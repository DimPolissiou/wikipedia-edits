Sister stations [[WRBL|WRBL-TV]] (Channel 3) and WRBL-FM (102.9 FM) were named after the original station.\n\nThrough the 1940s and 1950s WRBL had a conventional format of CBS Radio network programming, \"pop\" and country music, personality, sports and local news. In 1947, the station was reassigned to 1470&nbsp;kHz, with 5&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"history\"/> It added a high powered (50KW) FM channel (transmitter on Pine Mountain linked by a pioneering STL system) in 1949 simulcasting its AM. The music was phased out with the rise of [[FM broadcasting|FM radio]]. The station became '''WRCG''' (Radio Columbus Georgia) on January 18, 1977<ref name=\"history\"/> when the TV and radio went their separate ways after the death of long time owner, Jim Woodruff, Jr.<ref>{{cite web |work=Alabama Broadcast Media Page |url=http://bellsouthpwp2.net/c/r/crackedlcd/almediapage/profiles/wrcg.html |title=Technical Profile}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2002, McClure Broadcasting, Inc., (Chuck McClure Jr., president) reached an agreement to sell this station to Archway Broadcasting Group (Al Vicente, president/CEO). This was part of a four-station deal, along with [[WRLD-FM]], [[WCGQ]], and [[WKCN]], for a reported combined sale price of $15 million.<ref>{{cite news |date=2003-01-20 |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA271324.html?q=WRLD |work=Broadcasting & Cable |title=Changing Hands - 1/20/2003}}</ref> At the time of the sale, WRCG carried a [[news radio|news]]/[[talk radio]] format.\n\nOn July 31, 2008, local investment group PMB Broadcasting LLC (headed up by Jim Martin) purchased this station along with Columbus-area sister stations WRLD-FM, WCGQ, and WKCN from Archway Broadcasting Group LLC for a reported sale price of $7.2 million.<ref>{{cite news |date=2008-08-18 |url=http://www.broadcastingcable.com/article/CA6588011.html?q=WRLD |work=Broadcasting & Cable |title=Deals - 8/18/2008}}</ref> The deal was approved by the FCC on October 1, 2008.<ref name=\"fccj\">{{cite web |work=FCC Media Bureau |title=Application Search Details (BAL-20080806AAP) |url=http://fjallfoss.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/ws.exe/prod/cdbs/pubacc/prod/app_det.pl?Application_id=1268929 |date=2008-10-01}}</ref>\n\n[[Image:WRCG1420-70.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Former Boomer 106.9 logo]]\nIn April 2010, WRCG flipped formats from News/Talk to Oldies.

Later in 2010, formats were flipped again to classic rock. This was followed by numerous subsequent format changes: to active rock branded as \"106.9 Really Rocks\" on April 4, 2011, to news/talk on January 1, 2012, to southern gospel on November 1, 2014, and to urban adult contemporary, branded as \"R&B 92.1\" (simulcasting on translator W221DP 92.1 FM Columbus), on November 1, 2016.<ref>[https://radioinsight.com/blog/headlines/108952/rb-92-1-debuts-in-columbus-ga/ R&B 92.1 Debuts in Columbus, GA] Radioinsight - November 1, 2016</ref>\n\n==Previous logo==\n[[File:1069columbusga.JPG|200px]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://rnb921.com/ WRCG official website]\n{{AM station data|WRCG}}\n*[https://licensing.fcc.gov/cgi-bin/prod/cdbs/forms/prod/getimportletter_exh.cgi?import_letter_id=66415 FCC History Cards for WRCG] (covering 1928-1980 as WRBL / WRCG)\n*{{FMQ|W221DP}}\n*{{FXL|W221DP}}\n\n{{Columbus GA Radio}}\n{{Urban Radio Stations in Georgia}}\n\n[[Category:Radio stations in Columbus, Georgia|RCG]]\n[[Category:Radio stations established in 1928]]\n[[Category:1923 establishments in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n", "name_user": "Thomas H.

When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros.

by [[Hanna-Barbera]] which aired on [[NBC]] from September 8, 1979 to December 1, 1979.<ref name=Woolery>{{cite book |last1=Woolery |first1=George W. |title=Children's Television: The First

|page=108}}</ref>\n\nThe series contained the following two segments:\n\n*''[[The New Fred and Barney Show]]'' (a revival of ''The Flintstones'') \u2013 one episode, 30 minutes\n*''The Thing'' (based on the [[Marvel Comics]] superhero [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]) \u2013 two episodes, 11 minutes each\n \nDespite the show's title, the two segments remained separate and did not crossover with one another. The characters of [[Fred Flintstone]], [[Barney Rubble]] and the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] were only featured together during the opening title sequence and in brief bumpers between segments.<ref name=Daytime>{{cite book |last1=Hyatt |first1=Wesley |title=The Encyclopedia of Daytime Television |date=1997 |publisher=Watson-Guptill Publications |isbn=978-0823083152 |url=https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofda00hyat/page/160/mode/2up|accessdate=19 March 2020|page=160}}</ref> The unusual combination of a Marvel superhero and ''The Flintstones'' was possible because, at this time, [[Marvel Comics]] owned the rights to several Hanna-Barbera franchises and were, in fact, publishing comic books based upon them; ''The Flintstones'' was one of these.\n\nFor the 1979\u201380 season, the series was expanded to a 90-minute timeslot with the addition of ''[[The New Shmoo]]'' episodes and broadcast under the new title '''''[[Fred and Barney Meet the Shmoo]]'''''.\n\nLike many animated series created by Hanna-Barbera in the 1970s, the show contained a [[Laugh track#Making their own|laugh track]], one of their last productions to do so.\n\n==The Thing==\nThe first segment, a very loose adaptation of [[Marvel Comics]]' character the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], consisted of stories following the adventures of a scrawny, red-headed teenager named Benjy Grimm (voiced by Wayne Morton)<ref name=Perlmutter>{{cite book |last1=Perlmutter |first1=David |title=The Encyclopedia of American Animated Television Shows |date=2018 |publisher=Rowman & Littlefield |isbn=978-1538103739 |page=210}}</ref> who changes into the monstrous and mighty Thing (voiced by Joe Baker) by touching together magic rings and reciting the words \"Thing ring, do your thing!\", releasing an explosion of energy that causes orange rocks to hurl in from every direction and transform him into the stone-skinned superhero. When the Thing spoke, his good-naturedly gruff [[Brooklyn]]-accented voice was based on that of comedian [[Jimmy Durante]].\n\nThe stories centered mostly around Benjy at Centerville High School with his friends, the beautiful brunette Betty Harkness (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]), her snooty rich boyfriend Ronald Radford (voiced by [[John Erwin]]), and Betty's blond [[tomboy]] younger sister Kelly (voiced by Noelle North), with minimal adult supervision provided by teacher Miss Twilly (voiced by [[Marilyn Schreffler]]). Only Kelly and her scientist father Dr. Harkness (voiced by [[John Stephenson (actor)|John Stephenson]]) know Benjy's secret identity.\n\nWhen not battling various [[mad scientist]]s and getting involved in [[Scooby-Doo]]-style mysteries, the Thing spent most of his time using his superhuman strength to protect his pals from everyday dangers and the nasty [[practical joke]]s of leather-clad bully Spike (voiced by [[Art Metrano]]) and his biker buddies Stretch and Turkey in the [[Yancy Street Gang]].\n \nOther members of the [[Fantastic Four]] did not appear in the show, and the portrayal of the Thing and his origin story differed greatly from the original comics.<ref>{{cite news|title= Fantastic Four on TV|newspaper= [[IGN]]|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=|url= http://uk.tv.ign.com/articles/797/797130p2.html|accessdate=September 9, 2010}}</ref>\n\nTwenty-six 11-minute episodes of ''The Thing'' were produced; two shorts aired per show.\n\n''The Thing'' segments are owned by [[WarnerMedia]], through [[Hanna-Barbera]], [[Warner Bros. Animation]] and [[Warner Bros. Family Entertainment]], but the character is owned by [[The Walt Disney Company]] due to their purchase of Marvel Comics in late 2009.\n\n===Other appearances===\nIn ''[[Future Foundation|FF]]'' #8, [[Ant-Man]] and [[Dragon Man]] give pink-haired rock star turned reluctant superhero Darla Deering her own Thing Rings to summon Ben Grimm's old rocky Thing-bodied [[powered exoskeleton|exoskeleton]]

She died when she was newly crowned as Binibining Gay Pilipinas. Everyday in her wake, Trisha undergoes makeup transformations into different female celebrities, which she owes to the makeup skills of Barbs. The best friends enjoyed doing makeup transformations together when Trisha was still alive.\n\n[[Iza Calzado]], who crowned Trisha in Binibining Gay Pilipinas, visits the wake at the time when Trisha's makeup transformation is Iza's face. During Trisha's transformation as [[Miley Cyrus]], the funeral parlor owner Flora ([[Lou Veloso]]) takes a selfie with her and uploads it online. The photo goes viral, making Trisha's wake an attraction even for people who did not know her, much to Barbs' disapproval. Couturier [[Eugene Domingo]] also visits the wake and brings a white gown for Trisha to wear during her transformation as [[Julia Roberts]] from the [[Runaway Bride (film)|Runaway Bride]].\n\nFlashbacks of Trisha's life were shown. Teenage Trisha, who was still Patrick then, study in the same school with Barbs. Patrick has a crush on basketball player Migs ([[Albie Casi\u00f1o]]) and goes out with him one night after Barbs' encouraging. He gets gang-raped by a drunk Migs and his friends, causing an anal bleeding. Patrick's father, with his sister Beth ([[Gladys Reyes]]), visits him in the hospital and finds out about what happened, slapping him.\n\nThe relationship of Patrick and his father is further strained as Patrick secretly joins gay beauty contests. Eventually, his dad disowns him. As he exits their house, Patrick announces his new identity: Trisha Echeverria.\n\nBarbs and his mother let Trisha stay with them. Trisha adopts an orphaned child named Adora and renames her as Shirley Mae. Not having jobs, Trisha and Barbs continue to join pageants. Trisha usually loses because of failing the question and answer portion. She then gets breast implants, thinking that it will help her win pageants.\n\nTrisha dates a young gay club dancer named Miko. She even pays for Miko's rhinoplasty but their relationship is short-lived as she finds out that Miko is having an affair with a gay beauty parlor owner ([[Mel Martinez (actor)|Mel Martinez]]).\n\nTrisha meets Jesse ([[Luis Alandy]]) in a bar. Although Jesse is married, they start dating. On their sixth monthsary, Jesse fails to arrive. A month after, Jesse's wife Diana invites Trisha to a hospital where Jesse was confined due to [[leukemia]]. Jesse informs Trisha about his condition and confesses that their meeting was not accidental. Jesse was urged by his conscience as he was one of Migs' friends involved in the gang rape. Although he tells Trisha that he grew to love her, Trisha is distraught and leaves.\n\nTrisha joins Binibining Gay Pilipinas and picks a question she has encountered before. She delivers her memorized answer well \"''..if I'll die and be blessed to live again, I would choose to be nobody, nobody but me.''\" At the backstage, Trisha jokingly tells Barbs that if she wins the pageant, she will be ready to die. She further elaborates the details of her funeral: to have a makeover as different celebrities. Trisha finally wins but shortly dies of cerebral aneurysm.\n\nIn the morgue, Trisha's father and sister arrive. Her father orders to have Trisha's breast implants removed. Beth disagrees. Their father ends up having Trisha dressed in a [[Barong tagalog]]. Barbs, Paola, and Erica get disappointed at the sight of their friend and asks for Beth's help to sneak out Trisha's corpse and give her the burial she wished for.\n\nIn the last day of her wake, Barbs announces that the final makeover of Trisha is what she really is: the Trisha they knew who lived a glamorous life. The movie ends with Trisha's final walk message, showing a younger version of herself.\n\nOther celebrity transformations of Trisha during her wake are [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Beyonce]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paolo Ballesteros]] as Trisha Echevarria / Patrick<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acar|first1=Aedrianne|title=IN PHOTOS: Paolo Ballesteros as a transwoman in 'Die Beautiful'|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/gma/photos/2016-07-12/5313/62216/Paolo-Ballesteros|website=GMA Network Portal|publisher=[[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network]]|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Christian Bables]] as Barbs\n* [[Joel Torre]] as Papa\n* [[Gladys Reyes]] as Beth\n* [[Luis Alandy]] as Jesse\n* [[Albie Casi\u00f1o]] as Migs\n* Faye Alhambra as Shirley Mae\n*Inah de Belen as teen Shirley Mae\n* [[IC Mendoza]] as Paola\n* Cedrick Juan as Erika\n* [[Lou Veloso]] as Flora\n* Mimi Juareza as Mommy\n* [[Iza Calzado]] as herself\n* [[Eugene Domingo]] as herself\n* [[Mel Martinez (actor)|Mel Martinez]] as gay parlor owner\n* Jade Lopez as Diana\n* Kokoy De Santos as Michael Angelo\n\n==Production==\n''Die Beautiful'' is a film funded by Hong Kong \u2013 Asia Financing Forum and produced by [[Regal Entertainment]], The IdeaFirst Company, and Octobertrain Films.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/445093/showbiz/chikaminute/paolo-ballesteros-to-star-as-transgender-woman-in-indie-film|title=Paolo Ballesteros to star as transgender woman in indie film|date=2 March 2015|work=GMA News Online|publisher=[[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network, Inc.]]|agency=[[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]]|last1=Dabu|first1=Bianca Rose|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Jun Lana|Jun Robles Lana]] and produced by [[Lily Monteverde]], Roselle Monteverde and Perci Intalan.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=LOOK: Paolo Ballesteros bares \u2018boobs\u2019 for upcoming film|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/197008/look-paolo-ballesteros-unmasks-boobs-for-upcoming-film|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=inquirer.net|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gabinete|first1=Jojo|title=Paolo Ballesteros bares prosthetic boobs for Die Beautiful|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/23990/paolo-ballesteros-bares-prosthetic-boobs-for-emdie-beautifulem|website=pep.ph|publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]|accessdate=23 August 2016|ref=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Die Beautiful'' was selected in the Main Competition of the Tokyo International Film Festival, which ran from October 25, 2016 to November 3, 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/147487-paolo-ballesteros-film-die-beautiful-compete-tokyo-film-festival|title=PH film 'Die Beautiful' to compete in Tokyo Film Festival|newspaper=Rappler|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/jun-lanas-die-beautiful-premieres-at-tokyo-international-film-festival/|title=Jun Lana\u2019s \u2018Die Beautiful\u2019 premieres at Tokyo International Film Festival|last=Sallan|first=Edwin P.|newspaper=InterAksyon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115170110/http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/jun-lanas-die-beautiful-premieres-at-tokyo-international-film-festival/|archive-date=2017-01-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film is an official entry to the [[2016 Metro Manila Film Festival]], and was screened at the 2017 Luang Prabang Film Festival.\n\n== Reception ==\nAt the awarding ceremony at the Tokyo International Film Festival which was held on November 3, 2016 at the [[Toho Cinemas]] in [[Roppongi Hills]] in [[Japan]], Paolo Ballesteros was named the festival's Best Actor.

She died when she was newly crowned as Binibining Gay Pilipinas. Everyday in her wake, Trisha undergoes makeup transformations into different female celebrities, which she owes to the makeup skills of Barbs. The best friends enjoyed doing makeup transformations together when Trisha was still alive.\n\n[[Iza Calzado]], who crowned Trisha in Binibining Gay Pilipinas, visits the wake at the time when Trisha's makeup transformation is Iza's face. In Trisha's transformation as [[Miley Cyrus]], the funeral parlor owner Flora ([[Lou Veloso]]) takes a selfie with her and uploads it online. The photo goes viral, making Trisha's wake an attraction even for people who did not know her, much to Barbs' disapproval. Couturier [[Eugene Domingo]] also visits the wake and brings a white gown for Trisha to wear during her transformation as [[Julia Roberts]] from the [[Runaway Bride (film)|Runaway Bride]].\n\nFlashbacks of Trisha's life were shown. Teenage Trisha, who was still Patrick then, study in the same school with Barbs. Patrick has a crush on basketball player Migs ([[Albie Casi\u00f1o]]) and goes out with him one night after Barbs' encouraging. He gets gang-raped by a drunk Migs and his friends, causing an anal bleeding. Patrick's father, with his sister Beth ([[Gladys Reyes]]), visits him in the hospital and finds out about what happened, slapping him.\n\nThe relationship of Patrick and his father is further strained as Patrick secretly joins gay beauty contests. Eventually, his dad disowns him. As he exits their house, Patrick announces his new identity: Trisha Echeverria.\n\nBarbs and his mother let Trisha stay with them. Trisha adopts an orphaned child named Adora and renames her as Shirley Mae. Not having jobs, Trisha and Barbs continue to join pageants. Trisha usually loses because of failing the question and answer portion. Trisha then gets breast implants, thinking that it will help her win pageants.\n\nTrisha dates a young gay club dancer named Miko. Trisha even pays for Miko's rhinoplasty but their relationship is short-lived as she finds out that Miko is having an affair with a gay beauty parlor owner ([[Mel Martinez (actor)|Mel Martinez]]).\n\nTrisha meets Jesse ([[Luis Alandy]]) in a bar. Although Jesse is married, they start dating. On their sixth monthsary, Jesse fails to arrive. A month after, Jesse's wife Diana invites Trisha to a hospital where Jesse was confined due to [[leukemia]]. Jesse informs Trisha about his condition and confesses that their meeting was not accidental. Jesse was urged by his conscience as he was one of Migs' friends who gang-raped her. Although he tells Trisha that he grew to love her, Trisha is distraught and leaves.\n\nTrisha joins Binibining Gay Pilipinas and she picks a question he has encountered before. He delivers her memorized answer well \"''..if I'll die and be blessed to live again, I would choose to be nobody, nobody but me.''\" At the backstage, Trisha jokingly tells Barbs that if she wins the pageant, she will be ready to die. She further elaborates the details of her funeral: to have a makeover as different celebrities. Trisha finally wins but later dies of cerebral aneurysm.\n\nIn the morgue, Trisha's father and sister arrive. Her father orders to have Trisha's breast implants removed. Beth disagrees. Their father ends up dressing Trisha in a Barong Tagalog. Barbs, Paola, and Erica get disappointed at the sight of their friend and asks for Beth's help to sneak out Trisha's corpse and give her the burial she wished for.\n\nIn the last day of her wake, Barbs announces that the final makeover of Trisha is what she really is: the Trisha they knew who lived a glamorous life. The movie ends with Trisha's final walk message, showing a younger version of herself,\n\nOther celebrity transformations of Trisha during her wake are [[Angelina Jolie]], [[Lady Gaga]], and [[Beyonce]].\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Paolo Ballesteros]] as Trisha Echevarria / Patrick<ref>{{cite web|last1=Acar|first1=Aedrianne|title=IN PHOTOS: Paolo Ballesteros as a transwoman in 'Die Beautiful'|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/entertainment/gma/photos/2016-07-12/5313/62216/Paolo-Ballesteros|website=GMA Network Portal|publisher=[[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network]]|accessdate=23 August 2016|date=12 July 2016}}</ref>\n* [[Christian Bables]] as Barbs\n* [[Joel Torre]] as Papa\n* [[Gladys Reyes]] as Beth\n* [[Luis Alandy]] as Jesse\n* [[Albie Casi\u00f1o]] as Migs\n* Faye Alhambra as Shirley Mae\n*Inah de Belen as teen Shirley Mae\n* [[IC Mendoza]] as Paola\n* Cedrick Juan as Erika\n* [[Lou Veloso]] as Flora\n* Mimi Juareza as Mommy\n* [[Iza Calzado]] as herself\n* [[Eugene Domingo]] as herself\n* [[Mel Martinez (actor)|Mel Martinez]] as gay parlor owner\n* Jade Lopez as Diana\n* Kokoy De Santos as Michael Angelo\n\n==Production==\n''Die Beautiful'' is a film funded by Hong Kong \u2013 Asia Financing Forum and produced by [[Regal Entertainment]], The IdeaFirst Company, and Octobertrain Films.<ref name=\"ref2\">{{cite news|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/445093/showbiz/chikaminute/paolo-ballesteros-to-star-as-transgender-woman-in-indie-film|title=Paolo Ballesteros to star as transgender woman in indie film|date=2 March 2015|work=GMA News Online|publisher=[[GMA Network (company)|GMA Network, Inc.]]|agency=[[GMA News and Public Affairs|GMA News]]|last1=Dabu|first1=Bianca Rose|accessdate=23 August 2016}}</ref> The film was directed by [[Jun Lana|Jun Robles Lana]] and produced by [[Lily Monteverde]], Roselle Monteverde and Perci Intalan.<ref name=\"ref1\" /><ref>{{cite news|title=LOOK: Paolo Ballesteros bares \u2018boobs\u2019 for upcoming film|url=http://entertainment.inquirer.net/197008/look-paolo-ballesteros-unmasks-boobs-for-upcoming-film|accessdate=23 August 2016|work=inquirer.net|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|date=5 July 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Gabinete|first1=Jojo|title=Paolo Ballesteros bares prosthetic boobs for Die Beautiful|url=http://www.pep.ph/guide/movies/23990/paolo-ballesteros-bares-prosthetic-boobs-for-emdie-beautifulem|website=pep.ph|publisher=[[Philippine Entertainment Portal]]|accessdate=23 August 2016|ref=5 July 2016}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''Die Beautiful'' was selected in the Main Competition of the Tokyo International Film Festival, which ran from October 25, 2016 to November 3, 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.rappler.com/entertainment/news/147487-paolo-ballesteros-film-die-beautiful-compete-tokyo-film-festival|title=PH film 'Die Beautiful' to compete in Tokyo Film Festival|newspaper=Rappler|access-date=2016-10-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/jun-lanas-die-beautiful-premieres-at-tokyo-international-film-festival/|title=Jun Lana\u2019s \u2018Die Beautiful\u2019 premieres at Tokyo International Film Festival|last=Sallan|first=Edwin P.|newspaper=InterAksyon.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170115170110/http://www.interaksyon.com/entertainment/jun-lanas-die-beautiful-premieres-at-tokyo-international-film-festival/|archive-date=2017-01-15|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe film is an official entry to the [[2016 Metro Manila Film Festival]], and was screened at the 2017 Luang Prabang Film Festival.\n\n== Reception ==\nAt the awarding ceremony at the Tokyo International Film Festival which was held on November 3, 2016 at the [[Toho Cinemas]] in [[Roppongi Hills]] in [[Japan]], Paolo Ballesteros was named the festival's Best Actor.

Born in [[South Shields]] he began his career with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] before spending time at [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (twice), [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (twice),  [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]]. After he retired from playing he spent time on the coaching staff of a number of clubs, including brief spells as manager of [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]] and [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]], and is currently youth team coach at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and assistant manager to [[Noel Blake]]'s [[England national under-19 football team]].\n\n==Playing career==\nDavison started his career at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] making only two appearances between 1980 and 1981. He moved on to [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] on 1 August 1981 and holds a good record 29 goals in 63 appearances. This caught the eye of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and between 1982 and 1987 he made 206 appearances scoring 83 goals, contributing towards their promotion to the Second Division in 1986 and the First Division a year later. He played a total of 206 league games for the Rams, scoring 83 goals and became a Derby legend.<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=39385]</ref>\n\nMuch to Derby fans' disappointment he was sold for \u00a3350,000 to a rebuilding [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] squad, managed by [[Billy Bremner]], in November 1987.\n\n[[Howard Wilkinson]] succeeded Bremner as Leeds managed in September 1988 and in the subsequent push for promotion Bobby became a cult hero for Leeds due to a high work rate and general rapport with the crowd. His scoring record of 35 times in 110 games is a good one for Leeds at that time.

Born in [[South Shields]] he began his career with [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] before spending time at [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (twice), [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]], [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] (twice),  [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]], [[Rotherham United F.C.|Rotherham United]] and [[Hull City A.F.C.|Hull City]].  After he retired from playing he spent time on the coaching staff of a number of clubs, including brief spells as manager of [[Guiseley A.F.C.|Guiseley]] and [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]], and is currently youth team coach at [[Crystal Palace F.C.|Crystal Palace]] and assistant manager to [[Noel Blake]]'s [[England national under-19 football team]].\n\n==Playing career==\nDavison started his career at [[Huddersfield Town A.F.C.|Huddersfield Town]] making only two appearances between 1980 and 1981. He moved on to [[Halifax Town A.F.C.|Halifax Town]] on 1 August 1981 and holds a good record 29 goals in 63 appearances. This caught the eye of [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] and between 1982 and 1987 he made 206 appearances scoring 83 goals, contributing towards their promotion to the Second Division in 1986 and the First Division a year later. He played a total of 206 league games for the Rams, scoring 83 goals and became a Derby legend.<ref>[http://www.sporting-heroes.net/football-heroes/displayhero_club.asp?HeroID=39385]</ref>\n\nMuch to Derby fans' disappointment he was sold for \u00a3350,000 to a rebuilding [[Leeds United F.C.|Leeds United]] squad, managed by [[Billy Bremner]], in November 1987.\n\n[[Howard Wilkinson]] succeeded Bremner as Leeds managed in September 1988 and in the subsequent push for promotion Bobby became a cult hero for Leeds due to a high work rate and general rapport with the crowd. His scoring record of 35 times in 110 games is a good one for Leeds at that time. He helped them seal a return to the top flight as they sealed the Second Division title on the last day of the [[1989-90 in English football|1989\u201390 season]] by beating [[AFC Bournemouth]] 1\u20130 at [[Dean Court]].\n\nHowever, Davison lost his first team place for the [[1990-91 in English football|1990\u201391 season]] following the arrival of [[Lee Chapman]], who was established as a top goalscorer.
