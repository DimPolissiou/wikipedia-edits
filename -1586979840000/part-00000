These main streets (aside from Vaughan Road) generally demarcate borders with other York and old City of Toronto neighbourhoods or borders of the sub-neighbourhoods and neighbourhoods (Five Points, Northcliffe Village) previously mentioned.

As of 2020, Tilden is the only individual to [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|win an outright majority of the popular vote]] in a [[United States presidential election]] but lose the election.{{efn|As of 2020, four candidates have lost a presidential election despite garnering a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote; [[Andrew Jackson]] in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; [[Grover Cleveland]] in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]]; [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]; and [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].}} \n\nTilden was born into a wealthy family in [[New Lebanon, New York]]. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]]. After studying at [[Yale University]] and [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden began a legal career in [[New York City]], becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and helped launch Van Buren's [[third party (United States)|third party]], anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]]. Though he opposed the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Tilden supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the Civil War, Tilden was selected as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]], and he managed Democratic nominee [[Horatio Seymour]]'s campaign in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. \n\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's [[Tammany Hall]] faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss [[William M. Tweed]]'s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1874, and in that office he helped break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]].\" Tilden's battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in the country's most populous state, made him the leading candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the nominee on the second ballot of the [[1876 Democratic National Convention]]. In the general election, Tilden faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], another governor with reform credentials. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the [[gold standard]], and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the South.\n\nMost observers initially believed that Tilden had won the election, but disputes in four states left both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Electoral Commission, and in a series of party-line rulings, ruled that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the [[Compromise of 1877]], Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden was a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential elections]], but declined to run.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Image:SamuelJTilden.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Tilden as a young man]]\n\nTilden was born in [[New Lebanon, New York]], the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden.<ref>Bigelow (2009), pp. 12\u201315</ref> He was descended from [[Tylden (family)|Nathaniel Tilden]], an early [[English people|English]] settler who came to [[North America]] in 1634. His father and other family members were the makers of [[Tilden's Extract]], a popular [[patent medicine]] of the 1800s and early 1900s derived from [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]].<ref>William Lee Richter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cyGb-eMnmXkC&pg=PA610 ''Historical Dictionary of the Civil War and Reconstruction''], 2004, page 610</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=psbmAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA117 Obituary, Samuel J. Tilden (nephew of New York Governor)], ''The Pharmaceutical Era'', March 1914, page 117</ref> Tilden's father maintained relationships with many influential politicians, including President [[Martin Van Buren]], who became Tilden's political idol. Tilden was frequently in poor health during his youth, and he spent much of his time studying politics and reading works such as ''[[The Wealth of Nations]]''. Tilden's health troubles prevented him from regularly attending school, and he dropped out of [[Yale University]] after a single term.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nLikely motivated by a family friendship with [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]], then serving as a professor at [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden enrolled there to resume his studies, and he continued to attend intermittently from 1838 to 1841.<ref>{{cite book|title=The life and public services of Hon.

Bouck]], Tilden was appointed as New York City's corporation counsel. Tilden handled hundreds of cases on behalf of the city, but was forced out of office in 1844 after New York City elected a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] mayor. He served as a delegate to the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], which rejected Van Buren and nominated [[James K. Polk]] for president. At the urging of Governor [[Silas Wright]], Tilden won election to the [[New York State Assembly]]. He became a key ally to Wright and helped end the [[Anti-Rent War]] by passing a compromise land bill that defused tensions between tenant farmers and their landlords. After serving as a delegate to the 1846 [[New York State Constitutional Convention]], Tilden left public office to focus on his legal practice, where he gained a national reputation as a \"financial physician\" for struggling railroads.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 89\u201393</ref> Tilden's successful legal practice, combined with shrewd investments, made him rich. His success at money management and investing caused many of his friends, relatives, and political allies, including Van Buren, to allow Tilden to manage their finances.<ref>Severn (1968), p. 64</ref>\n\nTilden helped to found the \"[[Barnburner]]s\", an anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] faction of the New York Democratic Party that arose in the midst of the debate over the [[Wilmot Proviso]]. Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the [[Mexican cession|land acquired from Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He helped organize the 1848 [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]] may have played a role in the victory of Whig nominee [[Zachary Taylor]] over Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]]. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> In [[New York state election, 1855|1855]], Tilden was the unsuccessful [[New York State Attorney General|state attorney general]] candidate of the \"[[Hunkers and Barnburners|Soft]]\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party.<ref>Robinson (2001), p. 85</ref> In [[New York state election, 1859|1859]], after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"<ref>Morris (2003), p. 95</ref>\n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 95\u201396</ref> Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Tilden served as the manager of [[Horatio Seymour]]'s successful 1862 campaign for governor, and played a key role in securing the nomination of [[George B. McClellan]] at the [[1864 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\nIn 1867, Tilden received the [[honorary degree]] of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite book |last=General Alumni Society, New York University |date=1906 |title=General Alumni Catalogue |url=https://archive.org/details/generalalumnica01univgoog |location=New York, NY |publisher=New York University |page=170}}</ref> He was also chosen as a delegate to that year's [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1867\u20131868|state constitutional convention]].<ref>{{cite news |date=June 4, 1867 |title=The Constitutional Convention to Assemble To-Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/329585675/ |work=[[New York Herald]] |location=New York, NY |url-access=subscription |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |page=7}}</ref>\n\n== State party leader ==\n[[File:SamuelTilden.png|thumb|right|upright|A portrait of Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nFollowing the end of the Civil War, Tilden won election as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]]. He served as Seymour's campaign chairman in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 97\u201398</ref> After the election, Tilden broke with [[William M. Tweed]], the leader of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]]. Through bribery, patronage, and control of [[Irish-American]] voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 99\u2013102</ref> In 1871, former Tammany associate [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] leaked Tweed's account books to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the [[New York state election, 1871|1871 state elections]], and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1874|1874]]. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]],\" a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the [[New York State Canal System]]. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of [[Grant administration scandals|scandals]] that had come into public view during the [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from [[Yale University]].<ref name=Yale_Catalogue>{{cite book |last=Yale University |date=1877 |title=Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UahGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA51 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Morehouse and Taylor |page=51}}</ref> At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref name=\"Yale_Catalogue\"/>\n\n==Presidential election of 1876==\n{{See also|Samuel Tilden presidential campaign, 1876}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\n[[Image:Tilden and Hendricks campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Campaign poster for the election of 1876]]\n\nBy the time of the June [[1876 Democratic National Convention]], Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106</ref> Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge was so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he'd predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes.<ref>Holt (2008), p. 100</ref> Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the 1876 presidential elections, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including [[Thomas F. Bayard]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], and General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nDuring the difficult economic times of the [[Panic of 1873]], the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of [[History of monetary policy in the United States|currency]]. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] and authorize the printing of more [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s, [[banknotes]] that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in [[inflation]] and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the [[gold standard]]) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 108\u2013109, 112\u2013114</ref> \n\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds majority on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 115\u2013117</ref> Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 80\u201383, 122</ref>\n\n===General election===\n[[File:1876 U.S. presidential election, contested states.png|thumb|upright=1.5|In the aftermath of the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], the electoral votes of four states were disputed.]]\n\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed [[Abram Hewitt]] to lead his campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 123, 131\u2013132</ref> The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), p. 121</ref> The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration.<ref name=\"morris118120\"/> Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and hard money policies.<ref>White (2017), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> Republicans, meanwhile, focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion.<ref name=\"morris118120\">Morris (2003), pp. 118\u2013120</ref> Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"[[Redeemers|unredeemed]]\" Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 125\u2013126, 146</ref> Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning [[African-American]] voters.<ref>White (2017), pp. 330\u2013331</ref> Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the [[Hamburg massacre]], in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key [[swing states]], but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 167\u2013171</ref> Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General [[George B. McClellan]] as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Post-election controversy===\n[[Image:SJTilden of NY.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6000 votes. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 174\u2013178</ref> On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 180\u2013182</ref> On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to \"systemic intimidation,\" leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Early on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 193\u2013197</ref> Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] violated the [[United States Constitution]]. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 183\u2013185, 197\u2013198</ref>\n\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 197\u2013198</ref> With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that [[Thomas W. Ferry]], a Republican senator from Michigan and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]], could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 203\u2013204</ref> He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 206\u2013207, 214</ref>\n\n===Electoral Commission===\n[[File:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] defeated Tilden in the 1876 election.]]\n\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a [[political independent]], but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican [[Joseph P. Bradley]], was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 216\u2013219</ref> In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 222\u2013235</ref>\n\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the election results.<ref>White (2017), p. 332</ref> Though some House Democrats hoped to do just that, they were unable to prevent the House of Representatives from blocking certification, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in accepting the results.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 235\u2013236</ref> During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The [[Compromise of 1877]], as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris, Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 232\u2013234</ref> Some other historians, including [[C.

Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.<ref>Guenther (1983), 284\u2013285</ref> Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by [[Western Union]]. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party's argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency.<ref>Kahn (1996), pp. 221\u2013229</ref> Tilden was not implicated in any wrongdoing, but the investigation into the Cipher Telegrams damaged his national standing.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n===Election of 1880===\n\nAfter the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 presidential election]].

As of 2020, Tilden is the only individual to [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|win an outright majority of the popular vote]] in a [[United States presidential election]] but lose the election.{{efn|As of 2020, four candidates have lost a presidential election despite garnering a [[plurality (voting)|plurality]] of the popular vote; [[Andrew Jackson]] in [[1824 United States presidential election|1824]]; [[Grover Cleveland]] in [[1888 United States presidential election|1888]]; [[Al Gore]] in [[2000 United States presidential election|2000]]; and [[Hillary Clinton]] in [[2016 United States presidential election|2016]].}} \n\nTilden was born into a wealthy family in [[New Lebanon, New York]]. Attracted to politics at a young age, he became a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of [[Martin Van Buren]], the eighth [[President of the United States]]. After studying at [[Yale University]] and [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden began a legal career in [[New York City]], becoming a noted corporate lawyer. He served in the [[New York State Assembly]] and helped launch Van Buren's [[third party (United States)|third party]], anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]]. Though he opposed the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860, Tilden supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] during the [[American Civil War]]. After the Civil War, Tilden was selected as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]], and he managed Democratic nominee [[Horatio Seymour]]'s campaign in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]]. \n\nTilden initially cooperated with the state party's [[Tammany Hall]] faction, but he broke with them in 1871 due to boss [[William M. Tweed]]'s rampant corruption. Tilden won election as [[Governor of New York]] in 1874, and in that office he helped break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]].\" Tilden's battle against public corruption, along with his personal fortune and electoral success in the country's most populous state, made him a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president in 1876. Tilden was selected as the Democratic Party's nominee on the second ballot of the [[1876 Democratic National Convention]]. In the general election, Tilden faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] candidate [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], another governor with reform credentials. Tilden focused his campaign on civil service reform, support for the [[gold standard]], and opposition to high taxes, but many of his supporters were more concerned with ending [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] in the South.\n\nMost observers initially believed that Tilden had won the election, but disputes in four states left both Tilden and Hayes without a majority of the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]. As Tilden had won 184 electoral votes, one vote shy of a majority, a Hayes victory required that he sweep all of the disputed electoral votes. Against Tilden's wishes, Congress appointed the bipartisan [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the controversy. Republicans had a one-seat advantage on the Electoral Commission, and in a series of party-line rulings, ruled that Hayes had won all of the disputed electoral votes. In the [[Compromise of 1877]], Democratic leaders agreed to accept Hayes as the victor in return for the end of Reconstruction. Tilden was a major contender for the Democratic presidential nomination in the [[1880 United States presidential election|1880]] and [[1884 United States presidential election|1884 presidential elections]], but declined to run.\n\n== Early life ==\n[[Image:SamuelJTilden.jpeg|thumb|Samuel Tilden as a young man]]\n\nTilden was born in [[New Lebanon, New York]], the youngest son of Elam Tilden and Polly Jones Tilden.<ref>Bigelow (2009), pp. 12\u201315</ref> He was descended from [[Tylden (family)|Nathaniel Tilden]], an early [[English people|English]] settler who came to [[North America]] in 1634.

Tilden's health troubles prevented him from regularly attending school, and he dropped out of [[Yale University]] after a single term.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 84\u201386</ref>\n\nLikely motivated by a family friendship with [[Benjamin Franklin Butler (lawyer)|Benjamin Franklin Butler]], then serving as a professor at [[New York University School of Law]], Tilden enrolled there to resume his studies, and he continued to attend intermittently from 1838 to 1841.<ref>{{cite book|title=The life and public services of Hon.

Bouck]], Tilden was appointed as New York City's corporation counsel. Tilden handled hundreds of cases on behalf of the city, but was forced out of office in 1844 after New York City elected a [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig]] mayor. He served as a delegate to the [[1844 Democratic National Convention]], which rejected Van Buren and nominated [[James K. Polk]] for president. At the urging of Governor [[Silas Wright]], Tilden won election to the [[New York State Assembly]]. He became a key ally to Wright and helped end the [[Anti-Rent War]] by passing a compromise land bill that defused tensions between tenant farmers and their landlords. After serving as a delegate to the 1846 [[New York State Constitutional Convention]], Tilden left public office to focus on his legal practice, where he gained a national reputation as a \"financial physician\" for struggling railroads.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 89\u201393</ref> Tilden's successful legal practice, combined with shrewd investments, made him rich. His success at money management and investing caused many of his friends, relatives, and political allies, including Van Buren, to allow Tilden to manage their finances.<ref>Severn (1968), p. 64</ref>\n\nTilden helped to found the \"[[Barnburner]]s\", an anti-[[slavery in the United States|slavery]] faction of the New York Democratic Party that arose in the midst of the debate over the [[Wilmot Proviso]]. Like other Barnburners, Tilden sought to prevent the spread of slavery into the [[Mexican cession|land acquired from Mexico]] in the [[Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo]]. He helped organize the 1848 [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] Convention, which nominated Van Buren for president. Van Buren's candidacy in the [[1848 United States presidential election|1848 presidential election]] may have played a role in the victory of Whig nominee [[Zachary Taylor]] over Democratic nominee [[Lewis Cass]]. Unlike many other anti-slavery Democrats, Tilden did not join the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] in the 1850s, but he did not have close relations with Democratic presidents [[Franklin Pierce]] and [[James Buchanan]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 94\u201395</ref> In [[New York state election, 1855|1855]], Tilden was the unsuccessful [[New York State Attorney General|state attorney general]] candidate of the \"[[Hunkers and Barnburners|Soft]]\" faction of Barnburners, which favored compromise and reconciliation with the Democratic Party.<ref>Robinson (2001), p. 85</ref> In [[New York state election, 1859|1859]], after he lost an election to serve as New York City's corporation counsel, Tilden announced that he was \"out of politics.\"<ref>Morris (2003), p. 95</ref>\n\nIn the [[1860 United States presidential election|1860 presidential election]], Tilden strongly opposed the candidacy of Republican presidential nominee [[Abraham Lincoln]]. He warned that the election of Lincoln could lead to the secession of the South and a subsequent civil war.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 95\u201396</ref> Tilden initially opposed using force to prevent secession, but he supported the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] after the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]]. Tilden served as the manager of [[Horatio Seymour]]'s successful 1862 campaign for governor, and played a key role in securing the nomination of [[George B. McClellan]] at the [[1864 Democratic National Convention]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 96\u201397</ref>\n\nIn 1867, Tilden received the [[honorary degree]] of [[Legum Doctor|LL.D.]] from [[New York University]].<ref>{{cite book |last=General Alumni Society, New York University |date=1906 |title=General Alumni Catalogue |url=https://archive.org/details/generalalumnica01univgoog |location=New York, NY |publisher=New York University |page=170}}</ref> He was also chosen as a delegate to that year's [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1867\u20131868|state constitutional convention]].<ref>{{cite news |date=June 4, 1867 |title=The Constitutional Convention to Assemble To-Day |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/329585675/ |work=[[New York Herald]] |location=New York, NY |url-access=subscription |via=[[Newspapers.com]] |page=7}}</ref>\n\n== State party leader ==\n[[File:SamuelTilden.png|thumb|right|upright|A portrait of Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nFollowing the end of the Civil War, Tilden won election as the chairman of the [[New York State Democratic Committee]]. He served as Seymour's campaign chairman in the [[1868 United States presidential election|1868 presidential election]], but Seymour lost the election to Republican nominee [[Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 97\u201398</ref> After the election, Tilden broke with [[William M. Tweed]], the leader of the [[Tammany Hall]] [[political machine]]. Through bribery, patronage, and control of [[Irish-American]] voters, Tweed and his allies had become the dominant power in both New York City and the state of New York.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 99\u2013102</ref> In 1871, former Tammany associate [[James O'Brien (U.S. Congressman)|James O'Brien]] leaked Tweed's account books to the ''[[New York Times]]''. The ''Times'' subsequently began a public crusade against Tammany Hall, and Tilden launched an investigation into Tweed's bank records. Tilden ran for the New York State Assembly as part of a slate of anti-Tammany Democrats; at the state party convention, he declared that it was \"time to proclaim that whoever plunders the people, though he steal the livery of heaven to serve the devil in, is no Democrat.\" The anti-Tammany Democrats, including Tilden, won a major victory in the [[New York state election, 1871|1871 state elections]], and Tweed was indicted on 120 counts of fraud and other violations. After the election, Tweed fled the state, but he was eventually extradited back to New York, where he died in prison in 1878.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 103\u2013104</ref>\n\nTilden's role in taking down Tweed bolstered his popularity, and he was elected Governor of New York in [[New York state election, 1874|1874]]. As governor, he continued to focus on rooting out corruption. He helped to break up the \"[[Canal Ring (New York)|Canal Ring]],\" a bipartisan group of state and local officials who had enriched themselves by overcharging for the maintenance of the [[New York State Canal System]]. Tilden gained a national reputation as a reform governor, a valuable asset given the number of [[Grant administration scandals|scandals]] that had come into public view during the [[presidency of Ulysses S. Grant]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 104\u2013105</ref>\n\nIn 1875, Tilden received an honorary LL.D. from [[Yale University]].<ref name=Yale_Catalogue>{{cite book |last=Yale University |date=1877 |title=Catalogue of the Officers and Graduates of Yale University |url=https://books.google.de/books?id=UahGAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA51 |location=New Haven, CT |publisher=Morehouse and Taylor |page=51}}</ref> At the same time, Yale also enrolled him as a graduate of the Class of 1837 and he received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree.<ref name=\"Yale_Catalogue\"/>\n\n==Presidential election of 1876==\n{{See also|Samuel Tilden presidential campaign, 1876}}\n\n===Democratic nomination===\n[[Image:Tilden and Hendricks campaign poster.jpg|thumb|Campaign poster for the election of 1876]]\n\nBy the time of the June [[1876 Democratic National Convention]], Tilden had emerged as the front-runner for the Democratic nomination in the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106</ref> Tilden's appeal to the national party was based on his reputation for reform and his electoral success in the country's most populous state. He was also a skilled organizer whose canvassing system and field knowledge was so thorough that, months before the 1874 election, he'd predicted his own winning margin accurately to within 300 votes.<ref>Holt (2008), p. 100</ref> Tilden further bolstered his presidential candidacy through a nationwide newspaper advertising campaign. As many Democrats expected that their party would win the 1876 presidential elections, Tilden faced competition from some of the party's most prominent leaders, including [[Thomas F. Bayard]], [[Allen G. Thurman]], [[Thomas A. Hendricks]], and General [[Winfield Scott Hancock]].<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nDuring the difficult economic times of the [[Panic of 1873]], the major ideological divide in the Democratic Party concerned the issue of [[History of monetary policy in the United States|currency]]. Many \"soft money\" Democrats wanted Congress to repeal the [[Specie Payment Resumption Act]] and authorize the printing of more [[greenback (money)|greenback]]s, [[banknotes]] that had first been printed during the Civil War. The printing of more greenbacks would result in [[inflation]] and potentially benefit farmers by raising prices and helping them pay down their debts. Like most Republicans and \"hard money\" members of the conservative business establishment, Tilden believed that the termination of greenback circulation (which would return the country to the [[gold standard]]) was the best way to solve the ongoing economic crisis. Tilden's lieutenants at the Democratic National Convention emphasized Tilden's reform credentials above all else, but they also ensured that the party platform endorsed Tilden's hard money views.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 108\u2013109, 112\u2013114</ref> \n\nTilden won a majority of the votes cast on the first presidential ballot of the convention, but fell short of the two-thirds majority required to win the Democratic presidential nomination. His closest rival was Hendricks, who had the support of New York party boss [[John Kelly (New York politician)|John Kelly]] and the soft money faction of Democrats. Tilden won the necessary two-thirds majority on the second presidential ballot, and the convention then voted to make his nomination unanimous. Delegates unanimously chose Hendricks as Tilden's running mate, providing a balance between the hard money and soft money factions.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 115\u2013117</ref> Though the Republicans had nominated a ticket led by [[Rutherford B. Hayes]] of Ohio, another governor who had established a reputation for honest governance, Tilden was widely regarded as the favorite in the general election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 80\u201383, 122</ref>\n\n===General election===\n[[File:1876 U.S. presidential election, contested states.png|thumb|upright=1.5|In the aftermath of the [[1876 United States presidential election|1876 presidential election]], the electoral votes of four states were disputed.]]\n\nPer tradition, both Tilden and Hayes avoided publicly campaigning for president, leaving that task to their supporters; Tilden appointed [[Abram Hewitt]] to lead his campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 123, 131\u2013132</ref> The Republican campaign established a major cash advantage, partly because Tilden refused to contribute much of his personal fortune to the campaign.<ref>Morris (2003), p. 121</ref> The Democrats campaigned on the theme of \"retrenchment and reform\" and attacked the \"corrupt centralism\" of the Grant administration.<ref name=\"morris118120\"/> Tilden blamed high taxes and the Grant administration for the economic downturn, and, like Hayes, promised [[U.S. Civil Service Reform|civil service reform]] and hard money policies.<ref>White (2017), pp. 328\u2013330</ref> Republicans, meanwhile, focused on their party's identification with Lincoln and the Union cause in the Civil War; many Republicans still associated the Democratic Party with slavery and disunion.<ref name=\"morris118120\">Morris (2003), pp. 118\u2013120</ref> Rebutting Republican charges, Tilden categorically denied that he had any intention of compensating the South for any slaves emancipated or losses suffered during the Civil War.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 161\u2013162</ref> For their part, many Democrats cared little for Tilden's emphasis on reform, and were instead focused on ending sixteen years of Republican leadership. Southern Democrats especially hoped to end [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and gain control of South Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, the last three \"[[Redeemers|unredeemed]]\" Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 125\u2013126, 146</ref> Southern whites, who overwhelmingly favored Tilden, used violence and intimidation to suppress the turnout of Republican-leaning [[African-American]] voters.<ref>White (2017), pp. 330\u2013331</ref> Tilden worked to distance himself from violent encounters like the [[Hamburg massacre]], in which disgruntled Southern whites clashed with the Republican-led government of South Carolina.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 129\u2013131</ref>\n\nBoth campaigns considered New York, Ohio, and Indiana to be the key [[swing states]], but the campaigns also focused on several smaller states, including the three unredeemed Southern states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 155\u2013156</ref> Ultimately, Hayes swept the West and won much of the North, but Tilden carried the closely contested Northern states of New York, New Jersey, Indiana, and Connecticut, swept the [[border states (American Civil War)|border states]], and carried most of the South. He had won a majority of the popular vote and tallied clear victories in seventeen states, leaving him one [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]] short of a majority. On November 6, the day after election day, most major newspapers reported that Tilden had won the election; however, Hayes still had a narrow path to victory if he could sweep the electoral votes of Florida, South Carolina, and Louisiana.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 164\u2013166</ref> Hayes refused to formally concede, but told members of the press that he was \"of the opinion that the Democrats have carried the country and elected Tilden.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 167\u2013171</ref> Tilden, meanwhile, urged his alarmed followers, many of whom believed that the Republicans were attempting to steal the election, to remain calm and refrain from violence. Both parties feared the possibility that a dispute over the election would lead to armed conflict; Tilden discussed appointing General [[George B. McClellan]] as his military assistant, while President Grant ordered army and naval units to reinforce Washington.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 172\u2013174</ref>\n\n===Post-election controversy===\n[[Image:SJTilden of NY.jpg|thumb|right|Samuel Jones Tilden]]\n\nWith the election in doubt, each party sent some of their most prominent leaders to monitor the election process in the three disputed Southern states. Initial election returns showed that Hayes had carried South Carolina by several hundred votes, but that Tilden had won Florida by 91 votes and Louisiana by over 6000 votes. Republicans controlled the bodies charged with determining the validity of election results in all three states.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 174\u2013178</ref> On November 22, the South Carolina canvassing board adjourned after declaring that Hayes had won the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 180\u2013182</ref> On December 4, the Louisiana canvassing board announced that it had thrown out 15,623 votes due to \"systemic intimidation,\" leaving Hayes as the winner of all of the state's electoral votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 191\u2013192</ref> Early on the morning of December 6, the day the Electoral College was scheduled to convene, the Florida canvassing board announced that Hayes had won the state by a margin of 924 votes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 193\u2013197</ref> Democrats challenged the results in all three contested Southern states. Meanwhile, another controversy had arisen in Oregon, where a Hayes elector, John Watts, resigned because his simultaneous service as a presidential elector and as a low-ranking official in the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office]] violated the [[United States Constitution]]. After Watts resigned, the state's Democratic governor appointed an elector to fill the vacancy, while, separately, the state's two remaining Hayes electors chose a third elector to fill the vacancy caused by Watts's resignation.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 183\u2013185, 197\u2013198</ref>\n\nOn December 6, the members of the Electoral College met in Washington, D.C., but the disputes in four states prevented a conclusive vote for president.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 197\u2013198</ref> With the Electoral College unable to select a president, the disputed election became an issue for Congress to settle; Republicans controlled the Senate, while Democrats controlled the House. The vague wording of the Constitution gave rise to further controversy, as Republicans held that [[Thomas W. Ferry]], a Republican senator from Michigan and the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|president pro tempore]] of the [[United States Senate]], could determine the validity of the disputed electoral votes. Democrats argued that Ferry could only count the votes that were not disputed; in such a scenario, neither candidate would have an electoral vote majority, necessitating a [[contingent election]] in the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Since Democrats controlled a majority of the state delegations in the House, they would be able to elect Tilden as president in a contingent election.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 200\u2013201</ref> In response to the controversy, Tilden compiled his own study of electoral procedures in the previous 22 presidential elections. He delivered the study to every sitting member of Congress, but congressional Republicans were not swayed by Tilden's argument that history supported the Democratic position on the election returns.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 203\u2013204</ref> He continued to call for calm, and rejected Abram Hewitt's suggestion that he ask his supporters to engage in mass public demonstrations.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 206\u2013207, 214</ref>\n\n===Electoral Commission===\n[[File:President Rutherford Hayes 1870 - 1880 Restored.jpg|thumb|upright=1|[[Rutherford B. Hayes]] defeated Tilden in the 1876 election.]]\n\nOn January 26, both houses of Congress agreed to establish the 15-member [[Electoral Commission (United States)|Electoral Commission]] to settle the dispute over the contested electoral votes. The commission consisted of five Democratic members of Congress, five Republican members of Congress, and five justices of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]]. Of the Supreme Court justices, two were to be Democrats, two were to be Republicans, and the fifth justice would be selected by the other four justices. Tilden opposed the creation of the Electoral Commission because he still hoped to force a contingent election in the House of Representatives, but he was unable to prevent Democratic congressmen from voting for the establishment of the commission. Most had expected that the fifth justice on the commission would be Associate Justice [[David Davis (Supreme Court justice)|David Davis]], a [[political independent]], but Davis refused to serve on the commission after he accepted election to the Senate. Another associate justice, Republican [[Joseph P. Bradley]], was instead chosen as the fifth justice on the Electoral Commission.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 216\u2013219</ref> In a series of 8-to-7, party-line decisions, the Electoral Commission voted to award all of the contested electoral votes to Hayes.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 222\u2013235</ref>\n\nEven after the Electoral Commission delivered its rulings, the House of Representatives could have blocked the inauguration of Hayes by refusing to certify the election results.<ref>White (2017), p. 332</ref> Though some House Democrats hoped to do just that, they were unable to prevent the House of Representatives from blocking certification, as many House Democrats joined with their Republican colleagues in accepting the results.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 235\u2013236</ref> During the proceedings of the Electoral Commission, high-ranking members of both parties had discussed the possibility of declaring Hayes the winner in exchange for the removal of all federal troops from the South. The [[Compromise of 1877]], as it became known, may have played a role in preventing the House from challenging the Electoral Commission's rulings, although author Roy Morris, Jr. argues that the compromise \"was more a mutual concession of the obvious than a device for controlling larger events.\"<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 232\u2013234</ref> Some other historians, including [[C. Vann Woodward]], have argued that the Compromise of 1877 played the decisive role in determining the outcome of the election.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kleinfeld |first1=N.

Potter was appointed as the head of the commission, which Democrats hoped would implicate Hayes and damage the Republican Party in the next presidential election.<ref>Guenther (1983), 284\u2013285</ref> Rather than produce conclusive evidence of Republican malfeasance, the committee uncovered conflicting evidence that reflected poorly on election and campaign officials of both parties. For ten months beginning in May 1878, the Potter Committee subpoenaed all telegrams sent by political operatives during the election dispute. 29,275 telegrams had been sent, but all save 641 had been routinely destroyed by [[Western Union]]. The remaining telegrams were in cipher, as was common with business and political communication in the telegraph era. ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' editor [[Whitelaw Reid]] obtained and deciphered many of the telegrams and, in October 1878, he published the story of the Democratic efforts to sway election officials through bribery and other means. The revelation of the bribery attempts undercut the Democratic Party's argument that Tilden had been cheated out of the presidency.<ref>Kahn (1996), pp. 221\u2013229</ref> Tilden was not implicated in any wrongdoing, but the investigation into the Cipher Telegrams damaged his national standing.<ref>Morris (2003), pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n===Election of 1880===\n\nAfter the controversy over the election of 1876, Tilden became the presumptive Democratic candidate in [[1880 United States presidential election|1880 presidential election]].

He was a major figure in establishing the 16th-century \"English Mission\" of the [[Society of Jesus]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Persons was born at [[Nether Stowey]], [[Somerset]] to [[yeoman]] parents. Through the favour of local parson named John Hayward, a former monk, he was educated in 1562 at [[St. Mary's Hall, Oxford]]. After completing his degrees with distinction, he became a fellow and tutor at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] in 1568.<ref name=pollen>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11729a.htm Pollen, John Hungerford. \"Robert Persons.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1911. 25 March 2016</ref>\n\n==College fellow and priest==\nAs a Fellow of Balliol College, Persons clashed with the Master there, [[Adam Squire]], and also the academic and Roman Catholic priest [[Christopher Bagshaw]].<ref name=\"DNB\">{{cite DNB|wstitle=Parsons, Robert (1546-1610)|volume=43}}</ref> On 13 February 1574, he was subsequently forced to resign. Through discussion and encouraged by pupillage with [[William Good (Jesuit)|Father William Good, SJ]], he travelled overseas to become a Jesuit priest at St Paul's, Rome on 3 July 1575.\n\n==English mission: 1580\u20131581==\nPersons accompanied [[Edmund Campion]] on his mission to fellow English Catholics in 1580. The Jesuit General, [[Everard Mercurian]], had been reluctant to involve the Society directly in English ecumenical affairs. He was persuaded by an Italian Jesuit provincial, and later by Superior General [[Claudio Acquaviva]], after [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] had found Mercurian resistant to change in October 1579.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Persons fast tracked English recruits to the Jesuits, and planned to set up cooperation with the remaining English [[secular clergy]]. He became impatient with Father Good's approach to the situation. Campion was much less of an enthusiast than he was.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Persons and Campion only learned of this event in [[Reims]] while they were en route to England. After the initial invasion force under the mercenary [[Thomas Stukley]] had achieved nothing successful in 1578, the intervention under FitzGerald caused the English authorities to monitor the [[recusancy|recusants]] closely, and try to finance the campaign against the papal forces with exactions from them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

This action then resulted in a petition from Pounde to the Privy Council to allow a disputation where the Jesuits would take on [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and [[Henry Tripp]], who used to preach to the [[Marshalsea]] inmates. Campion and Persons also prepared their own personal statements, to be kept in reserve. The immediate consequence was that Pounde was then transferred to [[Bishop's Stortford Castle]]; but the prepared statement by Campion was later circulated soon after his capture.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=69038|title=Pounde, Thomas|first=Thomas M.|last=McCoog}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the time Persons spent in England was taken up with covert printing, and pamphleteering. He made his negative view on church [[Papist|papism]] clear to the local Catholic clergy, before a synod in [[Southwark]]. The secret printing press needed to be relocated, moving it in early 1581 to [[Stonor Park]]. Campion was captured in July of that year; and then [[Stephen Brinkley]], who ran the printing press, was taken captive in August. Quite soon after that date Persons left for France.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His underlying strategy of trying to embarrass the English government by demanding a forum for his ideals was consistent with the general approach of Allen and Persons, but met with much criticism from the Catholic members. Allen and Parsons persisted with their demand for another two years, but Jesuit opinion was against further confrontation. Campion was forced into disputation in the [[Tower of London]] under adverse conditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

He was in close contact with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], and through the Duke founded a school for English boys at [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]], on the coast to the north-east. [[William Creighton (Jesuit)|Father William Creighton, SJ]], was on the way to Scotland. He arrived in January 1582 and was briefed by Persons and the duke. In April Creighton returned with word from [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]]; and they went to Paris to confer with [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|James Beaton]] and Claude Mathieu, Jesuit provincial in France, on his military plans and the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The scheme, which Persons supported confidently, advanced further, but was stopped after the [[raid of Ruthven]] of August 1582. One consequence was that Allen was made Cardinal, as Persons had recommended.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA new enterprise was projected for September 1583, this time through England. Persons was sent by the Duke of Guise with written instructions to Rome. He returned to [[Flanders]], and stayed for some time at the court of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]. The discovery of the [[Throckmorton Plot]] disrupted the plan, and the Duke of Guise became absorbed in French domestic affairs. [[Philip II of Spain]] took over the lead, placed the Duke of Parma in charge, and limited involvement to Persons, Allen, and Hew Owen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIt was during this period that Persons was involved in the work later known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]''. Distributed covertly, it came to light in 1584. Persons is now generally thought not to be the author.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The British historian John Bossy, from the University of York, is inclined to disagree.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Correspondingly his own standing suffered in some quarters.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Claudio Acquaviva by the end of the year was concerned that the Jesuit strategies for France and the English mission would turn out to be inconsistent in the longer term, and consulted Pope Gregory XIII on the matter. Persons as his subordinate had been told to drop plans to assassinate Elizabeth.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

At this period Allen and Persons made a close study of the [[succession to Elizabeth I of England]], working with noted genealogist Robert Heighinton.<ref name=\"DNB\"/> Persons took his vows of final profession in the Jesuits in Rome on 7 May 1587.\n\n==Later life==\nPersons was sent to Spain at the close of 1588 to conciliate [[Philip II of Spain]], who was offended with [[Claudio Acquaviva]]. Persons was successful, and then made use of the royal favour to found the seminaries of [[English College, Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[English College of St Gregory|Seville]], and [[Madrid]] (1589, 1592, 1598) and the residences of [[San-Lucar]] and of [[Lisbon]] (which became a college in 1622). He then succeeded in establishing at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] (1594) a larger institution to which the boys from Eu were transferred. It is the institutional ancestor of [[Stonyhurst College]].<ref name=pollen/>\n\nIn 1596, in [[Seville]], he wrote ''Memorial for the Reformation of England'', which gave in some detail a blueprint for the kind of society England was to become after its return to the faith. He had hoped to succeed [[William Allen (cardinal)|Allen]] as Cardinal on the latter's death. Unsuccessful, he was rewarded with the rectorship of the [[English College at Rome|English College]] in Rome, where he died at the age of 63.\n\n==Works==\nPersons's published works were:<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n* ''A brief discovrs contayning certayne reasons why Catholiques refuse to goe to Church . . . dedicated by I.

He was a major figure in establishing the 16th-century \"English Mission\" of the [[Society of Jesus]].\n\n==Early life==\nRobert Persons was born at [[Nether Stowey]], [[Somerset]] to [[yeoman]] parents. Through the favour of local parson named John Hayward, a former monk, he was educated in 1562 at [[St. Mary's Hall, Oxford]]. After completing his degrees with distinction, he became a fellow and tutor at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] in 1568.<ref name=pollen>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11729a.htm Pollen, John Hungerford. \"Robert Persons.\" The Catholic Encyclopedia] Vol. 11.

Through discussion and encouraged by pupillage with [[William Good (Jesuit)|Father William Good, SJ]], he travelled overseas to become a Jesuit priest at St Paul's, Rome on 3 July 1575.\n\n==English mission: 1580\u20131581==\nPersons accompanied [[Edmund Campion]] on his mission to fellow English Catholics in 1580. The Jesuit General, [[Everard Mercurian]], had been reluctant to involve the Society directly in English ecumenical affairs. He was persuaded by an Italian Jesuit provincial, and later by Superior General [[Claudio Acquaviva]], after [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Cardinal Allen]] had found Mercurian resistant to change in October 1579.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Persons fast tracked English recruits to the Jesuits, and planned to set up cooperation with the remaining English [[secular clergy]]. He became impatient with Father Good's approach to the situation. Campion was much less of an enthusiast than he was.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Persons and Campion only learned of this event in [[Reims]] while they were en route to England. After the initial invasion force under the mercenary [[Thomas Stukley]] had achieved nothing successful in 1578, the intervention under FitzGerald caused the English authorities to monitor the [[recusancy|recusants]] closely, and try to finance the campaign against the papal forces with exactions from them.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

This action then resulted in a petition from Pounde to the Privy Council to allow a disputation where the Jesuits would take on [[Robert Crowley (printer)|Robert Crowley]] and [[Henry Tripp]], who used to preach to the [[Marshalsea]] inmates. Campion and Persons also prepared their own personal statements, to be kept in reserve. The immediate consequence was that Pounde was then transferred to [[Bishop's Stortford Castle]]; but the prepared statement by Campion was later circulated soon after his capture.<ref>{{cite ODNB|id=69038|title=Pounde, Thomas|first=Thomas M.|last=McCoog}}</ref>\n\nMuch of the time Persons spent in England was taken up with covert printing, and pamphleteering. He made his negative view on church [[Papist|papism]] clear to the local Catholic clergy, before a synod in [[Southwark]]. The secret printing press needed to be relocated, moving it in early 1581 to [[Stonor Park]]. Campion was captured in July of that year; and then [[Stephen Brinkley]], who ran the printing press, was taken captive in August. Quite soon after that date Persons left for France.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> His underlying strategy of trying to embarrass the English government by demanding a forum for his ideals was consistent with the general approach of Allen and Persons, but met with much criticism from the Catholic members. Allen and Parsons persisted with their demand for another two years, but Jesuit opinion was against further confrontation. Campion was forced into disputation in the [[Tower of London]] under adverse conditions.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

He was in close contact with [[Henry I, Duke of Guise]], and through the Duke founded a school for English boys at [[Eu, Seine-Maritime|Eu]], on the coast to the north-east. [[William Creighton (Jesuit)|Father William Creighton, SJ]], was on the way to Scotland. He arrived in January 1582 and was briefed by Persons and the duke. In April Creighton returned with word from [[Esm\u00e9 Stewart, 1st Duke of Lennox]]; and they went to Paris to confer with [[William Allen (cardinal)|William Allen]], [[James Beaton (archbishop of Glasgow)|James Beaton]] and Claude Mathieu, Jesuit provincial in France, on his military plans and the imprisoned [[Mary, Queen of Scots]]. The scheme, which Persons supported confidently, advanced further, but was stopped after the [[raid of Ruthven]] of August 1582. One consequence was that Allen was made Cardinal, as Persons had recommended.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nA new enterprise was projected for September 1583, this time through England. Persons was sent by the Duke of Guise with written instructions to Rome. He returned to [[Flanders]], and stayed for some time at the court of the [[Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma|Duke of Parma]]. The discovery of the [[Throckmorton Plot]] disrupted the plan, and the Duke of Guise became absorbed in French domestic affairs. [[Philip II of Spain]] took over the lead, placed the Duke of Parma in charge, and limited involvement to Persons, Allen, and Hew Owen.<ref name=\"DNB\"/>\n\nIt was during this period that Persons was involved in the work later known as ''[[Leicester's Commonwealth]]''. Distributed covertly, it came to light in 1584. Persons is now generally thought not to be the author.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> The British historian John Bossy, from the University of York, is inclined to disagree.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Thomas M.

Correspondingly his own standing suffered in some quarters.<ref name=\"ODNB\"/> Claudio Acquaviva by the end of the year was concerned that the Jesuit strategies for France and the English mission would turn out to be inconsistent in the longer term, and consulted Pope Gregory XIII on the matter.

Persons was successful, and then made use of the royal favour to found the seminaries of [[English College, Valladolid|Valladolid]], [[English College of St Gregory|Seville]], and [[Madrid]] (1589, 1592, 1598) and the residences of [[San-Lucar]] and of [[Lisbon]] (which became a college in 1622). He then succeeded in establishing at [[Saint-Omer|St Omer]] (1594) a larger institution to which the boys from Eu were transferred. It is the institutional ancestor of [[Stonyhurst College]].<ref name=pollen/>\n\nIn 1596, in [[Seville]], he wrote ''Memorial for the Reformation of England'', which gave in some detail a blueprint for the kind of society England was to become after its return to the faith.
