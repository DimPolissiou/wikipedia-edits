Eventually, Kimberly tells everyone to get over their relationship issues. Duncan forgives Jing and she apologizes for forcing marriage on him as she is too young.

In contrast to Buddhist temples in the region that built in typical [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] architecture; such as nearby [[Singhasari temple|Singhasari]], [[Jago temple|Jago]], Brahu in [[Trowulan]] and [[Jabung]] temple in Paiton.\n\nThe stupa consists of square base and cylindrical body of bell-shaped stupa, akin to Central Javanese [[Borobudur]]-style stupa, while the pinnacle is missing. The structure is made of [[andesite]] stone. The structure consists of a square base, pedestal, and a stupa. Rectangular base measures each sides 6.30 metres and 2.60 metres in height. Above the base is the rectangular pedestal measuring side of 5.04 m and height of 1.08 meters. The stupa consists of a rectangular-shaped pedestal measuring 4.24 x 4.24 m, the lower part of the stupa with an octagonal shape, topped with a rounded lotus-shaped cushion and a bell-shaped stupa body. The height of the stupa is 2.42 m. Total measurement of the stupa is 6.25 metres in length, width of 6.25 metres, and height of 5.23 metres.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n[[File:Candi Sumberawan Java 446.jpg|thumb|upright|Water spring at Sumberawan]]\n\n==Location==\nBuilt at an altitude of 650 m above sea level, at the foot of Mount Arjuno, the scenery around this temple is quite beautiful. The temple is located near a [[Spring (hydrology)|water spring]] with a very clear water, thus gave the name of the temple; ''Sumber-awan'', in  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''sumber'' means \"water spring\", while ''awan'' means \"noon\". It is thought the clear spring in the past is considered as a holy spring, essential for Hindu-Buddhist rituals. Thus the shrine was built as the landmarker, the guardian and the protector of the water spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/06/19/candi-sumberawan-little-guardian-springs.html|title=Candi Sumberawan: Little guardian of the springs|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|website=The Jakarta Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThis site has been identified with Kasurangganan, or 'the garden of the heavenly nymphs', which was mentioned in the [[Nagarakretagama]] manuscript as having been visited by King [[Hayam Wuruk]] of Majapahit during his royal tour across his realm in East Java in 1359.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n\nThe numbers written on the stones of dagoba (small stupa) indicate the period between the 11th and 15th centuries. However, examining the architecture and style, this simple form of stupa is thought to originate from between late 14th to early 15th century.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n\nIn modern times, Sumberawan temple was first discovered during the [[Dutch East Indies]] period in 1904. In 1935 a visit was made by researchers from the Archaeological Service. In 1937 a restoration was carried out on the base and pedestal parts of the structure, while the rest of stupa was reconstructed modestly, since most of the stones of stupa and ''chattra'' pinnacle are missing.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n\n==See also ==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[Candi of Indonesia]]\n*[[Buddhism in Indonesia]]\n*[[Prajnaparamita of Java]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Candi Sumberawan}}\n\n{{Buddhist Temples in Indonesia}}\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in Indonesia|Sumberawan]]\n[[Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in East Java]]\n[[Category:Singhasari]]\n[[Category:14th-century Buddhist temples]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|Buddhist stupa near Malang, East Java, Indonesia}}\n{{Infobox Historic building\n|image=047 View from East, Candi Sumberawan (39521127305).jpg\n|caption=Sumberawan stupa viewed from east\n|name=Candi Sumberawan\n|map_type=\n|map_size=\n|latitude=\n|longitude=\n|location_town=[[Malang Regency|Malang]], [[East Java]]. \n|location_country=[[Indonesia]]\n|architect=\n|client=\n|engineer=\n|construction_start_date=  \n|completion_date=  \n|date_demolished=\n|cost=\n|structural_system= \n|style=[[Candi of Indonesia|Candi]] [[stupa]] \n|size= 6.25 m x 6.25 m x 5.23 m\n| coordinates = {{coord|7|51|25|S|112|39|7.2|E|source:frwiki_region:ID|display=inline,title}}\n}}\n\n'''Sumberawan''' is a [[Buddhist]] [[stupa]] located in Toyomarto village, Sumberawan subdistrict, [[Malang Regency]], [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]].

In contrast to Buddhist temples in the region that built in typical [[Candi of Indonesia|candi]] architecture; such as nearby [[Singhasari temple|Singhasari]], [[Jago temple|Jago]], Brahu in [[Trowulan]] and [[Jabung]] temple in Paiton.\n\nThe stupa consists of square base and cylindrical body of bell-shaped stupa, akin to Central Javanese [[Borobudur]]-style stupa, while the pinnacle is missing. The structure is made of [[andesite]] stone. The structure consists of a square base, pedestal, and a stupa. Rectangular base measures each sides 6.30 metres and 2.60 metres in height. Above the base is the rectangular pedestal measuring side of 5.04 m and height of 1.08 meters. The stupa consists of a rectangular-shaped pedestal measuring 4.24 x 4.24 m, the lower part of the stupa with an octagonal shape, topped with a rounded lotus-shaped cushion and a bell-shaped stupa body. The height of the stupa is 2.42 m. Total measurement of the stupa is 6.25 metres in length, width of 6.25 metres, and height of 5.23 metres.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n[[File:Candi Sumberawan Java 446.jpg|thumb|upright|Water spring at Sumberawan]]\n\nBuilt at an altitude of 650 m above sea level, at the foot of Mount Arjuno, the scenery around this temple is quite beautiful. The temple is located near a [[Spring (hydrology)|water spring]] with a very clear water, thus gave the name of the temple; ''Sumber-awan'', in  [[Javanese language|Javanese]] ''sumber'' means \"water spring\", while ''awan'' means \"noon\". It is thought the clear spring in the past is considered as a holy spring, essential for Hindu-Buddhist rituals. Thus the shrine was built as the landmarker, the guardian and the protector of the water spring.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2009/06/19/candi-sumberawan-little-guardian-springs.html|title=Candi Sumberawan: Little guardian of the springs|last=Post|first=The Jakarta|website=The Jakarta Post|language=en|access-date=2020-04-09}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThis site has been identified with Kasurangganan, or 'the garden of the heavenly nymphs', which was mentioned in the [[Nagarakretagama]] manuscript as having been visited by King [[Hayam Wuruk]] of Majapahit during his royal tour across his realm in East Java in 1359.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n\nThe numbers written on the stones of dagoba (small stupa) indicate the period between the 11th and 15th centuries. However, examining the architecture and style, this simple form of stupa is thought to originate from between late 14th to early 15th century.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n\nIn modern times, Sumberawan temple was first discovered during the [[Dutch East Indies]] period in 1904. In 1935 a visit was made by researchers from the Archaeological Service. In 1937 a restoration was carried out on the base and pedestal parts of the structure, while the rest of stupa was reconstructed modestly, since most of the stones of stupa and ''chattra'' pinnacle are missing.<ref name =\"BPCB-Jatim-Sumberawan\"/>\n\n==See also ==\n{{Portal|Indonesia}}\n*[[Candi of Indonesia]]\n*[[Buddhism in Indonesia]]\n*[[Prajnaparamita of Java]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Commons category|Candi Sumberawan}}\n\n{{Buddhist Temples in Indonesia}}\n{{Indonesia topics}}\n\n[[Category:Buddhist temples in Indonesia|Sumberawan]]\n[[Category:Cultural Properties of Indonesia in East Java]]\n[[Category:Singhasari]]\n[[Category:14th-century Buddhist temples]]\n", "name_user": "Gunkarta", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eLocation and architecture", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sumberawan"}

He was one of the first great African players to make an impact on European club football. He played for teams in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and most famously France, where he was instrumental in Marseille's prominence in the [[UEFA Champions League]] during the early 1990s. Amongst his international accolades, he was often included in FIFA \"All-Star\" selections and captained the African All-Stars in their victory over their European counterparts in the [[1997 UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup|1997 Meridian Cup]].\n\nHe left Ghana after the 1982 [[African Cup of Nations]] to join [[Al Sadd SC|Al Sadd]] in Qatar for a $1,000 transfer fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-watan.com/viewnews.aspx?n=A5EBC9FC-754C-4AF9-BDB0-70FC56727DC2&d=20120429|title=Interview with Ali Behzad|publisher=al-watan.com|language=Arabic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814010101/http://www.al-watan.com/viewnews.aspx?n%3DA5EBC9FC%2D754C%2D4AF9%2DBDB0%2D70FC56727DC2%26d%3D20120429|url-status=dead|archivedate=14 August 2015}}</ref> After a short spell with [[FC Z\u00fcrich]], he returned to Ghana but, after both [[Asante Kotoko SC|Kotoko]] and [[Accra Hearts of Oak SC|Hearts of Oak]] failed to sign him, joined [[AS Dragons FC de l'Ou\u00e9m\u00e9]] in Benin. He would later return to Ghana and play for [[Real Tamale United]] for one season. He began his career in Europe with French side [[Chamois Niort]], subsequently joining [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] and [[Lille OSC|Lille]] before transferring to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. He later joined [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. He also played for [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] of Italy and rounded out his European career with [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]].\n\nAbedi Pele went on to sign a two-year contract with [[Al Ain Club|Al Ain]] in the United Arab Emirates and was nominated one of the best foreign players to play in the UAE league.\n\nHe was a captain  and was one of the first African football players to earn a top placing in [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] voting in 1991 and 1992. He is arguably Africa's most decorated and honoured football player ever, winning the ''[[France Football]]'' African Player of the Year Award three times, was the inaugural winner of the BBC African Sports Star of the Year in 1992, and the corresponding [[Confederation of African Football]] award twice.

However, he was arguably the most dominant figure on the [[Confederation of African Football|African football]] scene for nearly a decade. His performance in the [[1992 African Cup of Nations]] is often cited as one of the most outstanding football displays by any player in a single tournament. His native Ghana reached the finals of the Cup that year, only to lose on penalties in the final to the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] after Abedi was suspended because of a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] he received in the semi-final against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. Prior to that, his three spectacular goals against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]], [[Congo national football team|Congo]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] proved crucial in putting Ghana through to their seventh appearance in a CAN final \u2013 and their first final in ten years. The performance earned him the added nickname of \"The African [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]]\". His solo run goal against Congo in the quarter-finals is often compared to Maradona's second goal against [[England national football team|England]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]]. His backheader goal against Nigeria from the edge of the opponent's penalty box also heralded international acclaim.\n[[File:Ab\u00e9di P\u00e9l\u00e9 (cropped).jpg|thumb|260px|right|Abedi Ayew Pele, three-times winner of the [[African Footballer of the Year]] award; with [[The Black Stars|Black Stars]]' [[trophy]] of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]].<ref name=\"Ghana's brightest Black Star\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=161081/ |title= Ghana's brightest Black Star |work=FIFA | publisher= [[International Federation of Association Football]] |date= |accessdate= 17 February 2014}}</ref>]]\nAbedi holds the record for most appearances at the Nations Cup Finals, his record even surpassing the legendary [[Roger Milla]] of [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]]. He made his first appearance at the 13th Nations Cup Finals in Libya in 1982 and for the next 16 years (ending at the [[1998 African Cup of Nations|21st Finals]] in Burkina Faso) continued to grace the most prestigious football tournament on the continent, first as a member of Ghana's squad rising to become captain in 1991. Aside from his acclaimed exploits at the 1992 competition, Abedi also earned much acclaim for his three goals at the 1996 competition, where he led Ghana to the semi-finals of the competition despite critics expecting him to be in the twilight of his career.\n\nAt club level, he was a key figure in Marseille's dominance of the French league, resulting in four league championships and two European Cup finals appearances. An attacking midfielder, Abedi became as famous for his sublime dribbling skills as he did for his knack for scoring spectacular and often very important goals. Many such goals became regular \"Goals of the Week\" on ITN's weekly \"European Football\" program. At Marseille, he was a member of the team's \"Magical Trio\" along with [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] and [[Chris Waddle]], spearheading perhaps Europe's strongest league side of the early 1990s, including a [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup final defeat in 1991]]. Abedi was the only remaining member of the trio still with the side when Marseille defeated Milan in the 1993 Champions League final in [[Munich]].\n\nAyew has the singular honour of participating in more [[FIFA]] organized charity matches than any other African player. He is very popular in many African countries, especially the French-speaking countries because of his exploits in France. In countries such as Nigeria and South Africa, football fans still wear T-shirts bearing his name. He has become one of the continent's most respected and important ambassadors. Abedi Pele is a member of FIFA's Football Committee, and of the player status committees of both FIFA and CAF. That explains why the South African FA made him a Spokesperson for their 2006 World Cup bid. Abedi is considered one of the best players in World History not to have appeared at the FIFA World Cup, and perhaps the greatest African football player ever.\n\nIn appreciation of Abedi's devout services to the country, the Ghanaian government awarded him the country's highest honour, the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Ghana|Order of the Volta]] (civil division). He thus became the first Ghanaian sportsman to be so honoured.\n\nOn 29 January 1997, the first UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup All-Star Match between [[Europe XI v Africa XI (1997)|Europe and Africa]] was played in [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz (1954)|Est\u00e1dio da Luz]] in [[Lisbon]] and was televised in 100 countries worldwide, including 30 in Africa, for an audience of 60 million viewers. Abedi Pele was on target with a stunning goal early in the first half and, after [[Vincent Gu\u00e9rin]] had equalised for Europe just before half-time, it was the [[African Player of the Year|1998 African Player of the Year]], [[Mustapha Hadji]], who struck Africa's 78th-minute winner in the 2\u20131 win.<ref name=\"uefa meridian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/meridiancup/news/kind=1/newsid=1880.html |title=All-Stars clash kick off in Bari |accessdate=6 April 2007 |date=1 February 2001 |work=Meridian Cup |publisher=UEFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312062829/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/MeridianCup/News/Kind%3D1/newsId%3D1880.html |archivedate=12 March 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==After retirement==\n\n===CAF-UEFA All Star===\nIn 2001, the UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup All-Star Match format was changed slightly for the second All-Star Match to bring together great players aged between 35 and 45 who now revel in their 'veteran' status and play the game purely for pleasure. The squad sparked off memories of great footballing moments at club and international level<ref name=\"uefa meridian\"/>\n\n===Football Ambassador===\nIn June 2001 he was nominated by the present government of Ghana to serve as the next Chairman of the FA, an opportunity he later gave up for a more experienced former coach of Ghana for which in his own words said that this was to be an opportunity to learn from his superiors.\n\nAt present he owns a first division club, called [[Nania F.C.|Nania]], with the future hopes of nurturing the young talent to augment the fledgling league of the country. He has also been involved with various charity work across the African continent.\n\n===Controversy===\nAbedi Pele was recently embroiled in a serious alleged Second Division Promotion Play-off bribery scandal<ref name=\"National Middle League\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=121695 |title=Scandalous Middle League Results |accessdate=7 March 2007 |date=3 April 2007 |work=Ghana Football |publisher=Ghanaweb}}</ref> for which the Football Association found him and others guilty.

He was one of the first great African players to make an impact on European club football. He played for teams in Switzerland, Germany, Italy and most famously France, where he was instrumental in Marseille's prominence in the [[UEFA Champions League]] during the early 1990s. Amongst his international accolades, he was often included in FIFA \"All-Star\" selections and captained the African All-Stars in their victory over their European counterparts in the [[1997 UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup|1997 Meridian Cup]].\n\nHe left Ghana after the 1982 [[African Cup of Nations]] to join [[Al Sadd SC|Al Sadd]] in Qatar for a $1,000 transfer fee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-watan.com/viewnews.aspx?n=A5EBC9FC-754C-4AF9-BDB0-70FC56727DC2&d=20120429|title=Interview with Ali Behzad|publisher=al-watan.com|language=Arabic|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814010101/http://www.al-watan.com/viewnews.aspx?n%3DA5EBC9FC%2D754C%2D4AF9%2DBDB0%2D70FC56727DC2%26d%3D20120429|url-status=dead|archivedate=14 August 2015}}</ref> After a short spell with [[FC Z\u00fcrich]], he returned to Ghana but, after both [[Asante Kotoko SC|Kotoko]] and [[Accra Hearts of Oak SC|Hearts of Oak]] failed to sign him, joined [[AS Dragons FC de l'Ou\u00e9m\u00e9]] in Benin. He would later return to Ghana and play for [[Real Tamale United]] for one season. He began his career in Europe with French side [[Chamois Niort]], subsequently joining [[Montpellier HSC|Montpellier]] and [[Lille OSC|Lille]] before transferring to [[Olympique de Marseille|Marseille]]. He later joined [[Olympique Lyonnais|Lyon]]. He also played for [[Torino F.C.|Torino]] of Italy and rounded out his European career with [[TSV 1860 Munich|1860 Munich]].\n\nAbedi Pele went on to sign a two-year contract with [[Al Ain Club|Al Ain]] in the United Arab Emirates and was nominated one of the best foreign players to play in the UAE league.\n\nHe was a captain  and was one of the first African football players to earn a top placing in [[FIFA World Player of the Year]] voting in 1991 and 1992. He is arguably Africa's most decorated and honoured football player ever, winning the ''[[France Football]]'' African Player of the Year Award three times, was the inaugural winner of the BBC African Sports Star of the Year in 1992, and the corresponding [[Confederation of African Football]] award twice. He was also awarded the golden ball award for being the best player at the [[1992 African Cup of Nations]], and was the \"man of the match\" in Marseille's historic [[1993 UEFA Champions League Final|UEFA Champions League final]] win over [[A.C. Milan|Milan]] in 1993.\n\nAbedi Pele played for [[Ghana national football team|Ghana]] 73 times and is considered the greatest football player in his country's history, and among the best in Africa. Until 7 June 2013, when he was surpassed by [[Asamoah Gyan]], he was the top goalscorer for the ''Black Stars'' with 33 goals.<ref>{{cite magazine|magazine=[[World Soccer (magazine)|World Soccer]]|date=Summer 2013|page=9|title=Heroes & Villains}}</ref> He was a fixture in the African Championships of the 1980s and '90s with his national team, and a member of Ghana's victorious team in the [[1982 African Cup of Nations]], but he never had an opportunity to play in the [[FIFA World Cup]], as the ''Black Stars'' failed to qualify for the competition during his career. However, he was arguably the most dominant figure on the [[Confederation of African Football|African football]] scene for nearly a decade. His performance in the [[1992 African Cup of Nations]] is often cited as one of the most outstanding football displays by any player in a single tournament. His native Ghana reached the finals of the Cup that year, only to lose on penalties in the final to the [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]] after Abedi was suspended because of a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]] he received in the semi-final against [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]]. Prior to that, his three spectacular goals against [[Zambia national football team|Zambia]], [[Congo national football team|Congo]] and [[Nigeria national football team|Nigeria]] proved crucial in putting Ghana through to their seventh appearance in a CAN final \u2013 and their first final in ten years. The performance earned him the added nickname of \"The African [[Diego Maradona|Maradona]]\". His solo run goal against Congo in the quarter-finals is often compared to Maradona's second goal against [[England national football team|England]] in the [[1986 FIFA World Cup|1986 World Cup]]. His backheader goal against Nigeria from the edge of the opponent's penalty box also heralded international acclaim.\n[[File:Ab\u00e9di P\u00e9l\u00e9 (cropped).jpg|thumb|260px|right|Abedi Ayew Pele, three-times winner of the [[African Footballer of the Year]] award; with [[The Black Stars|Black Stars]]' [[trophy]] of the [[Africa Cup of Nations]].<ref name=\"Ghana's brightest Black Star\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.fifa.com/classicfootball/players/player=161081/ |title= Ghana's brightest Black Star |work=FIFA | publisher= [[International Federation of Association Football]] |date= |accessdate= 17 February 2014}}</ref>]]\nAbedi holds the record for most appearances at the Nations Cup Finals, his record even surpassing the legendary [[Roger Milla]] of [[Cameroon national football team|Cameroon]]. He made his first appearance at the 13th Nations Cup Finals in Libya in 1982 and for the next 16 years (ending at the [[1998 African Cup of Nations|21st Finals]] in Burkina Faso) continued to grace the most prestigious football tournament on the continent, first as a member of Ghana's squad rising to become captain in 1991. Aside from his acclaimed exploits at the 1992 competition, Abedi also earned much acclaim for his three goals at the 1996 competition, where he led Ghana to the semi-finals of the competition despite critics expecting him to be in the twilight of his career.\n\nAt club level, he was a key figure in Marseille's dominance of the French league, resulting in four league championships and two European Cup finals appearances. An attacking midfielder, Abedi became as famous for his sublime dribbling skills as he did for his knack for scoring spectacular and often very important goals. Many such goals became regular \"Goals of the Week\" on ITN's weekly \"European Football\" program. At Marseille, he was a member of the team's \"Magical Trio\" along with [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] and [[Chris Waddle]], spearheading perhaps Europe's strongest league side of the early 1990s, including a [[1991 European Cup Final|European Cup final defeat in 1991]]. Abedi was the only remaining member of the trio still with the side when Marseille defeated Milan in the 1993 Champions League final in [[Munich]].\n\nAyew has the singular honour of participating in more [[FIFA]] organized charity matches than any other African player. He is very popular in many African countries, especially the French-speaking countries because of his exploits in France. In countries such as Nigeria and South Africa, football fans still wear T-shirts bearing his name. He has become one of the continent's most respected and important ambassadors. Abedi Pele is a member of FIFA's Football Committee, and of the player status committees of both FIFA and CAF. That explains why the South African FA made him a Spokesperson for their 2006 World Cup bid. Abedi is considered one of the best players in World History not to have appeared at the FIFA World Cup, and perhaps the greatest African football player ever.\n\nIn appreciation of Abedi's devout services to the country, the Ghanaian government awarded him the country's highest honour, the [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Ghana|Order of the Volta]] (civil division). He thus became the first Ghanaian sportsman to be so honoured.\n\nOn 29 January 1997, the first UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup All-Star Match between [[Europe XI v Africa XI (1997)|Europe and Africa]] was played in [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]'s [[Est\u00e1dio da Luz (1954)|Est\u00e1dio da Luz]] in [[Lisbon]] and was televised in 100 countries worldwide, including 30 in Africa, for an audience of 60 million viewers. Abedi Pele was on target with a stunning goal early in the first half and, after [[Vincent Gu\u00e9rin]] had equalised for Europe just before half-time, it was the [[African Player of the Year|1998 African Player of the Year]], [[Mustapha Hadji]], who struck Africa's 78th-minute winner in the 2\u20131 win.<ref name=\"uefa meridian\">{{cite web|url=http://www.uefa.com/competitions/meridiancup/news/kind=1/newsid=1880.html |title=All-Stars clash kick off in Bari |accessdate=6 April 2007 |date=1 February 2001 |work=Meridian Cup |publisher=UEFA |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040312062829/http://www.uefa.com/competitions/MeridianCup/News/Kind%3D1/newsId%3D1880.html |archivedate=12 March 2004 }}</ref>\n\n==After retirement==\n\n===CAF-UEFA All Star===\nIn 2001, the UEFA\u2013CAF Meridian Cup All-Star Match format was changed slightly for the second All-Star Match to bring together great players aged between 35 and 45 who now revel in their 'veteran' status and play the game purely for pleasure. The squad sparked off memories of great footballing moments at club and international level<ref name=\"uefa meridian\"/>\n\n===Football Ambassador===\nIn June 2001 he was nominated by the present government of Ghana to serve as the next Chairman of the FA, an opportunity he later gave up for a more experienced former coach of Ghana for which in his own words said that this was to be an opportunity to learn from his superiors.\n\nAt present he owns a first division club, called [[Nania F.C.|Nania]], with the future hopes of nurturing the young talent to augment the fledgling league of the country. He has also been involved with various charity work across the African continent.\n\n===Controversy===\nAbedi Pele was recently embroiled in a serious alleged Second Division Promotion Play-off bribery scandal<ref name=\"National Middle League\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ghanaweb.com/GhanaHomePage/SportsArchive/artikel.php?ID=121695 |title=Scandalous Middle League Results |accessdate=7 March 2007 |date=3 April 2007 |work=Ghana Football |publisher=Ghanaweb}}</ref> for which the Football Association found him and others guilty.

Originally serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' from 1987 to 2004, it was transferred to the monthly [[seinen|''seinen'' manga]] magazine ''[[Ultra Jump]]'' in 2005. The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005. Trish hentai\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation. Also introduced in Part 8 is the {{nihongo|Rokakaka|\u30ed\u30ab\u30ab\u30ab|Rokakaka}} fruit, which is able to \"fix\" a body part at the expense of taking another away.\n\n==Production==\n[[File:Paul Gauguin 106.jpg|thumb|Araki is inspired by western art, such as this piece by [[Paul Gauguin]] which inspired him to use unusual colors in his own art.<ref name=\"comipress\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |title=NHK\u9ad8\u6821\u8b1b\u5ea7 &#124; \u82b8\u8853\uff08\u7f8e\u8853\u2160\uff0f\u66f8\u9053\u2160\uff09 &#124; \u7b2c15\u56de \u7f8e\u8853(8) \u6f2b\u753b\u306f\u3084\u3063\u3071\u308a\u304a\u3082\u3057\u308d\u3044 \u301c\u4eba\u7269\u301c |publisher=Nhk.or.jp |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140810200320/http://www.nhk.or.jp/kokokoza/tv/art/archive/chapter015.html |archivedate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>]]\nFor ''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'', Araki wanted to use a classical method as a base and then introduce modern elements in the singular.

The plot of the series is divided into eight story arcs, each following the adventures of a new protagonist bearing the \"JoJo\" nickname; the eighth part, ''[[JoJolion]]'', began serialization in May 2011. The series is currently [[Shueisha]]'s second [[List of manga series by volume count|largest manga series by volume count]], with its chapters collected in 126 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of December 2019.\n\nA [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (1993 anime series)|13-episode original video animation series]] adapting the manga's third part, ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'', was produced by [[A.P.P.P.]] and released between 1993 and 2002.{{efn|Seven episodes adapting the latter half of the part were released between 1993 and 1994; six more episodes adapting the first half were released between 2000 and 2002.}} The studio later produced [[Phantom Blood#Release and related media|an anime film]] adaptation of the first part in the series, ''[[Phantom Blood]]'', which was released in Japanese theaters in 2007. In October 2012, an [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure (2012 TV series)|anime television series adaptation]] produced by [[David Production]] began broadcast on [[Tokyo MX]]. The studio has since adapted through the series' fifth part, ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'', which ended broadcast in July 2019. A [[JoJo's Bizarre Adventure: Diamond Is Unbreakable Chapter I|live-action film]] directed by [[Takashi Miike]] and based on the fourth part, ''[[Diamond is Unbreakable]]'', entered theaters in 2017.\n\n''JoJo's Bizarre Adventure'' is famous for its iconic art style and poses, frequent references to Western [[popular music]] and [[fashion]], and creative battles centered around [[#Supernatural powers|Stands]], psycho-spiritual manifestations possessing unique supernatural abilities. The series has sold over 100 million copies in print to date, making it one of the [[List of best-selling manga|best-selling manga series]] in history, and it has spawned a [[media franchise]] including [[One-shot (comics)|one-shot manga]], spin-off [[light novel]]s, [[List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure video games|video games]], [[model figure|action figures]], and lines of apparel. The manga, TV anime, and live-action film are licensed in North America by [[Viz Media]], which has produced various English-language releases of the series since 2005.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of JoJo's Bizarre Adventure characters}}\nEach of the series' eight protagonists is a member of the {{Nihongo|Joestar family|\u30b8\u30e7\u30fc\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u5bb6|J\u014dsut\u0101 ke}}, whose mainline descendants invariably possess a star-shaped birthmark above their left shoulder blade and a name that can be abbreviated to the titular \"JoJo\". The plot of each part generally consists of this JoJo gathering a group of allies, mastering their supernatural ability, battling various enemies, and ultimately confronting the part's powerful main villain. The first six parts of the series take place within a single continuity whose multi-generational conflict stems from the rivalry between [[Jonathan Joestar]] and [[Dio Brando]], while the latter two parts take place in an alternate universe following a continuity reboot, where the Joestar family tree is heavily altered.\n\n; Part 1<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Phantom Blood]]''|\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30c8\u30e0\u30d6\u30e9\u30c3\u30c9|Fantomu Buraddo}}\n:Volumes 1\u20135, 44 chapters. In late 19th-century [[England]], the young Jonathan Joestar meets his new adopted brother [[Dio Brando]], who only wants to usurp Jonathan as heir to the Joestar family. However, his attempts are thwarted and he resorts to using an ancient Stone Mask which transforms him into a vampire. Jonathan, with Italian [[#Supernatural powers|Hamon]] master Will A. Zeppeli and former street thug Robert E.O. Speedwagon at his side, uses his newly found affinity for Hamon to stop Dio whose sights are set on nothing less than world domination. With this Hamon, Jonathan has discovered the only power that can kill a Vampire, and thus is especially necessary in his rivalry against Dio, who has tormented him his whole life.\n\n; Part 2<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Battle Tendency]]''|\u6226\u95d8\u6f6e\u6d41|Sent\u014d Ch\u014dry\u016b}}\n:Volumes 5\u201312, 69 chapters. In [[New York City]] in 1938, Joseph Joestar, grandson of Jonathan, has a natural affinity for Hamon. After hearing of Speedwagon's supposed death during an excavation, Joseph decides to investigate and becomes entangled with the revival of the Pillar Men, ancient humanoids of impossible power who are tied to the creation of the Stone Mask. Joseph ultimately teams up with Caesar Zeppeli, Will's grandson, and Caesar's teacher Lisa Lisa, who is mysteriously tied to Joseph. Under the pressure of poisons implanted in Joseph's body, Joseph must master Hamon as they try to stop the Pillar Men from obtaining the Red Stone of Aja, a mystical artifact in Lisa Lisa's possession that will grant them immortality and bring about the end of the world at their hands.\n\n; Part 3<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stardust Crusaders]]''|\u30b9\u30bf\u30fc\u30c0\u30b9\u30c8\u30af\u30eb\u30bb\u30a4\u30c0\u30fc\u30b9|Sut\u0101dasuto Kuruseid\u0101su}}\n:Volumes 13\u201328, 152 chapters. In 1989, Jotaro Kujo, a Japanese high school student, places himself in jail because he believes he is possessed by an evil spirit. His mother Holly calls on her father Joseph Joestar to talk sense into Jotaro. With the help of his ally the Egyptian fortune teller Mohammed Avdol, Joseph reveals that Jotaro has in fact developed a supernatural ability known as a [[#Supernatural powers|Stand]] that has run through the family due to a newly resurfaced Dio Brando having fused his head to Jonathan Joestar's headless body. After thwarting an assassination attempt by transfer student Noriaki Kakyoin, who is under Dio's thrall, Jotaro and Joseph discover that Holly is dying from her own Stand. Jotaro resolves to hunt down Dio, and Joseph leads him, Avdol, and Kakyoin to Egypt, using their Stands to battle more Stand-wielding assassins along the way before 50 days elapse and Holly dies. As they progress, they gain allies in the French swordsman Jean Pierre Polnareff, who wishes to avenge the death of his sister, and the [[Boston Terrier]] Iggy, who begrudgingly accompanies the group on the way to Cairo to bring about the demise of Dio that was due one hundred years prior.\n\n; Part 4<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]''|\u30c0\u30a4\u30e4\u30e2\u30f3\u30c9\u306f\u7815\u3051\u306a\u3044|Daiyamondo wa Kudakenai}}\n:Volumes 29\u201347, 174 chapters. In the fictional Japanese town of Morioh in 1999, Jotaro arrives to tell Josuke Higashikata (the kanji {{lang|ja|\u52a9}} in his name is read in the ''[[on'yomi]]'' form as ''jo'') that he is the illegitimate son of Joseph Joestar and to warn him that Morioh is becoming filled with Stand users. This is due to a mystical Bow and Arrow that bestows Stands on those struck by the arrowheads. After Josuke takes revenge on a Stand user who killed his grandfather, he agrees to help Jotaro hunt down the holder of the Bow and Arrow. He gains allies in Josuke's friend Koichi Hirose, who is hit by the arrow; Okuyasu Nijimura, whose brother Keicho was using the Arrow until it was stolen from him; Rohan Kishibe, a famous manga artist; and even his estranged father Joseph Joestar. Along the way, the group deals with the various new Stand users throughout Morioh, including several of Josuke, Koichi, and Okuyasu's classmates. Eventually, the death of one of their friends leads to the discovery that one of the new Stand users is the serial killer, Yoshikage Kira.\n\n; Part 5<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]''|\u9ec4\u91d1\u306e\u98a8|\u014cgon no Kaze}}\n:Volumes 47\u201363, 155 chapters. In 2001, Koichi Hirose is sent by Jotaro to [[Naples]] to investigate Giorno Giovanna, whom Jotaro has discovered is Dio's son fathered via Jonathan's body before his defeat in Cairo 12 years earlier, to see if the boy has a Stand and if he is evil. Koichi ultimately discovers Giorno's Stand and his pure goals for reforming a mafia organization from the inside out, and Jotaro lets him live his life uninterrupted. Giorno ultimately joins Bruno Bucciarati's squad within Passione, a Stand-using mafia, who leads Giorno, Leone Abbacchio, Guido Mista, Narancia Ghirga, and Pannacotta Fugo on a mission to [[Capri]] to retrieve Bruno's former superior's riches. In addition to being attacked by rival mafioso along the way, they are then tasked by Passione's boss to escort his daughter Trish Una throughout Italy and protect her from others in the gang who wish to use her to find out the boss's identity.\n\n; Part 6<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Stone Ocean]]''|\u30b9\u30c8\u30fc\u30f3\u30aa\u30fc\u30b7\u30e3\u30f3|Sut\u014dn \u014cshan}}\n:Volumes 64\u201380, 158 chapters. In 2011 near [[Port St. Lucie, Florida]], Jolyne Cujoh is arrested and sent to the Green Dolphin St. Prison for murder. Her estranged father Jotaro visits her and reveals that she has been set up in order for one of Dio's disciples to kill her within the prison. After revealing that a gift he gave her has awoken her latent Stand powers to protect her, Jotaro is attacked, and his Stand and memories are stolen from him by the prison chaplain Enrico Pucci, Dio's disciple. Jolyne works with fellow inmate Ermes Costello, who has also had a Stand awoken in her, to retrieve her father's Stand, gaining allies in the boy Emporio Alni\u00f1o; fellow inmates Narciso Anasui and Weather Report; and the sentient Stand-using plankton colony \u201cFoo Fighters\u201d to save her father and stop Pucci before he can use his Stand to recreate the universe in Dio's image.\n\n; Part 7<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[Steel Ball Run]]''|\u30b9\u30c6\u30a3\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30dc\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e9\u30f3|Sut\u012bru B\u014dru Ran}}\n:Volumes 81\u2013104, 95 chapters. In an alternate timeline in 1890, Gyro Zeppeli travels to the United States to take part in a cross-country horse race known as the Steel Ball Run. His skill in a mystical martial art known as Spin, which he controls with steel balls, garners the interest of former jockey turned paraplegic Johnny Joestar, particularly after a Spin-infused ball briefly restores Johnny's ability to walk. Johnny travels with Gyro on the race to learn the art of Spin from him in hopes he can walk again, but they soon discover that the race is a ploy set up by Funny Valentine, the President of the United States, to search the country for the scattered parts of a holy corpse that imbue their holders with a Stand, so the President can use the entire corpse to his own patriotic ends, even if it means the disruption of other dimensions with his Stand's ability. Gyro and Johnny work together, along with fellow racers Mountain Tim and Hot Pants, and race organizer Stephen Steel and his wife Lucy, to stop the President from achieving his plans, as they threaten the very world, all while dealing with Valentine's hired assassins in the race, including the charismatic racer Diego Brando.\n\n; Part 8<nowiki>:</nowiki> {{nihongo|''[[JoJolion]]''|\u30b8\u30e7\u30b8\u30e7\u30ea\u30aa\u30f3|Jojorion}}\n:Volumes 105\u2013126, 93 chapters. In 2012, in the same universe as ''Steel Ball Run'', the town of Morioh has been devastated by the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]], which has caused mysterious faults colloquially known as the \"Wall Eyes\" to appear in town. Local college student Yasuho Hirose is near one of the Wall Eyes when she discovers a young man buried in the rubble and a strange bite mark on him. She nicknames him \"Josuke\", as he cannot remember his own name, and after following a lead that he may be \"Yoshikage Kira\", an attack by a Stand user leads them to find the real Yoshikage Kira's corpse. Josuke is put in the care of the Higashikata family, whose patriarch Norisuke IV seems to know more about Josuke than he initially lets on, but Josuke himself discovers that the Higashikata family and Yoshikage Kira's family are linked due to Johnny Joestar's marriage to Rina Higashikata in the late 19th century. Josuke and Yasuho ultimately discover that Josuke is in fact Yoshikage Kira, mysteriously fused with another person, and Yoshikage Kira possessed the knowledge to cure a curse that has plagued the Higashikata family for centuries. Norisuke IV wants that knowledge back to save his grandchild from the same fate he and his family has suffered, but a mysterious race of rock men and Norisuke IV's own son Jobin seem to be conspiring against them to both prevent Josuke from regaining his memories and from lifting the curse on the Higashikata family.\n\n==Supernatural powers==\n{{more citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n* {{anchor|Hamon}} '''Part 1:''' ''[[Phantom Blood]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Stone Mask|\u77f3\u4eee\u9762|Ishikamen}}, an artifact discovered in Aztec ruins that reacts when blood is spilled on it, the Stone Mask produces spikes that drive themselves into the wearer's skull, transforming them into an immortal {{nihongo|[[Vampire]]|\u5438\u8840\u9b3c|Ky\u016bketsuki}}. These Vampires drain people of blood, can heal from most injuries, combine other creatures into abominations and freeze objects. A Vampire can only be killed by destroying the head, or by exposure to natural sunlight or ultraviolet rays. The {{nihongo|Ripple|\u6ce2\u7d0b|Hamon}} is also introduced as a martial arts technique that allows the user to focus bodily energy via controlled breathing. It is effective in combating vampires, as experienced Ripple users can emulate sunlight. Such energy is also useful in combating {{nihongo|Zombies|{{ruby-ja|\u5c4d\u751f\u4eba|\u30be\u30f3\u30d3}}|Zonbi|also referred to as {{nihongo|\"Undead\"|{{ruby-ja|\u4ea1\u8005|\u30a2\u30f3\u30c7\u30c3\u30c9}}|Andeddo}}}} created by vampires.\n* '''Part 2:''' ''[[Battle Tendency]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Pillar Men|\u67f1\u306e\u7537|Hashira no Otoko}}, ancient humanoids whose superhuman abilities enabled them to thrive as apex predators. One of their members, Kars, created the Stone Masks in an attempt to find a way to bypass their species' weakness to sunlight so they may rule Earth. When they are exposed to sunlight, they turn to stone, thus making them susceptible to the energies of the Ripple. Their surviving members seek out the {{nihongo|Red Stone of Aja|\u30a8\u30a4\u30b8\u30e3\u306e\u8d64\u77f3|Eija no Sekiseki}}, a flawless gem that amplifies light into nearly laser precision which is able to perfect the transformation into an immortal being with control over all life's forces. It is for this reason that the Ripple users protect the flawless Super Aja so it will not fall into the hands of the Pillar Men.\n* {{anchor|Stands}} '''Part 3:''' ''[[Stardust Crusaders]]'' introduces an evolution of the Ripple concept, {{nihongo|Stands|{{ruby-ja|\u5e7d\u6ce2\u7d0b|\u3086\u3046\u306f\u3082\u3093}}|Y\u016bhamon|literally \"Ghost (or Spirit) Ripple\", pronounced in the series as the English {{nihongo|\"Stand\"|\u30b9\u30bf\u30f3\u30c9|Sutando}}}}, so named because they are the manifestation of the user's psychic powers, or what would be their Ripple, in the form of a spiritual familiar that stands with them. A person may obtain a Stand naturally at birth, through rigorous spiritual and/or Ripple training, through exceptionally strong willpower, desire and/or passion, or through inheritance from bloodline. A Stand may never manifest itself until it is amplified by certain conditions or factors and not everyone has the ability to control it. Some Stands appear to have a separate and autonomous personality from their users, able to act on their own to protect them or speak to them. Generally, if the Stand user is incapacitated, the Stand will no longer be a threat (with an exception in Part 5), and any damage to a stand will be reflected on its user, and vice versa.\n* '''Part 4:''' ''[[Diamond Is Unbreakable]]'' introduces a {{nihongo|Bow and Arrow|\u5f13\u3068\u77e2|Yumi to Ya}}, forged from a mysterious meteorite that made its way to Earth after being drawn in by the spiritual powers of the planet's inhabitants. A Stand can be brought forth after one is pierced by the Arrow; however, the results can be unpredictable, as it could easily kill an unqualified person, and there is no apparent way to know if a person is qualified ahead of time. The Arrows do, however, tend to seek out qualified people on their own if there is someone to guide them.\n* '''Part 5:''' ''[[Golden Wind (manga)|Golden Wind]]'' introduces the ability to create a {{nihongo|\"Requiem\"|{{ruby-ja|\u93ae\u9b42\u6b4c|\u30ec\u30af\u30a4\u30a8\u30e0}}|Rekuiemu}} Stand. If an Arrow hits the Stand instead of the user, the Stand can completely change form and its powers become a Requiem Stand with increased powers that relate to the control over the souls of living beings. Both Giorno's Gold Experience and Polnareff's Silver Chariot are pierced by the Arrow and given Requiem forms. Silver Chariot Requiem's new ability swaps the souls of all living beings, and Gold Experience Requiem's new ability removes the consequences of any action, reverting it to a null state.\n* '''Part 6:''' ''[[Stone Ocean]]'' shows examples of a single person possessing two Stands because of the ability of an extraordinary Stand. Enrico Pucci is able to produce artificial Stand users by stealing others' Stands, transforming them into {{nihongo|Discs|\u30c7\u30a3\u30b9\u30af|Disuku}}, and \"inserting\" them into certain individuals. Part 6 also features {{nihongo|DIO's bone|{{ruby-ja|DIO|\u30c7\u30a3\u30aa}}\u306e\u9aa8|DIO no Hone}}, the sole remaining part of DIO which is instrumental in Pucci's {{nihongo|Way to Heaven|\u5929\u56fd\u3078\u884c\u304f\u65b9\u6cd5|Tengoku e Iku H\u014dh\u014d}}. It grants a new and more powerful Stand that ultimately leads to the creation of {{nihongo|Made in Heaven|\u30e1\u30a4\u30c9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30fb\u30d8\u30d6\u30f3|Meido In Hebun}}, a powerful Stand that can accelerate the universe to the point of a universal reset in accordance with the [[Big Bounce|Big Bounce cosmological model]].\n* '''Part 7:''' ''[[Steel Ball Run]]'' introduces the {{nihongo|Spin|\u56de\u8ee2|Kaiten}}, a technique that incorporates the [[Fibonacci number|Fibonacci sequence]], [[golden spiral]], and {{nihongo|[[golden rectangle]]|\u9ec4\u91d1\u9577\u65b9\u5f62|\u014dgon ch\u014dh\u014dkei}} into a means of manipulating the [[Magnus effect]] to the user's benefit, but its true power lies in its destructive effects. Also introduced in Part 7 is the {{nihongo|Saint's Corpse|\u8056\u4eba\u306e\u907a\u4f53|Seijin no Itai}}, body parts of a deceased holy man (hinted to be [[Jesus|Jesus Christ]]) that imbue the user with a Stand if the body part is fused with the user. If the user loses the Corpse part, they lose their Stand.\n* '''Part 8:''' ''[[JoJolion]]'' introduces another method of obtaining a Stand, interaction with the {{nihongo|Wall Eyes|\u58c1\u306e\u76ee|Kabe no Me}}, strange [[fault (geology)|fault]]-like structures that have risen from the ground following the [[2011 T\u014dhoku earthquake and tsunami]]. They disrupt all forms of transportation, communication, and utilities, but all users of Stands have come in contact with the Wall Eyes at some point. A race of Stand-using {{nihongo|Rock People|\u5ca9\u4eba\u9593|Iwa Ningen}} also appears in ''JoJolion''. These humans seem to innately possess the ability to turn their body into stone and enter a state of suspended animation.

The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

name {{nihongo|Jack|\u30b8\u30e3\u30c3\u30af|Jakku}}, is a [[Character (arts)|fictional character]] and one of the main protagonists of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear]]'' series of video games. The character was created by [[Hideo Kojima]] and designed by [[Yoji Shinkawa]], and was introduced in the series as the main [[player character]] of the 2001 [[stealth game]] ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]''. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', Raiden appears to be a member of the U.S. special operations unit [[FOXHOUND]] and is participating in his first mission against terrorists. Despite coming across as a rookie, he is a young soldier who is later revealed to have been a Liberian [[child soldier]]. Raiden also appears as a supporting character in ''[[Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots]]'', in which he is assisting the series' protagonist [[Solid Snake]] in his fight against [[Revolver Ocelot]]'s forces. He is also the main character of the [[hack and slash]] game ''[[Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance]]'', in which he is dealing with his past and his present life as a combatant who faces enemies from [[private military companies]].\n\nRaiden, who was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories and a fan's letter wanting a younger character to be featured in the series, originated from Hideo Kojima's desire to view Solid Snake from a different point of view. Raiden's inclusion in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was kept secret from gamers before his debut; despite some players' reactions, the staff liked the character. To appeal to fans of the series who initially disliked Raiden, the character was redesigned for ''Metal Gear Solid 4''. He was again redesigned for both the cancelled game ''Metal Gear Solid: Rising'' and its reboot ''Revengeance'' to portray a darker side of his character. In Japanese, the character is voiced by  [[Kenyu Horiuchi]] and in English by [[Quinton Flynn]].\n\nRaiden's debut role as the protagonist of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' was controversial, however, due to his unexpected substitution for the established hero Solid Snake. Some critics defended the character, stating that fans were merely angered by the former's removal and that the latter was appealing. Despite this mixed reception, Raiden has been praised for his role and ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' redesign especially in his fight scene, and more for his role and design in ''Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance'' where he was found as a better character than in previous installments.\n\n==Character design==\n===Initial concept===\n{{multiple image\n | footer    = Hideo Kojima created Raiden while Yoji Shinkawa designed him.\n | image1    = Hideo Kojima - Tokyo Game Show 2011 (1) (cropped).jpg\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  =  \n | width1    = 170\n | image2    = Yoji Shinkawa.png\n | alt2      =\n | caption2  =\n | width2    = 150\n}}\nAccording to series creator [[Hideo Kojima]], the decision to make a new character to replace Solid Snake for most of ''[[Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty]]'' stemmed from the developer's desire to develop Snake from a third-person perspective. Kojima stated that Raiden's character and his perception by the audience were important to the overall feel of the story. The idea of having a second main character was inspired by the [[Sherlock Holmes]] short stories and novels in which the narrator is [[Dr. Watson]] rather than Holmes. Kojima said Snake was the game's protagonist rather than Raiden. Yoshikazu Matsuhana, assistant director for the project, was uncertain about this decision; he considered Raiden a \"weak-looking character\" but decided to follow Kojima.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Final Hours of Metal Gear Solid 2|website=[[GameSpot]]|url=http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103100148/http://www.gamespot.com/gamespot/features/video/btg_mgs2/p02_01.html|accessdate=July 3, 2011|archivedate=January 3, 2006}}</ref> The codename \"Raiden\" was based on that of the [[Mitsubishi J2M|Mitsubishi J2M Raiden]], a historical combat aircraft of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service]].

Originally, to defeat Solidus, Raiden must cut off both his mechanical snake-like arms, then he must attack Solidus' back and sever the back bone vertebra connection, rendering Solidus no longer mobile. Following this, Raiden would finish Solidus by decapitating him similar to samurai fashion. The scene was rejected and instead Raiden would slice Solidus' stomach, another idea taken from samurais. However, this concept was also scrapped to simply Raiden slicing Solidus' vertebral column with the boss falling from the area to give the idea he could not accept his defeat.<ref name=\"production\">{{cite web|url=https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130709185620/https://muni_shinobu.webs.com/mgs2/production.html|title=Metal Gear Solid 2 Production|archivedate=July 9, 2013|accessdate=August 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\n[[Konami]] kept Raiden's starring role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' secret until the game's North American release; the company replaced Raiden with Snake in teaser trailers and other preview materials.

This is also true for fungi where the sexual phase is present, although in this case, additional and significant variation is incorporated through the sexual reproduction.\n\n==Stages==\n\n===Diploidization===\nOccasionally, two haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus\u2014with two [[homologous chromosome|homologous]] copies of each chromosome. The mechanism is largely unknown, and it seems to be a relatively rare event, but once a diploid nucleus has been formed it can be very stable and divide to form further diploid nuclei, along with the normal haploid nuclei. Thus the heterokaryon consists of a mixture of the two original haploid nuclear types as well as diploid fusion nuclei.<ref name=Deacon2005/>\n\n===Mitotic chiasma formation===\n[[Chiasma (genetics)|Chiasma]] formation is common in meiosis, where two homologous chromosomes break and rejoin, leading to chromosomes that are hybrids of the parental types. It can also occur during mitosis but at a much lower frequency because the chromosomes do not pair in a regular arrangement. Nevertheless, the result will be the same when it does occur\u2014the [[genetic recombination|recombination of genes]].<ref name=Deacon2005/>\n\n===Haploidization===\nOccasionally, [[nondisjunction]] of chromosomes occurs during division of a diploid nucleus, so that one of the daughter nuclei has one chromosome too many (2n+1) and the other has one chromosome too few (2n\u20131). Such nuclei with incomplete multiples of the haploid number are termed ''aneuploid'', as they do not have even chromosome number sets such as n or 2n. They tend to be unstable and to lose further chromosomes during subsequent mitotic divisions, until the 2n+1 and 2n-1 nuclei progressively revert to n.

A parasexual cycle is initiated by the fusion of [[hypha]]e ([[anastomosis]]) during which nuclei and other cytoplasmic components occupy the same cell (heterokaryosis and [[plasmogamy]]). Fusion of the unlike nuclei in the cell of the heterokaryon results in formation of a diploid nucleus ([[karyogamy]]), which is believed to be unstable and can produce segregants by [[genetic recombination|recombination]] involving mitotic [[Crossing-over (genetics)|crossing-over]] and [[Haploidisation|haploidization]]. Mitotic crossing-over can lead to the exchange of genes on [[chromosome]]s; while haploidization probably involves mitotic nondisjunctions which randomly reassort the chromosomes and result in the production of [[Aneuploidy|aneuploid]] and haploid cells. Like a sexual cycle, parasexuality gives the species the opportunity to recombine the genome and produce new [[genotype]]s in their offspring. Unlike a sexual cycle, the process lacks coordination and is exclusively mitotic.\n\nThe parasexual cycle resembles sexual reproduction. In both cases, unlike hyphae (or modifications thereof) may fuse (plasmogamy) and their nuclei will occupy the same cell. The unlike nuclei fuse (karyogamy) to form a diploid (zygote) nucleus.  In contrast to the sexual cycle, in the parasexual cycle recombination takes place during [[mitosis]] followed by haploidization (but without meiosis). The recombined haploid nuclei appear among vegetative cells, which differ genetically from those of the parent mycelium.\n\nBoth heterokaryosis and the parasexual cycle are very important for those fungi that have no sexual reproduction. Those cycles provide for [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]] variation in the vegetative phase of their [[biological life cycle|life cycles]]. This is also true for fungi where the sexual phase is present, although in this case, additional and significant variation is incorporated through the sexual reproduction.\n\n==Stages==\n\n===Diploidization===\nOccasionally, two haploid nuclei fuse to form a diploid nucleus\u2014with two [[homologous chromosome|homologous]] copies of each chromosome. The mechanism is largely unknown, and it seems to be a relatively rare event, but once a diploid nucleus has been formed it can be very stable and divide to form further diploid nuclei, along with the normal haploid nuclei. Thus the heterokaryon consists of a mixture of the two original haploid nuclear types as well as diploid fusion nuclei.<ref name=Deacon2005/>\n\n===Mitotic chiasma formation===\n[[Chiasma (genetics)|Chiasma]] formation is common in meiosis, where two homologous chromosomes break and rejoin, leading to chromosomes that are hybrids of the parental types. It can also occur during mitosis but at a much lower frequency because the chromosomes do not pair in a regular arrangement. Nevertheless, the result will be the same when it does occur\u2014the [[genetic recombination|recombination of genes]].<ref name=Deacon2005/>\n\n===Haploidization===\nOccasionally, [[nondisjunction]] of chromosomes occurs during division of a diploid nucleus, so that one of the daughter nuclei has one chromosome too many (2n+1) and the other has one chromosome too few (2n\u20131). Such nuclei with incomplete multiples of the haploid number are termed ''aneuploid'', as they do not have even chromosome number sets such as n or 2n. They tend to be unstable and to lose further chromosomes during subsequent mitotic divisions, until the 2n+1 and 2n-1 nuclei progressively revert to n. Consistent with this, in ''E.&nbsp;nidulans'' (where normally, n=8) nuclei have been found with 17 (2n+1), 16 (2n), 15 (2n\u20131), 12, 11, 10, and 9 chromosomes.<ref name=Deacon2005/>\n\nEach of these events is relatively rare, and they do not constitute a regular cycle like the sexual cycle. But the outcome would be similar. Once a diploid nucleus has formed by fusion of two haploid nuclei from different parents, the parental genes can potentially recombine. And, the chromosomes that are lost from an aneuploid nucleus during its reversion to a euploid could be a mixture of those in the parental strain.<ref name=Deacon2005/>\n\n==Organisms==\nThe potential to undergo a parasexual cycle under laboratory conditions has been demonstrated in many species of filamentous fungi, including ''[[Fusarium monoliforme]]'',<ref name=Sidhu1983/> ''[[Penicillium roqueforti]]''<ref name=Durand1992/> (used in making [[blue cheese]]s<ref>Alexopolous (1996), ''et al''., p. 12.</ref>), ''[[Verticillium dahliae]]'',<ref name=Pulhalla1974/><ref name=OGarro1992/> ''[[Verticillium alboatrum]]'',<ref name=Hastie1964/> ''[[Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides]]'',<ref>Hocart MJ, Lucas JA, and Peberdy JF. \"Parasexual recombination between W and R pathotypes of Pseudocercosporella herpotrichoides through protoplast fusion.\" Mycological Research. 1993 August;97(8):977-983.</ref> ''[[Ustilago scabiosae]]'',<ref name=Garber1992/> ''[[Magnaporthe grisea]]'',<ref name=Zeigler1997/> ''[[Cladosporium fulvum]]'',<ref name=Higgins1987/><ref name=Arnau1993/> and the human pathogens ''[[Candida albicans]]''<ref>Bennett RJ and Johnson AD. \"Completion of a parasexual cycle in Candida albicans by induced chromosome loss in tetraploid strains.\" EMBO J. 2003 May 15;22(10):2505-15.</ref> and ''[[Candida tropicalis]]''.<ref>Seervai RNH, Knox SKJ, Hirakawa MK, Porman AM, and Bennett RJ. \"Parasexuality and Ploidy Change in Candida tropicalis.\" Eukaryotic Cell. 2013 Dec; 12(12): 1629\u20131640.</ref>\n\n==Significance==\nParasexuality has become a useful tool for industrial mycologists to produce strains with desired combinations of properties.

But apart from two performances:a compulsory and an optional, which counted for both the team competition and the all-around, a gymnast, who competed in an apparatus final should show one's skills once more on the respective apparatus. For the final score (\"Total\" column in tables below), the compulsory routine's mark was added to the optional routine's, the result was divided by two (\"Prelim\" column) and added to the third routine's mark (\"Final\" column).\n\n==Results==\n===Men's events===\n{| {{MedalistTable|type=Event}}\n|-valign=\"top\"\n| Individual all-around<br />{{DetailsLink|Gymnastics at the 1960 Summer
