Born in [[Southeast Asia]] around 1875, Topsy was secretly brought into the [[United States]] soon thereafter and added to the herd of performing elephants at the [[Adam Forepaugh|Forepaugh Circus]], who fraudulently advertised her as the first elephant born in America. During her 25 years at Forepaugh, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant and, after killing a spectator in 1902, was sold to Coney Island's [[Sea Lion Park]]. When Sea Lion was leased out at the end of the 1902 season and replaced by [[Luna Park (Coney Island, 1903)|Luna Park]], Topsy was involved in several well-publicized incidents, attributed to the actions of either her drunken handler or the park's new publicity-hungry owners, [[Frederic Thompson]] and [[Elmer \"Skip\" Dundy]].\n\nTheir end-of-the-year plans to hang Topsy at the park in a public spectacle and charge admission were prevented by the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. The event was instead limited to invited guests and press only and Thompson and Dundy agreed to use a more sure method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch with both poison and electrocution planned for good measure. On January 4, 1903, in front of a small crowd of invited reporters and guests, Topsy was fed poison, electrocuted, and strangled, the electrocution ultimately killing her. Amongst the invited press that day was a crew from the [[Edison Studios|Edison Manufacturing movie company]] who filmed the event. Their film of the electrocution part was released to be viewed in coin-operated [[kinetoscope]]s under the title ''[[Electrocuting an Elephant]]''. It is probably the first filmed death of an animal in history.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite book|last=Daly|first=Michael|title=Topsy: The Startling Story of the Crooked-tailed Elephant, P.T.

In popular culture Thompson and Dundy's killing of Topsy has switched attribution, with claims it was an anti-[[alternating current]] demonstration organized by [[Thomas A. Edison]] during the [[war of the currents]]. Historians point out that Edison was never at Luna Park and the electrocution of Topsy took place ten years after the war of currents.<ref name=Daly>\"Later, some historians would suggest that Edison electrocuted Topsy as part of the War of Currents.

At the time Forepaugh Circus was in competition with the [[Barnum & Bailey Circus]] over who had the most and largest elephants. The name \"Topsy\" came from a slave girl character in ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.\n\nForepaugh announced to the press in February 1877 that his circus now boasted \"the only baby elephant ever born on American soil\". The elephant trader who sold Topsy to Forepaugh also sold elephants to [[P. T. Barnum]] and tipped Barnum off about the deception. Barnum exposed the hoax publicly and Forepaugh stopped claiming that Topsy was born in America, only advertising that she was the first elephant born outside a tropical zone.\n\nAt maturity, Topsy was {{cvt|10|ft}} high and {{cvt|20|ft}} long, with claims she weighed between {{convert|4|and|6|ST|LT t|abbr=off|sp=us}}. Over the years, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant. In 1902, another event brought her again to prominence: the killing of spectator James Fielding Blount<ref>originally from Fort Wayne, Indiana and described as a ''circus follower'', maybe trying to get employment at Forepaugh</ref> in [[Brooklyn]], New York, at what was then the Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus. Accounts vary as to what happened but the common story is that on the morning of May 27, 1902, a possibly drunk Blount wandered into the menagerie tent where all the elephants were tied in a line and began teasing them in turn, offering them a bottle of whiskey. He reportedly threw sand in Topsy's face and then burnt the extremely sensitive tip of her trunk with a lit [[cigar]].<ref name=\"topsyReview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324110404578625792096049594|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|title=Book Review: \"Topsy\"|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref> Topsy threw Blount to the ground with her trunk and then crushed him with her head, knees, or foot. Newspaper reports on Blount's death contained what seem to be exaggerated accounts of Topsy's man-killing past, with claims that she killed up to 12 men, but with more common accounts that, during the 1900 season, she had killed two Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus workers, one in [[Paris, Texas]] and one in [[Waco, Texas]]. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, could find no record of anyone being killed by an elephant in Waco, and a handler attacked by Topsy in Paris suffered injuries but there is no record of him dying.<ref name=autogenerated2/> The publicity generated by Topsy's man killing brought very large crowds to the circus to see the elephant. In June 1902 during the unloading of Topsy from a train in [[Kingston, New York]], a spectator named Louis Dodero used a stick in his hand to \"tickle\" Topsy behind the ear. Topsy seized Dodero around the waist with her trunk, hoisted him high in the air and threw him back down before being stopped by a handler.<ref name=autogenerated2/> Because of this attack, the owners of Forepaugh & Sell Circus decided to sell Topsy.<ref name=\"samuelhawley.com\">[http://www.samuelhawley.com/topsy.html Samuel Hawley, TOPSY THE CIRCUS ELEPHANT, .samuelhawley.com (research collected for the novel \"Bad Elephant Far Stream\")]</ref>\n\n=== Sea Lion and Luna Park ===\nTopsy was sold in June 1902 to [[Paul Boyton]], owner of Coney Island's [[Sea Lion Park]], and added to the menagerie of animals on display there. The elephant's handler from Forepaugh, William \"Whitey\" Alt,<ref>Various accounts from the period name him as \"Frederic Ault\", \"William Alt\", \"William Alf\" (per:Michael Daly and Samuel Hawley)</ref> came along with Topsy to work at the park. A bad summer season and competition with the nearby [[Steeplechase Park]] made Boyton decide to get out of the amusement park business. At the end of the year he leased Sea Lion Park to Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy who proceeded to redevelop it into a much larger attraction and renamed it [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park]].<ref name=\"samuelhawley.com\"/> Topsy was used in publicity, moving timbers and even the fanciful airship ''Luna'', part of the amusement ride ''[[A Trip to the Moon (attraction)|A Trip to the Moon]]'', from Steeplechase to Luna Park, characterized in the media as \"penance\" for her rampaging ways.<ref name=\"samuelhawley.com\"/>\n\nDuring the moving of the ''Luna'' in October 1902, handler William Alt was involved in an incident where he stabbed Topsy with a pitchfork trying to get her to pull the amusement ride. When confronted by a police officer, Alt turned Topsy loose from her work harness to run free in the streets, leading to Alt's arrest. The occurrence was attributed to the handler's drinking. In December 1902, a drunk Alt rode Topsy down the town streets of Coney Island and walked, or tried to ride, Topsy into the local police station. Accounts say Topsy tried to batter her way through the station door and \"she set up a terrific trumpeting\", leading the officers to take refuge in the cells. The handler was fired after the incident.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Topsy elephant electrocution Luna Park, Coney Island January 1903.png|thumb|320px|Topsy, standing in the middle of press photographers and on-lookers, refusing to cross the bridge over the lagoon to the spot where she was supposed to be killed.

On December 13, 1902, Luna Park press agent Charles Murray released a statement to the newspapers that Topsy would be put to death within a few days by electrocution. At least one local paper noted that the steady drone of events and reports regarding Topsy from the park had the hallmarks of a publicity campaign designed to get the new park continually mentioned in the papers.<ref name=autogenerated2/><ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/50395940/ \"TOPS\" AND THE PRESS AGENT, The Brooklyn Daily Eagle from Brooklyn, New York December 13, 1902, page 5]</ref> On January 1, 1903, Thompson and Dundy announced plans to conduct a public hanging of the elephant,<ref>[https://www.newspapers.com/image/57100026/ The Brooklyn Daily Eagle, January 5, 1903 \u00b7 page 8]</ref> set for January 3 or 4, and collect a twenty-five cents a head admission to see the spectacle.<ref name=\"fultonhistory.com\">[http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2018/New%20York%20NY%20Press/New%20York%20NY%20Press%201903/New%20York%20NY%20Press%201903%20-%200051.pdf#xml=http://fultonhistory.com/dtSearch/dtisapi6.dll?cmd=getpdfhits&u=ffffffffb413fd04&DocId=2590125&Index=Z%3a%5cIndex%20I%2dE%2dV&HitCount=10&hits=17+19+70+81+f1+10b+14a+2e3+37a+3ed+&SearchForm=C%3a%5cinetpub%5cwwwroot%5cFulton%5fNew%5fform%2ehtml&.pdf BAD ELEPHANT DIES BY SHOCK, Electricity Kills Topsy at Coney Island, New York Press, January 5, 1903 (at fultonhistory.com)]</ref> The site they chose was an island in the middle of the lagoon for the old [[Shoot the Chute]] ride where they were building the centerpiece of their new park, the 200-foot Electric Tower (the structure had reached a height of 75 feet at the time of the killing). Press agent Murray arranged media coverage and posted banners around the park and on all four sides of the makeshift [[gallows]] advertising, \"OPENING MAY 2ND 1903 LUNA PARK $1,000,000 EXPOSITION, THE HEART OF CONEY ISLAND\".\n\nOn hearing Thompson and Dundy's plans, the President of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], [[John Peter Haines]], stepped in and forbade hanging as a \"needlessly cruel means of killing [Topsy]\" and also told Thompson and Dundy they could not conduct a public spectacle and charge admission. Thompson and Dundy discussed alternatives with Haines, going over methods used in previous attempts to euthanize elephants including poisoning, but that, as well as a 1901 attempt to electrocute an elephant named Jumbo II two years earlier in [[Buffalo, New York]], were botched.<ref>The poisonings either left the animals in agony or showed little effect and the electricity seemed to show no effect.</ref> After much negotiation, which included Thompson and Dundy trying to give the elephant to the ASPCA, a method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered [[winch]] was agreed upon. They also agreed they would use poisoning and electricity as well.<ref name=\"fultonhistory.com\"/>\n\nThe date of Topsy's demise was finally set for Sunday, January 4, 1903. The press attention the event had received brought out an estimated 1500 spectators and 100 press photographers as well as agents from the ASPCA to inspect the proceedings. Thompson and Dundy allowed 100 spectators into the park although more climbed through the park fence. Many more were on the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings, which were charging admission to see the event.<ref name=\"fultonhistory.com\"/> The Electric Tower had been re-rigged with large ropes set up to strangle the elephant, which were inspected by the ASPCA agents to make sure they conformed to what had been agreed.

During her 25 years at Forepaugh, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant and, after killing a spectator in 1902, was sold to Coney Island's [[Sea Lion Park]]. When Sea Lion was leased out at the end of the 1902 season and replaced by [[Luna Park (Coney Island, 1903)|Luna Park]], Topsy was involved in several well-publicized incidents, attributed to the actions of either her drunken handler or the park's new publicity-hungry owners, [[Frederic Thompson]] and [[Elmer \"Skip\" Dundy]].\n\nTheir end-of-the-year plans to hang Topsy at the park in a public spectacle and charge admission were prevented by the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]]. The event was instead limited to invited guests and press only and Thompson and Dundy agreed to use a more sure method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered winch with both poison and electrocution planned for good measure. On January 4, 1903, in front of a small crowd of invited reporters and guests, Topsy was fed poison, electrocuted, and strangled, the electrocution ultimately killing her. Amongst the invited press that day was a crew from the [[Edison Studios|Edison Manufacturing movie company]] who filmed the event. Their film of the electrocution part was released to be viewed in coin-operated [[kinetoscope]]s under the title ''[[Electrocuting an Elephant]]''. It is probably the first filmed death of an animal in history.<ref name=autogenerated2>{{Cite book|last=Daly|first=Michael|title=Topsy: The Startling Story of the Crooked-tailed Elephant, P.T.

In popular culture Thompson and Dundy's killing of Topsy has switched attribution, with claims it was an anti-[[alternating current]] demonstration organized by [[Thomas A. Edison]] during the [[war of the currents]]. Historians point out that Edison was never at Luna Park and the electrocution of Topsy took place ten years after the war of currents.<ref name=Daly>\"Later, some historians would suggest that Edison electrocuted Topsy as part of the War of Currents. But that war had long since been lost and the execution itself and perhaps even the method were arranged by Thompson and Dundy.\"'- Daly, Michael (2013).

At the time Forepaugh Circus was in competition with the [[Barnum & Bailey Circus]] over who had the most and largest elephants. The name \"Topsy\" came from a slave girl character in ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]''.\n\nForepaugh announced to the press in February 1877 that his circus now boasted \"the only baby elephant ever born on American soil\". The elephant trader who sold Topsy to Forepaugh also sold elephants to [[P. T. Barnum]] and tipped Barnum off about the deception. Barnum exposed the hoax publicly and Forepaugh stopped claiming that Topsy was born in America, only advertising that she was the first elephant born outside a tropical zone.\n\nAt maturity, Topsy was {{cvt|10|ft}} high and {{cvt|20|ft}} long, with claims she weighed between {{convert|4|and|6|ST|LT t|abbr=off|sp=us}}. Over the years, Topsy gained a reputation as a \"bad\" elephant. In 1902, another event brought her again to prominence: the killing of spectator James Fielding Blount<ref>originally from Fort Wayne, Indiana and described as a ''circus follower'', maybe trying to get employment at Forepaugh</ref> in [[Brooklyn]], New York, at what was then the Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus. Accounts vary as to what happened but the common story is that on the morning of May 27, 1902, a possibly drunk Blount wandered into the menagerie tent where all the elephants were tied in a line and began teasing them in turn, offering them a bottle of whiskey. He reportedly threw sand in Topsy's face and then burnt the extremely sensitive tip of her trunk with a lit [[cigar]].<ref name=\"topsyReview\">{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424127887324110404578625792096049594|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|title=Book Review: \"Topsy\"|date=August 2, 2013|accessdate=September 15, 2013}}</ref> Topsy threw Blount to the ground with her trunk and then crushed him with her head, knees, or foot. Newspaper reports on Blount's death contained what seem to be exaggerated accounts of Topsy's man-killing past, with claims that she killed up to 12 men, but with more common accounts that, during the 1900 season, she had killed two Forepaugh & Sells Brothers' Circus workers, one in [[Paris, Texas]] and one in [[Waco, Texas]]. Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, could find no record of anyone being killed by an elephant in Waco, and a handler attacked by Topsy in Paris suffered injuries but there is no record of him dying.<ref name=autogenerated2/> The publicity generated by Topsy's man killing brought very large crowds to the circus to see the elephant. In June 1902 during the unloading of Topsy from a train in [[Kingston, New York]], a spectator named Louis Dodero used a stick in his hand to \"tickle\" Topsy behind the ear. Topsy seized Dodero around the waist with her trunk, hoisted him high in the air and threw him back down before being stopped by a handler.<ref name=autogenerated2/> Because of this attack, the owners of Forepaugh & Sell Circus decided to sell Topsy.<ref name=\"samuelhawley.com\">[http://www.samuelhawley.com/topsy.html Samuel Hawley, TOPSY THE CIRCUS ELEPHANT, .samuelhawley.com (research collected for the novel \"Bad Elephant Far Stream\")]</ref>\n\n=== Sea Lion and Luna Park ===\nTopsy was sold in June 1902 to [[Paul Boyton]], owner of Coney Island's [[Sea Lion Park]], and added to the menagerie of animals on display there. The elephant's handler from Forepaugh, William \"Whitey\" Alt,<ref>Various accounts from the period name him as \"Frederic Ault\", \"William Alt\", \"William Alf\" (per:Michael Daly and Samuel Hawley)</ref> came along with Topsy to work at the park. A bad summer season and competition with the nearby [[Steeplechase Park]] made Boyton decide to get out of the amusement park business. At the end of the year he leased Sea Lion Park to Frederick Thompson and Elmer Dundy who proceeded to redevelop it into a much larger attraction and renamed it [[Luna Park, Coney Island (1903)|Luna Park]].<ref name=\"samuelhawley.com\"/> Topsy was used in publicity, moving timbers and even the fanciful airship ''Luna'', part of the amusement ride ''[[A Trip to the Moon (attraction)|A Trip to the Moon]]'', from Steeplechase to Luna Park, characterized in the media as \"penance\" for her rampaging ways.<ref name=\"samuelhawley.com\"/>\n\nDuring the moving of the ''Luna'' in October 1902, handler William Alt was involved in an incident where he stabbed Topsy with a pitchfork trying to get her to pull the amusement ride. When confronted by a police officer, Alt turned Topsy loose from her work harness to run free in the streets, leading to Alt's arrest. The occurrence was attributed to the handler's drinking. In December 1902, a drunk Alt rode Topsy down the town streets of Coney Island and walked, or tried to ride, Topsy into the local police station. Accounts say Topsy tried to batter her way through the station door and \"she set up a terrific trumpeting\", leading the officers to take refuge in the cells. The handler was fired after the incident.\n\n===Death===\n[[File:Topsy elephant electrocution Luna Park, Coney Island January 1903.png|thumb|320px|Topsy, standing in the middle of press photographers and on-lookers, refusing to cross the bridge over the lagoon to the spot where she was supposed to be killed.

On December 13, 1902, Luna Park press agent Charles Murray released a statement to the newspapers that Topsy would be put to death within a few days by electrocution.

Press agent Murray arranged media coverage and posted banners around the park and on all four sides of the makeshift [[gallows]] advertising, \"OPENING MAY 2ND 1903 LUNA PARK $1,000,000 EXPOSITION, THE HEART OF CONEY ISLAND\".\n\nOn hearing Thompson and Dundy's plans, the President of the [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], [[John Peter Haines]], stepped in and forbade hanging as a \"needlessly cruel means of killing [Topsy]\" and also told Thompson and Dundy they could not conduct a public spectacle and charge admission. Thompson and Dundy discussed alternatives with Haines, going over methods used in previous attempts to euthanize elephants including poisoning, but that, as well as a 1901 attempt to electrocute an elephant named Jumbo II two years earlier in [[Buffalo, New York]], were botched.<ref>The poisonings either left the animals in agony or showed little effect and the electricity seemed to show no effect.</ref> After much negotiation, which included Thompson and Dundy trying to give the elephant to the ASPCA, a method of strangling the elephant with large ropes tied to a steam-powered [[winch]] was agreed upon.

The press attention the event had received brought out an estimated 1500 spectators and 100 press photographers as well as agents from the ASPCA to inspect the proceedings. Thompson and Dundy allowed 100 spectators into the park although more climbed through the park fence. Many more were on the balconies and roofs of nearby buildings, which were charging admission to see the event.<ref name=\"fultonhistory.com\"/> The Electric Tower had been re-rigged with large ropes set up to strangle the elephant, which were inspected by the ASPCA agents to make sure they conformed to what had been agreed.

The theme of Topsy's electrocution also appears in songs, in the plot-line of several novels, and in poems such as U.S. poet laureate [[W. S. Merwin]]'s \"The Chain to Her Leg\".<ref>[http://www.globalanimal.org/2011/09/06/read-poem-donated-by-u-s-poet-laureate READ: Poem Donated By U.S. Poet Laureate By Global Animal on September 6, 2011]</ref>\n\nTopsy was the subject of episode 33 in \"Bob's Burgers\", and of the 2018 alternate history story ''[[The Only Harmless Great Thing]]''.\n\n===Association with Thomas Edison===\n[[File:Portrait of Thomas A.

The events surrounding Topsy took place ten years after the end of the \"War\".<ref name=Daly /><ref>[http://edison.rutgers.edu/topsy.htm \"While an Edison motion picture camera crew did film the event it is very unlikely that Edison himself was involved even in determining whether a film should be made. Edison did not run his motion picture business himself.  Contrary to popular myth, the electrocution of Topsy had nothing to do with the battle between AC and DC, which ended with the formation of GE in 1892.\" - rutgers.edu, The Edison Papers, Myth Buster-Topsy the Elephant]</ref> At the time of Topsy's death, Edison was no longer involved in the electric lighting business. He had been forced out of control of his company by its 1892 merger into [[General Electric]] and sold all his stock in GE during the 1890s to finance an iron ore refining venture.<ref>Michael Gelb, Sarah Miller Caldicott, Innovate Like Edison: The Success System of America's Greatest Inventor, Penguin - 2007, page 29</ref> The Brooklyn company that still bore his name mentioned in newspaper reports was a privately owned power company no longer associated with his earlier [[Edison Illuminating Company]].<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/><ref name=\"edison.rutgers.edu\">[http://edison.rutgers.edu/topsy.htm rutgers.edu, The Edison Papers, Myth Buster-Topsy the Elephant]</ref> Edison himself was not present at Luna Park, and it is unclear as to the input he had in Topsy's death or even its filming since the Edison Manufacturing film company made 1200 short films during that period with little guidance from Edison as to what they filmed.<ref name=\"edison.rutgers.edu\"/> Journalist Michael Daly, in his 2013 book on Topsy, surmises that Edison would have been pleased by the proper positioning of the copper plates and that the elephant was killed by the large Westinghouse AC generators at Bay Ridge, but he shows no actual contact or communication between the owners of Luna Park and Edison over Topsy.<ref name=autogenerated2/>\n\nTwo things that may have indelibly linked Thomas Edison with Topsy's death were the primary newspaper sources describing it as being carried out by \"electricians of the Edison Company\u201d (leading to an eventual confusing of the unrelated power company with the man), and the fact that the film of the event (like many Edison films from that period) was credited on screen to \"Thomas A.

The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement revealed that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence.<ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview with Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police.

The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention.

Anyone detained under PSA is not entitled to legal counsel. <ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\nThe board is known for almost always upholding the detention orders passed by executive officials.

The operative provisions of the act are too broad and vague that they end up granting the authorities sweeping powers, at the same time seriously diminishing any real possibility for persons detained to contest the legality of the detention order. <ref name=\"AI India\">{{cite web |title=TYRANNY OF A 'LAWLESS LAW' |url=https://amnesty.org.in/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/Tyranny-of-A-Lawless-Law.pdf |website=Amnesty India |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Section 13 ====\n\nSection 13 of the act, allows the authority to not communicate grounds of detention for up to 5 days, which can be extended to 10 days of detention.<ref name=\"JKPSA\">{{cite web |title=India: Act No. Act No. 6 of 1978, Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act, 1978 |url=https://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b52014.html |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\nArticle 9(2) of the ICCPR provides that anyone arrested has a right to be immediately informed about the grounds of the arrest, which also applies to preventive and administrative detentions.<ref name=\"AR9\">{{cite web |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx |website=OHCHR}}</ref>\n\nAnd at the same time, the Sub-Section 2, allows the authorities to withhold any information that it considers \"to be against public interest\" to disclose, which has been abused many times by the authorities to withhold significant information from the person detained.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \nSuch provisions of non-disclosure are in violation of Article 9(2) of the ICCPR.<ref name=\"AR9\"/>\n\n==== Section 15 ====\n\nUnder Article 9(4) of the ICCPR, every person deprived of their liberty, whether arrested or detained has a right to a judicial review<ref name=\"AR9\"/>, however PSA makes no such provisions and instead an Advisory Board, a non-judicial body appointed by the government on the recommendations of a three-person committee comprising senior state bureaucrats reviews all the orders. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n==== Section 16 ====\n\nDetained persons have the right to communicate with and be represented by a counsel of their choice, however, Section 16 of the Public Safety Act, states that any person against whom a detention order has been made is not entitled to legal counsel with respect to the Advisory Board and its proceedings.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\nSection 16 not only disregards the \"right to communicate with and be represented by counsel of choosing in the determination of criminal charges\" guaranteed by Articles 14(3)(b) and (d) of the [[ICCPR]] but also undermines the right to challenge the legality of detention set out in Article 9(4).<ref name=\"AR9\"/>\n\n==== Section 22 ====\n\nEveryone has a right to a remedy under international human rights law and standards.<ref>{{cite web |title=International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights |url=https://www.ohchr.org/en/professionalinterest/pages/ccpr.aspx |website=OHCHR |accessdate=3 April 2020 |quote=To ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognized are violated shall have an effective remedy, notwithstanding that the violation has been committed by persons acting in an official capacity;}}</ref>\n \nHowever, Section 22 of the Public Safety Act, provides a complete bar on criminal, civil or \u201cany other legal proceedings...against any person for anything done or intended to be done in good faith in pursuance of the provisions of this Act\u201d, thus enabling impunity by  protecting officials even in situations where PSA is abused.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\n\n=== Inconsistency of data ===  \n\nThe data regarding the number of humans detained under PSA throughout the years has been quite inconsistent, with figures widely conflicting with each other.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\nFor example, in January 2018, the J&K government said only 525 persons were detained under PSA in 2016, which was almost half the number quoted by media reports in 2019.<ref name=\"Wire\">{{cite web |title=The Wire |url=https://thewire.in/rights/psa-detentions-kashmir |website=How the Public Safety Act Continues to Haunt Kashmir |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\nThe government also said, 201 persons were booked in 2017, when the official data says that more than double, 410 were booked under PSA.<ref name=\"Wire\"/>\n\nThis can be further seen in the 2011 report by Amnesty International,<ref name=\"Amnesty\">{{cite web |title=A Lawless Law: Detentions under the Jammu and Kashmir Public Safety Act |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/28000/asa200012011en.pdf |accessdate=3 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The detaining authority passes the order of detention on subjective satisfaction\u2026 To prevent misuse of this potentially dangerous power the law of preventive detention has to be strictly construed and meticulous compliance with the procedural safeguards, however technical, is, in our opinion, mandatory and vital.\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rekha vs State Of T.Nadu |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/192877/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==== Lack of SOPs ====\n\nAn RTI application to the J&K Home Department filed by members of the J&K RTI Movement revealed that the State Government of J&K has not made any Rules or Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) under PSA, during the four decades of its existence. <ref name=\"SOP\">{{cite web |title=NO RULES, SOPS FOR ORDERING PREVENTIVE DETENTIONS UNDER J&K PSA |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/no-rules-sops-for-ordering-preventive-detentions-under-jk-psa |website=HRI |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nEvery year the detaining authorities have been issuing hundreds and at times thousands of detention orders without any SOPs to guide them except the reports and dossiers prepared by the J&K Police.<ref name=\"SOP\"/>\n\n\n==== Failure to Scrutinize Evidence ====\n\nIn an interview with Amnesty International, a former District Magistrate said that the Magistrates do not have dedicated assistance available, which could verify and seriously examine the police version, thus the District Magistrate as to necessarily rely on the reports filed by the police. Thus reducing their role to mere rubber stamps.<ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\nAmnesty India observed a common flaw in the detention orders where the detaining authorities reproduced word-for-word the dossier given by the police which contained the allegations against the person detained.<ref name=\"AI India\"/> <br>\nMany such detention orders have been quashed by the High Court, for example in May 2017, a detention was quashed by the High Court, stating among other reasons: \u201cPerusal of grounds of detention would show that it is a verbatim copy of Dossier of Senior Superintendent of Police submitted by him to the Concerned Magistrate.\u201d<ref>{{cite web |title=Bashir Ahmad Mir vs State Of J&K |url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/15456862/ |website=Indian Kanoon |accessdate=4 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n\n\n=== Role of Advisory Boards  ===\n\nSince the PSA does not make any provision for judicial review or any appeal process to detainees, under Section 14 of the PSA<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>, a non- judicial body, Advisory Board is set up to review detention orders and determine whether there is sufficient cause for detention. The Advisory Board examines the case only in the initial stages of the detention. There is no provision in the PSA to appeal against the decision of the Advisory Board.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/> \n\n==== Appointment  ====\n\nAdvisory Board consists of two members and a chairperson, which are appointed by the government. Prior to the Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018,<ref name=\"Ord\"/> the members of the Advisory Board were appointed by the Government in consultation with the Chief Justice of the High Court.<ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\n\nThe ordinance removes the mandatory requirement of consultation with the Chief Justice of the J&K High Court.,<ref name=\"Ord\">{{cite web |title=Jammu & Kashmir (Preventive Detention Laws) Ordinance 2018 |url=http://jklaw.nic.in/pdf/preanative%20decation%20.pdf |website=JK Law Department |accessdate=5 April 2020}}</ref> Now the members \u2013 provided they were not sitting judges \u2013 would be appointed by the government on the recommendations of a 3-person committee made up of senior state bureaucrats.<ref name=\"Ord\"/> Thus enhancing the role that the executive play and reducing the independence of the Advisory Board. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n==== Functioning ====\n\nThe Advisory Board is required to review the grounds of detention and the representation, if any, by the person detained. Anyone detained under PSA is not entitled to legal counsel. <ref name=\"JKPSA\"/>\nThe board is known for almost always upholding the detention orders passed by executive officials. For example, an RTI application<ref name=\"HRIJK\">{{cite web |title=RTI REVEALS ADVISORY BOARD UNDER J&K PUBLIC SAFETY ACT SPENT 75% OF ITS BUDGET UPHOLDING DETENTION ORDERS WHICH J&K HIGH COURT QUASHED LATER ON |url=https://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/blog/rti-reveals-advisory-board-under-jk-public-safety-act-spent-75-of-its-budget-upholding-detention-orders-which-jk-high-court-quashed-later-on |website=HRI |accessdate=6 April 2020}}</ref> filed by two students of the Department of Law, University of Kashmir revealed that the Advisory Board was referred 1004 detention orders by the State Government between April 2016 and mid-December<ref name=\"HRIJK\"/> and it found sufficient cause to uphold the detention order in 99.40% cases, <ref name=\"HRIJK\"/>. <br>\n\nThe J&K High Court quashed more than 81% of the detention orders that the Board upheld earlier in the same period. \nThe RTI also revealed that the Advisory Board spent more than 75% of its total expenditure in 2016-17 to uphold detention orders which were quashed later on by the court.\nIt was observed by Amnesty International was informed that in many cases, detainees refuse to file representations before the Advisory Board, as they see no hope of a proper hearing. <ref name=\"AI India\"/>\n\n===Criticism from Judiciary and Civil Societies  ===\n\nDuring a preventive detention case under PSA in 1982, the [[Supreme Court of India]] said: \"danger looms large that the normal criminal trials and criminal courts set up for administering justice will be substituted by detention laws often described as lawless law\".<ref name=\":9\" />\n\nIndian lawyer and constitutional expert [[A.
