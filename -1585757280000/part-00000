Highways are scarce and present mainly in the east. Airplanes are commonly used in small remote communities and sometimes in the larger cities.\n*[[Vegetation]]: Almost the entire region is covered by [[Amazon Rainforest]], except the state of Tocantins, which has [[savanna]]-like vegetation (''cerrado''). Although most of the native vegetation still remains, the region suffers from critical problems due to the growing [[deforestation]] of the area.\n*Notable characteristics: Presence of the Amazon Rainforest, which is the vegetation dominant in every state but Tocantins. Cities are spread far apart in the region, and it has the lowest population density of the country. There are very few paved highways in the region, as it is almost isolated from the rest of the country. It is also the biggest region of Brazil, being responsible for almost half of the Brazilian territorial extension. Economic growth is above national average (especially in Amazonas and in Tocantins).\n\n==Northeast Region==\n{{main|Northeast Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region Nordeste.svg|right|200px]]\n\n*Area: 1,       561,177&nbsp;km\u00b2 (18.3%)\n*Population: 53,340,945 (30.55 people/km\u00b2; 29%; 2009)\n*GDP: [[Brazilian real|R$]]437 billion / [[US$]]273,1 billion (2009; ~12%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|3rd]])</small>\n*Climate: Hot all the year long.

It has the lowest levels in the country in almost all of the social indicators, being considered the most impoverished region in Brazil. However, has been growing above national average since the start of 21st century, gradually reducing the socio-economic distance to the other regions.\n\n==Mid West Region==\n{{main|Mid West Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region CentroOeste.svg|right|200px]]\n\n*Area: 1,612,007.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 (18.86%)\n*Population: 13,357,154 (7.2 people/km\u00b2; 6.4%)\n*GDP: [[Brazilian real|R$]]279 billion / [[US$]]174,3 billion (2008; 8.3%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|4th]])</small>\n*Climate: Savanna climate (hot, with little precipitation during winter in the northeast and the east; Tropical in the east and in the west; Equatorial in the north; Some temperate climate places in the south).\n*States: [[Goi\u00e1s]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Federal District (Brazil)|Distrito Federal]] (Federal District).\n*Largest Cities: [[Bras\u00edlia]] (national capital) (2,562,963); [[Goi\u00e2nia]] (1,318,148); [[Campo Grande]] (796,252); [[Cuiab\u00e1]] (556,298); [[Aparecida de Goi\u00e2nia]] (442,978); [[An\u00e1polis]] (334,613).\n*Economy: Livestock, Soybeans, tourism.\n*Transport: Highways where they are present (mostly in the center and east regions); transport by rivers is common in the north and in the east; airplanes are used in remote and smaller communities.\n*Vegetation: Mainly savanna-like vegetation, including the [[Pantanal]] ([[Chaco Department|Chaco]], in [[Paraguay]]), flooded areas in the west, equatorial rainforests in the north.\n*Notable characteristics: With a low population density, most of the land in the region is used for grazing instead of agriculture. The region is also the least industrialized in the country, based mainly in food & meat processing.\n\n==Southeast Region==\n{{main|Southeast Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region Sudeste.svg|right|200px]]\n\n* Area: 927,286&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10.85%)\n* Population: 80,303,750 (77.96 people/km\u00b2, 38%)\n* [[GDP]]: [[Brazilian real|R$]]1,629 billion / [[US$]]803 billion (2008; ~49%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|1st]])</small>\n* Climate: Tropical in the northwest (warm, relatively dry in the winter and wet in the summer); Semi-arid in the north; temperate in the south\n* States: [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n* Largest cities: [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (11,037,593); [[Rio de Janeiro]] (6,186,710); [[Belo Horizonte]] (2,452,617); [[Guarulhos]] (1,299,283); [[Campinas]] (1,064,669); [[S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, Rio de Janeiro|S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo]] (991,382); [[Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro|Duque de Caxias]] (872,762); [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]] (865,089); [[S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo]] (810,979); [[Osasco]] (718,646); [[Santo Andr\u00e9]] (673,396); [[Uberl\u00e2ndia]] (634,345); [[Contagem]] (625,393); [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos]] (615,871); [[Sorocaba]] (584,313); [[Ribeir\u00e3o Preto]] (563,107); [[Juiz de Fora]] (526,706); [[Belford Roxo]] (501,544); [[Niter\u00f3i]] (479,384);  [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti]] (469,827); [[Betim]] (441,748); [[Campos dos Goytacazes]] (434,008).\n* Economy: Manufacturing (machinery, electronics, automobiles and aviation), coffee, sugar cane, tourism, petroleum, textiles, energy production (not sufficient, however, to fulfill its demand.) The Southeast is the economic center of Brazil, and most large companies present in Brazil have their headquarters in this region. The economical success of this region is a combination of its 4 states. [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] state is the most developed in the country, it has a population density as high as European Occident, and a HDI [http://www.alunosonline.com.br/geografia/oidhdosestadosbrasileiros.html] comparable to European East. [[Rio de Janeiro]] is the leader in petroleum production (with almost 3/4 of national production) [http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/tecnologias-verdes/quem-sao-os-10-estados-produtores-de-petroleo-no-brasil.shtml]. [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] are placed in the richest mining region in Brazil.\n* Transport: The region is heavily covered by highways, and, to some extent, railways. Railways and rivers are used mainly for freight, and used where they are present. The region also contains several [[airline hub|airport hubs]] which provide many domestic and international air routes.\n* Vegetation: Mainly tropical-like semi-deciduous forests ([[Mata Atl\u00e2ntica]]); semi-arid in the north, with almost no vegetation; [[savannah]]-like vegetation in the west and in the northwest (''[[Cerrado]]''). Very little of the native vegetation still remains (~2%, mostly in parks.)\n* Notable characteristics: The southeast region is the major powerhouse of the Brazilian economy, responsible as it is for 49% of the Brazilian GDP (approximately US$1024 billion in 2010). It is also the most populous region in the country, with more than 80 million people, and contains the two most important metropolitan regions ([[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]), as well as many other large cities (such as [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil|Vit\u00f3ria]], both State capitals, [[Campinas]] and several others.)\n\n==South Region==\n{{main|South Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region Sul.svg|right|200px]]\n\n*'''Area''': 577,214&nbsp;km\u00b2 (6.75%)\n*'''Population''': 25,800,000 (43.46 people/km\u00b2, 12.5%)\n*'''GDP''': [[Brazilian real|R$]]503 billion / [[US$]]313,8 billion (2008; ~15%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|2nd]])</small>\n*Climate: Subtropical by the coast, hot to moderately hot in the summer, mild and very humid winters and temperate by the mountain range, the valleys and the plateaus in the interior, with moderate temperatures in the summer and cold in the winter, with well distributed rainfalls.

Rivers are used when possible.\n*Vegetation: Rainforests along the coast (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica), subtropical semiciduous in the north and west (Arauc\u00e1rias) and prairie-like vegetation in the south ([[Pampas]]). Little native vegetation still remains due to deforestation.\n*Notable characteristics: The South Region of Brazil is historically characterized by its high standard of living, with considerably better social indicators, which include some of the cities with the highest HDI levels in the country, including their capitals. Cities also feature an advanced level of urbanism in comparison with other parts of Brazil. The region is almost the newest in terms of urbanization, it was recently populated by [[Europe]]an [[immigrants]] (almost 19th century immigration and  refugees of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]<nowiki/>s). They have added to the local culture, especially in architecture, cuisine and forms of agriculture. Southern region, however, is not immune from poverty, violence and other social issues, especially in the larger cities, even though in a lower level than poorer areas in the country. The state of Santa Catarina is proportionally the Whitest state in Brazil with over 87% of its population being European. The other Southern states also have the highest percentage rates of [[White Brazilian|European population]].\n\n== Ethnic composition of regions ==\n\nThe composition of regions of Brazil according to autosomal genetic studies focused on the Brazilian population (which has been found to be a complex melting pot of European, African and Native Americans components):\n\nA 2011 autosomal DNA study, with nearly 1000 samples from all over the country (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\"), found a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.<ref name=\"plosone.org\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Pena | first1 = S\u00e9rgio D.

The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific ''American Journal of Human Biology'' by a team of the [[Catholic University of Bras\u00edlia]], show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as colour of skin, eyes and hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies (regardless of census classification).<ref>[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml DNA de brasileiro \u00e9 80% europeu, indica estudo]</ref> Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.\"<ref name=\"pmid19639555\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lins | first1 = T.

Highways are scarce and present mainly in the east. Airplanes are commonly used in small remote communities and sometimes in the larger cities.\n*[[Vegetation]]: Almost the entire region is covered by [[Amazon Rainforest]], except the state of Tocantins, which has [[savanna]]-like vegetation (''cerrado''). Although most of the native vegetation still remains, the region suffers from critical problems due to the growing [[deforestation]] of the area.\n*Notable characteristics: Presence of the Amazon Rainforest, which is the vegetation dominant in every state but Tocantins. Cities are spread far apart in the region, and it has the lowest population density of the country. There are very few paved highways in the region, as it is almost isolated from the rest of the country. It is also the biggest region of Brazil, being responsible for almost half of the Brazilian territorial extension. Economic growth is above national average (especially in Amazonas and in Tocantins).\n\n==Northeast Region==\n{{main|Northeast Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region Nordeste.svg|right|200px]]\n\n*Area: 1,       561,177&nbsp;km\u00b2 (18.3%)\n*Population: 53,340,945 (30.55 people/km\u00b2; 29%; 2009)\n*GDP: [[Brazilian real|R$]]437 billion / [[US$]]273,1 billion (2009; ~12%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|3rd]])</small>\n*Climate: Hot all the year long.

It has the lowest levels in the country in almost all of the social indicators, being considered the most impoverished region in Brazil. However, has been growing above national average since the start of 21st century, gradually reducing the socio-economic distance to the other regions.\n\n==Mid West Region==\n{{main|Mid West Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region CentroOeste.svg|right|200px]]\n\n*Area: 1,612,007.2&nbsp;km\u00b2 (18.86%)\n*Population: 13,357,154 (7.2 people/km\u00b2; 6.4%)\n*GDP: [[Brazilian real|R$]]279 billion / [[US$]]174,3 billion (2008; 8.3%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|4th]])</small>\n*Climate: Savanna climate (hot, with little precipitation during winter in the northeast and the east; Tropical in the east and in the west; Equatorial in the north; Some temperate climate places in the south).\n*States: [[Goi\u00e1s]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Federal District (Brazil)|Distrito Federal]] (Federal District).\n*Largest Cities: [[Bras\u00edlia]] (national capital) (2,562,963); [[Goi\u00e2nia]] (1,318,148); [[Campo Grande]] (796,252); [[Cuiab\u00e1]] (556,298); [[Aparecida de Goi\u00e2nia]] (442,978); [[An\u00e1polis]] (334,613).\n*Economy: Livestock, Soybeans, tourism.\n*Transport: Highways where they are present (mostly in the center and east regions); transport by rivers is common in the north and in the east; airplanes are used in remote and smaller communities.\n*Vegetation: Mainly savanna-like vegetation, including the [[Pantanal]] ([[Chaco Department|Chaco]], in [[Paraguay]]), flooded areas in the west, equatorial rainforests in the north.\n*Notable characteristics: With a low population density, most of the land in the region is used for grazing instead of agriculture. The region is also the least industrialized in the country, based mainly in food & meat processing.\n\n==Southeast Region==\n{{main|Southeast Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region Sudeste.svg|right|200px]]\n\n* Area: 927,286&nbsp;km\u00b2 (10.85%)\n* Population: 80,303,750 (77.96 people/km\u00b2, 38%)\n* [[GDP]]: [[Brazilian real|R$]]1,629 billion / [[US$]]803 billion (2008; ~49%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|1st]])</small>\n* Climate: Tropical in the northwest (warm, relatively dry in the winter and wet in the summer); Semi-arid in the north; temperate in the south\n* States: [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]], [[Minas Gerais]], [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]], [[S\u00e3o Paulo (state)|S\u00e3o Paulo]]\n* Largest cities: [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] (11,037,593); [[Rio de Janeiro]] (6,186,710); [[Belo Horizonte]] (2,452,617); [[Guarulhos]] (1,299,283); [[Campinas]] (1,064,669); [[S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo, Rio de Janeiro|S\u00e3o Gon\u00e7alo]] (991,382); [[Duque de Caxias, Rio de Janeiro|Duque de Caxias]] (872,762); [[Nova Igua\u00e7u]] (865,089); [[S\u00e3o Bernardo do Campo]] (810,979); [[Osasco]] (718,646); [[Santo Andr\u00e9]] (673,396); [[Uberl\u00e2ndia]] (634,345); [[Contagem]] (625,393); [[S\u00e3o Jos\u00e9 dos Campos]] (615,871); [[Sorocaba]] (584,313); [[Ribeir\u00e3o Preto]] (563,107); [[Juiz de Fora]] (526,706); [[Belford Roxo]] (501,544); [[Niter\u00f3i]] (479,384);  [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o de Meriti]] (469,827); [[Betim]] (441,748); [[Campos dos Goytacazes]] (434,008).\n* Economy: Manufacturing (machinery, electronics, automobiles and aviation), coffee, sugar cane, tourism, petroleum, textiles, energy production (not sufficient, however, to fulfill its demand.) The Southeast is the economic center of Brazil, and most large companies present in Brazil have their headquarters in this region. The economical success of this region is a combination of its 4 states. [[S\u00e3o Paulo]] state is the most developed in the country, it has a population density as high as European Occident, and a HDI [http://www.alunosonline.com.br/geografia/oidhdosestadosbrasileiros.html] comparable to European East. [[Rio de Janeiro]] is the leader in petroleum production (with almost 3/4 of national production) [http://info.abril.com.br/noticias/tecnologias-verdes/quem-sao-os-10-estados-produtores-de-petroleo-no-brasil.shtml]. [[Minas Gerais]] and [[Esp\u00edrito Santo]] are placed in the richest mining region in Brazil.\n* Transport: The region is heavily covered by highways, and, to some extent, railways. Railways and rivers are used mainly for freight, and used where they are present. The region also contains several [[airline hub|airport hubs]] which provide many domestic and international air routes.\n* Vegetation: Mainly tropical-like semi-deciduous forests ([[Mata Atl\u00e2ntica]]); semi-arid in the north, with almost no vegetation; [[savannah]]-like vegetation in the west and in the northwest (''[[Cerrado]]''). Very little of the native vegetation still remains (~2%, mostly in parks.)\n* Notable characteristics: The southeast region is the major powerhouse of the Brazilian economy, responsible as it is for 49% of the Brazilian GDP (approximately US$1024 billion in 2010). It is also the most populous region in the country, with more than 80 million people, and contains the two most important metropolitan regions ([[S\u00e3o Paulo]] and [[Rio de Janeiro]]), as well as many other large cities (such as [[Belo Horizonte]], [[Vit\u00f3ria, Brazil|Vit\u00f3ria]], both State capitals, [[Campinas]] and several others.)\n\n==South Region==\n{{main|South Region, Brazil}}\n[[File:Brazil Region Sul.svg|right|200px]]\n\n*'''Area''': 577,214&nbsp;km\u00b2 (6.75%)\n*'''Population''': 25,800,000 (43.46 people/km\u00b2, 12.5%)\n*'''GDP''': [[Brazilian real|R$]]503 billion / [[US$]]313,8 billion (2008; ~15%) <small> ([[Economy of Brazil|2nd]])</small>\n*Climate: Subtropical by the coast, hot to moderately hot in the summer, mild and very humid winters and temperate by the mountain range, the valleys and the plateaus in the interior, with moderate temperatures in the summer and cold in the winter, with well distributed rainfalls.

Rivers are used when possible.\n*Vegetation: Rainforests along the coast (Mata Atl\u00e2ntica), subtropical semiciduous in the north and west (Arauc\u00e1rias) and prairie-like vegetation in the south ([[Pampas]]). Little native vegetation still remains due to deforestation.\n*Notable characteristics: The South Region of Brazil is historically characterized by its high standard of living, with considerably better social indicators, which include some of the cities with the highest HDI levels in the country, including their capitals. Cities also feature an advanced level of urbanism in comparison with other parts of Brazil. The region is almost the newest in terms of urbanization, it was recently populated by [[Europe]]an [[immigrants]] (almost 19th century immigration and  refugees of [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]<nowiki/>s). They have added to the local culture, especially in architecture, cuisine and forms of agriculture. Southern region, however, is not immune from poverty, violence and other social issues, especially in the larger cities, even though in a lower level than poorer areas in the country. The state of Santa Catarina is proportionally the Whitest state in Brazil with over 87% of its population being European. The other Southern states also have the highest percentage rates of [[White Brazilian|European population]].\n\n== Ethnic composition of regions ==\n\nThe composition of regions of Brazil according to autosomal genetic studies focused on the Brazilian population (which has been found to be a complex melting pot of European, African and Native Americans components):\n\nA 2011 autosomal DNA study, with nearly 1000 samples from all over the country (\"whites\", \"pardos\" and \"blacks\"), found a major European contribution, followed by a high African contribution and an important Native American component.<ref name=\"plosone.org\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Pena | first1 = S\u00e9rgio D.

The variation between the regions is small, with the possible exception of the South, where the European contribution reaches nearly 90%. The results, published by the scientific ''American Journal of Human Biology'' by a team of the [[Catholic University of Bras\u00edlia]], show that, in Brazil, physical indicators such as colour of skin, eyes and hair have little to do with the genetic ancestry of each person, which has been shown in previous studies (regardless of census classification).<ref>[http://www1.folha.uol.com.br/folha/ciencia/ult306u633465.shtml DNA de brasileiro \u00e9 80% europeu, indica estudo]</ref> Ancestry informative SNPs can be useful to estimate individual and population biogeographical ancestry. Brazilian population is characterized by a genetic background of three parental populations (European, African, and Brazilian Native Amerindians) with a wide degree and diverse patterns of admixture. In this work we analyzed the information content of 28 ancestry-informative SNPs into multiplexed panels using three parental population sources (African, Amerindian, and European) to infer the genetic admixture in an urban sample of the five Brazilian geopolitical regions. The SNPs assigned apart the parental populations from each other and thus can be applied for ancestry estimation in a three hybrid admixed population. Data was used to infer genetic ancestry in Brazilians with an admixture model. Pairwise estimates of F(st) among the five Brazilian geopolitical regions suggested little genetic differentiation only between the South and the remaining regions. Estimates of ancestry results are consistent with the heterogeneous genetic profile of Brazilian population, with a major contribution of European ancestry (0.771) followed by African (0.143) and Amerindian contributions (0.085). The described multiplexed SNP panels can be useful tool for bioanthropological studies but it can be mainly valuable to control for spurious results in genetic association studies in admixed populations.\"<ref name=\"pmid19639555\">{{Cite journal | last1 = Lins | first1 = T.

Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are [[Inflatable|pneumatically]] inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively.\n\nThe materials of modern pneumatic tires are [[synthetic rubber]], [[natural rubber]], fabric and wire, along with [[carbon black]] and other chemical compounds. They consist of a [[tire tread|tread]] and a body. The tread provides [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] while the body provides containment for a quantity of [[compressed air]]. Before [[rubber]] was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including [[car]]s, [[bicycle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]], and [[aircraft]]. Metal tires are still used on [[locomotive]]s and [[railcar]]s, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some [[caster]]s, [[cart]]s, [[lawn mower|lawnmower]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s.i feel that tires can be limiting to social interaction due to trees.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology and spelling==\nThe word ''tire'' is a short form of ''attire'', from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.<ref>{{OEtymD|tire}}</ref><ref name=\"oed\"/>\n\nThe spelling ''tyre'' does not appear until the 1840s when the English began shrink fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron.

A skilled worker, known as a [[wheelwright]], would cause the tire to expand by heating it in a [[forge]] fire, place it over the wheel and [[quench]] it, causing the metal to contract back to its original size so that it fit tightly on the wheel.\n\nThe first patent for what appears to be a standard pneumatic tire appeared in 1847<ref>( [http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=US5104&F=0&QPN=US5104 see US Patent 5104] )</ref> lodged by the Scottish inventor [[Robert William Thomson]]. However, this never went into production. The first practical pneumatic tire was made in 1888 on May Street, [[Belfast]], by Scots-born [[John Boyd Dunlop]], owner of one of Ireland's most prosperous veterinary practices. It was an effort to prevent the headaches of his 10-year-old son Johnnie, while riding his [[tricycle]] on rough pavements. His doctor, John, later Sir John Fagan, had prescribed cycling as an exercise for the boy, and was a regular visitor. Fagan participated in designing the first pneumatic tires. Cyclist [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tires in 1889, winning the tire's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.<ref name=\"Gold Hume\">[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling \u2013 William Hume, 1938.

They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and also acquired other rights and patents which allowed them some limited protection of their  [[Dunlop Rubber#Pneumatic Tyre|Pneumatic Tyre]] business's position.

The development of this technology hinged on myriad engineering advances, including the [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] of natural rubber using sulfur, as well as by the development of the \"clincher\" rim for holding the tire in place laterally on the wheel rim.\n\n[[Synthetic rubber]]s were invented in the laboratories of [[Bayer]] in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">Werner Obrecht, Jean-Pierre Lambert, Michael Happ, Christiane Oppenheimer-Stix, John Dunn and Ralf Kr\u00fcger \"Rubber, 4.

The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and in the context of off-roading, decreased \"self-cleaning\" ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n''Bias tire'' (or cross ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased [[rolling resistance]] and less control and [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at higher speeds.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n\nA ''belted bias tire'' starts with two or more bias-plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the \"[[Goodyear Polyglas tire|Polyglas]]\" trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass.<ref name=\"pliesandangles\">{{cite journal|date=March 1972|title=Plies and angles - see how they run|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=Plies+and+angles+-+see+how+they+run+Until+1967+U.S.+tiremakers|journal=Popular Mechanics|volume=136|issue=3|page=62|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> The \"belted\" tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires.

They are most commonly used on small vehicles, such as golf carts, and on utility vehicles in situations where the risk of puncture is high, such as on construction equipment. Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations. Solid tires include those used for lawn mowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers. One of the most common applications for solid tires is for material handling equipment (forklifts). Such tires are installed by means of a hydraulic tire press.\n\nSome [[Railway tire|railway wheels]] and other older types of rolling stock are fitted with railway tires in order to prevent the need to replace the entirety of a wheel. The tire, usually made of steel, surrounds the wheel and is primarily held in place by [[interference fit]].\n\nAircraft tires are usually inflated with [[nitrogen]] to minimize expansion and contraction from extreme changes in ambient temperature and pressure experienced during flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/0/55850e6389efba3c8625695b006723a3!OpenDocument#_Section1|title=FAA Airworthiness Directive|accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> Dry nitrogen expands at the same rate as other dry atmospheric gases (normal air is about 80% nitrogen), but common compressed air sources may contain moisture, which increases the expansion rate with temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getnitrogen.org/why/|title=Why Nitrogen|accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> Aircraft tires generally operate at high pressures, up to {{convert|200|psi|bar kPa|lk=on}} for airliners, and even higher for business jets. Tests of airliner aircraft tires have shown that they are able to sustain pressures of maximum {{convert|800|psi|bar kPa}} before bursting. During the tests the tires have to be filled with water, to prevent the test room being blown apart by the energy that would be released by a gas when the tire bursts.\n\nAircraft tires also include [[fusible plug]]s (which are assembled on the inside of the wheels), designed to melt at a certain temperature. Tires often overheat if maximum braking is applied during an aborted takeoff or an [[emergency landing]]. The fuses provide a safer failure mode that prevents tire explosions by deflating in a controlled manner, thus minimizing damage to aircraft and objects in the surrounding environment.\n\nThe requirement that an inert gas, such as nitrogen, be used instead of air for inflation of tires on certain transport category airplanes was prompted by at least three cases in which the oxygen in air-filled tires combined with volatile gases given off by a severely overheated tire and exploded upon reaching [[autoignition temperature]]. The use of an inert gas for tire inflation eliminates the possibility of a tire explosion.<ref>Federal Aviation Administration, Use of Nitrogen or Other Inert Gas for Tire Inflation in Lieu of Air</ref>\n\n== Manufacturing ==\n{{Main|Tire manufacturing}}\nPneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world.

The bead fit is tight to ensure the tire does not shift circumferentially as the wheel rotates. The width of the rim in relationship to the tire is a factor in the handling characteristics of an automobile, because the rim supports the tire's profile.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe ''sidewall'' is that part of the tire, or [[Bicycle tire#Sidewall|bicycle tire]], that bridges between the tread and bead.

The inner tubes are inserted into the tire and inflated to retain air pressure. Large inner tubes can be re-used for other purposes, such as swimming and rafting (see [[swim ring]]), [[tubing (recreation)]], [[sledding]], and [[skitching]].

Tires are checked again in the auto assembly plant or tire retail shop after mounting the tire to the wheel. Assemblies that exhibit excessive imbalance are corrected by applying balance weights to the wheels to counteract the tire/wheel imbalance. An alternative method to tire balancing is the use of internal tire balancing agents. These agents take advantage of centrifugal force and inertia to counteract the tire imbalance.{{citation needed|date = July 2018}} To facilitate proper balancing, most high-performance tire manufacturers place red and yellow marks on the sidewalls to enable the best possible match-mounting of the tire/wheel assembly.

Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as [[tire uniformity]]. Tire uniformity is characterized by [[Radial Force Variation|radial force variation]] (RFV), [[lateral force variation]] (LFV) and [[Tire uniformity#Tangential force variation|tangential force variation]]. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a [[force variation machine]] at the end of the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected.

As the tire rolls, tread enters the contact area and is deformed flat to conform to the roadway. The energy required to make the deformation depends on the inflation pressure, rotating speed, and numerous physical properties of the tire structure, such as spring force and stiffness. Tire makers seek lower rolling resistance tire constructions to improve [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in cars and especially trucks, where rolling resistance accounts for a high proportion of fuel consumption. Pneumatic tires also have a much lower rolling resistance than solid tires.

Poor [[wheel alignment]] can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear to the center of the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for tread wear testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n;Tread wear indicators ('''T.W.I.'''): Raised bars in the tread channels, which indicate that the tread is becoming worn and therefore unsafe.

TWI can also be used to refer to small arrows or icons on the tire sidewall, indicating the location of the raised wear bars.\n;Damage by aging: Tire aging or \"thermo-oxidative degradation\" can be caused by time, ambient and operating temperatures, partial pressure of O2 in a tire, flex fatigue, or construction and compounding characteristics. For example, prolonged UV exposure leads to rubber's chemicals warp, potentially causing dry rot. Various storage methods may slow the aging process, but will not eliminate tire degradation.<ref>{{cite web |last=Kane |first=Sean |title=Tire Aging and Service Life NTSB Tire Safety Symposium |url= https://www.ntsb.gov/news/events/Documents/2014_Tire_Safety_SYM_Panel_4b_Kane.pdf |publisher=NTSB |date=10 December 2014 |accessdate=7 August 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Regulation==\n[[File:Tire_code_-_en.svg|alt=|thumb|Tire identification diagram with [[tire code]]s]]\nAutomotive tires have a variety of identifying markings molded onto the sidewall as a [[tire code]].

[[Front-wheel drive]] vehicles tend to wear the front tires at a greater rate compared to the rear tires. Tire rotation is moving the tires to different car positions, such as front-to-rear, in order to even out the wear, with the objective of extending the life of the tire.<ref name=\"Gilles\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=mNIhYSCBfmUC&pg=PA271&dq=m%2Bs+tire+rating#v=onepage&q=m%2Bs%20tire%20rating&f=false|title=Automotive Chassis: Brakes, Suspension, and Steering|last=Gilles|first=Tim|date=2005|publisher=Thompson Delmar Learning|isbn=9781401856304|location=Santa Barbara|pages=551|language=|author-link=}}</ref>\n*''Alignment''\u2014[[Wheel alignment]] helps prevent wear by having the tire rotate in a direction, other than the path of the vehicle. When mounted on the vehicle, the wheel and tire may not be perfectly aligned to the direction of travel, and therefore may exhibit irregular wear. If the discrepancy in alignment is large, then the irregular wear will become substantial if left uncorrected. Wheel alignment is the procedure for checking and correcting this condition through adjustment of [[Camber angle|camber]], [[Caster angle|caster]] and [[Toe (automotive)|toe]] angles. The adjustment of the angles should be done as per the OEM specifications.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Inflation ===\n[[File:Rolling resistance vs inflation -- NHTSA The Pneumatic Tire.png|thumb|Rolling resistance as a function of tire inflation]]\n\nInflation is key to proper wear and rolling resistance of pneumatic tires. Many vehicles have monitoring systems to assure proper inflation.\n\n*''Specification''\u2014Tires are specified by the vehicle manufacturer with a recommended inflation pressure, which permits safe operation within the specified load rating and vehicle loading. Most tires are stamped with a maximum pressure rating. For passenger vehicles and light trucks, the tires should be inflated to what the vehicle manufacturer recommends, which is usually located on a decal just inside the driver's door or in the vehicle owners handbook. Tires should not generally be inflated to the pressure on the sidewall; this is the maximum pressure, rather than the recommended pressure.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cars.cartalk.com/content/advice/tirepressure.html|title=Car Talk Service Advice: Tire Pressure|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111203160511/http://cars.cartalk.com/content/advice/tirepressure.html|archivedate=2011-12-03|url-status=dead|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>\n*''Ground contact''\u2014The tire contact patch is readily changed by both over- and underinflation. Overinflation may increase the wear on the center contact patch, and underinflation will cause a concave tread, resulting in less center contact, though the overall contact patch will still be larger.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.barrystiretech.com/airortire.html|title=Air or Tire|accessdate=2015-04-15}}</ref> Most modern tires will wear evenly at high tire pressures, but will degrade prematurely if underinflated.

This increases rolling resistance, tire flexing, and friction between the road and tire. Under-inflation can lead to tire overheating, premature tread wear, and tread separation in severe cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/Cars/rules/rulings/TirePresFinal/FEA/TPMS3.html|title=NHTSA test|accessdate=2009-01-16}}</ref>\n*''Monitoring''\u2014[[Tire pressure monitoring system]]s (TPMS) are electronic systems that monitor the tire pressures on individual wheels on a vehicle, and alert the driver when the pressure goes below a warning limit. There are several types of designs to monitor tire pressure. Some actually measure the air pressure, and some make indirect measurements, such as gauging when the relative size of the tire changes due to lower air pressure.\n\n== Hazards ==\n[[File:Tire_bubble.jpg#|thumb|Tire bubble]]\n[[File:Weather-cracked Tire.JPG|thumb|Tire showing weather-cracking over long-term exposure to the weather]]\nTire hazards may occur from failure of the tire, itself, or from loss of traction on the surface over which it is rolling.\n\n=== Failure ===\nTires may fail for any of a variety of reasons, including:<ref>{{Cite book|title=Tire forensic investigation : analyzing tire failure|last=Giapponi, Thomas R.|date=2008|publisher=SAE International|isbn=9780768019551|location=Warrendale, Pa.|oclc=213080702}}</ref>\n\n* ''Belt Separation''\u2014Belt separation may be belt-to-belt, tread and belt, or separation of the edge of the belt. Belt-to-belt separation may occur having the tire deflect too much, from high pavement temperatures, from road hazard impacts and other causes having to do with maintenance and storage. \n* ''Non-Belt Separations''\u2014Non-Belt Separations include those at the tire tread, in the bead area, in the lower sidewall, between reinforcing plies, and of the reinforcing steel or fabric materials.\n* Other\u2014Other types of failure include run-flat damage, chemical degradation, cracking, indentations and bulges\n\n===Loss of traction===\n\n* ''Melting rubber''\u2014As tire rubber compounds heat, owing to the friction of stopping, cornering or accelerating, they may begin to melt, lubricate the tire-road contact area, and become deposited on the pavement. This effect is stronger with increased ambient temperature.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n* ''Hydroplaning''\u2014Motor vehicle or aircraft tires passing over a wet pavement may lose contact contact with sufficient speed or water depth for a given tread design. In this case, the tire contact area is riding on a film of water and loses the friction needed for braking or cornering and begin to ''[[Aquaplaning|hydroplane]]'' (or ''aquaplane''). Hydroplaning may occur as ''dynamic'' hydroplaning where standing water is present with a depth of at least {{Convert|3|mm|in|abbr=|order=flip}} above the texture of the pavement and speed is sustained above a threshold level. It may also occur as ''viscous'' hydroplaning whereby tire rubber melts for a brief interval and causes slippage; this may leave deposits of rubber on the landing portion of a runway.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lrRCWz3f_78C&pg=PA89&dq=aquaplaning+vs+hydroplaning#v=onepage&q=aquaplaning%20vs%20hydroplaning&f=false|title=Aircraft Performance Theory for Pilots|last=Swatton|first=Peter J.|date=2008-04-30|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470693056|location=New York|pages=89\u201391|language=en}}</ref> Dynamic hydroplaning causes decreased friction and contact with increased tire speed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aLgNET9YkS0C&pg=PA287&dq=aquaplaning+vs+hydroplaning#v=onepage&q=aquaplaning%20vs%20hydroplaning&f=false|title=Advanced Vehicle Technology|last=Heisler|first=Heinz|date=2002-07-17|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080493442|language=en}}</ref>\n* ''Snow''\u2014The degree to which a tire can maintain traction in snow depends on its ability to compact snow, which material then develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U_Y5AQAAMAAJ&q=traction+in+mud&dq=traction+in+mud|title=Driving Traction on Ice with All-season and Mud-and-snow Radial Tires|last=Blaisdell|first=George L.|date=1983|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory|language=en}}</ref> At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction. The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation. The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering.<ref name=\"Hays2\"/>\n* ''Ice''\u2014Ice is typically close to its melting point when a tire travels over it. This, combined with a smooth texture, promotes a low coefficient of friction and reduced traction during braking, cornering or acceleration.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n* ''Soft ground''\u2014Soil can become lubricated with water, which reduces its ability to maintain shear strength when a tire tries to apply force in acceleration, braking or cornering. Dry sand also has low shear strength, owing to poor cohesiveness among sand particles.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tyje5iXkGmUC&pg=PA74&dq=traction+in+mud#v=onepage&q=traction%20in%20mud&f=false|title=Four-Wheeler's Bible|last=Allen|first=Jim|date=2009|publisher=MotorBooks International|isbn=9781616730888|language=en}}</ref>\n\n== End of use ==\n{{main|Tire recycling}}\nOnce tires are discarded, they are considered scrap tires. Scrap tires are often re-used for things from bumper car barriers to weights to hold down tarps. Tires are not desired at [[landfills]], due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. Rubber tires are likely to contain some traces of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or other serious [[pollutant]]s, but these are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound they are unlikely to be hazardous unless the tire structure is seriously damaged by fire or strong chemicals.<ref>Liu, H., Mead, J., Stacer, R.

In the past, millions of tires have been discarded into open fields. This creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding. Mosquitoes create a nuisance and may increase the likelihood of spreading disease. It also creates a fire danger, since such a large tire pile is a lot of fuel. Some [[tire fire]]s have burned for months, since water does not adequately penetrate or cool the burning tires. Tires have been known to liquefy, releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even ground water, under extreme heat and temperatures from a fire. The black smoke from a tire fire causes air pollution and is a hazard to down wind properties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe use of scrap tire chips for landscaping has become controversial, due to the leaching of metals and other contaminants from the tire pieces.

Casings with problems such as capped tread, tread separation, irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected. The mold cure method involves the application of raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices. During the curing period, vulcanization takes place and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix. On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves the application of a ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.<ref name=\"Bodziak\" />\n\n=== Recycling ===\nTires can be recycled into, among other things, the hot melt [[asphalt]], typically as [[crumb rubber]] modifier\u2014recycled asphalt pavement (CRM\u2014RAP),<ref>Kandhal PS.

Most tires, such as those for automobiles and bicycles, are [[Inflatable|pneumatically]] inflated structures, which also provide a flexible cushion that absorbs shock as the tire rolls over rough features on the surface. Tires provide a footprint that is designed to match the weight of the vehicle with the bearing strength of the surface that it rolls over by providing a bearing pressure that will not deform the surface excessively.\n\nThe materials of modern pneumatic tires are [[synthetic rubber]], [[natural rubber]], fabric and wire, along with [[carbon black]] and other chemical compounds. They consist of a [[tire tread|tread]] and a body. The tread provides [[Traction (engineering)|traction]] while the body provides containment for a quantity of [[compressed air]]. Before [[rubber]] was developed, the first versions of tires were simply bands of metal fitted around wooden wheels to prevent wear and tear. Early rubber tires were solid (not pneumatic). Pneumatic tires are used on many types of vehicles, including [[car]]s, [[bicycle]]s, [[motorcycle]]s, [[bus]]es, [[truck]]s, [[Heavy equipment (construction)|heavy equipment]], and [[aircraft]]. Metal tires are still used on [[locomotive]]s and [[railcar]]s, and solid rubber (or other polymer) tires are still used in various non-automotive applications, such as some [[caster]]s, [[cart]]s, [[lawn mower|lawnmower]]s, and [[wheelbarrow]]s.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Etymology and spelling==\nThe word ''tire'' is a short form of ''attire'', from the idea that a wheel with a tire is a dressed wheel.<ref>{{OEtymD|tire}}</ref><ref name=\"oed\"/>\n\nThe spelling ''tyre'' does not appear until the 1840s when the English began shrink fitting railway car wheels with malleable iron.

A skilled worker, known as a [[wheelwright]], would cause the tire to expand by heating it in a [[forge]] fire, place it over the wheel and [[quench]] it, causing the metal to contract back to its original size so that it fit tightly on the wheel.\n\nThe first patent for what appears to be a standard pneumatic tire appeared in 1847<ref>( [http://v3.espacenet.com/origdoc?DB=EPODOC&IDX=US5104&F=0&QPN=US5104 see US Patent 5104] )</ref> lodged by the Scottish inventor [[Robert William Thomson]]. However, this never went into production. The first practical pneumatic tire was made in 1888 on May Street, [[Belfast]], by Scots-born [[John Boyd Dunlop]], owner of one of Ireland's most prosperous veterinary practices. It was an effort to prevent the headaches of his 10-year-old son Johnnie, while riding his [[tricycle]] on rough pavements. His doctor, John, later Sir John Fagan, had prescribed cycling as an exercise for the boy, and was a regular visitor. Fagan participated in designing the first pneumatic tires. Cyclist [[Willie Hume]] demonstrated the supremacy of Dunlop's tires in 1889, winning the tire's first-ever races in Ireland and then England.<ref name=\"Gold Hume\">[http://www.thepedalclub.org/archives/goldenbook/u-z/WilliamHume.html The Golden Book of Cycling \u2013 William Hume, 1938.

They employed inventor Charles Kingston Welch and also acquired other rights and patents which allowed them some limited protection of their  [[Dunlop Rubber#Pneumatic Tyre|Pneumatic Tyre]] business's position. Pneumatic Tyre would become Dunlop Rubber and [[Dunlop Tyres]]. The development of this technology hinged on myriad engineering advances, including the [[sulfur vulcanization|vulcanization]] of natural rubber using sulfur, as well as by the development of the \"clincher\" rim for holding the tire in place laterally on the wheel rim.\n\n[[Synthetic rubber]]s were invented in the laboratories of [[Bayer]] in the 1920s.<ref name=\"Ullmann\">Werner Obrecht, Jean-Pierre Lambert, Michael Happ, Christiane Oppenheimer-Stix, John Dunn and Ralf Kr\u00fcger \"Rubber, 4.

The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer tread life, better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and in the context of off-roading, decreased \"self-cleaning\" ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n''Bias tire'' (or cross ply) construction utilizes body ply cords that extend diagonally from bead to bead, usually at angles in the range of 30 to 40 degrees, with successive plies laid at opposing angles forming a crisscross pattern to which the tread is applied. The design allows the entire tire body to flex easily, providing the main advantage of this construction, a smooth ride on rough surfaces. This cushioning characteristic also causes the major disadvantages of a bias tire: increased [[rolling resistance]] and less control and [[traction (engineering)|traction]] at higher speeds.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n\nA ''belted bias tire'' starts with two or more bias-plies to which stabilizer belts are bonded directly beneath the tread. This construction provides smoother ride that is similar to the bias tire, while lessening rolling resistance because the belts increase tread stiffness. The design was introduced by Armstrong, while Goodyear made it popular with the \"[[Goodyear Polyglas tire|Polyglas]]\" trademark tire featuring a polyester carcass with belts of fiberglass.<ref name=\"pliesandangles\">{{cite journal|date=March 1972|title=Plies and angles - see how they run|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LtUDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=Plies+and+angles+-+see+how+they+run+Until+1967+U.S.+tiremakers|journal=Popular Mechanics|volume=136|issue=3|page=62|accessdate=13 March 2014}}</ref> The \"belted\" tire starts two main plies of polyester, rayon, or nylon annealed as in conventional tires, and then placed on top are circumferential belts at different angles that improve performance compared to non-belted bias tires.

They are most commonly used on small vehicles, such as golf carts, and on utility vehicles in situations where the risk of puncture is high, such as on construction equipment. Many tires used in industrial and commercial applications are non-pneumatic, and are manufactured from solid rubber and plastic compounds via molding operations. Solid tires include those used for lawn mowers, skateboards, golf carts, scooters, and many types of light industrial vehicles, carts, and trailers. One of the most common applications for solid tires is for material handling equipment (forklifts). Such tires are installed by means of a hydraulic tire press.\n\nSome [[Railway tire|railway wheels]] and other older types of rolling stock are fitted with railway tires in order to prevent the need to replace the entirety of a wheel. The tire, usually made of steel, surrounds the wheel and is primarily held in place by [[interference fit]].\n\nAircraft tires are usually inflated with [[nitrogen]] to minimize expansion and contraction from extreme changes in ambient temperature and pressure experienced during flight.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rgl.faa.gov/Regulatory_and_Guidance_Library/rgAD.nsf/0/55850e6389efba3c8625695b006723a3!OpenDocument#_Section1|title=FAA Airworthiness Directive|accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> Dry nitrogen expands at the same rate as other dry atmospheric gases (normal air is about 80% nitrogen), but common compressed air sources may contain moisture, which increases the expansion rate with temperature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://getnitrogen.org/why/|title=Why Nitrogen|accessdate=2013-06-15}}</ref> Aircraft tires generally operate at high pressures, up to {{convert|200|psi|bar kPa|lk=on}} for airliners, and even higher for business jets. Tests of airliner aircraft tires have shown that they are able to sustain pressures of maximum {{convert|800|psi|bar kPa}} before bursting. During the tests the tires have to be filled with water, to prevent the test room being blown apart by the energy that would be released by a gas when the tire bursts.\n\nAircraft tires also include [[fusible plug]]s (which are assembled on the inside of the wheels), designed to melt at a certain temperature. Tires often overheat if maximum braking is applied during an aborted takeoff or an [[emergency landing]]. The fuses provide a safer failure mode that prevents tire explosions by deflating in a controlled manner, thus minimizing damage to aircraft and objects in the surrounding environment.\n\nThe requirement that an inert gas, such as nitrogen, be used instead of air for inflation of tires on certain transport category airplanes was prompted by at least three cases in which the oxygen in air-filled tires combined with volatile gases given off by a severely overheated tire and exploded upon reaching [[autoignition temperature]]. The use of an inert gas for tire inflation eliminates the possibility of a tire explosion.<ref>Federal Aviation Administration, Use of Nitrogen or Other Inert Gas for Tire Inflation in Lieu of Air</ref>\n\n== Manufacturing ==\n{{Main|Tire manufacturing}}\nPneumatic tires are manufactured in about 450 tire factories around the world.

They mount directly to the rim, in the case of tubeless tires, or are an integral part of the inner tube.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Most modern passenger vehicles are now required to have a [[Tire-pressure monitoring system|tire pressure monitoring system]] which usually consists of a valve stem attached to an electronic module.<ref name=\":1\"/>\n*''Inner tube''\u2014Most [[bicycle tire]]s, many [[motorcycle tire]]s, and many tires for large vehicles such as buses, heavy trucks, and tractors are designed for use with inner tubes. Inner tubes are [[torus]]-shaped balloons made from an impermeable material, such as soft, elastic synthetic rubber, to prevent air leakage. The inner tubes are inserted into the tire and inflated to retain air pressure. Large inner tubes can be re-used for other purposes, such as swimming and rafting (see [[swim ring]]), [[tubing (recreation)]], [[sledding]], and [[skitching]]. Purpose-built inflatable tori are also manufactured for these uses, offering choice of colors, fabric covering, handles, decks, and other accessories, and eliminating the protruding valve stem.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Performance characteristics==\n[[File:Tire performance envelope.svg|thumb|Tire performance envelope by Goodyear]]\n\nThe interactions of a tire with the pavement are complex.

Tires are checked at the point of manufacture for excessive static imbalance and dynamic imbalance using automatic tire balance machines. Tires are checked again in the auto assembly plant or tire retail shop after mounting the tire to the wheel. Assemblies that exhibit excessive imbalance are corrected by applying balance weights to the wheels to counteract the tire/wheel imbalance. An alternative method to tire balancing is the use of internal tire balancing agents. These agents take advantage of centrifugal force and inertia to counteract the tire imbalance.{{citation needed|date = July 2018}} To facilitate proper balancing, most high-performance tire manufacturers place red and yellow marks on the sidewalls to enable the best possible match-mounting of the tire/wheel assembly.

This area transmits forces between the tire and the road via friction. The length-to-width ratio of the contact patch affects steering and cornering behavior.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n*''Cornering force\u2014''[[Cornering force]] or side force is the lateral (i.e. parallel to the road surface) force produced by a vehicle tire during cornering.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n*''Dry traction''\u2014Dry traction is measure of the tire's ability to deliver traction, or grip, under dry conditions. Dry traction is a function of the tackiness of the rubber compound.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n*''Force variation\u2014''The tire tread and sidewall elements undergo deformation and recovery as they enter and exit the footprint. Since the rubber is elastomeric, it is deformed during this cycle. As the rubber deforms and recovers, it imparts cyclical forces into the vehicle. These variations are collectively referred to as [[tire uniformity]]. Tire uniformity is characterized by [[Radial Force Variation|radial force variation]] (RFV), [[lateral force variation]] (LFV) and [[Tire uniformity#Tangential force variation|tangential force variation]]. Radial and lateral force variation is measured on a [[force variation machine]] at the end of the manufacturing process. Tires outside the specified limits for RFV and LFV are rejected. Geometric parameters, including radial runout, lateral runout, and sidewall bulge, are measured using a tire uniformity machine at the tire factory at the end of the manufacturing process as a quality check.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n*''Rolling resistance''\u2014[[Rolling resistance]] is the resistance to rolling caused by deformation of the tire in contact with the road surface. As the tire rolls, tread enters the contact area and is deformed flat to conform to the roadway. The energy required to make the deformation depends on the inflation pressure, rotating speed, and numerous physical properties of the tire structure, such as spring force and stiffness. Tire makers seek lower rolling resistance tire constructions to improve [[fuel economy in automobiles|fuel economy]] in cars and especially trucks, where rolling resistance accounts for a high proportion of fuel consumption. Pneumatic tires also have a much lower rolling resistance than solid tires. Because the internal air pressure acts in all directions, a pneumatic tire is able to \"absorb\" bumps in the road as it rolls over them without experiencing a reaction force opposite to the direction of travel, as is the case with a solid (or foam-filled) tire.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n*''Self aligning torque\u2014''[[Self aligning torque|Self-aligning torque]], also known as the aligning torque, SAT or Mz, is the [[torque]] that a tire creates as it rolls along that tends to steer it, i.e. rotate it around its vertical axis.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n*''Wet traction\u2014''Wet traction is the tire's [[Traction (engineering)|traction]], or grip, under wet conditions. Wet traction is improved by the tread design's ability to channel water out of the tire footprint and reduce [[Aquaplaning|hydroplaning]]. However, tires with a circular cross-section, such as those found on racing bicycles, when properly inflated have a sufficiently small footprint to not be susceptible to hydroplaning. For such tires, it is observed that fully slick tires will give superior traction on both wet and dry pavement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheldonbrown.com/tires.html|title=Sheldon Brown on tires|last=Brown|first=Sheldon|accessdate=2008-07-01}}</ref>\n\n=== Load ===\n\n*''Load sensitivity\u2014''[[Tire load sensitivity|Load sensitivity]] is the behaviour of tires under load.

Poor [[wheel alignment]] can cause excessive wear of the innermost or outermost ribs. Gravel roads, rocky terrain, and other rough terrain causes accelerated wear. Over-inflation above the sidewall maximum can cause excessive wear to the center of the tread. Modern tires have steel belts built in to prevent this. Under-inflation causes excessive wear to the outer ribs. Unbalanced wheels can cause uneven tire wear, as the rotation may not be perfectly circular. Tire manufacturers and car companies have mutually established standards for tread wear testing that include measurement parameters for tread loss profile, lug count, and heel-toe wear.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n;Tread wear indicators ('''T.W.I.'''): Raised bars in the tread channels, which indicate that the tread is becoming worn and therefore unsafe.

It may also occur as ''viscous'' hydroplaning whereby tire rubber melts for a brief interval and causes slippage; this may leave deposits of rubber on the landing portion of a runway.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lrRCWz3f_78C&pg=PA89&dq=aquaplaning+vs+hydroplaning#v=onepage&q=aquaplaning%20vs%20hydroplaning&f=false|title=Aircraft Performance Theory for Pilots|last=Swatton|first=Peter J.|date=2008-04-30|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9780470693056|location=New York|pages=89\u201391|language=en}}</ref> Dynamic hydroplaning causes decreased friction and contact with increased tire speed.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aLgNET9YkS0C&pg=PA287&dq=aquaplaning+vs+hydroplaning#v=onepage&q=aquaplaning%20vs%20hydroplaning&f=false|title=Advanced Vehicle Technology|last=Heisler|first=Heinz|date=2002-07-17|publisher=Elsevier|isbn=9780080493442|language=en}}</ref>\n* ''Snow''\u2014The degree to which a tire can maintain traction in snow depends on its ability to compact snow, which material then develops strength against slippage along a shear plane parallel to the contact area of the tire on the ground.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=U_Y5AQAAMAAJ&q=traction+in+mud&dq=traction+in+mud|title=Driving Traction on Ice with All-season and Mud-and-snow Radial Tires|last=Blaisdell|first=George L.|date=1983|publisher=US Army Corps of Engineers, Cold Regions Research & Engineering Laboratory|language=en}}</ref> At the same time, the bottom of the tire treads compress the snow on which they are bearing, also creating friction. The process of compacting snow within the treads requires it to be expelled in time for the tread to compact snow anew on the next rotation. The compaction/contact process works both in the direction of travel for propulsion and braking, but also laterally for cornering.<ref name=\"Hays2\"/>\n* ''Ice''\u2014Ice is typically close to its melting point when a tire travels over it. This, combined with a smooth texture, promotes a low coefficient of friction and reduced traction during braking, cornering or acceleration.<ref name=\":0A\" />\n* ''Soft ground''\u2014Soil can become lubricated with water, which reduces its ability to maintain shear strength when a tire tries to apply force in acceleration, braking or cornering.

Scrap tires are often re-used for things from bumper car barriers to weights to hold down tarps. Tires are not desired at [[landfills]], due to their large volumes and 75% void space, which quickly consumes valuable space. Rubber tires are likely to contain some traces of [[Heavy metal (chemistry)|heavy metal]]s or other serious [[pollutant]]s, but these are tightly bonded within the actual rubber compound they are unlikely to be hazardous unless the tire structure is seriously damaged by fire or strong chemicals.<ref>Liu, H., Mead, J., Stacer, R. Chelsea Center For Recycling And Economic Development. (1998).  Environmental Impacts Of Recycling Rubber In Light Fill Applications: Summary & Evaluation Of Existing Literature University of Massachusetts</ref>  Some facilities are permitted to recycle scrap tires through chipping, and processing into new products, or selling the material to licensed power plants for fuel. Some tires may also be retreaded for re-use.\n\n===Environmental issues===\nAmericans generate about 285 million scrap tires per year.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/conserve/materials/tires/tdf.htm|title=Tire-Derived Fuel|publisher=U.S. Environmental Protection Agency|accessdate=2011-12-29}}</ref> Many states have regulations as to the number of scrap tires that can be held on site, due to concerns with dumping, fire hazards, and mosquitoes. In the past, millions of tires have been discarded into open fields. This creates a breeding ground for mosquitoes, since the tires often hold water inside and remain warm enough for mosquito breeding. Mosquitoes create a nuisance and may increase the likelihood of spreading disease. It also creates a fire danger, since such a large tire pile is a lot of fuel. Some [[tire fire]]s have burned for months, since water does not adequately penetrate or cool the burning tires. Tires have been known to liquefy, releasing hydrocarbons and other contaminants to the ground and even ground water, under extreme heat and temperatures from a fire. The black smoke from a tire fire causes air pollution and is a hazard to down wind properties.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nThe use of scrap tire chips for landscaping has become controversial, due to the leaching of metals and other contaminants from the tire pieces.

Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as [[shearography]]<ref>MK Meybodi, I Dobrev, P Klausmeyer, EJ Harrington, C Furlong, \"[http://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=1359093 Investigation of thermomechanical effects of lighting conditions on canvas paintings by laser shearography]\",SPIE Optical Engineering+ Applications, 2012</ref> to locate non-visible damage and embedded [[Road debris|debris]] and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.<ref name=\"Bodziak\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRsHlttaMrMC&pg=PA90|title=Tire Tread and Tire Track Evidence: Recovery and Forensic Examination Practical Aspects of Criminal & Forensic Investigations|last=Bodziak|first=William|publisher=CRC Press|year=2008|isbn=978-1420006827|pages=90}}</ref>\n\nDuring the retreading process, retread technicians must ensure the casing is in the best condition possible to minimize the possibility of a casing failure. Casings with problems such as capped tread, tread separation, irreparable cuts, corroded belts or sidewall damage, or any run-flat or skidded tires, will be rejected. The mold cure method involves the application of raw rubber on the previously buffed and prepared casing, which is later cured in matrices. During the curing period, vulcanization takes place and the raw rubber bonds to the casing, taking the tread shape of the matrix. On the other hand, the pre-cure method involves the application of a ready-made tread band on the buffed and prepared casing, which later is cured in an autoclave so that vulcanization can occur.<ref name=\"Bodziak\" />\n\n=== Recycling ===\nTires can be recycled into, among other things, the hot melt [[asphalt]], typically as [[crumb rubber]] modifier\u2014recycled asphalt pavement (CRM\u2014RAP),<ref>Kandhal PS.

It was released in April 1997 as the [[lead single]] from their debut full length studio album, ''[[Middle of Nowhere (album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'' (1997). The song was nominated for two [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] at the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards]] and is the band's most successful single to date. \"MMMBop\" was a major success worldwide, reaching number one in at least 12 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nThe song was voted the best single of the year in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll, while also topping critics' polls from such media as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', and [[VH1]], and was ranked No. 20 on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\",<ref name=\"greatest90s\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014102610/http://www.vh1.com:80/music/tuner/2013-05-23/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/82/|publisher=[[VH1]]|title=VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s|accessdate=January 27, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014102610/http://www.vh1.com:80/music/tuner/2013-05-23/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/82/|archivedate=January 27, 2015}}</ref> as well as No. 98 on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/vh1s-100-greatest-songs-of-the-past-25-years-20030612-gdgwye.html|title=VH1's '100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years'|date=June 12, 2003|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe song originally appeared on the 1996 independent album ''[[MMMBop (album)|MMMBop]]'' with a slower tempo, but was reworked as an upbeat pop track by hit producers [[The Dust Brothers]].\n\nIn an August 2004 interview with Songfacts, Zac Hanson explained the song's origins:\n\n{{quote|That song started out really as the background part for another song. We were making our first independent album and we were trying to come up with a background part. We started singing a slightly different incarnation of what is now the chorus of \"MMMbop.\" That sort of stuck in our heads and never really worked as a background part, and over a couple of years, that piece really has stuck in our heads and we really crafted the rest of the song - the verses and bridge and so on.\n\nWhat that song talks about is, you've got to hold on to the things that really matter. MMMbop represents a frame of time or the futility of life. Things are going to be gone, whether it's your age and your youth, or maybe the money you have, or whatever it is, and all that's going to be left are the people you've nurtured and have really built to be your backbone and your support system.\n\nThey [the lyrics] weren't inspired by one artist in particular. The first music that we got into was '50s and '60s music. If anything, \"MMMbop\" was inspired by [[The Beach Boys]] and vocal groups of that era - using your voice as almost a [[Doo-Wop]] kind of thing. It was something we almost stumbled upon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/zac_hanson/|title=Zac Hanson: Songwriter Interviews|website=Songfacts|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n==Track listings==\n\"MMMBop\" written by Isaac Hanson, [[Taylor Hanson]] and Zac Hanson.\n\n'''CD single'''\n# \"MMMBop\" (album version) \u2013 4:28\n# \"MMMBop\" (Dust Brothers Mix) \u2013 4:28\n# \"MMMBop\" (Hex Mix) \u2013 3:26\n# \"MMMBop\" (single version) \u2013 4:01\n\n'''US 7\" single'''\n# \"MMMBop\" (LP version) \u2013 4:27\n# \"Where's the Love\" \u2013 4:12\n\n'''US 12\" single'''\n# \"MMMBop\" (Berman Brothers Club Mix) \u2013 5:14\n# \"MMMBop\" (Berman Brothers Club Instrumental) \u2013 5:14\n# \"MMMBop\" (Soulful Club Mix) \u2013 5:27\n# \"MMMBop\" (Berman Brothers Radio Mix) \u2013 3:17\n# \"MMMBop\" (LP version) \u2013 4:27\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997\u20131998)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|4|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|chartid=3267|rowheader=true|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|5|chartid=3232|rowheader=true|accessdate=July 15, 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-06-14.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|work=[[Music & Media]]|page=15|date=June 14, 1997|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|European Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-06-14.pdf|title=Top National Sellers|work=[[Music & Media]]|page=17|date=June 14, 1997|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Finland|4|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|4|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|songid=3461|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-07-19.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|work=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn NR. 222 Vikuna 22.5.

[[Hanson (band)|Hanson]]. It was released in April 1997 as the [[lead single]] from their debut full length studio album, ''[[Middle of Nowhere (album)|Middle of Nowhere]]'' (1997). The song was nominated for two [[Grammy Award|Grammys]] at the [[40th Annual Grammy Awards]] and is the band's most successful single to date. \"MMMBop\" was a major success worldwide, reaching number one in at least 12 countries, including Australia, Canada, Germany, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States.\n\nIt was voted the best single of the year in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' [[Pazz & Jop]] critics poll, while also topping critics' polls from such media as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]'', and [[VH1]], and was ranked No. 20 on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Songs of the 90s\",<ref name=\"greatest90s\">{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014102610/http://www.vh1.com:80/music/tuner/2013-05-23/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/82/|publisher=[[VH1]]|title=VH1: 100 Greatest Songs of the '90s|accessdate=January 27, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014102610/http://www.vh1.com:80/music/tuner/2013-05-23/top-100-songs-of-the-90s/82/|archivedate=January 27, 2015}}</ref> as well as No. 98 on [[VH1]]'s \"100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/vh1s-100-greatest-songs-of-the-past-25-years-20030612-gdgwye.html|title=VH1's '100 Greatest Songs of the Past 25 Years'|date=June 12, 2003|website=The Sydney Morning Herald|language=en|access-date=December 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nThe song originally appeared on the 1996 independent album ''[[MMMBop (album)|MMMBop]]'' with a slower tempo, but was reworked as an upbeat pop track by hit producers [[The Dust Brothers]].\n\nIn an August 2004 interview with Songfacts, Zac Hanson explained the song's origins:\n\n{{quote|That song started out really as the background part for another song. We were making our first independent album and we were trying to come up with a background part. We started singing a slightly different incarnation of what is now the chorus of \"MMMbop.\" That sort of stuck in our heads and never really worked as a background part, and over a couple of years, that piece really has stuck in our heads and we really crafted the rest of the song - the verses and bridge and so on.\n\nWhat that song talks about is, you've got to hold on to the things that really matter. MMMbop represents a frame of time or the futility of life. Things are going to be gone, whether it's your age and your youth, or maybe the money you have, or whatever it is, and all that's going to be left are the people you've nurtured and have really built to be your backbone and your support system.\n\nThey [the lyrics] weren't inspired by one artist in particular. The first music that we got into was '50s and '60s music. If anything, \"MMMbop\" was inspired by [[The Beach Boys]] and vocal groups of that era - using your voice as almost a [[Doo-Wop]] kind of thing. It was something we almost stumbled upon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.songfacts.com/blog/interviews/zac_hanson/|title=Zac Hanson: Songwriter Interviews|website=Songfacts|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}</ref>}}\n\n==Track listings==\n\"MMMBop\" written by Isaac Hanson, [[Taylor Hanson]] and Zac Hanson.\n\n'''CD single'''\n# \"MMMBop\" (album version) \u2013 4:28\n# \"MMMBop\" (Dust Brothers Mix) \u2013 4:28\n# \"MMMBop\" (Hex Mix) \u2013 3:26\n# \"MMMBop\" (single version) \u2013 4:01\n\n'''US 7\" single'''\n# \"MMMBop\" (LP version) \u2013 4:27\n# \"Where's the Love\" \u2013 4:12\n\n'''US 12\" single'''\n# \"MMMBop\" (Berman Brothers Club Mix) \u2013 5:14\n# \"MMMBop\" (Berman Brothers Club Instrumental) \u2013 5:14\n# \"MMMBop\" (Soulful Club Mix) \u2013 5:27\n# \"MMMBop\" (Berman Brothers Radio Mix) \u2013 3:17\n# \"MMMBop\" (LP version) \u2013 4:27\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n!Chart (1997\u20131998)\n!Peak<br>position\n|-\n{{singlechart|Australia|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Austria|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Flanders|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Wallonia|4|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadatopsingles|1|chartid=3267|rowheader=true|accessdate=October 3, 2018}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Canadaadultcontemporary|5|chartid=3232|rowheader=true|accessdate=July 15, 2019}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Denmark ([[IFPI Danmark|IFPI]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-06-14.pdf|title=Eurochart Hot 100 Singles|work=[[Music & Media]]|page=15|date=June 14, 1997|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Europe ([[European Hot 100 Singles|European Hot 100]])<ref>{{cite web|url=https://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-06-14.pdf|title=Top National Sellers|work=[[Music & Media]]|page=17|date=June 14, 1997|accessdate=September 3, 2019}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n{{singlechart|Finland|4|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|France|4|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n{{singlechart|Germany2|1|artist=Hanson|song=MmmBop|songid=3461|rowheader=true}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Hungary ([[Mahasz]])<ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Music-and-Media/90s/1997/MM-1997-07-19.pdf|title=Top 10 Hungary|work=[[Music & Media]]|accessdate=May 6, 2018}}</ref>\n|1\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|Iceland ([[\u00cdslenski listinn|\u00cdslenski Listinn Topp 40]])<ref>{{cite magazine|title=\u00cdslenski Listinn NR. 222 Vikuna 22.5.

It is one of the corporate laboratories of the [[Naval Sea Systems Command]]. NUWC is headquartered in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] and has two major subordinate activities: Division Newport and Division Keyport in [[Keyport, Washington]]. NUWC also controls the [[Fox Island (Rhode Island)|Fox Island]] facility and [[Gould Island (Rhode Island)|Gould Island]]. It employs more than 4,400 civilian and military personnel, with budgets over $1 billion.\n\nThe current entity is composed of many elements of Navy undersea research, particularly acoustics and acoustic systems with weapons research and development history dating to the 19th century. Two major laboratories, in Newport and New London composed the largest elements of what is now Division Newport. Those laboratories were themselves made up of consolidated older laboratories and facilities dating from World War I.\n\n==Early history==\n===Newport, Rhode Island===\n[[Image:Goat Island.jpg|thumb|250px|right|C. 1900, picture of U.S. Torpedo Station on Goat Island]]\n\nIn 1869, the U.S. [[Naval Torpedo Station]] was founded in Newport, Rhode Island on [[Goat Island (Rhode Island)|Goat Island]], the site of [[Fort Wolcott]] which was built in 1702 and served as an Army fort from 1794 to 1835. During the 1890s, Charles Munroe and [[John Bernadou]] worked at Newport, patenting a formulation of [[nitrocellulose]] colloided with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]] which was used as [[smokeless powder]] for naval artillery through the two World Wars.<ref>Davis, Tenney L. (1943). ''The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives''. pp. 296\u2013297.</ref> The Army adopted the Navy formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at [[Picatinny Arsenal]].<ref>Sharpe, Philip B. ''Complete Guide to Handloading'' 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp. 146\u2013149</ref>\n\nA factory was built in 1907 to manufacture [[Torpedo#Wet-heater|steam torpedoes]] for the Navy. The torpedo factory became a major employer in the Newport area, as Rhode Island congressmen protected it from competition. The Torpedo Station designed the Mark VI magnetic influence fuze for torpedoes during the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Naval Weapons of World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=156 and 157|isbn=0-87021-459-4}}</ref> The [[Naval Torpedo Station]] researched and tested underwater weaponry through World Wars I and II, creating additional facilities on [[Rose Island (Rhode Island)|Rose Island]], [[Fox Island (Rhode Island)|Fox Island]], and [[Gould Island (Rhode Island)|Gould Island]]. In 1951, the station on Goat Island was reorganized:\n\n<blockquote>For the next 15 years, it was the Underwater Ordnance Station, and then the Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station until 1970. That year, the Underwater Sound Laboratory from New London, Conn. was combined with the Newport facility to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center or NUSC.  In 1992, the command was reorganized as the Naval Undersea Warfare Center, Division Newport.<ref>[http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:QG7MwfBWkVAJ:www.navsea.navy.mil/nuwc/newport/pressroom/09-15%2520NUWC%2520Newport%2520Celebrates%2520140%2520years.docx+Naval+Undersea+Warfare+Center+founded&cd=2&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us NUWC Press release August 3, 2009]</ref></blockquote>\n\n===New London, Connecticut===\n[[File:Naval Experimental Station, New London, Connecticut (1914-1918).jpg|150px|thumb|right|Pier area, Naval Experimental Station, New London circa 1918.]]\n[[New London, Connecticut]] had been the site of World War I sound research since the establishment of the Naval Experimental Station there as a result of meetings between Navy and the Submarine Signal Company, manufacturer of [[submarine signals]] as navigation aids and active in underwater acoustics since establishment in 1901, the [[Western Electric Company]] and the [[General Electric Company]]. The companies, under naval supervision had established an acoustical research station at East Point, [[Nahant, Massachusetts]]. The Navy, under one of its officers involved in the corporate effort, established the Naval Experimental Station at [[Fort Trumbull]] where physicists and engineers, including scientists from nearby universities, worked under the direction of the Special Board on Antisubmarine Devices.<ref name=Merrill>{{cite book |last=Merrill |first=John |last2=Wyld |first2=Lionel D. |year=1997 |title=Meeting the Submarine Challenge |location= |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |lccn=97203061 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tO53-JeqP5EC&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThough that laboratory had closed with the end of that war the same criteria and some of the same people advising made New London the logical place to site the East Coast laboratory in response to the Chief, [[Bureau of Ships]], now [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] (NAVSEA), April 10, 1941 request to the [[National Defense Research Committee]] to establish both an East and West coast antisubmarine warfare research laboratory. On July 1, 1941 the New London laboratory's establishment got approval with management by [[Columbia University]] for a wide range of antisubmarine warfare work including, passive sonar, ocean acoustics and recording of underwater sounds for that work.<ref name=Merrill/> \n\nIn 1944 the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) directed reorganization of the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London for peacetime operation consolidating the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Underwater Sound Laboratory, which had focused on physics of underwater sound, surface ship sonar and weapons systems,  in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] with the New London laboratory. After recruiting scientists from both efforts the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory was established on March 1, 1945.<ref name=Merrill/>\n\nSignificant accomplishments during [[World War II]] included the development of greatly improved surface ship and submarine sonar systems, acoustic homing [[torpedoes]], [[sonobuoy]]s, and acoustic mines. This work contributed greatly to the success against [[U-boat]]s in the [[Battle of the Atlantic]] and the near-total destruction of the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] and merchant fleets in the [[Pacific War]].<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=srREi-ScbFcC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=Navy+Underwater+Sound+Laboratory&source=bl&ots=rXOExsC7Bo&sig=L_sH3iwY_ewPJl6WXyff_EpJT8Y&hl=en&sa=X&ei=uWdmVJ2HPMvsoATyroHoCQ&ved=0CDgQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&q=Navy%20Underwater%20Sound%20Laboratory&f=false Sherman, Charles H. and Butler, John L., ''Transducers and Arrays for Underwater Sound'', pp. 7\u20138, Springer, 2007] {{ISBN|0-387-32940-4}}.</ref> \n\n==Predecessor organizations==\n[[File:Naval Underwater Systems Center lineage chart.png |150px|thumb|right|Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) lineage chart showing predecessor organizations.]]\n===Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory (NUSL) 1945\u20141970===\nIn July 1945 the Harvard facility's equipment and many of its personnel were moved to the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory, New London.

The Sound Lab's efforts were key to the further development of both submarine and [[anti-submarine warfare]].\n\n===Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) 1970\u20141992===\nOn July 1, 1970 the Naval Material Command independent laboratories, Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London and the Naval Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station (NUWS) at Newport, were administratively combined to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) with headquarters in Newport.\n\nThe Bermuda Research Detachment, formed by NUSL in 1961, became the NUSC Tudor Hill Laboratory, a major field detachment on formation of NUSC in 1970. In July the next year the [[Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center]] (AUTEC) located in the [[Tongue of the ocean]] with the main facility on [[Andros Island]], Bahamas, with a logistics component located at the [[Palm Beach International Airport]] became a detachment of NUSC. Among the smaller facilities and detachments were the underwater ranges at [[Narragansett Bay]] and [[Rhode Island Sound]], field activities at [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake Facility]], New York, Dodge Pond at [[Niantic, Connecticut]], the Central Test and Evaluation Activity (CTEA), Fort Lauderdale, Florida.<ref name=Merrill/><ref name=NUSCB/>\n\nNUSC was the lead laboratory in partnership with eight [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] nations to for the instrumented Azores Fixed Acoustic Range (AFAR) in the [[Azores]] based on [[Santa Maria Island]]. The range features three bottom fixed towers {{cvt|124|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} high by {cvt|43|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} across set approximately in an equalateral triangle. Two towers are receive only and one is transmit and receive. The principle studies are in acoustic propagation, reverberations and ambient noise.<ref name=Merrill/>\n\nMuch of the work involved sonar suites for both submarines and surface vessels; however, other work ranged from improved periscopes, computing, combat control systems, and communications.  Illustrating the wide variety of work are some examples:<ref name=Merrill/>\n\n* NUSC continued work begun by its NUSL predecessor on [[Extremely low frequency|Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)]] radio commendations with submarines proving communication with {{ship|USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|2}} in 1963. That system went operational with first use on an attack submarine with {{ship|USS|Batfish|SSN-681|2}} in 1976 and for ballistic missile submarines with {{ship|USS|Simon Bolivar|SSBN-641|2}} two years later.\n\n* NUSC became the responsible for design of the MARK 113 fire control systems for Polaris/Poseidon ballistic missile submarines after its design proposal for the MARK 113 MOD 9 Conversion Program was chosen over that of the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]]. System development had begun at Newport in 1968 and continued after the formation of NUSC with successful introduction and selection of NUSC for oversight in 1971.\n\n* Beginning in 1970 NUSC began work for the [[Naval Information Warfare Systems Command|Naval Electronics Systems Command]] (NAVELEX) on tactical towed arrays for use by faster surface ships. That work led to NAVELEX sponsorship of research and development of towed surveillance arrays to augment the fixed bottom SOSUS arrays. That work, in cooperation with the NAVELEX Naval Undersea Center (consolidated with Naval Electronics Laboratory Center in 1977 to become [[Naval Ocean Systems Center]] (NOSC)), San Diego, to develop what became the [[Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System]].<ref name=Merrill/>\n\nOn 2 January 1992 a major consolidation of Navy laboratories resulted in NUSC becoming a part of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.<ref name=Merrill/>\n\n===Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) Keyport===\nIn 1992 Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) at Keyport, Washington, became Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Division Keyport. The station originated with realization that the only torpedo facility was on the Atlantic coast as the Navy increasingly began operating in the Pacific following the [[Spanish-American War]]. The Pacific Coast Torpedo Station was established on [[Puget Sound]] in 1914. In 1930 the name was changed to Naval Torpedo Station Keyport and in 1978 to Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station.<ref name=Gundersen>{{cite report |last=Gundersen |first=Charles R. |date=August 1998 |title=The History of the Naval Torpedo Tracking Ranges at Keyport |pages= |location=Keyport, WA |publisher=Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Test & Training Environments Department |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bb4c/14a82a9c88f4283513c88ea484d512571bb8.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pritchett |first=Lloyd |date=January 3, 1992 |title=Keyport Base is a NUWC Now, But Mission's the Same |magazine=Kitsap Sun  |url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1992/01-03/244222_keyport_base_is_a_nuwc_now__but.html |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nKeyport focused on torpedoes and other undersea weapons and in later decades undersea vehicles.

It was headquartered in New York with two field stations. One was at [[Orlando, Florida]]  and the other was at [[Mountain Lakes, New Jersey]]. All activities were transferred to Orlando after the war under the [[Office of Naval Research]].

Those laboratories were themselves made up of consolidated older laboratories and facilities dating from World War I.\n\n==Early history==\n===Newport, Rhode Island===\n[[Image:Goat Island.jpg|thumb|250px|right|C. 1900, picture of U.S. Torpedo Station on Goat Island]]\n\nIn 1869, the U.S. [[Naval Torpedo Station]] was founded in Newport, Rhode Island on [[Goat Island (Rhode Island)|Goat Island]], the site of [[Fort Wolcott]] which was built in 1702 and served as an Army fort from 1794 to 1835. During the 1890s, Charles Munroe and [[John Bernadou]] worked at Newport, patenting a formulation of [[nitrocellulose]] colloided with [[diethyl ether|ether]] and [[ethanol|alcohol]] which was used as [[smokeless powder]] for naval artillery through the two World Wars.<ref>Davis, Tenney L. (1943). ''The Chemistry of Powder & Explosives''. pp. 296\u2013297.</ref> The Army adopted the Navy formulation in 1908 and began manufacture at [[Picatinny Arsenal]].<ref>Sharpe, Philip B. ''Complete Guide to Handloading'' 3rd Edition (1953) Funk & Wagnalls pp. 146\u2013149</ref>\n\nA factory was built in 1907 to manufacture [[Torpedo#Wet-heater|steam torpedoes]] for the Navy. The torpedo factory became a major employer in the Newport area, as Rhode Island congressmen protected it from competition. The Torpedo Station designed the Mark VI magnetic influence fuze for torpedoes during the 1920s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|title=Naval Weapons of World War II|year=1985|publisher=Naval Institute Press|location=Annapolis, MD|pages=156 and 157|isbn=0-87021-459-4}}</ref> The [[Naval Torpedo Station]] researched and tested underwater weaponry through World Wars I and II, creating additional facilities on [[Rose Island (Rhode Island)|Rose Island]], [[Fox Island (Rhode Island)|Fox Island]], and [[Gould Island (Rhode Island)|Gould Island]].

The companies, under naval supervision had established an acoustical research station at East Point, [[Nahant, Massachusetts]]. The Navy, under one of its officers involved in the corporate effort, established the Naval Experimental Station at [[Fort Trumbull]] where physicists and engineers, including scientists from nearby universities, worked under the direction of the Special Board on Antisubmarine Devices.<ref name=Merrill>{{cite book |last=Merrill |first=John |last2=Wyld |first2=Lionel D. |year=1997 |title=Meeting the Submarine Challenge |location= |publisher=United States Department of the Navy |lccn=97203061 |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tO53-JeqP5EC&pg=PR1#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=29 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nThough that laboratory had closed with the end of that war the same criteria and some of the same people advising made New London the logical place to site the East Coast laboratory in response to the Chief, [[Bureau of Ships]], now [[Naval Sea Systems Command]] (NAVSEA), April 10, 1941 request to the [[National Defense Research Committee]] to establish both an East and West coast antisubmarine warfare research laboratory. On July 1, 1941 the New London laboratory's establishment got approval with management by [[Columbia University]] for a wide range of antisubmarine warfare work including, passive sonar, ocean acoustics and recording of underwater sounds for that work.<ref name=Merrill/> \n\nIn 1944 the [[Naval Research Laboratory]] (NRL) directed reorganization of the Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London for peacetime operation consolidating the [[Harvard University|Harvard]] Underwater Sound Laboratory, which had focused on physics of underwater sound, surface ship sonar and weapons systems,  in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] with the New London laboratory. After recruiting scientists from both efforts the new Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory was established on March 1, 1945.<ref name=Merrill/>\n\nSignificant accomplishments during [[World War II]] included the development of greatly improved surface ship and submarine sonar systems, acoustic homing [[torpedoes]], [[sonobuoy]]s, and acoustic mines.

The Sound Lab's efforts were key to the further development of both submarine and [[anti-submarine warfare]].\n\n===Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) 1970\u20141992===\nOn July 1, 1970 the Naval Material Command independent laboratories, Navy Underwater Sound Laboratory at New London and the Naval Underwater Weapons Research and Engineering Station (NUWS) at Newport, were administratively combined to form the Naval Underwater Systems Center (NUSC) with headquarters in Newport.\n\nThe Bermuda Research Detachment, formed by NUSL in 1961, became the NUSC Tudor Hill Laboratory, a major field detachment on formation of NUSC in 1970. In July the next year the [[Atlantic Undersea Test and Evaluation Center]] (AUTEC) located in the [[Tongue of the ocean]] with the main facility on [[Andros Island]], Bahamas, with a logistics component located at the [[Palm Beach International Airport]] became a detachment of NUSC. Among the smaller facilities and detachments were the underwater ranges at [[Narragansett Bay]] and [[Rhode Island Sound]], field activities at [[Seneca Lake (New York)|Seneca Lake Facility]], New York, Dodge Pond at [[Niantic, Connecticut]], the Central Test and Evaluation Activity (CTEA), Fort Lauderdale, Florida.<ref name=Merrill/><ref name=NUSCB/>\n\nNUSC was the lead laboratory in partnership with eight [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO)]] nations to for the instrumented Azores Fixed Acoustic Range (AFAR) in the [[Azores]] based on [[Santa Maria Island]]. The range features three bottom fixed towers {{cvt|124|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} high by {cvt|43|ft|m|1|abbr=on}} across set approximately in an equalateral triangle. Two towers are receive only and one is transmit and receive. The principle studies are in acoustic propagation, reverberations and ambient noise.<ref name=Merrill/>\n\nMuch of the work involved sonar suites for both submarines and surface vessels; however, other work ranged from improved periscopes, computing, combat control systems, and communications.  Illustrating the wide variety of work are some examples:<ref name=Merrill/>\n\n* NUSC continued work begun by its NUSL predecessor on [[Extremely low frequency|Extremely Low Frequency (ELF)]] radio commendations with submarines proving communication with {{ship|USS|Seawolf|SSN-575|2}} in 1963. That system went operational with first use on an attack submarine with {{ship|USS|Batfish|SSN-681|2}} in 1976 and for ballistic missile submarines with {{ship|USS|Simon Bolivar|SSBN-641|2}} two years later.\n\n* NUSC became the responsible for design of the MARK 113 fire control systems for Polaris/Poseidon ballistic missile submarines after its design proposal for the MARK 113 MOD 9 Conversion Program was chosen over that of the [[Naval Ordnance Laboratory]]. System development had begun at Newport in 1968 and continued after the formation of NUSC with successful introduction and selection of NUSC for oversight in 1971.\n\n* Beginning in 1970 NUSC began work for the [[Naval Information Warfare Systems Command|Naval Electronics Systems Command]] (NAVELEX) on tactical towed arrays for use by faster surface ships. That work led to NAVELEX sponsorship of research and development of towed surveillance arrays to augment the fixed bottom SOSUS arrays. That work, in cooperation with the NAVELEX Naval Undersea Center (consolidated with Naval Electronics Laboratory Center in 1977 to become [[Naval Ocean Systems Center]] (NOSC)), San Diego, to develop what became the [[Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System]].<ref name=Merrill/>\n\nOn 2 January 1992 a major consolidation of Navy laboratories resulted in NUSC becoming a part of the Naval Undersea Warfare Center.<ref name=Merrill/>\n\n===Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) Keyport===\nIn 1992 Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station (NUWES) at Keyport, Washington, became Naval Undersea Warfare Center (NUWC), Division Keyport. The station originated with realization that the only torpedo facility was on the Atlantic coast as the Navy increasingly began operating in the Pacific following the [[Spanish-American War]]. The Pacific Coast Torpedo Station was established on [[Puget Sound]] in 1914. In 1930 the name was changed to Naval Torpedo Station Keyport and in 1978 to Naval Undersea Warfare Engineering Station.<ref name=Gundersen>{{cite report |last=Gundersen |first=Charles R. |date=August 1998 |title=The History of the Naval Torpedo Tracking Ranges at Keyport |pages= |location=Keyport, WA |publisher=Naval Undersea Warfare Center Division Keyport, Test & Training Environments Department |url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/bb4c/14a82a9c88f4283513c88ea484d512571bb8.pdf |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Pritchett |first=Lloyd |date=January 3, 1992 |title=Keyport Base is a NUWC Now, But Mission's the Same |magazine=Kitsap Sun  |url=https://products.kitsapsun.com/archive/1992/01-03/244222_keyport_base_is_a_nuwc_now__but.html |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nKeyport focused on torpedoes and other undersea weapons and in later decades undersea vehicles.
