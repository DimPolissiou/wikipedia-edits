Though the Goblin King, Jareth is never said to be a goblin himself, appearing instead as a handsome human.

He uses his crystals to show dreams, and offers a crystal to Sarah as a symbol of her dreams in exchange for her baby brother.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth is also a master of disguise. He can [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into a [[barn owl]], a form in which he appears at both the beginning and the end of the film. In another scene, he disguises himself as a blind [[Begging|beggar]], altering both his appearance and voice.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth also has the ability to reorder time. After Sarah belittles the Labyrinth as being too easy, Jareth moves time forward by three hours so that she has a stricter time limit in which to solve it. Although Sarah spends a total of ten hours in the Underground, when she returns to the human world only a couple of hours have passed.<ref name=\"Film\"/> The notion that Jareth is [[Immortality|immortal]] has been included in [[Jareth#Comic books|comic books based on the film]].\n\n=== Personality ===\nJareth is an mercurial being, prone to sudden changes of mood. He often grows impatient with his goblin subjects, annoyed at their lack of intelligence and having to remind them to laugh whenever he makes a joke. He uses intimidation and threats, such as that of the greatly feared Bog of Eternal Stench, to coerce his subjects into obeying his will. However, he also has a playful and affectionate side which is evident in his interactions with baby Toby. Jareth is highly emotional and often expresses his feelings through singing.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nBowie stated that Jareth is not evil;<ref name=\"Bravo\"/> however, he described the king as spoilt, childish and used to getting his own way.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> \"I think Jareth is, at best, a romantic; but at worst, he's a spoilt child, vain and temperamental \u2014 kind of like a rock 'n' roll star!\" Bowie said. He  added that the king is \"completely [[Infatuation|smitten]]\" by the character Sarah, admiring of her determination and virtue. According to Bowie, Jareth is lonely and longs for companionship, a sentiment which underlies his pleading for Sarah to remain with him in the Underground.<ref name=\"Notes\"/>\n\n[[Brian Henson]] has said that Jareth is emotionally immature and \"locked in a sort of teenage [[sensibility]] ...

Though the Goblin King, Jareth is never said to be a goblin himself, appearing instead as a handsome human.

He uses his crystals to show dreams, and offers a crystal to Sarah as a symbol of her dreams in exchange for her baby brother.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth is also a master of disguise. He can [[Shapeshifting|shapeshift]] into a [[barn owl]], a form in which he appears at both the beginning and the end of the film. In another scene, he disguises himself as a blind [[Begging|beggar]], altering both his appearance and voice.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nJareth also has the ability to reorder time. After Sarah belittles the Labyrinth as being too easy, Jareth moves time forward by three hours so that she has a stricter time limit in which to solve it. Although Sarah spends a total of ten hours in the Underground, when she returns to the human world only a couple of hours have passed.<ref name=\"Film\"/> The notion that Jareth is [[Immortality|immortal]] has been included in [[Jareth#Comic books|comic books based on the film]].\n\n=== Personality ===\nJareth is an mercurial being, prone to sudden changes of mood. He often grows impatient with his goblin subjects, annoyed at their lack of intelligence and having to remind them to laugh whenever he makes a joke. He uses intimidation and threats, such as that of the greatly feared Bog of Eternal Stench, to coerce his subjects into obeying his will. However, he also has a playful and affectionate side which is evident in his interactions with baby Toby. Jareth is highly emotional and often expresses his feelings through singing.<ref name=\"Film\"/>\n\nBowie stated that Jareth is not evil;<ref name=\"Bravo\"/> however, he described the king as spoilt, childish and used to getting his own way.<ref name=\"Inside\"/> \"I think Jareth is, at best, a romantic; but at worst, he's a spoilt child, vain and temperamental \u2014 kind of like a rock 'n' roll star!\" Bowie said. He  added that the king is \"completely [[Infatuation|smitten]]\" by the character Sarah, admiring of her determination and virtue. According to Bowie, Jareth is lonely and longs for companionship, a sentiment which underlies his pleading for Sarah to remain with him in the Underground.<ref name=\"Notes\"/>\n\n[[Brian Henson]] has said that Jareth is emotionally immature and \"locked in a sort of teenage [[sensibility]] ... He\u2019s a little petulant and unpredictable and he's spoiled rotten\".

Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \nalternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\n[[File:Mirror writing2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman mirror ambigram panel depicting the phrase \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (''[[Ali]] is the vicegerent of God'', in Arabic), between 1720 and 1730]]\nMirror writing in [[Islamic calligraphy]] flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the [[Hejaz]]. \n\nThe earliest known non-natural [[Point reflection|rotational]] ambigram dates to [[1893]] by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of [[reversible figure|reversible illustrations]], in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped [[Point_reflection|upside down]]. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 the Dutch-American [[comic]] artist [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams in three consecutive strips of ''The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Verbeek |first1=Gustave |title=The Upside-Down World of Gustave Verbeek |date=2009 |publisher=Sunday Press |isbn=0976888572}}</ref> His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. In ''The Wonderful Cure of the Waterfall'' ({{date|1904-03-13}}) an indian medicine man says 'Big waters would make her very sound', while when flipped the medicine man turns into an Indian woman who says  'punos dery, eay apew poom, serlem big'. Which is explained as, 'poor deary' several foreign words that meant that she would call the 'Serlem Big'. The next comic called ''At the House of the Writing Pig'' ({{date|1904-03-20}}), where two ambigram word [[Speech_balloon|balloons]] are featured.{{clarify|date=April 2020}} The first features an angry pig trying to make the main protagonist leave by showing a sign that says; 'big boy go away, dis am home of mr h hog', up side down it reads 'Boy yew go away. We sip. Home of hog pig.'. The protagonist asks the pig if it wants a big bun, upon which it replies 'Why big buns? Am mad u!', which flips into 'In pew we sang big hym'. Finally in ''The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard'' ({{date|1904 Mar 27}}) there are two more ambigrams. The first turns 'How do you do' into the name of a wizard called 'Opnohopmoy', the second features a squirrel telling the protagonist 'Yes further on' only to inform it that there are 'No serpents here' on his way back. These ambigrams are all relatively simple compared to contemporary designs, but given the constraints that Verbeek had due to the drawing and story they are impressive nevertheless.{{whose quote}} In a 2012 Swedish remake of the book<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ivarsson |first1=Marcus |title=Upp\u00e5ner med lilla Lisen & gamle Muppen |date=2012 |publisher=Epix |isbn=9789170895241}}</ref>, the artist Marcus Ivarsson redraws ''The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard'' in his own style. He removes the squirrel, but keeps the other ambigram. 'How do you do' is replaced by 'Nejnej' (Swedish for no no) and the wizard is now called 'Laulau'.\n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly [[The Strand Magazine|''The Strand'']] published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"[[Curiosities]]\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words.

Some ambigrams feature a relationship between their [[Visual appearance|form]] and their content. Ambigrams usually fall into one of several categories:\n\n; 3-Dimensional : A design where an object is presented that will appear to read several letters or words when viewed from different angles. Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain. Letters are usually overlapped meaning that a word will start partway through another word. Sometimes chain ambigrams are presented in the form of a circle.<ref name=\"John Langdon\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.johnlangdon.net/thoughts/types-of-ambigrams/|title=Types of Ambigrams {{!}} John Langdon|work=John Langdon|access-date=2018-10-17|language=en-US}}</ref> <!-- Please check the website as a reliable source.\nUsed for 13, 14, 16, and 17 -->\n\n; [[Dihedral prime|Dihedral]]: A natural mirror-image ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Figure-ground :A design in which the spaces between the letters of one word form another word.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Fractal : A version of space-filling ambigrams where the tiled word branches from itself and then shrinks in a [[self-similar]] manner, forming a [[fractal]].

Ambigrams that form different words when viewed in the mirror are also known as glass door ambigrams, because they can be printed on a glass door to be read differently when entering or exiting.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Multi-Lingual : An ambigram that can be read one way in one language and another way in a different language. Multi-lingual ambigrams can exist in all of the various styles of ambigrams, with multi-lingual perceptual shift ambigrams being particularly striking. The name '''sinosign''' has been proposed for the case of the shift being between [[Latin script]] and [[Hanzi|Chinese script]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Natural :A natural ambigram is a word that possesses one or more of the above symmetries when written in its natural state, requiring no typographic styling.  For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram. In some fonts, the word \"swims\" forms a natural rotational ambigram.

The words \"CHOICE\" and \"OXIDE\", in all capitals, form natural mirror ambigrams when reflected over a horizontal axis.  The longest such word is CHECKBOOK. The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted. WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym.

Thus, the generated ambigrams are in general of poor quality when compared to hand made ambigrams. \n\nMore sophisticated techniques employ databases of thousands of curves to create complex ambigrams.\n\nA few ambigram generators are [[Free software|free]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeux-et-mathematiques.davalan.org/liens/liens_ambi.html|title=Davalan Ambigram Generator|website=Davalan.org|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://makeambigrams.com/ambigram-generator/|title=The Make Ambigrams Ambigram Generator|website=MakeAmbigrams.com|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trulyscience.com/ambigram-generator/|title=Truly Science Free Ambigram Generator|website=trulyscience|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>, while others are run by [[privately held companies]].\n\n==Other names==\nAmbigrams have also been called, among other things:\n* vertical [[palindrome]]s (1965)<ref>{{cite book|last=Borgmann |first=Dmitri |authorlink=Dmitri Borgmann |title=[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]  |publisher=Scribner |year=1965 |asin=B0007FH4IE|page=27}}</ref>\n* designatures (1979)<ref>OMNI magazine, September 1979, page 143, work of Scott Kim.</ref>\n* inversions (1980)<ref>{{cite book |last=Kim |first=Scott |title=Inversions: Catalogue of Calligraphic Cartwheels |publisher=McGraw-Hill Inc., US |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-034546-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/inversionscatalo00kims }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ambigram Say Yes radial pattern rainbow color - rotation animation.gif|Rotational ambigram, ''Say Yes''\nFile:Vegas ambigram.svg|Rotational ambigram, ''Vegas''\nFile:Ambigram-wiki.svg|Mirror-image ambigram, ''Wiki''\nFile:3d-ambigram.jpg|Three-dimensional ambigram, ''ABC''\nFile:Wave-particle.jpg|Perceptual shift ambigram, [[Wave-particle duality|''Wave'' and ''Particle'']]\nFile:Spinonym neun.JPG|Spinonym, ''[[9 (number)|neun]]'' (German for nine) 9\nFile:Ambigram Two in One.png|Rotational ambigram, ''Two in One''\nFile:Rainbow reflection ambigram.jpg|Mirror ambigrams reading ''Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet'', ''Doug'' (for Douglas Hofstadter, signature)\nFile:Ambigram-8-eight-math-2-1-5-rotation-mirror-basile-morin.gif|Mirror and rotational ambigram of an arithmetic operation illustrating the [[commutative property]], ''2+1+5=8''\nFile:Typism book one ambigram Love Song by Basile Morin.jpg|Mirror ambigram ''Love Song'' in a book\nFile:Ambigram tattoo Stay here written on feet.jpg|Ambigram [[tattoo]] ''Stay here'' written on feet\nFile:Ambigram_tattoo_Texas_Sexy.jpg| Ambigram [[tattoo]] ''[[:en:Texas#Arts|Texas]] / [[:en:Sexual attraction|Sexy]]''\nFile:Wikipedia ambigram font.svg| Ambigram ''Wikipedia''\nFile:ABBA-Logo.svg| Ambigram ''[[ABBA]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Palindrome]]\n* [[Anagram]]\n* [[Mirror writing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Refs are in chronological order -->\n* [[Dmitri Borgmann|Borgmann, Dmitri A.]], ''[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]'', Charles Scribner's Sons (1965)\n* [[Scott Kim|Kim, Scott]], ''Inversions: A Catalog of Calligraphic Cartwheels,'' Byte Books (1981, republished 1996)\n* [[Douglas R.

It is sometimes turned into a mirror ambigram when written in [[capital letters]] with the removal of [[Space (punctuation)|spaces]], and the [[Style (visual arts)#Stylization|stylization]] of the [[letter N]] (\u0376).\n\nThe first [[sator square]] palindrome was found in the ruins of Pompeii, that means it was created before [[Eruption_of_Mount_Vesuvius_in_79_AD|79 AD]].\nA sator square using the [[mirror writing]] for the representation of the letters S and N was carved in a stone wall in [[Opp\u00e8de|Opp\u00e8de]] (France) between the [[Roman Empire]] and the [[Middle Ages]]\n<ref>[https://www.lydieshouse.com/fr/visit-provence/beautiful-villages/menerbes/]</ref>\n\nA [[boustrophedon]] is a type of [[bi-directional text]], mostly seen in ancient manuscripts and other inscriptions. \nEvery other line of writing is flipped or reversed, with reversed letters. Rather than going left-to-right as in modern European languages, or right-to-left as in [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], \nalternate lines in boustrophedon must be read in opposite directions. Also, the individual characters are reversed, or mirrored. It was a common way of writing in stone in [[Ancient Greece]].\n\n[[File:Mirror writing2.jpg|thumb|left|Ottoman mirror ambigram panel depicting the phrase \u0639\u0644\u064a \u0648\u0644\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0644\u0647 (''[[Ali]] is the vicegerent of God'', in Arabic), between 1720 and 1730]]\nMirror writing in [[Islamic calligraphy]] flourished during the early modern period, but its origins may stretch as far back as pre-Islamic mirror-image rock inscriptions in the [[Hejaz]]. \n\nThe earliest known non-natural [[Point reflection|rotational]] ambigram dates to [[1893]] by artist [[Peter Newell]]. Although better known for his children's books and illustrations for Mark Twain and Lewis Carroll, he published two books of [[reversible figure|reversible illustrations]], in which the picture turns into a different image entirely when flipped [[Point_reflection|upside down]]. The last page in his book ''Topsys & Turvys'' contains the phrase THE END, which, when inverted, reads PUZZLE. In ''Topsys & Turvys Number 2'' (1902), Newell ended with a variation on the ambigram in which THE END changes into PUZZLE 2.\n\nIn March 1904 the Dutch-American [[comic]] artist [[Gustave Verbeek]] used ambigrams in three consecutive strips of ''The UpsideDowns of old man Muffaroo and little lady Lovekins''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Verbeek |first1=Gustave |title=The Upside-Down World of Gustave Verbeek |date=2009 |publisher=Sunday Press |isbn=0976888572}}</ref> His comics were [[ambiguous image|ambiguous images]], made in such a way that one could read the 6 panel comic, flip the book and keep reading. In ''The Wonderful Cure of the Waterfall'' ({{date|1904-03-13}}) an indian medicine man says 'Big waters would make her very sound', while when flipped the medicine man turns into an Indian woman who says  'punos dery, eay apew poom, serlem big'. Which is explained as, 'poor deary' several foreign words that meant that she would call the 'Serlem Big'. The next comic called ''At the House of the Writing Pig'' ({{date|1904-03-20}}), where two ambigram word [[Speech_balloon|balloons]] are featured.{{clarify|date=April 2020}} The first features an angry pig trying to make the main protagonist leave by showing a sign that says; 'big boy go away, dis am home of mr h hog', up side down it reads 'Boy yew go away. We sip. Home of hog pig.'. The protagonist asks the pig if it wants a big bun, upon which it replies 'Why big buns? Am mad u!', which flips into 'In pew we sang big hym'. Finally in ''The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard'' ({{date|1904 Mar 27}}) there are two more ambigrams. The first turns 'How do you do' into the name of a wizard called 'Opnohopmoy', the second features a squirrel telling the protagonist 'Yes further on' only to inform it that there are 'No serpents here' on his way back. These ambigrams are all relatively simple compared to contemporary designs, but given the constraints that Verbeek had due to the drawing and story they are impressive nevertheless.{{whose quote}} In a 2012 Swedish remake of the book<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ivarsson |first1=Marcus |title=Upp\u00e5ner med lilla Lisen & gamle Muppen |date=2012 |publisher=Epix |isbn=9789170895241}}</ref>, the artist Marcus Ivarsson redraws ''The Bad Snake and the Good Wizard'' in his own style. He removes the squirrel, but keeps the other ambigram. 'How do you do' is replaced by 'Nejnej' (Swedish for no no) and the wizard is now called 'Laulau'.\n\nFrom June to September 1908, the British monthly [[The Strand Magazine|''The Strand'']] published a series of ambigrams by different people in its \"[[Curiosities]]\" column.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite magazine|last=Newnes|first=George|date=1908|title=Curiosities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=45MkAQAAIAAJ&pg=PA359&lpg=PA359&dq=Possibly+B+is+the+only+letter+of+the+alphabet+that+will+produce+such+an+interesting+anomaly&source=bl&ots=ScGLkirrWp&sig=DY-p5rSxj-fKc1MoJv7_sruTSws&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjXm8vdxJXQAhVGyyYKHbjiCKMQ6AEIIzAB|magazine=The Strand Magazine|issue=36|page=359|doi=|pmid=|access-date=6 November 2016}}</ref> Of particular interest is the fact that all four of the people submitting ambigrams believed them to be a rare property of particular words.

Such designs can be generated using [[constructive solid geometry]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Chain :A design where a word (or sometimes words) are interlinked, forming a repeating chain.

For example, the words \"dollop\", \"suns\" and \"pod\" form natural rotational ambigrams. In Korean,  \uacf0 (bear) and \ubb38 (door) form a natural rotational ambigram.

The word \"TOOTH\", in all capitals, forms a natural mirror ambigram when its letters are stacked vertically and reflected over a vertical axis.  See the article ''[[transformation of text]]'' for a discussion of letter symmetry.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n;Perceptual Shift (Oscillation) :A design with no symmetry but can be read as two different words depending on how the curves of the letters are interpreted.<ref name=\"John Langdon\"/>\n\n; Rotational : A design that presents several instances of words when rotated through a fixed angle.  This is usually 180 degrees, but rotational ambigrams of other angles exist, for example 90 or 45 degrees.  The word spelled out from the alternative direction(s) is often the same, but may be a different word to the initially presented form.  A simple example is the lower-case abbreviation for \"Down\", ''dn'', which looks like the lower-case word ''up'' when rotated 180 degrees.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; [[Strobogrammatic number|Strobogrammatic]]: A natural rotational ambigram consisting of numerical digits.\n\n; Space-Filling : Similar to chain ambigrams, but tile to fill the 2-dimensional plane.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\n; Spinonym : An ambigram in which all the letters are made of the same glyph, possibly rotated and/or inverted. WEB is an example of a word that can easily be made into a spinonym.

A number of books suggest methods for creation (including ''WordPlay''<ref>{{cite book |title=WordPlay |last=Langdon |first=John |publisher=Bantam Press |isbn= 0-593-05569-1}}</ref> and ''Eye Twisters''<ref name=\"Polster\">{{cite book |title=Eye Twisters |last=Polster |first=Burkard |publisher=Constable |isbn=1-84529-629-X|author-link=Burkard Polster}}</ref>). \n\n===Ambigram Generators===\nComputerized methods to automatically create ambigrams have been developed, most function on the simplified principle of mapping a single letter to another single letter. Because of this weakness, most of them can only map a word to itself or to another word that is the same length and do not combine letters. Thus, the generated ambigrams are in general of poor quality when compared to hand made ambigrams. \n\nMore sophisticated techniques employ databases of thousands of curves to create complex ambigrams.\n\nA few ambigram generators are [[Free software|free]] <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://jeux-et-mathematiques.davalan.org/liens/liens_ambi.html|title=Davalan Ambigram Generator|website=Davalan.org|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://makeambigrams.com/ambigram-generator/|title=The Make Ambigrams Ambigram Generator|website=MakeAmbigrams.com|url-status=live|access-date=1 April 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://trulyscience.com/ambigram-generator/|title=Truly Science Free Ambigram Generator|website=trulyscience|access-date=2 April 2020}}</ref>, while others are run by [[privately held companies]].\n\n==Other names==\nAmbigrams have also been called, among other things:\n* vertical [[palindrome]]s (1965)<ref>{{cite book|last=Borgmann |first=Dmitri |authorlink=Dmitri Borgmann |title=[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]  |publisher=Scribner |year=1965 |asin=B0007FH4IE|page=27}}</ref>\n* designatures (1979)<ref>OMNI magazine, September 1979, page 143, work of Scott Kim.</ref>\n* inversions (1980)<ref>{{cite book |last=Kim |first=Scott |title=Inversions: Catalogue of Calligraphic Cartwheels |publisher=McGraw-Hill Inc., US |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-034546-5 |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/inversionscatalo00kims }}</ref>\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Ambigram Say Yes radial pattern rainbow color - rotation animation.gif|Rotational ambigram, ''Say Yes''\nFile:Vegas ambigram.svg|Rotational ambigram, ''Vegas''\nFile:Ambigram-wiki.svg|Mirror-image ambigram, ''Wiki''\nFile:3d-ambigram.jpg|Three-dimensional ambigram, ''ABC''\nFile:Wave-particle.jpg|Perceptual shift ambigram, [[Wave-particle duality|''Wave'' and ''Particle'']]\nFile:Spinonym neun.JPG|Spinonym, ''[[9 (number)|neun]]'' (German for nine) 9\nFile:Ambigram Two in One.png|Rotational ambigram, ''Two in One''\nFile:Rainbow reflection ambigram.jpg|Mirror ambigrams reading ''Red, Orange, Yellow, Green, Blue, Indigo, Violet'', ''Doug'' (for Douglas Hofstadter, signature)\nFile:Ambigram-8-eight-math-2-1-5-rotation-mirror-basile-morin.gif|Mirror and rotational ambigram of an arithmetic operation illustrating the [[commutative property]], ''2+1+5=8''\nFile:Typism book one ambigram Love Song by Basile Morin.jpg|Mirror ambigram ''Love Song'' in a book\nFile:Ambigram tattoo Stay here written on feet.jpg|Ambigram [[tattoo]] ''Stay here'' written on feet\nFile:Ambigram_tattoo_Texas_Sexy.jpg| Ambigram [[tattoo]] ''[[:en:Texas#Arts|Texas]] / [[:en:Sexual attraction|Sexy]]''\nFile:Wikipedia ambigram font.svg| Ambigram ''Wikipedia''\nFile:ABBA-Logo.svg| Ambigram ''[[ABBA]]''\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Palindrome]]\n* [[Anagram]]\n* [[Mirror writing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|25em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n<!-- Refs are in chronological order -->\n* [[Dmitri Borgmann|Borgmann, Dmitri A.]], ''[[Language on Vacation: An Olio of Orthographical Oddities]]'', Charles Scribner's Sons (1965)\n* [[Scott Kim|Kim, Scott]], ''Inversions: A Catalog of Calligraphic Cartwheels,'' Byte Books (1981, republished 1996)\n* [[Douglas R.
