This was in part due to her intentionally humorous singing style, which involved her singing in a deadpan manner, with no facial expressions and very little movement\u2013 reportedly she stumbled upon this \"gimmick\" by accident during a stage show when she became virtually paralyzed with [[glossophobia|stage fright]] before singing a number in the Los Angeles stage production ''[[Meet the People]]''. The audience found the performance to be hilarious and she was soon hired to repeat this performance in a number of movies beginning in 1940, for which she gained the nicknames \"Frozen Face\" and \"Miss Ice Glacier\" amongst others. When she was not singing, her acting style was just as emotive as other actresses, and she did not always employ her gimmick when singing, as evidenced by her performance in the excerpt from ''[[Show Boat]]'' in the 1946 film ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''. She made her Broadway debut in the short-lived musical ''[[Keep Off The Grass]]'' with Jimmy Durante and recorded four of the songs for Columbia Records. She also recorded several sides for [[Decca Records]], including two of her signature songs \u2013 \"[[The Wild, Wild West (song)|The Wild, Wild West]]\" and \"[[Say We're Sweethearts Again]].\"\n\nAmong the films she appeared in during her time at MGM were ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941) with the [[Marx Brothers]], ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]'' (1941), ''[[Ship Ahoy]]'' (1942) with [[Eleanor Powell]] and [[Red Skelton]], ''[[Thousands Cheer]]'' (in which she endured ribbing from [[Mickey Rooney]] about her singing style), ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|Du Barry Was a Lady]]'' (with Skelton and [[Lucille Ball]]), the film version of ''[[Meet the People]]'' with [[Dick Powell]], ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (with [[Judy Garland]]), and ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]].'' After appearing once again with Red Skelton in 1947's ''[[Merton of the Movies (1947 film)|Merton of the Movies]]'' and after a guest appearance the following year in the short, ''[[Musical Merry-Go-Round]],'' O'Brien was suddenly dropped from her MGM film contract, and she moved into television and back to live performances.\n\nShe made two film appearances after this: ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' (1955) and a brief appearance in the 1976 [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]] comedy, ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]].'' She was among the stars in a 1972 nostalgia revue entitled ''[[The Big Show of 1928]]'' with [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Cass Daley]], [[Beatrice Kay]], and [[Sally Rand]], which toured the country and played New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. In 1984 she created a cabaret act, \"Virginia O'Brien Salutes the Great MGM Musicals,\" which was recorded at the Masquer's Club in Hollywood, and is currently available on CD and on [[iTunes]].

This was in part due to her intentionally humorous singing style, which involved her singing in a deadpan manner, with no facial expressions and very little movement\u2013 reportedly she stumbled upon this \"gimmick\" by accident during a stage show when she became virtually paralyzed with [[glossophobia|stage fright]] before singing a number in the Los Angeles stage production ''[[Meet the People]]''. The audience found the performance to be hilarious and she was soon hired to repeat this performance in a number of movies beginning in 1940, for which she gained the nicknames \"Frozen Face\" and \"Miss Ice Glacier\" amongst others. When she was not singing, her acting style was just as emotive as other actresses, and she did not always employ her gimmick when singing, as evidenced by her performance in the excerpt from ''[[Show Boat]]'' in the 1946 film ''[[Till the Clouds Roll By]]''. She made her Broadway debut in the short-lived musical ''[[Keep Off The Grass]]'' with Jimmy Durante and recorded four of the songs for Columbia Records. She also recorded several sides for [[Decca Records]], including two of her signature songs \u2013 \"[[The Wild, Wild West (song)|The Wild, Wild West]]\" and \"[[Say We're Sweethearts Again]].\"\n\nAmong the films she appeared in during her time at MGM were ''[[The Big Store]]'' (1941) with the [[Marx Brothers]], ''[[Lady Be Good (1941 film)|Lady Be Good]]'' (1941), ''[[Ship Ahoy]]'' (1942) with [[Eleanor Powell]] and [[Red Skelton]], ''[[Thousands Cheer]]'' (in which she endured ribbing from [[Mickey Rooney]] about her singing style), ''[[DuBarry Was a Lady (film)|Du Barry Was a Lady]]'' (with Skelton and [[Lucille Ball]]), the film version of ''[[Meet the People]]'' with [[Dick Powell]], ''[[The Harvey Girls]]'' (with [[Judy Garland]]), and ''[[Ziegfeld Follies (film)|Ziegfeld Follies]].'' After appearing once again with Red Skelton in 1947's ''[[Merton of the Movies (1947 film)|Merton of the Movies]]'' and after a guest appearance the following year in the short, ''[[Musical Merry-Go-Round]],'' O'Brien was suddenly dropped from her MGM film contract, and she moved into television and back to live performances.\n\nShe made two film appearances after this: ''[[Francis in the Navy]]'' (1955) and a brief appearance in the 1976 [[List of assets owned by Disney#Studio Entertainment|Walt Disney Studios]] comedy, ''[[Gus (1976 film)|Gus]].'' She was among the stars in a 1972 nostalgia revue entitled [[The Big Show of 1928]] with [[Allan Jones (actor)|Allan Jones]], [[Cass Daley]], [[Beatrice Kay]], and [[Sally Rand]], which toured the country and played New York's [[Madison Square Garden]]. In 1984 she created a cabaret act, \"Virginia O'Brien Salutes the Great MGM Musicals,\" which was recorded at the Masquer's Club in Hollywood, and is currently available on CD and on [[iTunes]]. She performed several times at such clubs as Hollywood's [[Roosevelt Hotel (Hollywood)|Roosevelt Hotel]] Cinegrill, the Vine St. Bar and Grill, and the Gardenia, as well as the Plush Room in San Francisco.\n\nShe continued to perform well into the 1990s with both her one-woman show and a production of ''[[Show Boat]],'' co-starring [[Alan Young]], and also headlined [[The Fabulous Palm Springs Follies]].\n\nShe died aged 81 in [[Woodland Hills, Los Angeles|Woodland Hills, California]], from natural causes.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7-DgDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA557&lpg=PA557&dq=virginia+o'brien+burial+site+scott+wilson&source=bl&ots=6VQKKBts2I&sig=ACfU3U2gHB4l3zS7KOBcF0QTXWOgAXbAbg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwip0tSf0d3kAhVHRa0KHcutAQoQ6AEwFXoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=virginia+o'brien+burial+site+scott+wilson&f=false|title=Resting Places: The Burial Sites of More Than 14,000 Famous Persons, 3d ed.|first=Scott|last=Wilson|date=August 17, 2016|publisher=McFarland|via=Google Books}}</ref> She is buried at the [[Forest Lawn Memorial Park (Glendale)|Forest Lawn Memorial Park]] in [[Glendale, California]].<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nO'Brien was a registered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] and was supportive of [[Dwight Eisenhower]]'s campaign during the [[1952 United States presidential election|1952 presidential election]].<ref>''Motion Picture and Television Magazine'', November 1952, page 34, Ideal Publishers</ref> She also adhered to [[Catholicism]].<ref>Morning News, January 10, 1948, ''Who Was Who in America'' (Vol. 2).</ref>\n\n==Filmography==\n{| border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; background: #f9f9f9; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 90%;\"\n|-style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\"\n!

They are most famous for their 1989 debut album ''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' and the two singles from it; \"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" and \"I Wanna Be with You\". The band broke up in 1991 but reformed in 1995, releasing several new records since that time, and continue to the present.\n\n==History==\n\nAfter rehearsing and playing a few shows on the Sunset Strip, Pretty Boy Floyd got their big break at [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Records]]. Their debut album named ''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' was released in 1989 and produced by producer [[Howard Benson]].\n\nTwo singles, and accompanying promotional videos were released from the album; \"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" and \"I Wanna Be with You\", which gained rotation on [[MTV]].  They were also having success in Europe at the time, by being the cover subject of [[hard rock]] magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' on December 16, 1989.\n\nPretty Boy Floyd became embroiled in a dispute over the [[copyright]] of their band name, with a Canadian band, also called [[Pretty Boy Floyd (Canadian band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]]. The Canadian group released their debut ''Bullets and Lipstik'' the same year, but after a negotiated settlement agreed to surrender use of the name.\n\nTheir music featured on two film [[soundtrack]]s, first the demo version of \"48 Hours\" was included on the 1989 film ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]''. Two years later the previously unreleased \"Slam Dunk\" was released on the [[Ellen Barkin]] movie ''[[Switch (1991 film)|Switch]]'' soundtrack. However, by that time MCA Records had dropped the band.\n\nBy late 1995 Pretty Boy Floyd had reformed. They recorded a five-song EP, ''[[A Tale of Sex, Designer Drugs, and the Death of Rock n' Roll]]'', in 1998. The band featured former [[Big Bang Babies]] guitarist [[Keri Kelli]], Steve Summers (Steven Podwalski), Kristy Majors (Chris Maggiore, Jr.), and Kari Kane (Cary Ayers).\n\nIn February 2006 they toured the United States and then broke up again. Majors released ''Sex, Drugs 'N' Rock N Roll'' and toured Europe in March 2007. On March 1, 2008, Majors and Kane joined Summers to play on stage at The Knitting Factory in Hollywood, California. In 2009, the band celebrated their 20th anniversary of the release of ''Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz'' with a world tour. Troy Patrick Farrell was hired as the drummer, and Criss 6 of Los Angeles-based M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce tribute band ''True 2 Crue'' was hired as the new bassist.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130514 | title= PRETTY BOY FLOYD To Release New Album, Covers CD, Live DVD|last= Blabbermouth.net |first= |date=November 17, 2009|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOriginal bassist, Vinnie Chas (Charles Pusateri) died on April 5, 2010 from heart failure.<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club January to June 2010 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref> Kari Kane (Cary Ayers) has worked as a special effects make-up artist since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3130442/|title=Cary Ayers|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, they announced a new album of original material and a tour to support the album. The band has also announced that Ben Graves formerly of [[Murderdolls]] and has been hired as the new drummer. They set out on the \"America Rocks Tour\" with Jack Russell's Great White, [[Faster Pussycat]] and [[Lillian Axe]] on June 15, 2012. During the tour, Majors and Summers got into an argument and the band ended up quitting the tour early. In April 2014 Majors announced his new band, \"Kristy Majors and the Thrill Kills\", which consisted of two previous members of Pretty Boy Floyd: JK Famous on bass and Ben Graves on drums. The band released one album and one music video.\n\nSummers kept busy by doing an album for the band Shameless as well as doing some solo shows worldwide.\n\nIn July 2015, Steve Summers and Kristy Majors announced they would reunite together and were in the process of finishing their album. The new version of the band included JK Famous on bass and Tod \"T\" Burr on drums.

They are most famous for their 1989 debut album ''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' and the two singles from it; \"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" and \"I Wanna Be with You\". The band broke up in 1991 but reformed in 1995, releasing several new records since that time, and continue to the present.\n\n==History==\n\nAfter rehearsing and playing a few shows on the Sunset Strip, Pretty Boy Floyd got their big break at [[Music Corporation of America|MCA Records]]. Their debut album named ''[[Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz]]'' was released in 1989 and produced by producer [[Howard Benson]].\n\nTwo singles, and accompanying promotional videos were released from the album; \"Rock and Roll (Is Gonna Set the Night on Fire)\" and \"I Wanna Be with You\", which gained rotation on [[MTV]].  They were also having success in Europe at the time, by being the cover subject of [[hard rock]] magazine ''[[Kerrang!]]'' on December 16, 1989.\n\nPretty Boy Floyd became embroiled in a dispute over the [[copyright]] of their band name, with a Canadian band, also called [[Pretty Boy Floyd (Canadian band)|Pretty Boy Floyd]]. The Canadian group released their debut ''Bullets and Lipstik'' the same year, but after a negotiated settlement agreed to surrender use of the name.\n\nTheir music featured on two film [[soundtrack]]s, first the demo version of \"48 Hours\" was included on the 1989 film ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]''. Two years later the previously unreleased \"Slam Dunk\" was released on the [[Ellen Barkin]] movie ''[[Switch (1991 film)|Switch]]'' soundtrack. However, by that time MCA Records had dropped the band.\n\nBy late 1995 Pretty Boy Floyd had reformed. They recorded a five-song EP, ''[[A Tale of Sex, Designer Drugs, and the Death of Rock n' Roll]]'', in 1998. The band featured former [[Big Bang Babies]] guitarist [[Keri Kelli]], Steve Summers (Steven Podwalski), Kristy Majors (Chris Maggiore, Jr.), and Kari Kane (Cary Ayers).\n\nIn February 2006 they toured the United States and then broke up again. Majors released ''Sex, Drugs 'N' Rock N Roll'' and toured Europe in March 2007. On March 1, 2008, Majors and Kane joined Summers to play on stage at The Knitting Factory in Hollywood, California. In 2009, the band celebrated their 20th anniversary of the release of ''Leather Boyz with Electric Toyz'' with a world tour. Troy Patrick Farrell was hired as the drummer, and Criss 6 of Los Angeles-based M\u00f6tley Cr\u00fce tribute band ''True 2 Crue'' was hired as the new bassist.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=130514 | title= PRETTY BOY FLOYD To Release New Album, Covers CD, Live DVD|last= Blabbermouth.net |first= |date=November 17, 2009|work=[[Blabbermouth.net]]|accessdate=June 13, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOriginal bassist, Vinnie Chas (Charles Pusateri) died on April 5, 2010 from heart failure.<ref name=\"Dead\">{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010.html |title=The Dead Rock Stars Club January to June 2010 |publisher=Thedeadrockstarsclub.com |date= |accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref> Kari Kane (Cary Ayers) has worked as a special effects make-up artist since 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm3130442/|title=Cary Ayers|publisher=IMDb.com|accessdate=December 23, 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2011, they announced a new album of original material and a tour to support the album. The band has also announced that Ben Graves formerly of [[Murderdolls]] and has been hired as the new drummer. They set out on the \"America Rocks Tour\" with Jack Russell's Great White, [[Faster Pussycat]] and [[Lillian Axe]] on June 15, 2012. During the tour, Majors and Summers got into an argument and the band ended up quitting the tour early. In April 2014 Majors announced his new band, \"Kristy Majors and the Thrill Kills\", which consisted of two previous members of Pretty Boy Floyd: JK Famous on bass and Ben Graves on drums. The band released one album and one music video.\n\nSummers kept busy by doing an album for the band Shameless as well as doing some solo shows worldwide.\n\nIn July 2015, Steve Summers and Kristy Majors announced they would reunite together and were in the process of finishing their album. The new version of the band included JK Famous on bass and Tod \"T\" Burr on drums. The band debuted at the Cathouse Live 30th Anniversary Festival in Irvine, California, and had a string of shows to follow. The band continued to tour through 2016 and were awarded at the Hair Metal Awards show in Las Vegas alongside Scorpions and Twisted Sister.

Anschuetz gave the violin to her daughter-in-law, [[Estonia]]n violinist Evi Liivak, and upon her death in 1996, Liivak's husband, Richard Anschuetz, took possession of the instrument.  After Anschuetz moved to the [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]] area, the violin was stored in a local bank vault.  Upon Anschuetz' death in February 2008,  ownership of the violin passed to an anonymous family member, who lent the ''Lipinski'' to [[Milwaukee Symphony Orchestra]] [[concertmaster]] [[Frank Almond]].<ref name=\"jso20080906\">{{cite news | author=Tom Strini | title=Encore for a Stradivarius | date=2008-09-06 | url=http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=791756 | work=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel | accessdate=2008-09-06 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910050332/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=791756 | archivedate=2008-09-10 }}</ref>\n\n===2014 theft===\nOn January 27, 2014, a Monday, at around 10:20 pm (22:20 [[Central Time Zone|CST]]), Almond was assaulted with a [[Taser]], and the violin, including two bows, was stolen during an armed robbery in a parking lot in the rear of [[Wisconsin Lutheran College]] on West Wisconsin Avenue.
