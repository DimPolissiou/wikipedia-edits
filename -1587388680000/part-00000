It is the twenty-fourth and [[season finale]] episode of the show's [[Desperate Housewives (season 5)|fifth season]] and aired on May 17, 2009.\n\n==Plot==\nThe episode begins with Mary Alice explaining the marriage of Lila and David Dash, three years earlier. The scene continues with Lila wanting to go out for ice cream as a family; however Dave states that he cannot go; having brought work home. He promises that the next night they will do something together as a family. Returning to voice over, Mary Alice states there would be no tomorrow for Lila and Paige as it is the night they crash into Mike and Susan. The flashback ends with Mary Alice stating that the last thing Lila thought about was what her death would do to Dave and is lucky she would never know.\n\nMike has a weird feeling about Dave, but Katherine tells him that is just how Dave is. But when he wants to call them, Katherine tells him to put their bags in the car so they do not miss their flight. Katherine wants to stop at the store to get videotape for the camera, but Mike tells her to grab one from the desk so she grabs the tape that Dave made during the previous episode. At the airport, Mike calls Susan and finds out everything is fine. Katherine asks Mike if he wants to go through with the wedding because she feels he is still hooked into Susan, but Mike convinces Katherine he loves her. When Katherine pulls out her purse to go get some coffee, she accidentally turns on the video camera in her bag as she leaves for the coffee shop. Mike sees the tape Dave recorded and realizing the danger Susan and M.J. are in, grabs the camera and rushes away, telling a waiting lady to tell Katherine that he had to leave on an emergency. The lady repeats the message to Katherine, but fails to mention the word \"emergency\", so because of how the woman phrased Mike's message, it appears to Katherine that Mike could not go through with their wedding and left her.\n\nKaren and Roberta break into Edie's house and while searching through his briefcase, they find the name \"David Dash\" on the pill bottles. The two investigators show up asking to speak to Dave and catch Karen and Roberta inside the house. The detectives got confirmation from the receptionist that David Dash was a patient there and is the same one whose wife and daughter died in the car crash. Karen tells them that she remembers that crash because her neighbors, Mike and Susan, were in that crash so Roberta tells them that is weird and wonders why he would move onto the same street as the people who killed his family.\n\nMike calls Susan and tells her that Dave is actually the husband of the wife they killed in the accident. Mike tells her they are in danger and need to get away from him. Susan tries to find ways for Dave to pull over so she and M.J. can escape, but he is determined to get to the lake as soon as possible. Dave agrees to pull over and Susan takes M.J. to \"go to the bathroom\" in the woods. When the detectives call Dave to inform him they know everything, Susan hits him over the head with a rock and tries to get the keys out of his pocket, but he grabs her hand. Susan frees her hand and tells M.J. to run, but she trips over a rock and tells M.J. they are playing hide and seek and not to come out for anything. Dave grabs her and demands that she calls for M.J., but when she refuses he points his gun at her face, so she does, but only to tell him not to come out so he knocks her out with his gun. Dave eventually finds M.J. hiding behind a gravestone and gets them back in the car. When Mike calls, Dave answers and Mike tells him to let Susan and M.J. go and take him instead so Dave tells them to meet him on the same road where the accident happened. Dave ties up Susan and informs her that he and M.J. are going to pull into the intersection just as Mike goes speeding down that road. He wants Susan to watch as Mike kills their son just like she killed his daughter. Dave unbuckles M.J.'s seatbelt and when he looks through the rearview mirror he sees his daughter in M.J.'s place. Susan manages to get free and tries to get Mike to stop, but he crashes into Dave and Susan is devastated until she sees M.J. standing on the side of the road as Dave told him to get out. When the three of them gather together, Mike and Susan share a passionate [[kiss]]. After the crash Dave is put back in the [[psychiatric hospital]] in Boston where in his mind, his family never died.\n\nThe Solises are waiting for Ana to arrive and because her father walked out, her mother is in jail and she has been bounced around from relative to relative, and the Solises want this to be the end of the line for her. Carlos wonders if she will remember him because he has not seen her since she was six. Carlos remembers doing fun stuff with her like taking her to the swings in the park, buying her ice cream and giving her piggyback rides, but when she steps out of the taxi, he tells Gaby he does not remember that (Ana had since grown into a very attractive young lady). Gaby explains the house rules to Ana and is shocked to find out that Ana gets designer clothes from guys for making them think she will have [[sexual intercourse]] with them. Gaby comes back from doing errands and sees that Ana got the Scavo boys to do all the chores for her. Gaby scolds Ana as it sets a bad example for her daughters so Ana accuses her of being jealous because she is too old to get guys to do things for her. Gaby threatens to throw her out on the streets if she makes another comment like that. Ana goes outside and pretends to cry and tells Carlos that Gaby wants to kick her out so he tells Gaby to start acting like an adult, that Ana has had so much grief in her life without Gaby making things worse.\n\nKarl is surprised that Bree told Orson about the divorce. Bree is worried because she is being [[blackmail]]ed and if she does not pretend to love Orson, he will send her to prison. Orson is attacked by a man who warns him to let go. Otherwise, next time he will not. Orson thinks Bree hired the man to attack him, but realizes that Bree would never physically hurt him. Bree inadvertently changes Orson's mind and he decides to stay as she did not know he had a packed suitcase and was ready to leave. Bree is furious that Karl hired someone to attack Orson and accuses him of turning her into a completely different person. Karl tells her she is the most fascinating woman he has ever met and when she fires him, he kisses Bree and they both enjoy it.\n\nLynette starts to feel sick so she calls the doctor, saying she thinks the cancer is back. Meanwhile, Tom is excited because not only did he pass the exam; he got in the top five percent while drunk. To celebrate, Tom takes the whole family out for hot fudge sundaes. Lynette strongly believes it is cancer, but is stunned to find out she is [[pregnancy|pregnant]] with twins again. The news causes Tom to wonder about college and Lynette about her job.\n\nTwo months later, everyone is attending a wedding. Gaby is still trying to keep Ana in line, catching her flirting with a man at the wedding. Lynette excuses herself as she rushes to the bathroom, likely due to [[morning sickness]]. Bree is seen sitting next to Orson, but slowly turns to look at Karl, indicating they are likely still seeing one another. The scene ends on Mike as the groom, kissing an unidentified bride.\n\n==Notes==\n*Although she does not appear in this episode, [[Nicollette Sheridan]] ([[Edie Britt]]) is credited as a series regular for the last time.\n*Although credited, [[Shawn Pyfrom]] ([[Andrew Van de Kamp]]) does not appear in this episode.\n*This episode included a clip from \"[[You're Gonna Love Tomorrow]]\".\n*This is the fourth season finale to feature a cliffhanger featuring Mike:\n**In season one he entered his house where Zach Young was waiting and planning to kill him.\n**In season two he was run over by Orson Hodge and left for dead.\n**In season four it was unknown what had happened to Mike in the five-year jump due to Susan's new relationship with Jackson.\n*This is one of four season finales to feature a wedding.

It was long Northern Ireland's fifth-largest party, currently holding eight seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], but made breakthroughs in recent elections to place third in first preference votes in both the most recent [[European Parliament]] and [[2019 UK general election|United Kingdom general election]]. The party won one of the three Northern Ireland seats in the [[European Parliament]], and one seat, [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]] in the House of Commons respectively.\n\nFounded in 1970 from the [[New Ulster Movement]], the Alliance Party originally represented moderate and non-sectarian [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]].  However, over time, particularly in the 1990s, it moved towards neutrality on the [[Act of Union (1800)|Union]], and has come to represent wider liberal and non-sectarian concerns. It opposes the [[consociationalism|consociational]] power-sharing mandated by the [[Good Friday Agreement]] as deepening the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] divide, and, in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is [[Cross-community vote|designated]] as neither [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] nor [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], but 'Other'.\n\nIn  [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election in May 2010]] the Alliance Party won their first [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seat in a UK-wide general election, in the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] constituency, unseating [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). [[Naomi Long]] was the first MP from the Alliance Party since [[Stratton Mills]], who joined the party from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) in 1973. However, the DUP regained the seat at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] following an electoral pact with the UUP, leaving the Alliance Party with no representation in the House of Commons. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Alliance regained its foothold in the House of Commons, with [[Stephen Farry]] winning the North Down seat vacated by independent unionist, [[Sylvia Hermon]]. Earlier that year, leader and former MP, [[Naomi Long]] won the party's first seat in the European Parliament in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European elections]].\n\nThe Alliance Party is a member of the [[Liberal International]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal-international.org/site/Full_Members.html|title=Liberal International: Full Members|publisher=Liberal International|accessdate=3 June 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525043836/http://www.liberal-international.org/site/Full_Members.html|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aldeparty.eu/members/member-parties|title=ALDE Party - Member Parties|website=ALDE Party}}</ref> and is aligned with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in [[Great Britain]].<ref name=\"Driver2011\">{{cite book|author=Stephen Driver|title=Understanding British Party Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_Qq6RJr6_QC&pg=PA125|year=2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4077-8|page=125}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early growth and the 1974 Northern Ireland Executive===\nIt was formed in April 1970 as an alternative to the established parties. In the context of a rapidly worsening political crisis, the party aimed not only to present an alternative to what they perceived as [[sectarian]] parties and expressly aimed to act as a bridge between the [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] sections of the community and heal the divisions in Northern Ireland society. The Party's founding principles were expressly in favour of Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, although in contrast to other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] parties, this was expressed in socio-economic rather than [[ethnic group|ethnic]] terms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loretto |first1=Denis |title=Alliance, Liberals and the SDP |url=https://liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/33-Winter-2001-02.pdf}}</ref>\nOn 5 February 1973, prior to the [[1973 Northern Ireland border poll]], the party's Chairman, [[Jim Hendron]], stated that \"Support for the position of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom is a fundamental principle of the Alliance Party, not only for economic reasons but also because we firmly believe that a peaceful solution to our present tragic problems is only possible within a United Kingdom context.

The party supported the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], and despite claims that this would fatally damage its soft unionist support, Alliance rebounded to pick up 10.0% of the vote in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election]], with some voters rejecting the tacit mainstream unionist support for violence in the aftermath of the Agreement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas Whyte|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/gallsum.htm|title=Election results in Northern Ireland since 1973|publisher=Ark.ac.uk|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIts new leader, [[John Alderdice]], polled 32.0% of the vote in [[East Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|East Belfast]], while Alliance came within 15,000 votes of both the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and Sinn F\u00e9in across Northern Ireland. In 1996 Alderdice accepted a peerage, becoming the Alliance Party\u2019s only representation in Parliament. [[John Alderdice | Lord Alderdice]] took the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] whip on wider UK and European issues but remained free from the whip\u2019s control on issues impacting Northern Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/alderdice-accepts-lib-dem-peerage-in-house-of-lords-1.78580?mode=amp|title=Alderdice accepts Lib Dem peerage in House of Lords|website=www.irishtimes.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> \n\nIn 1988, in Alliance's keynote post-Anglo Irish Agreement document, ''Governing with Consent'', Alderdice called for a devolved power-sharing government. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Alliance's vote stabilised at between 7% and 10%. After the IRA and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] ceasefires in 1994, Alliance became the first non-nationalist party to enter into talks with Sinn F\u00e9in, as an active participant in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] negotiations leading to the [[Good Friday Agreement]], which it strongly supported. Alliance polled poorly in the 1996 elections for the [[Northern Ireland Forum]], and the [[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election|1998 election]] for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] winning around 6.5% of the vote each time. This did enable the party to win six seats in the Assembly, although this was somewhat of a let-down given that it had been expected to do much better.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/p1998.htm 1998 elections], ark.ac.uk; accessed 28 May 2016.</ref>\n\n===The Good Friday Agreement era===\n\n====1998\u20132004====\nJohn Alderdice resigned as party leader in 1998 to take up the post of the Assembly's [[Presiding Officer of the Northern Ireland Assembly|Presiding Officer]].

Another problem for the APNI was that the rules of the Assembly require major votes (such as the election of the [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]]) to have the support of both a majority of unionist and nationalist MLAs, thus diminishing the importance of parties such as Alliance which are not aligned to either of these two blocs.\n\nIn the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly elections]], Alliance held all their seats, while the Women's Coalition lost both of theirs. Alliance's vote fell to just 3.7%. In the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament Elections in 2004]], Alliance gave strong support to Independent candidate John Gilliland<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allianceparty.org/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120717220437/http://allianceparty.org/article/2004/000371/alliance-endorses-gilliland-for-europe|url-status=dead|title=Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|website=Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|archive-date=17 July 2012|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref> who polled 6.6% of the vote, the highest for a non-communal candidate in a European election since 1979. In the early years of the peace process, the centre ground was relentlessly squeezed in Northern Ireland politics. The support for Gilliland's candidature, which was also supported by parties such as the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] and Northern Ireland Conservatives, reflected a desire to reunite the fragmented and weakened non-communal bloc in Northern Ireland politics.\n\n====2004\u20132016====\n\nIn the 5 May [[2005 United Kingdom general election]], they contested 12 seats and polled 3.9% of the vote. In the simultaneous elections to Northern Ireland's local authorities, they polled 5.0% of first preference votes and had 30 Councillors elected, a gain of two seats relative to the previous elections.\n\nThe 2006\u20132007 period saw some signs of an Alliance upturn, topping the poll and gaining a seat in a by-election for [[Coleraine Borough Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2006/12/14/alliance-top-poll-in-coleraine/|title=Alliance top poll in Coleraine\u2026|date=14 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election]]s, Alliance put in a strong media campaign and polled 5.2%,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/vote2007/nielection/html/main.stm|title=Northern Ireland election overview|publisher=BBC News|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> up from 3.6% in the previous election and gaining a seat in Belfast South following the successful candidature of [[Anna Lo]], the first ethnic Chinese public representative in a national assembly anywhere in Western Europe. In an election cycle where many pundits had predicted that the Alliance Party would struggle to hold on to the six seats it won in the 2003 election, the party pulled off a credible performance which included Deputy Leader Naomi Long doubling her share of the vote in Belfast East.\n\nIn 2008, during the deadlock between Sinn F\u00e9in and the DUP over the devolution of policing, the two parties came to an agreement that the Minister of Justice would not come from either party. The Alliance Party was the obvious choice but party leader [[David Ford]] said \"it's a very definite and a very emphatic no\".

The party re-gained a seat in the House of Commons ([[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], previously held by the retiring independent [[Sylvia Hermon]]), and was second in another four constituencies.\n\n==Ideology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nOver the past 40 years and particularly since the mid-1990s, Alliance's [[political philosophy]] has veered away from non-sectarian [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]] towards a more liberal, neutral position on the question of either a [[united Ireland]] or continued Union with Great Britain. While the [[Good Friday Agreement]] has attempted to implement [[Consociational state|consociational power-sharing]], Alliance continues to argue that such enforced coalition government in Northern Ireland entrenches division rather than providing a basis for overcoming it.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe Alliance Party was founded on the back of efforts by the [[New Ulster Movement]] (NUM), which was established as a moderating influence upon the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). After [[Irish nationalist]] politicians withdrew their role as official Opposition at Stormont, and the resignation of UUP [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]] [[Terence O'Neill]] in 1969, the NUM split between those who wished to remain a pressure group for the UUP and those who saw reform only through the establishment of a new political party. The latter broke off and formed the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland on 21 April 1970.\n\nAs Alliance viewed the situation, the major problem of Northern Ireland was the division between Protestant and Catholic. It contended that the turmoil had its origins in that division and not in the [[partition of Ireland]]. \"Partition was the result of the divisions and not the cause of them\". (John Cushnahan, 1979) The party's founding members resolved to change the \"traditional mould\" of sectarian politics in Northern Ireland, by launching a party deliberately set out to win support from both sections of the population. The party's founding principles were an attempt to address the \"fundamental fears\" of Protestants being coerced into a united Ireland, and of Catholics being condemned to a second-class citizenship within Northern Ireland.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of Alliance is its belief in the legitimacy of a distinctive Northern Ireland community, one that has more in common than what divides it, with most inhabitants speaking a common language, sharing some form of Christianity, and not separated by distinguishable racial or physical characteristics. \"Its people are one community living in what has been called a place apart, but sharing a great deal with the rest of this island, the rest of these islands, and the rest of the developed world\". (Alliance 1992) Alliance does not view unionism and nationalism as distinct communities, but as \"political positions\". Furthermore, Alliance sees identity as an individual matter, originating in historical contexts, producing unionist and nationalist traditions. Alliance is at times seen as representing a \"third tradition\". \"In the context of Northern Ireland it includes those who, whether in politics, culture, religion, or in private life have refused to be categorised as Orange or Green\". (Alliance 1992)\n\nAs Alliance have moved to an ideologically liberal perspective, and Northern Ireland society has become more diverse, support for diversity has become a key Alliance platform, with [[Anna Lo]] MLA elected as the first [[Chinese British|ethnically Chinese]] parliamentarian in Western Europe and the party promoting a number of [[openly gay]] spokespeople.\n\n==Electoral performance and the regionalisation of Alliance's vote==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox political party\t\n|country =\t\n| name = Northern Ireland Council Seats\t\n|native_name = \t\n|colorcode = {{Alliance Party of Northern Ireland/meta/color}}\t\n|seats1_title = [[Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council|Antrim and Newtownabbey]]\t\n|seats1 = {{Composition bar|7|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\t\n|seats2_title = [[Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council|Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon]]\t\n|seats2 = {{Composition bar|3|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\t\n|seats3_title = [[Belfast City Council|Belfast City]]\t\n|seats3 = {{Composition bar|10|60|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats4_title = [[Causeway Coast and Glens District Council|Causeway Coast and Glens]]\t\n|seats4 = {{Composition bar|2|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats5_title = [[Derry and Strabane District Council|Derry and Strabane]]\t\n|seats5 = {{Composition bar|2|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats6_title = [[Fermanagh and Omagh District Council|Fermanagh and Omagh]]\t\n|seats6 = {{Composition bar|1|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats7_title = [[Lisburn and Castlereagh District Council|Lisburn and Castlereagh]]\t\n|seats7 = {{Composition bar|9|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats8_title = [[Mid and East Antrim District Council|Mid and East Antrim]]\t\n|seats8 = {{Composition bar|7|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats9_title = [[Mid Ulster District Council|Mid Ulster]]\t\n|seats9 = {{Composition bar|0|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats10_title = [[Newry, Mourne and Down District Council|Newry, Mourne and Down]]\t\n|seats10 = {{Composition bar|2|41|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats11_title = [[North Down and Ards District Council|North Down and Ards]]\t\n|seats11 = {{Composition bar|10|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n}}\n\nOne trend over time with Alliance's vote is that in contrast to 1973, when Alliance support was dispersed across Northern Ireland, Alliance has increasingly polled best in the [[Greater Belfast]] hinterland. For example, the 1977 elections, while representing an overall increase for Alliance, masked a sharp decline in vote share in many Western councils. In the 12 councils covering the former counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Armagh and Fermanagh their vote only rose in Omagh, it remained static in Magherafelt and fell in the other ten councils (these being Fermanagh, Dungannon, Cookstown, Strabane, Londonderry, Limavady, Coleraine, Newry & Mourne, Armagh and Craigavon.) Overall in these 12 councils the number of Alliance councillors fell from 18 in 1973 to ten in 1977. In contrast, in the rest of the region Alliance increased their number of councillors from 45 to 60.\n\nThe party won eight council seats across Belfast in 1985. Although that has now recovered to six (from three in 2001), the six are entirely from South and East Belfast. Both seats in the Falls Road area of West Belfast were lost after the death and resignation of their councillors there in 1987 while their seat in North Belfast was lost in 1993, regained four years later and lost again in 2001. In the neighbouring areas of Dunmurry Cross (Twinbrook/Dunmurry) and Macedon (Rathcoole) Alliance lost their councillors in 1989 and 1994 respectively; on the other hand, the party won three out of seven seats in Victoria in 2011, the first time since 1977 that the party had won three council seats in the same electoral area.<ref>Alliance won three seats in Belfast Area C and Castlereagh Area B in 1977.</ref>\n\nBy 2005, the party had councillors in only half of Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies. However, this rose to 13 in 2011 after gains in Coleraine, Craigavon, Down and elsewhere. Having had around 30 councillors for a decade, the party won 44 seats in 2011. In the 2010 elections, the Alliance gained the Westminster seat of Belfast East, and gained a 22.6% swing there; in 2011 it re-emphasised that result, winning two out of the six MLA seats available.\n\nIn 2014 the party gained one seat in the Belfast Council area, this coming in North Belfast when Nuala McAllister ousted Sinn F\u00e9in. Outside of the capital the party's vote held up, and with the exception of Patrick Brown winning in Rowallen, there were no outstanding results.\n\nIn the 2015 Westminster elections the party directed their resources at retaining the East Belfast seat Naomi Long had gained from the DUP in 2010. The party lost the seat to the DUP by 2,500 votes, after a Unionist pact, whilst the Alliance vote increased by 6% across the constituency.\n\nThe [[2019 Northern Ireland local elections]] saw a substantial increase in the Alliance vote and resulted in 53 councillors being elected, with the only council not having any Alliance representation is in Mid Ulster. The balance of power in the capital of [[Belfast]], is held by the party after an increase to 10 seats and becoming the 3rd party, at Belfast City Hall.\n\n===Vote share by district council (1973\u20132011)===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! !! 1973 !! 1977 !! 1981 !! 1985 !! 1989 !! 1993 !! 1997 !! 2001 !! 2005 !! 2011 \n|-\n| [[Antrim (borough)|Antrim]] || 16.1 || 16.9 || 10.9 || 7.6 || 7.0 || 8.5 || 8.2 || 5.5 || 6.9 || 11.3 \n|-\n| [[Ards (borough)|Ards]] || 14.8 || 20.8 || 12.3 || 12.4 || 18.8 || 23.4 || 21.1 || 16.7 || 14.1 || 18.2 \n|-\n| [[Armagh City and District Council|Armagh]] || 7.8 || 6.4 || ||  ||  ||  || 0.7 ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena]] || 6.4 || 5.2 ||  ||  || 6.1 || 5.4 || 2.0 || 1.1 || 1.5 || 1.7 \n|-\n| [[Ballymoney (borough)|Ballymoney]] || 7.7 || 8.3 || 8.1 || 2.6 ||  || 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Banbridge (district)|Banbridge]] || 5.7 || 6.2 || 4.6 || 1.6 || 2.2 || 1.8 || 5.1 || 2.0 || 4.5 || 4.9 \n|-\n| [[Belfast City Council|Belfast]] || 13.4 || 18.6 || 13.2 || 11.5 || 10.9 || 11.2 || 9.2 || 6.8 || 6.8 || 12.6 \n|-\n| [[Carrickfergus Borough Council|Carrickfergus]] || 22.3 || 30.0 || 21.8 || 24.9 || 27.1 || 32.2 || 27.4 || 23.5 || 23.2 || 25.1 \n|-\n| [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]] || 22.1 || 32.5 || 21.1 || 18.8 || 21.5 || 21.9 || 18.7 || 15.2 || 16.2 || 25.2 \n|-\n| [[Coleraine Borough Council|Coleraine]] || 13.2 || 10.6 || 6.3 || 6.2 || 7.9 || 11.8 || 9.2 || 6.4 || 4.7 || 8.8 \n|-\n| [[Cookstown District Council|Cookstown]] || 6.3 || 5.2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 0.6 \n|-\n| [[Craigavon Borough Council|Craigavon]] || 16.0 || 11.3 || 4.1 || 4.3 || 5.8 || 6.2 || 4.5 || 1.6 || 2.4 || 3.4 \n|-\n| [[Derry City Council|Derry]] || 14.5 || 11.9 || 6.4 || 2.7 || 0.6 || 1.0 ||  || 0.9 ||  || 0.9 \n|-\n| [[Down District Council|Down]] || 12.3 || 11.8 || 8.4 || 5.2 || 2.2 || 3.8 || 3.7 ||  || 2.1 || 4.9 \n|-\n| [[Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council|Dungannon and South Tyrone]] || 5.9 || 2.9 ||  ||  ||  ||  || 1.1 ||  ||  || 0.9 \n|-\n| [[Fermanagh District Council|Fermanagh]] || 7.7 || 1.9 || 1.6 || 1.8 || 1.0 ||  || 0.9 ||  ||  || 0.4\n|-\n| [[Larne Borough Council|Larne]] || 25.5 || 25.8 || 17.4 || 16.4 || 11.5 || 9.0 || 12.2 || 14.5 || 12.4 || 15.5 \n|-\n| [[Limavady Borough Council|Limavady]] || 11.2 || 8.5 || 2.0 || 1.9 || 2.1 ||  ||  ||  ||  || 2.0 \n|-\n| [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] || 18.1 || 20.4 || 12.2 || 11.0 || 10.7 || 12.3 || 13.0 || 11.0 || 9.2 || 10.4 \n|-\n| [[Magherafelt District Council|Magherafelt]] || 4.6 || 4.7 || 2.5 || 1.2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Moyle District Council|Moyle]] || 5.0 || 2.9 || 7.0 ||  ||  || ||  ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Newry and Mourne District Council|Newry and Mourne]] || 13.5 || 8.3 || 3.6 || 1.0 ||  ||  || 2.0 ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] || 18.9 || 28.4 || 15.6 || 10.3 || 14.0 || 16.1 || 10.3 || 8.0 || 8.0 || 16.4 \n|-\n| [[North Down Borough Council|North Down]] || 29.5 || 38.5 || 25.2 || 26.3 || 20.7 || 22.7 || 22.1 || 17.6 || 16.0 || 18.3 \n|-\n| [[Omagh District Council|Omagh]] || 12.2 || 16.0 || 9.0 || 4.7 || 3.7 || 5.0 || 3.3 ||  ||  || 1.5 \n|-\n| [[Strabane District Council|Strabane]] || 9.6 || 3.0 || 1.7 ||  || 1.1 || 2.2 || 0.9 || ||  ||  \n|-\n| '''Northern Ireland totals''' || '''13.7''' || '''14.4''' || '''8.9''' || '''7.0''' || '''6.9''' || '''7.6''' || '''6.6''' || '''5.1''' || '''5.0''' || '''7.4''' \n|}\n\n===Vote share by district council (2014\u2013present)===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! !! 2014 || 2019   \n|-\n| [[Antrim and Newtownabbey]] || 12.7 || 18.7  \n|-\n| [[Ards and North Down]] || 13.4 || 22.2\n|-\n| [[Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon]] || 3.3 || 7.8\n|-\n| [[Belfast City]] || 11.4 || 15.7\n|-\n| [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] || 3.9 || 8.0\n|-\n| [[Derry and Strabane]] || 1.6 || 4.7\n|-\n| [[Fermanagh and Omagh]] || 1.7 || 3.9\n|-\n| [[Lisburn and Castlereagh]] || 12 || 23.6\n|-\n| [[Mid and East Antrim]] || 9.4 || 15.8\n|-\n| [[Mid-Ulster District|Mid Ulster]] || 0.6 || 1.2\n|-\n| [[Newry, Mourne and Down]] || 2.4 || 7.5\n|-\n| '''Northern Ireland totals''' || '''6.6 ||'''11.5\n|}\n\n===Devolved Legislature elections===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It was long Northern Ireland's fifth-largest party, currently holding eight seats in the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]], but made breakthroughs in recent elections to place third in first preference votes in both the most recent [[European Parliament]] and [[2019 UK general election|United Kingdom general election]]. The party won one of the three Northern Ireland seats in the [[European Parliament]], and one seat, [[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]] in the House of Commons respectively.\n\nFounded in 1970 from the [[New Ulster Movement]], the Alliance Party originally represented moderate and non-sectarian [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]].  However, over time, particularly in the 1990s, it moved towards neutrality on the [[Act of Union (1800)|Union]], and has come to represent wider liberal and non-sectarian concerns. It opposes the [[consociationalism|consociational]] power-sharing mandated by the [[Good Friday Agreement]] as deepening the [[Sectarianism|sectarian]] divide, and, in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is [[Cross-community vote|designated]] as neither unionist nor [[Irish nationalism|nationalist]], but 'Other'.\n\nIn  [[2010 United Kingdom general election|general election in May 2010]] the Alliance Party won their first [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] seat in a UK-wide general election, in the [[Belfast East (UK Parliament constituency)|Belfast East]] constituency, unseating [[Peter Robinson (Northern Ireland politician)|Peter Robinson]], [[First Minister of Northern Ireland]] and leader of the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] (DUP). [[Naomi Long]] was the first MP from the Alliance Party since [[Stratton Mills]], who joined the party from the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP) in 1973. However, the DUP regained the seat at the [[2015 United Kingdom general election|2015 general election]] following an electoral pact with the UUP, leaving the Alliance Party with no representation in the House of Commons. In the [[2019 United Kingdom general election|2019 general election]], Alliance regained its foothold in the House of Commons, with [[Stephen Farry]] winning the North Down seat vacated by independent unionist, [[Sylvia Hermon]]. Earlier that year, leader and former MP, [[Naomi Long]] won the party's first seat in the European Parliament in the [[2019 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|2019 European elections]].\n\nThe Alliance Party is a member of the [[Liberal International]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.liberal-international.org/site/Full_Members.html|title=Liberal International: Full Members|publisher=Liberal International|accessdate=3 June 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525043836/http://www.liberal-international.org/site/Full_Members.html|archivedate=25 May 2014|df=dmy-all}}</ref> and [[Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party|Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.aldeparty.eu/members/member-parties|title=ALDE Party - Member Parties|website=ALDE Party}}</ref> and is aligned with the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]] in [[Great Britain]].<ref name=\"Driver2011\">{{cite book|author=Stephen Driver|title=Understanding British Party Politics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2_Qq6RJr6_QC&pg=PA125|year=2011|publisher=Polity|isbn=978-0-7456-4077-8|page=125}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early growth and the 1974 Northern Ireland Executive===\nIt was formed in April 1970 as an alternative to the established parties. In the context of a rapidly worsening political crisis, the party aimed not only to present an alternative to what they perceived as [[sectarian]] parties and expressly aimed to act as a bridge between the [[Protestant]] and [[Catholic]] sections of the community and heal the divisions in Northern Ireland society. The Party's founding principles were expressly in favour of Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, although in contrast to other [[Unionism in Ireland|unionist]] parties, this was expressed in socio-economic rather than [[ethnic group|ethnic]] terms.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Loretto |first1=Denis |title=Alliance, Liberals and the SDP |url=https://liberalhistory.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/33-Winter-2001-02.pdf}}</ref>\nOn 5 February 1973, prior to the [[1973 Northern Ireland border poll]], the party's Chairman, [[Jim Hendron]], stated that \"Support for the position of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom is a fundamental principle of the Alliance Party, not only for economic reasons but also because we firmly believe that a peaceful solution to our present tragic problems is only possible within a United Kingdom context.

The party supported the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], and despite claims that this would fatally damage its soft unionist support, Alliance rebounded to pick up 10.0% of the vote in the [[1987 United Kingdom general election]], with some voters rejecting the tacit mainstream unionist support for violence in the aftermath of the Agreement.<ref>{{cite web|author=Nicholas Whyte|url=http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/gallsum.htm|title=Election results in Northern Ireland since 1973|publisher=Ark.ac.uk|accessdate=28 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nIts new leader, [[John Alderdice]], polled 32.0% of the vote in [[East Belfast (UK Parliament constituency)|East Belfast]], while Alliance came within 15,000 votes of both the [[Democratic Unionist Party]] and Sinn F\u00e9in across Northern Ireland. In 1996 Alderdice accepted a peerage, becoming the Alliance Party\u2019s only representation in Parliament. [[John Alderdice | Lord Alderdice]] took the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] whip on wider UK and European issues but remained free from the whip\u2019s control on issues impacting Northern Ireland.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/alderdice-accepts-lib-dem-peerage-in-house-of-lords-1.78580?mode=amp|title=Alderdice accepts Lib Dem peerage in House of Lords|website=www.irishtimes.com|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> \n\nIn 1988, in Alliance's keynote post-Anglo Irish Agreement document, ''Governing with Consent'', Alderdice called for a devolved power-sharing government. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Alliance's vote stabilised at between 7% and 10%. After the IRA and [[Ulster loyalism|loyalist]] ceasefires in 1994, Alliance became the first non-nationalist party to enter into talks with Sinn F\u00e9in, as an active participant in the [[Northern Ireland peace process]] negotiations leading to the [[Good Friday Agreement]], which it strongly supported. Alliance polled poorly in the 1996 elections for the [[Northern Ireland Forum]], and the [[1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election|1998 election]] for the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] winning around 6.5% of the vote each time. This did enable the party to win six seats in the Assembly, although this was somewhat of a let-down given that it had been expected to do much better.<ref>[http://www.ark.ac.uk/elections/p1998.htm 1998 elections], ark.ac.uk; accessed 28 May 2016.</ref>\n\n===The Good Friday Agreement era===\n\n====1998\u20132004====\nJohn Alderdice resigned as party leader in 1998 to take up the post of the Assembly's [[Presiding Officer of the Northern Ireland Assembly|Presiding Officer]]. He was replaced by [[Se\u00e1n Neeson]], who himself resigned as party leader in September 2001. Neeson was replaced by [[David Ford]], a member of the Assembly for [[South Antrim (Assembly constituency)|South Antrim]].\n<!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Alliancemlas2003.jpg|framed|right|The six Alliance MLAs elected in 2003.

Front row: [[Eileen Bell]], [[David Ford]], [[Naomi Long]].]] -->\n\nIt was predicted that Alliance would suffer electorally as a new centrist challenger established itself in Northern Irish politics, the [[Northern Ireland Women's Coalition]]. Another problem for the APNI was that the rules of the Assembly require major votes (such as the election of the [[First Minister and deputy First Minister]]) to have the support of both a majority of unionist and nationalist MLAs, thus diminishing the importance of parties such as Alliance which are not aligned to either of these two blocs.\n\nIn the [[2003 Northern Ireland Assembly election|2003 Assembly elections]], Alliance held all their seats, while the Women's Coalition lost both of theirs. Alliance's vote fell to just 3.7%. In the [[2004 European Parliament election in the United Kingdom|European Parliament Elections in 2004]], Alliance gave strong support to Independent candidate John Gilliland<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.allianceparty.org/|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120717220437/http://allianceparty.org/article/2004/000371/alliance-endorses-gilliland-for-europe|url-status=dead|title=Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|website=Alliance Party of Northern Ireland|archive-date=17 July 2012|access-date=11 August 2019}}</ref> who polled 6.6% of the vote, the highest for a non-communal candidate in a European election since 1979. In the early years of the peace process, the centre ground was relentlessly squeezed in Northern Ireland politics. The support for Gilliland's candidature, which was also supported by parties such as the [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] and Northern Ireland Conservatives, reflected a desire to reunite the fragmented and weakened non-communal bloc in Northern Ireland politics.\n\n====2004\u20132016====\n\nIn the 5 May [[2005 United Kingdom general election]], they contested 12 seats and polled 3.9% of the vote. In the simultaneous elections to Northern Ireland's local authorities, they polled 5.0% of first preference votes and had 30 Councillors elected, a gain of two seats relative to the previous elections.\n\nThe 2006\u20132007 period saw some signs of an Alliance upturn, topping the poll and gaining a seat in a by-election for [[Coleraine Borough Council]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://sluggerotoole.com/2006/12/14/alliance-top-poll-in-coleraine/|title=Alliance top poll in Coleraine\u2026|date=14 December 2006}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2007 Northern Ireland Assembly election]]s, Alliance put in a strong media campaign and polled 5.2%,<ref>{{cite news|url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/vote2007/nielection/html/main.stm|title=Northern Ireland election overview|publisher=BBC News|date=13 March 2007|accessdate=21 June 2018}}</ref> up from 3.6% in the previous election and gaining a seat in Belfast South following the successful candidature of [[Anna Lo]], the first ethnic Chinese public representative in a national assembly anywhere in Western Europe.

The party re-gained a seat in the House of Commons ([[North Down (UK Parliament constituency)|North Down]], previously held by the retiring independent [[Sylvia Hermon]]), and was second in another four constituencies.\n\n==Ideology==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2016}}\nOver the past 40 years and particularly since the mid-1990s, Alliance's [[political philosophy]] has veered away from non-sectarian [[Unionism in Ireland|unionism]] towards a more liberal, neutral position on the question of either a [[united Ireland]] or continued Union with Great Britain. While the [[Good Friday Agreement]] has attempted to implement [[Consociational state|consociational power-sharing]], Alliance continues to argue that such enforced coalition government in Northern Ireland entrenches division rather than providing a basis for overcoming it.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe Alliance Party was founded on the back of efforts by the [[New Ulster Movement]] (NUM), which was established as a moderating influence upon the [[Ulster Unionist Party]] (UUP). After [[Irish nationalist]] politicians withdrew their role as official Opposition at Stormont, and the resignation of UUP [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]] [[Terence O'Neill]] in 1969, the NUM split between those who wished to remain a pressure group for the UUP and those who saw reform only through the establishment of a new political party. The latter broke off and formed the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland on 21 April 1970.\n\nAs Alliance viewed the situation, the major problem of Northern Ireland was the division between Protestant and Catholic. It contended that the turmoil had its origins in that division and not in the [[partition of Ireland]]. \"Partition was the result of the divisions and not the cause of them\". (John Cushnahan, 1979) The party's founding members resolved to change the \"traditional mould\" of sectarian politics in Northern Ireland, by launching a party deliberately set out to win support from both sections of the population. The party's founding principles were an attempt to address the \"fundamental fears\" of Protestants being coerced into a united Ireland, and of Catholics being condemned to a second-class citizenship within Northern Ireland.\n\nThe distinguishing feature of Alliance is its belief in the legitimacy of a distinctive Northern Ireland community, one that has more in common than what divides it, with most inhabitants speaking a common language, sharing some form of Christianity, and not separated by distinguishable racial or physical characteristics. \"Its people are one community living in what has been called a place apart, but sharing a great deal with the rest of this island, the rest of these islands, and the rest of the developed world\". (Alliance 1992) Alliance does not view unionism and nationalism as distinct communities, but as \"political positions\". Furthermore, Alliance sees identity as an individual matter, originating in historical contexts, producing unionist and nationalist traditions. Alliance is at times seen as representing a \"third tradition\". \"In the context of Northern Ireland it includes those who, whether in politics, culture, religion, or in private life have refused to be categorised as Orange or Green\". (Alliance 1992)\n\nAs Alliance have moved to an ideologically liberal perspective, and Northern Ireland society has become more diverse, support for diversity has become a key Alliance platform, with [[Anna Lo]] MLA elected as the first [[Chinese British|ethnically Chinese]] parliamentarian in Western Europe and the party promoting a number of [[openly gay]] spokespeople.\n\n==Electoral performance and the regionalisation of Alliance's vote==\n{{refimprove section|date=June 2016}}\n{{Infobox political party\t\n|country =\t\n| name = Northern Ireland Council Seats\t\n|native_name = \t\n|colorcode = {{Alliance Party of Northern Ireland/meta/color}}\t\n|seats1_title = [[Antrim and Newtownabbey Borough Council|Antrim and Newtownabbey]]\t\n|seats1 = {{Composition bar|7|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\t\n|seats2_title = [[Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon District Council|Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon]]\t\n|seats2 = {{Composition bar|3|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\t\n|seats3_title = [[Belfast City Council|Belfast City]]\t\n|seats3 = {{Composition bar|10|60|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats4_title = [[Causeway Coast and Glens District Council|Causeway Coast and Glens]]\t\n|seats4 = {{Composition bar|2|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats5_title = [[Derry and Strabane District Council|Derry and Strabane]]\t\n|seats5 = {{Composition bar|2|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats6_title = [[Fermanagh and Omagh District Council|Fermanagh and Omagh]]\t\n|seats6 = {{Composition bar|1|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats7_title = [[Lisburn and Castlereagh District Council|Lisburn and Castlereagh]]\t\n|seats7 = {{Composition bar|9|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats8_title = [[Mid and East Antrim District Council|Mid and East Antrim]]\t\n|seats8 = {{Composition bar|7|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats9_title = [[Mid Ulster District Council|Mid Ulster]]\t\n|seats9 = {{Composition bar|0|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats10_title = [[Newry, Mourne and Down District Council|Newry, Mourne and Down]]\t\n|seats10 = {{Composition bar|2|41|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n|seats11_title = [[North Down and Ards District Council|North Down and Ards]]\t\n|seats11 = {{Composition bar|10|40|hex=#F6CB2F}}\n}}\n\nOne trend over time with Alliance's vote is that in contrast to 1973, when Alliance support was dispersed across Northern Ireland, Alliance has increasingly polled best in the [[Greater Belfast]] hinterland. For example, the 1977 elections, while representing an overall increase for Alliance, masked a sharp decline in vote share in many Western councils. In the 12 councils covering the former counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Armagh and Fermanagh their vote only rose in Omagh, it remained static in Magherafelt and fell in the other ten councils (these being Fermanagh, Dungannon, Cookstown, Strabane, Londonderry, Limavady, Coleraine, Newry & Mourne, Armagh and Craigavon.) Overall in these 12 councils the number of Alliance councillors fell from 18 in 1973 to ten in 1977. In contrast, in the rest of the region Alliance increased their number of councillors from 45 to 60.\n\nThe party won eight council seats across Belfast in 1985. Although that has now recovered to six (from three in 2001), the six are entirely from South and East Belfast. Both seats in the Falls Road area of West Belfast were lost after the death and resignation of their councillors there in 1987 while their seat in North Belfast was lost in 1993, regained four years later and lost again in 2001. In the neighbouring areas of Dunmurry Cross (Twinbrook/Dunmurry) and Macedon (Rathcoole) Alliance lost their councillors in 1989 and 1994 respectively; on the other hand, the party won three out of seven seats in Victoria in 2011, the first time since 1977 that the party had won three council seats in the same electoral area.<ref>Alliance won three seats in Belfast Area C and Castlereagh Area B in 1977.</ref>\n\nBy 2005, the party had councillors in only half of Northern Ireland's 18 constituencies. However, this rose to 13 in 2011 after gains in Coleraine, Craigavon, Down and elsewhere. Having had around 30 councillors for a decade, the party won 44 seats in 2011. In the 2010 elections, the Alliance gained the Westminster seat of Belfast East, and gained a 22.6% swing there; in 2011 it re-emphasised that result, winning two out of the six MLA seats available.\n\nIn 2014 the party gained one seat in the Belfast Council area, this coming in North Belfast when Nuala McAllister ousted Sinn F\u00e9in. Outside of the capital the party's vote held up, and with the exception of Patrick Brown winning in Rowallen, there were no outstanding results.\n\nIn the 2015 Westminster elections the party directed their resources at retaining the East Belfast seat Naomi Long had gained from the DUP in 2010. The party lost the seat to the DUP by 2,500 votes, after a Unionist pact, whilst the Alliance vote increased by 6% across the constituency.\n\nThe [[2019 Northern Ireland local elections]] saw a substantial increase in the Alliance vote and resulted in 53 councillors being elected, with the only council not having any Alliance representation is in Mid Ulster. The balance of power in the capital of [[Belfast]], is held by the party after an increase to 10 seats and becoming the 3rd party, at Belfast City Hall.\n\n===Vote share by district council (1973\u20132011)===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! !! 1973 !! 1977 !! 1981 !! 1985 !! 1989 !! 1993 !! 1997 !! 2001 !! 2005 !! 2011 \n|-\n| [[Antrim (borough)|Antrim]] || 16.1 || 16.9 || 10.9 || 7.6 || 7.0 || 8.5 || 8.2 || 5.5 || 6.9 || 11.3 \n|-\n| [[Ards (borough)|Ards]] || 14.8 || 20.8 || 12.3 || 12.4 || 18.8 || 23.4 || 21.1 || 16.7 || 14.1 || 18.2 \n|-\n| [[Armagh City and District Council|Armagh]] || 7.8 || 6.4 || ||  ||  ||  || 0.7 ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Ballymena (borough)|Ballymena]] || 6.4 || 5.2 ||  ||  || 6.1 || 5.4 || 2.0 || 1.1 || 1.5 || 1.7 \n|-\n| [[Ballymoney (borough)|Ballymoney]] || 7.7 || 8.3 || 8.1 || 2.6 ||  || 2.0 ||  ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Banbridge (district)|Banbridge]] || 5.7 || 6.2 || 4.6 || 1.6 || 2.2 || 1.8 || 5.1 || 2.0 || 4.5 || 4.9 \n|-\n| [[Belfast City Council|Belfast]] || 13.4 || 18.6 || 13.2 || 11.5 || 10.9 || 11.2 || 9.2 || 6.8 || 6.8 || 12.6 \n|-\n| [[Carrickfergus Borough Council|Carrickfergus]] || 22.3 || 30.0 || 21.8 || 24.9 || 27.1 || 32.2 || 27.4 || 23.5 || 23.2 || 25.1 \n|-\n| [[Castlereagh (borough)|Castlereagh]] || 22.1 || 32.5 || 21.1 || 18.8 || 21.5 || 21.9 || 18.7 || 15.2 || 16.2 || 25.2 \n|-\n| [[Coleraine Borough Council|Coleraine]] || 13.2 || 10.6 || 6.3 || 6.2 || 7.9 || 11.8 || 9.2 || 6.4 || 4.7 || 8.8 \n|-\n| [[Cookstown District Council|Cookstown]] || 6.3 || 5.2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  || 0.6 \n|-\n| [[Craigavon Borough Council|Craigavon]] || 16.0 || 11.3 || 4.1 || 4.3 || 5.8 || 6.2 || 4.5 || 1.6 || 2.4 || 3.4 \n|-\n| [[Derry City Council|Derry]] || 14.5 || 11.9 || 6.4 || 2.7 || 0.6 || 1.0 ||  || 0.9 ||  || 0.9 \n|-\n| [[Down District Council|Down]] || 12.3 || 11.8 || 8.4 || 5.2 || 2.2 || 3.8 || 3.7 ||  || 2.1 || 4.9 \n|-\n| [[Dungannon and South Tyrone Borough Council|Dungannon and South Tyrone]] || 5.9 || 2.9 ||  ||  ||  ||  || 1.1 ||  ||  || 0.9 \n|-\n| [[Fermanagh District Council|Fermanagh]] || 7.7 || 1.9 || 1.6 || 1.8 || 1.0 ||  || 0.9 ||  ||  || 0.4\n|-\n| [[Larne Borough Council|Larne]] || 25.5 || 25.8 || 17.4 || 16.4 || 11.5 || 9.0 || 12.2 || 14.5 || 12.4 || 15.5 \n|-\n| [[Limavady Borough Council|Limavady]] || 11.2 || 8.5 || 2.0 || 1.9 || 2.1 ||  ||  ||  ||  || 2.0 \n|-\n| [[Lisburn City Council|Lisburn]] || 18.1 || 20.4 || 12.2 || 11.0 || 10.7 || 12.3 || 13.0 || 11.0 || 9.2 || 10.4 \n|-\n| [[Magherafelt District Council|Magherafelt]] || 4.6 || 4.7 || 2.5 || 1.2 ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Moyle District Council|Moyle]] || 5.0 || 2.9 || 7.0 ||  ||  || ||  ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Newry and Mourne District Council|Newry and Mourne]] || 13.5 || 8.3 || 3.6 || 1.0 ||  ||  || 2.0 ||  ||  ||  \n|-\n| [[Newtownabbey Borough Council|Newtownabbey]] || 18.9 || 28.4 || 15.6 || 10.3 || 14.0 || 16.1 || 10.3 || 8.0 || 8.0 || 16.4 \n|-\n| [[North Down Borough Council|North Down]] || 29.5 || 38.5 || 25.2 || 26.3 || 20.7 || 22.7 || 22.1 || 17.6 || 16.0 || 18.3 \n|-\n| [[Omagh District Council|Omagh]] || 12.2 || 16.0 || 9.0 || 4.7 || 3.7 || 5.0 || 3.3 ||  ||  || 1.5 \n|-\n| [[Strabane District Council|Strabane]] || 9.6 || 3.0 || 1.7 ||  || 1.1 || 2.2 || 0.9 || ||  ||  \n|-\n| '''Northern Ireland totals''' || '''13.7''' || '''14.4''' || '''8.9''' || '''7.0''' || '''6.9''' || '''7.6''' || '''6.6''' || '''5.1''' || '''5.0''' || '''7.4''' \n|}\n\n===Vote share by district council (2014\u2013present)===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- style=\"background:#ccc;\"\n! !! 2014 || 2019   \n|-\n| [[Antrim and Newtownabbey]] || 12.7 || 18.7  \n|-\n| [[Ards and North Down]] || 13.4 || 22.2\n|-\n| [[Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon]] || 3.3 || 7.8\n|-\n| [[Belfast City]] || 11.4 || 15.7\n|-\n| [[Causeway Coast and Glens]] || 3.9 || 8.0\n|-\n| [[Derry and Strabane]] || 1.6 || 4.7\n|-\n| [[Fermanagh and Omagh]] || 1.7 || 3.9\n|-\n| [[Lisburn and Castlereagh]] || 12 || 23.6\n|-\n| [[Mid and East Antrim]] || 9.4 || 15.8\n|-\n| [[Mid-Ulster District|Mid Ulster]] || 0.6 || 1.2\n|-\n| [[Newry, Mourne and Down]] || 2.4 || 7.5\n|-\n| '''Northern Ireland totals''' || '''6.6 ||'''11.5\n|}\n\n===Devolved Legislature elections===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

He studied with [[Vagn Holmboe]] at the [[Royal Danish Academy of Music]] in [[Copenhagen]], and subsequently with [[Nadia Boulanger]] in [[Paris]]. To begin with, he was strongly influenced by the Nordic styles of [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Carl Nielsen]] and [[Vagn Holmboe]]. In the 1960s, N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd began exploring the modernist techniques of central Europe, eventually developing a [[serialism|serial]] compositional system based on the \"infinity series\" {{harv|N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd|1975}}, which he used in his ''Voyage into the Golden Screen'', the Second and Third Symphonies, ''I Ching'', and other works of the late 1960s and 70s {{harv|Mortensen|n.d.(a)}}. Later he became interested in the Swiss artist [[Adolf W\u00f6lfli]], who inspired many of N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's works {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}, including the Fourth Symphony, the opera ''Det Guddommelige Tivoli'' and ''Papalagi'' for solo guitar.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd has composed works in all major genres: six operas, two ballets, eight symphonies and other pieces for orchestra, several concertos, choral and vocal works, a very large number of chamber works (among them ten string quartets) and several solo instrumental works. These include a number of works for the guitar, mostly written for the Danish guitarist [[Erling M\u00f8ldrup]]: ''In Memory Of...'' (1978), ''Papalagi'' (1981), a series of suites called ''Tales from a Hand'' (1985\u20132001), ''Early Morn'' (1997\u201398) and ''Rondino Amorino'' (1999). One of his most important works for percussion solo is ''I Ching'' (1982) for the Danish percussionist Gert Mortensen. He has also composed music for several films, including ''The Red Cloak'' (1966), ''[[Babette's Feast]]'' (1987), and ''Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'' (1993).\n\nHis eighth symphony was premiered on 19 September 2012 in the [[Helsinki Music Centre]], [[Finland]], by the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[John Storg\u00e5rds]]. Heikki Valska from the Finnish radio described the symphony as \"very bright and lyrical\" and \"approachable\". It was well received by the audience at the premiere {{harv|Anon.|2012}}.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd is also a prolific writer. He has written many articles dealing with music not only from a technical but also a philosophical viewpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n== Music ==\n[[File:Infinityseries.png|thumb|upright=2|{{listen|plain=yes|filename=Infinityseries.mid|title=Uendelighedsr\u00e6kken in G major (the first 32 terms)}} with numbers=scale steps and 0=A]]\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's music often features the use of the '''infinity series''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] ''Uendelighedsr\u00e6kken'') for [[serialism|serializing]] melody, harmony, and rhythm in musical composition. The method takes its name from the endlessly [[self-similar]] nature of the resulting musical material {{harv|Mortensen|n.d.(b)}}, comparable to [[fractal|fractal geometry]]. Mathematically, the infinity series is an [[integer sequence]]. \"Invented in an attempt to unify in a perfect way repetition and variation,\" {{harv|Sloane}} the first few terms of its simplest form are 0, 1, \u22121, 2, 1, 0, \u22122, 3, \u2026 {{OEIS|A004718}}.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd discovered the melodic infinity series in 1959 and it proved an inspiration for many of his works during the 1960s. However, it was not until his ''Voyage into the Golden Screen'' for small ensemble (1968)\u2014which has been identified as the first \"properly instrumental piece of [[spectral composition]]\" {{harv|Anderson|2000|loc=14}}\u2014and Symphony No. 2 (1970) that it provided the structure for an entire work {{harv|N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd|1975|loc=9}}.

To begin with, he was strongly influenced by the Nordic styles of [[Jean Sibelius]], [[Carl Nielsen]] and [[Vagn Holmboe]]. In the 1960s, N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd began exploring the modernist techniques of central Europe, eventually developing a [[serialism|serial]] compositional system based on the \"infinity series\" {{harv|N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd|1975}}, which he used in his ''Voyage into the Golden Screen'', the Second and Third Symphonies, ''I Ching'', and other works of the late 1960s and 70s {{harv|Mortensen|n.d.(a)}}. Later he became interested in the Swiss artist [[Adolf W\u00f6lfli]], who inspired many of N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's works {{harv|Anon.|n.d.}}, including the Fourth Symphony, the opera ''Det Guddommelige Tivoli'' and ''Papalagi'' for solo guitar.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd has composed works in all major genres: six operas, two ballets, eight symphonies and other pieces for orchestra, several concertos, choral and vocal works, a very large number of chamber works (among them ten string quartets) and several solo instrumental works. These include a number of works for the guitar, mostly written for the Danish guitarist [[Erling M\u00f8ldrup]]: ''In Memory Of...'' (1978), ''Papalagi'' (1981), a series of suites called ''Tales from a Hand'' (1985\u20132001), ''Early Morn'' (1997\u201398) and ''Rondino Amorino'' (1999). One of his most important works for percussion solo is ''I Ching'' (1982) for the Danish percussionist Gert Mortensen. He has also composed music for several films, including ''The Red Cloak'' (1966), ''[[Babette's Feast]]'' (1987), and ''Hamlet, Prince of Denmark'' (1993).\n\nHis eighth symphony was premiered on 19 September 2012 in the [[Helsinki Music Centre]], [[Finland]], by the [[Helsinki Philharmonic Orchestra]] conducted by [[John Storg\u00e5rds]]. Heikki Valska from the Finnish radio described the symphony as \"very bright and lyrical\" and \"approachable\". It was well received by the audience at the premiere {{harv|Anon.|2012}}.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd is also a prolific writer. He has written many articles dealing with music not only from a technical but also a philosophical viewpoint.{{Citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n== Music ==\n[[File:Infinityseries.png|thumb|upright=2|{{listen|plain=yes|filename=Infinityseries.mid|title=Uendelighedsr\u00e6kken in G major (the first 32 terms)}} with numbers=scale steps and 0=A]]\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd's music often features the use of the '''infinity series''' ([[Danish language|Danish]] ''Uendelighedsr\u00e6kken'') for [[serialism|serializing]] melody, harmony, and rhythm in musical composition. The method takes its name from the endlessly [[self-similar]] nature of the resulting musical material {{harv|Mortensen|n.d.(b)}}, comparable to [[fractal|fractal geometry]]. Mathematically, the infinity series is an [[integer sequence]]. \"Invented in an attempt to unify in a perfect way repetition and variation,\" {{harv|Sloane}} the first few terms of its simplest form are 0, 1, \u22121, 2, 1, 0, \u22122, 3, \u2026 {{OEIS|A004718}}.\n\nN\u00f8rg\u00e5rd discovered the melodic infinity series in 1959 and it proved an inspiration for many of his works during the 1960s. However, it was not until his ''Voyage into the Golden Screen'' for small ensemble (1968)\u2014which has been identified as the first \"properly instrumental piece of [[spectral composition]]\" {{harv|Anderson|2000|loc=14}}\u2014and Symphony No. 2 (1970) that it provided the structure for an entire work {{harv|N\u00f8rg\u00e5rd|1975|loc=9}}.
