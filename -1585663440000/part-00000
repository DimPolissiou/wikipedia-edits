An offshoot of the Mexican stable ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' from the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, the group was formed in November 2015 by Naito, [[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]] and [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]], but has since come to also include [[Seiya Sanada|Sanada]], [[Hiromu Takahashi]], and [[Shingo Takagi]]. Through NJPW's working relationship with other companies, they have also appeared in CMLL and in the American [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) promotion.\n\nDespite being smaller in numbers than full-scale factions such as [[Bullet Club]] or [[Chaos (professional wrestling)|Chaos]], ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'' has established itself as one of the most prominent and most popular stables in NJPW. As part of the stable, Naito has held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]], the top championship of the company, on two occasions, and the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] five times; he is the first (and currently only) wrestler to have held both titles simultaneously. Among the other accomplishments of the stable are two [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] reigns and two [[G1 Tag League]] wins for the [[tag team]] of Evil and Sanada, four [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] reigns divided between Bushi and Takahashi, one [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] reign from Bushi and Takagi, two [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] reigns from Evil and a current reign for Takagi, and a record three [[NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship]] reigns for Bushi, Evil and Sanada, plus a fourth reign for Bushi and Evil with Takagi; overall, twenty title reigns took place within the stable. ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' cited ''L.I.J.''{{'}}s impact on NJPW as one of the main factors in the magazine naming Naito the 2016 [[Tokyo Sports Puroresu Awards#MVP Award|Wrestler of the Year]], a feat he repeated the following year.\n\n==History==\n=== Origins and background (2013\u20132016) ===\n[[File:Tetsuya Nait\u014d 2016.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Tetsuya Naito]], the leader of ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'']]\nIn June 2013, [[Tetsuya Naito]] returned to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) from a legitimate [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]]. Two months later, Naito defeated [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in the finals to win NJPW's premier singles tournament, the [[G1 Climax#2013|G1 Climax]]. Despite being a clean-cut [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], Naito was soundly rejected by NJPW fans and his win over Tanahashi was booed. NJPW had pegged Naito as their next top babyface star, but seeing how the fans were reacting to him, the company changed their course of action and announced a fan vote to decide whether the planned [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] match between Naito and [[Kazuchika Okada]] or an [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] match between [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] and Hiroshi Tanahashi would main event the promotion's biggest event of the year, [[Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome]]. The fans voted Nakamura and Tanahashi to main event the show with Naito and Okada relegated to semi-main event. After failing to capture the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Okada, Naito would remain a step below the top spot in NJPW.<ref name=IngobernableRise>{{cite web | url = http://pwinsider.com/article/101347/ingobernable-tetsuya-naitos-rise-to-the-top-of-new-japan.html?p=1 | title = Ingobernable: Tetsuya Naito's rise to the top of New Japan | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=April 15, 2016 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/710281/ | script-title=ja:\u3010\u65b0\u65e5\uff27\uff11\u3011\u5185\u85e4\u3000\u9ed2\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u5857\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u5149\u308a\u306e\u738b\u8005\u3078 | date=July 19, 2017 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Naito, through a working relationship between NJPW and the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, worked a tour of CMLL, during which he joined the ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528114739/http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u54f2\u4e5f\u304c\u30bd\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30ed\u30b9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b4\u30d9\u30eb\u30ca\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u300d\u306b\u6b63\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165!? \u30105.27\u30a2\u30ec\u30ca\u30e1\u30d2\u30b3\u8a18\u8005\u4f1a\u898b\u3011 | archivedate=May 28, 2015 | date=May 28, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://rotativo.com.mx/deportes/412051-la-sombra-integra-a-japones-naito-a-los-ingobernables/ | title = La Sombra integra a japon\u00e9s Naito a Los Ingobernables | date=May 27, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Diario Rotativo | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/stable-money-how-wwe-playing-catch-rest-wrestling-world-208476 | title = Stable Money: How WWE is playing catch up to the rest of the wrestling world | last=Dominello | first=Zach | date=March 6, 2016 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> Upon his June return to NJPW, Naito continued representing ''Los Ingobernables'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/416110/ | script-title=ja:\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u304b\u3076\u308c\uff1f\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u672c\u968a\u96e2\u8131\u3082 | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> adopting the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] attitude associated with the stable,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pwinsider.com/article/94748/628-new-japan-road-to-dominion-in-tokyo-japan-report.html?p=1 | title = 6/28 New Japan Road to Dominion in Tokyo, Japan report | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref> using the fans' rejection of him as a catalyst for the change.<ref name=IngobernableRise/> In the weeks leading to October's [[King of Pro-Wrestling (2015)|King of Pro-Wrestling]] event, Naito began teasing bringing in a ''pareja'' (\"partner\") to witness his match against [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], contested for Tanahashi's contract for a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at [[Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/453644/ | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u4e0d\u6c17\u5473\u4e88\u544a \u30d1\u30ec\u30cf\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\uff12\u5bfe\uff11\u3067\u68da\u6a4b\u6f70\u3059 | date=October 3, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> At the October 12 event, [[Takaaki Watanabe]], making his NJPW return after a two-year overseas learning excursion, was revealed as Naito's ''pareja'' as he attacked Hiroshi Tanahashi during his match with Naito.

Ungovernables of Japan\"), also shortened to  '''''L.I.J.''''',  is a Japanese [[professional wrestling]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]], based in the [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) [[Professional wrestling promotion|promotion]] and led by [[Tetsuya Naito]]. An offshoot of the Mexican stable ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' from the [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, the group was formed in November 2015 by Naito, [[Tetsuya Bushi|Bushi]] and [[Evil (wrestler)|Evil]], but has since come to also include [[Seiya Sanada|Sanada]], [[Hiromu Takahashi]], and [[Shingo Takagi]]. Through NJPW's working relationship with other companies, they have also appeared in CMLL and in the American [[Ring of Honor]] (ROH) promotion.\n\nDespite being smaller in numbers than full-scale factions such as [[Bullet Club]] or [[Chaos (professional wrestling)|Chaos]], ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'' has established itself as one of the most prominent and most popular stables in NJPW. As part of the stable, Naito has held the [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]], the top championship of the company, on two occasions, and the [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] five times; he is the first (and currently only) wrestler to have held both titles simultaneously. Among the other accomplishments of the stable are two [[IWGP Tag Team Championship]] reigns and two [[G1 Tag League]] wins for the [[tag team]] of Evil and Sanada, four [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Championship]] reigns divided between Bushi and Takahashi, one [[IWGP Junior Heavyweight Tag Team Championship]] reign from Bushi and Takagi, two [[NEVER Openweight Championship]] reigns from Evil and a current reign for Takagi, and a record three [[NEVER Openweight 6-Man Tag Team Championship]] reigns for Bushi, Evil and Sanada, plus a fourth reign for Bushi and Evil with Takagi; overall, twenty title reigns took place within the stable. ''[[Tokyo Sports]]'' cited ''L.I.J.''{{'}}s impact on NJPW as one of the main factors in the magazine naming Naito the 2016 [[Tokyo Sports Puroresu Awards#MVP Award|Wrestler of the Year]], a feat he repeated the following year.\n\n==History==\n=== Origins and background (2013\u20132016) ===\n[[File:Tetsuya Nait\u014d 2016.JPG|thumb|upright|left|[[Tetsuya Naito]], the leader of ''Los Ingobernables de Japon'']]\nIn June 2013, [[Tetsuya Naito]] returned to [[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] (NJPW) from a legitimate [[anterior cruciate ligament injury]]. Two months later, Naito defeated [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]] in the finals to win NJPW's premier singles tournament, the [[G1 Climax#2013|G1 Climax]]. Despite being a clean-cut [[Face (professional wrestling)|babyface]], Naito was soundly rejected by NJPW fans and his win over Tanahashi was booed. NJPW had pegged Naito as their next top babyface star, but seeing how the fans were reacting to him, the company changed their course of action and announced a fan vote to decide whether the planned [[IWGP Heavyweight Championship]] match between Naito and [[Kazuchika Okada]] or an [[IWGP Intercontinental Championship]] match between [[Shinsuke Nakamura]] and Hiroshi Tanahashi would main event the promotion's biggest event of the year, [[Wrestle Kingdom 8 in Tokyo Dome]]. The fans voted Nakamura and Tanahashi to main event the show with Naito and Okada relegated to semi-main event. After failing to capture the IWGP Heavyweight Championship from Okada, Naito would remain a step below the top spot in NJPW.<ref name=IngobernableRise>{{cite web | url = http://pwinsider.com/article/101347/ingobernable-tetsuya-naitos-rise-to-the-top-of-new-japan.html?p=1 | title = Ingobernable: Tetsuya Naito's rise to the top of New Japan | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=April 15, 2016 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/710281/ | script-title=ja:\u3010\u65b0\u65e5\uff27\uff11\u3011\u5185\u85e4\u3000\u9ed2\u6b74\u53f2\u3092\u5857\u308a\u66ff\u3048\u5149\u308a\u306e\u738b\u8005\u3078 | date=July 19, 2017 | accessdate=August 14, 2017 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref>\n\nDuring the summer of 2015, Naito, through a working relationship between NJPW and the Mexican [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL) promotion, worked a tour of CMLL, during which he joined the ''[[Los Ingobernables]]'' [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150528114739/http://www.njpw.co.jp/news/detail.php?nid=14083 | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u54f2\u4e5f\u304c\u30bd\u30f3\u30d6\u30e9\u306e\u30e6\u30cb\u30c3\u30c8\u300c\u30ed\u30b9\u30fb\u30a4\u30f3\u30b4\u30d9\u30eb\u30ca\u30d6\u30ec\u30b9\u300d\u306b\u6b63\u5f0f\u52a0\u5165!? \u30105.27\u30a2\u30ec\u30ca\u30e1\u30d2\u30b3\u8a18\u8005\u4f1a\u898b\u3011 | archivedate=May 28, 2015 | date=May 28, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[New Japan Pro-Wrestling]] | language=Japanese}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://rotativo.com.mx/deportes/412051-la-sombra-integra-a-japones-naito-a-los-ingobernables/ | title = La Sombra integra a japon\u00e9s Naito a Los Ingobernables | date=May 27, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Diario Rotativo | language=Spanish}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.f4wonline.com/wwe-news/stable-money-how-wwe-playing-catch-rest-wrestling-world-208476 | title = Stable Money: How WWE is playing catch up to the rest of the wrestling world | last=Dominello | first=Zach | date=March 6, 2016 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Wrestling Observer Newsletter]]}}</ref> Upon his June return to NJPW, Naito continued representing ''Los Ingobernables'',<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/416110/ | script-title=ja:\u30e1\u30ad\u30b7\u30b3\u304b\u3076\u308c\uff1f\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u65b0\u65e5\u672c\u672c\u968a\u96e2\u8131\u3082 | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> adopting the [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous]] attitude associated with the stable,<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.pwinsider.com/article/94748/628-new-japan-road-to-dominion-in-tokyo-japan-report.html?p=1 | title = 6/28 New Japan Road to Dominion in Tokyo, Japan report | last=Macklin | first=Matthew | date=June 29, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=Pro Wrestling Insider}}</ref> using the fans' rejection of him as a catalyst for the change.<ref name=IngobernableRise/> In the weeks leading to October's [[King of Pro-Wrestling (2015)|King of Pro-Wrestling]] event, Naito began teasing bringing in a ''pareja'' (\"partner\") to witness his match against [[Hiroshi Tanahashi]], contested for Tanahashi's contract for a shot at the IWGP Heavyweight Championship at [[Wrestle Kingdom 10 in Tokyo Dome]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.tokyo-sports.co.jp/prores/mens_prores/453644/ | script-title=ja:\u5185\u85e4\u304c\u4e0d\u6c17\u5473\u4e88\u544a \u30d1\u30ec\u30cf\u3068\u4e00\u7dd2\u306b\uff12\u5bfe\uff11\u3067\u68da\u6a4b\u6f70\u3059 | date=October 3, 2015 | accessdate=October 1, 2016 | work=[[Tokyo Sports]] | language=Japanese}}</ref> At the October 12 event, [[Takaaki Watanabe]], making his NJPW return after a two-year overseas learning excursion, was revealed as Naito's ''pareja'' as he attacked Hiroshi Tanahashi during his match with Naito.

What would become the 70th Division originated with the [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Infantry Division]], which was formed in 1938 to serve in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] during the [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt]]. This division then transferred to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] on the outbreak of the Second World War and soon became the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Infantry Division]], which went on to take part in the [[Battle of Crete]] and the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign]]. On 10 October 1941, the 6th Division was re-created as the 70th Infantry Division, in an attempt to deceive [[Axis powers|Axis]] intelligence concerning the strength of British forces in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]].\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] transported the division to [[Tobruk]] from 19 September to 25 October, in a politically controversial move to relieve the [[9th Division (Australia)|mainly Australian]] garrison which had been defending the port for almost seven months, since the beginning of the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Under daily aerial and artillery attacks, the division defended the port and conducted nightly offensive patrols against [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] positions. On 18 November, the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] launched [[Operation Crusader]]. The division was tasked with breaking out of Tobruk, following the destruction of the Axis armoured forces. Following unexpected early success, the division began its attacks on 21 November, before the armoured formations of Germans and Italians had been defeated. Heavy fighting soon followed as the division captured several well-defended and dug-in German and Italian strong points. The looming threat of the Axis tanks ended the break-out offensive the following day. Renewed fighting on 26 November saw the division link up with the approaching [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand Division]], cutting the Axis [[line of communication|lines of communication]]. In response, the Germans launched several counter-attacks to throw back the 70th Division from the territory they had gained. The failure of these attacks had a lasting strategic impact on Operation Crusader; the Axis forces began their retreat and lifted the siege of Tobruk. Two men\u2014from units attached to the division\u2014were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for their actions during Operation Crusader.\n\nFollowing the fighting at Tobruk, the division was withdrawn from the front and placed in reserve. When [[Malayan Campaign|Japan entered the war]], the division was transferred to [[British Raj|India]]. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] landings while it trained in [[jungle warfare]]. It also served as a police force, protecting railways and being used to suppress [[civil disobedience]] caused by the [[Quit India Movement]]. While it was requested that the division be sent to the front line in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the [[Chindits]]. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24 November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] (who led the British troops in Burma) believed that the division could have had a greater impact against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.\n\n==Background==\n===Arab Revolt in Palestine===\nIn 1936, the [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt]] broke out in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=21}} British troops were dispatched, ending the first phase of the war by the close of the year.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=26}} Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With [[Causes of World War II|rising tensions in Europe]], the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=27\u201332}} The conclusion of the [[Munich Agreement]]\u2014on 30 September 1938\u2014calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Infantry Division]] was formed the following month and placed under the command of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Richard O'Connor]].{{sfn|The Times|1938}} The division was deployed to Palestine on internal security duties as part of a build-up of 18,500 men in the region.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=51}}{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=35}} This force then began to suppress the revolt. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas had overrun the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. O'Connor's men proceeded to sweep the area, declaring the Old City free of militants on 19 October. The same day, the division seized [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and by the end of the month were clearing [[Jaffa]] of rebels.{{sfn|Jackson|1996|p=31}}{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=35\u201336}} Many Palestinians were detained and rebel activity significantly dropped off in the area.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=35\u201336}} In the north, the [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Division]], under Major-General [[Bernard Montgomery]], and [[Special Night Squads]] engaged in counter-terror operations, with O'Connor writing that one [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] \"always encouraged his men to be brutal\". [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding]] [[Palestine Command|British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan]] [[Robert Haining]] wrote in late 1938 that \"unnecessary violence, vindictiveness ..., [and] killing in cold blood\" had to be curbed. O'Connor was likewise opposed to the measures in the north, and wrote \"harshness and unnecessary violence on the part of our soldiers\" had to be curbed.{{sfn|Marston|2010|p=32}} During the operation in Jerusalem, only four to nineteen guerrillas were killed.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=36}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2011|p=473}} In early 1939, the revolt finally came to an end.{{efn|[[Bernard Montgomery]]'s [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Division]] launched a major operation that defeated the rebels on a military level.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=37\u201338}} On a political level, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] drew up the [[White Paper of 1939]] conceding to the demands of the [[Arab Higher Committee]]: \"Self-government\u2014an Arab-controlled Palestine\u2014would be implemented within 10 years and in the meantime Jewish immigration would cease after five years.\"{{sfn|Marston|2010|p=32}}}}\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II}}\n\n[[File:Men of the Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment) camouflaging a gun position at Mersa Matruh, Egypt, 28&nbsp;May 1940.

O'Connor and the divisional staff then left Jerusalem bound for [[Cairo]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]]. From Cairo, the men moved forward to [[Mersa Matruh]] arriving on 7 September. The headquarters was then assigned all troops based there, with the exception of the [[7th Armoured Division (United Kingdom)|7th Armoured Division]].{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=51}} The British [[History of the Second World War|Official Historian]], [[I. S. O. Playfair]], comments that this decision was undertaken to relieve the burden on [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[Henry Maitland Wilson]], GOC [[Egypt Command|British Troops Egypt]], of \"direct control of operations which had been his in addition to the command of all troops in Egypt\".{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=97}} Due to the logistical problems in maintaining substantial forces across the [[Libyan Desert|Western Desert]] and on the [[Libya]]\u2013Egypt border, Mersa Matruh was the forward British base of operations and supplied by rail. Positioned {{convert|200|mi|km}} west of [[Alexandria]] and {{convert|120|mi|km}} from the border, the location had been chosen to shield forward [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) landing strips behind it and to defend the [[Nile Delta]]. Mersa Matruh also offered the British the strategy of drawing [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] or other forces forward to them, to allow a counter-attack after they ran into supply difficulties.{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=4}}{{sfn|Grehan|Mace|2015|p=6}}\n\nOn 3 November, the division was renamed the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Infantry Division]]. The division initially commanded rear area personnel and the [[22nd Brigade (United Kingdom)|22nd Infantry Brigade]]. Over the coming months, the [[14th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|14th]] and [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigades]] were assigned to the division as they arrived in Egypt from Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=97}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|pp=49, 51, 253, and 257}} On 10 June 1940, [[Italy]] declared war upon Britain and her [[Allies of World War II|allies]].{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=100}} Seven days later, the 6th Infantry Division was dissolved and its headquarters transformed into the command staff of a [[corps]] known as the [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF).{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=49}}{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=97}} In early September 1940, Italian forces based in Libya [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]]. Three months later, the WDF began a limited raid, [[Operation Compass]]. The raid succeeded and was expanded; in two months the WDF advanced {{convert|500|mi|km}}, occupied the Italian province of [[Cyrenaica]] and destroyed the [[Tenth Army (Italy)|Italian 10th Army]]. The operation was halted in February 1941 to give priority to the [[Battle of Greece]].{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|pp=362\u2013366, 371\u2013376}}\n\n[[File:The British Army in the Middle East 1941 E3944.jpg|thumb|alt=Two British soldiers face right while they talk to two French soldiers (centre). A third British soldier stands in the background, and a fourth stands on guard behind (to the left) of the French troops.|British infantry question captured [[Vichy France|Vichy French]] troops, near Damascus.]]\n\nOn 17 February 1941, the 6th Infantry Division was reformed in Egypt. It was initially made up of the 16th and the [[22nd Guards Brigade]], who were based in Egypt, but lacked artillery or other supporting arms. The 22nd Guards Brigade was soon withdrawn, and the division was assigned the 14th and [[23rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|23rd Infantry Brigade]]. Here, the division trained for amphibious operations in the [[Dodecanese]].{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=2}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|pp=49, 258, and 266}} The deteriorating situation in North Africa, which saw [[General der Panzertruppe|General]] [[Erwin Rommel]]'s ''[[Afrika Korps]]'' retake the territory lost by the Italians during Operation Compass, resulted in the 6th Infantry Division being reassigned to defend Egypt.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004|pp=32\u201333}} The division had been earmarked to deploy to [[Crete]], where the 14th Brigade had been based since November, but instead took up defensive positions at Mersa Matruh.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004|pp=125, 127}} The 14th Brigade later defended the airfield at [[Heraklion]] during the [[Battle of Crete]] when 2,000 [[Fallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)|German paratroopers]] landed in the area on 20 May. The Germans were able to penetrate into Heraklion, before Anglo-Greek forces cleared the town following heavy fighting. Despite many losses, the [[paratrooper]]s were able to dig-in on ridges around the brigade's positions.{{sfn|Long|1953|pp=281\u2013285}} Due to the deteriorating situation on Crete, the 14th Brigade was evacuated by [[Royal Navy]] ships on 29 May.{{sfn|Long|1953|pp=288\u2013291}} En route to Egypt, they were repeatedly bombed by the ''Luftwaffe'', suffering 800 casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=143}}\n\nBy late April, British attention had shifted to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]] due to the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], although the situation was resolved by the end of May.

The division was deployed throughout these areas, suppressing the disturbances and protecting the railways of Bihar.{{sfn|Green|2014|pp=5\u20136}}{{sfn|James|1988|p=65}}{{sfn|Messenger|1994|p=105}}{{sfn|Moreman|2014|p=64}}{{sfn|Allen|2000|p=93}} After civil power was restored in the affected areas, the 70th Division was concentrated again at Ranchi and resumed training as part of [[XV Corps (British India)|XV Indian Corps]].{{sfn|Slim|1960|p=138}} The corps commander, Lieutenant-General [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]], wrote in his memoirs that the 70th Division \"was one of the best British formations I have met, with a magnificent battle hardened spirit gained in the Middle East\".{{sfn|Slim|1960|p=141}}\n\nA member of the division, writing in May 1943, commented that it would not be\n\n{{quote|...&nbsp;enough for us to rest on our Middle East laurels [despite them being] \"well deserved\"...&nbsp;those days should only be regarded as a starting point in efficiency for only 100% trained tps&nbsp;... will defeat the Japanese in Arakan or in any other theatre of operations.|70th Division soldier{{sfn|Moreman|2014|p=79}}}}\n\nIn April 1943, Slim requested that the 70th Division be released from Eastern Army reserve to relieve other units on the Arakan front, but elements of the division were only slowly redeployed.{{sfn|Slim|1960|p=160}} The 23rd Infantry Brigade arrived in the Arakan area in May.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=267}} As of June, the remainder of the division was still part of the army reserve.{{sfn|Slim|1960|p=165}}\n\nOn 14 February 1943, Brigadier [[Orde Wingate]] launched [[Operation Longcloth]]. This operation saw the [[77th Indian Infantry Brigade]] operate behind the Japanese lines, supplied via air drops, ambushing Japanese troops and destroying rail lines. The force returned to Allied lines during April, having lost nearly a third of its troops; most of the remainder, as described by historian Christopher Chant, were \"crippled by exhaustion, malnutrition, dysentery, and malaria.\" Despite this, the operation was deemed a success.{{sfn|Chant|2013|pp=117\u2013118}} In August 1943, Wingate (now a major-general) was sent to attend the [[Quebec Conference, 1943|Quebec Conference]]. Churchill and the Americans were so impressed by Wingate that Special Force, commonly known as the [[Chindits]], were ordered to be expanded. Under this expansion, the 70th Division would be broken up and its units transferred to Special Force.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=376}}{{sfn|Rooney|1997|pp=64\u201365}}\n\nAuchinleck, now [[Commander-in-Chief, India]], strongly opposed such a move preferring to retain the division as an entity. Instead, he proposed that the newly arrived [[81st (West Africa) Division]] could be used in its place. Despite his arguments and the end of the division's availability for operations against the Japanese-occupied [[Ramree Island]], he was over-ruled by Churchill's backing of Wingate.{{sfn|Jackson|2006|p=376}}{{sfn|Rooney|1997|p=65}} On 6 September, the division began reorganising for [[long-range penetration]]. It had been estimated that 10 percent of the men would be unsuitable but this had been based on an erroneous report given in London (believed to be from Wingate) that the division was not first class, even though the standard of its infantry was high.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004b|p=36}}\n\nOn 25 October, the division was broken up and all troops were transferred to Special Force.{{sfn|Rooney|1997|p=65}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=50}} Symes, despite his seniority, became Wingate's second-in-command and tried to prevent the further break-up of the divisional units to retain the traditions, histories and ''[[Morale|esprit de corps]]'' of the British Army's [[Structure of the British Army|regimental structure]], which reconciled his men and helped to ensure a smooth transition to Special Force.{{sfn|Royle|2010|pp=275\u2013276}} Having ceased to exist, the 70th Division was officially disbanded on 24 November.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=49}}\n\nThe British Official Historian, [[Stanley Kirby]], wrote that the best-trained and most-experienced British division had been broken up to reinforce Special Force, which eventually absorbed one-sixth of the infantry in [[South East Asia Command]]. He judged that had the division been retained, it could have reinforced the Fourteenth Army, making the defence of [[Battle of Imphal|Imphal]] and [[Battle of Kohima|Kohima]] in 1944 easier.{{sfn|Woodburn Kirby|2004b|pp=442, 445}} Historian F. W. Perry wrote, \"it is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the results achieved by the force did not represent an adequate return for the resources invested\". He further argued that the force was too lightly armed to capture strongly held positions or to hold one if captured, and concluded that Special Force \"inflicted more damage and disruption on the British Army than it ever did on the Japanese.\"{{sfn|Perry|1988|p=71}} Similarly, Slim argued in his memoirs that it had been a mistake to break up the 70th Division as it was the only British division which had been trained in jungle warfare, and that it would have been twice as effective as an experienced conventional formation than it proved to be as part of Special Force.{{sfn|Slim|1960|pp=216\u2013217}}\n\n==General officers commanding==\n{{see also|General officer commanding}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: left; border-spacing: 2px; border: 1px

What would become the 70th Division originated with the [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Infantry Division]], which was formed in 1938 to serve in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] during the [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt]]. This division then transferred to [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]] on the outbreak of the Second World War and soon became the [[6th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|6th Infantry Division]], which went on to take part in the [[Battle of Crete]] and the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign]]. On 10 October 1941, the 6th Division was re-created as the 70th Infantry Division, in an attempt to deceive [[Axis powers|Axis]] intelligence concerning the strength of British forces in the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]].\n\nThe [[Royal Navy]] transported the division to [[Tobruk]] from 19 September to 25 October, in a politically controversial move to relieve the [[9th Division (Australia)|mainly Australian]] garrison which had been defending the port for almost seven months, since the beginning of the [[Siege of Tobruk]]. Under daily aerial and artillery attacks, the division defended the port and conducted nightly offensive patrols against [[Nazi Germany|German]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] positions. On 18 November, the [[Eighth Army (United Kingdom)|British Eighth Army]] launched [[Operation Crusader]]. The division was tasked with breaking out of Tobruk, following the destruction of the Axis armoured forces. Following unexpected early success, the division began its attacks on 21 November, before the armoured formations of Germans and Italians had been defeated. Heavy fighting soon followed as the division captured several well-defended and dug-in German and Italian strong points. The looming threat of the Axis tanks ended the break-out offensive the following day. Renewed fighting on 26 November saw the division link up with the approaching [[2nd New Zealand Division|New Zealand Division]], cutting the Axis [[line of communication|lines of communication]]. In response, the Germans launched several counter-attacks to throw back the 70th Division from the territory they had gained. The failure of these attacks had a lasting strategic impact on Operation Crusader; the Axis forces began their retreat and lifted the siege of Tobruk. Two men\u2014from units attached to the division\u2014were awarded the [[Victoria Cross]] for their actions during Operation Crusader.\n\nFollowing the fighting at Tobruk, the division was withdrawn from the front and placed in reserve. When [[Malayan Campaign|Japan entered the war]], the division was transferred to [[British Raj|India]]. It was considered the most experienced and best trained British formation available in Asia. In India, the division formed a reserve to counter possible [[Empire of Japan|Japanese]] landings while it trained in [[jungle warfare]]. It also served as a police force, protecting railways and being used to suppress [[civil disobedience]] caused by the [[Quit India Movement]]. While it was requested that the division be sent to the front line in [[Burma Campaign|Burma]], it was instead transferred to Special Force, commonly known as the [[Chindits]]. Such a move was opposed by the highest military commanders in India and Burma, and proved controversial with the troops themselves. Despite their pleas, the division was broken up and officially ceased to exist on 24 November 1943. Historian Woodburn Kirby and [[Lieutenant-general (United Kingdom)|Lieutenant-General]] [[William Slim, 1st Viscount Slim|William Slim]] (who led the British troops in Burma) believed that the division could have had a greater impact against the Japanese had it been retained as a single formation.\n\n==Background==\n===Arab Revolt in Palestine===\nIn 1936, the [[1936\u201339 Arab revolt in Palestine|Arab Revolt]] broke out in the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]].{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=21}} British troops were dispatched, ending the first phase of the war by the close of the year.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=26}} Fighting soon resumed and reached its zenith during the summer of 1938. With [[Causes of World War II|rising tensions in Europe]], the British began to withdraw troops from Palestine for use elsewhere.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=27\u201332}} The conclusion of the [[Munich Agreement]]\u2014on 30 September 1938\u2014calmed the rising tensions in Europe and averted war, allowing the British to resume their military build-up in Palestine.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=35}}\n\nThe [[7th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|7th Infantry Division]] was formed the following month and placed under the command of [[Major-general (United Kingdom)|Major-General]] [[Richard O'Connor]].{{sfn|The Times|1938}} The division was deployed to Palestine on internal security duties as part of a build-up of 18,500 men in the region.{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=51}}{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=35}} This force then began to suppress the revolt. Meanwhile, Palestinian guerrillas had overrun the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]]. O'Connor's men proceeded to sweep the area, declaring the Old City free of militants on 19 October. The same day, the division seized [[Acre, Israel|Acre]] and by the end of the month were clearing [[Jaffa]] of rebels.{{sfn|Jackson|1996|p=31}}{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=35\u201336}} Many Palestinians were detained and rebel activity significantly dropped off in the area.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=35\u201336}} In the north, the [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Division]], under Major-General [[Bernard Montgomery]], and [[Special Night Squads]] engaged in counter-terror operations, with O'Connor writing that one [[Brigadier (United Kingdom)|brigadier]] \"always encouraged his men to be brutal\". [[General officer commanding|General Officer Commanding]] [[Palestine Command|British Forces in Palestine and Trans-Jordan]] [[Robert Haining]] wrote in late 1938 that \"unnecessary violence, vindictiveness ..., [and] killing in cold blood\" had to be curbed. O'Connor was likewise opposed to the measures in the north, and wrote \"harshness and unnecessary violence on the part of our soldiers\" had to be curbed.{{sfn|Marston|2010|p=32}} During the operation in Jerusalem, only four to nineteen guerrillas were killed.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|p=36}}{{sfn|Sebag Montefiore|2011|p=473}} In early 1939, the revolt finally came to an end.{{efn|[[Bernard Montgomery]]'s [[8th Infantry Division (United Kingdom)|8th Infantry Division]] launched a major operation that defeated the rebels on a military level.{{sfn|Bar-On|2006|pp=37\u201338}} On a political level, the [[Government of the United Kingdom|British Government]] drew up the [[White Paper of 1939]] conceding to the demands of the [[Arab Higher Committee]]: \"Self-government\u2014an Arab-controlled Palestine\u2014would be implemented within 10 years and in the meantime Jewish immigration would cease after five years.\"{{sfn|Marston|2010|p=32}}}}\n\n===Second World War===\n{{Main|Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II}}\n\n[[File:Men of the Highland Light Infantry (City of Glasgow Regiment) camouflaging a gun position at Mersa Matruh, Egypt, 28&nbsp;May 1940.

O'Connor and the divisional staff then left Jerusalem bound for [[Cairo]], [[Kingdom of Egypt|Egypt]]. From Cairo, the men moved forward to [[Mersa Matruh]] arriving on 7 September.

Positioned {{convert|200|mi|km}} west of [[Alexandria]] and {{convert|120|mi|km}} from the border, the location had been chosen to shield forward [[Royal Air Force]] (RAF) landing strips behind it and to defend the [[Nile Delta]].

Over the coming months, the [[14th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|14th]] and [[16th Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|16th Infantry Brigades]] were assigned to the division as they arrived in Egypt from Palestine.{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=97}}{{sfn|Joslen|2003|pp=49, 51, 253, and 257}} On 10 June 1940, [[Italy]] declared war upon Britain and her [[Allies of World War II|allies]].{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=100}} Seven days later, the 6th Infantry Division was dissolved and its headquarters transformed into the command staff of a [[corps]] known as the [[Western Desert Force]] (WDF).{{sfn|Joslen|2003|p=49}}{{sfn|Playfair|Stitt|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=97}} In early September 1940, Italian forces based in Libya [[Italian invasion of Egypt|invaded Egypt]].

It was initially made up of the 16th and the [[22nd Guards Brigade]], who were based in Egypt, but lacked artillery or other supporting arms. The 22nd Guards Brigade was soon withdrawn, and the division was assigned the 14th and [[23rd Infantry Brigade (United Kingdom)|23rd Infantry Brigade]].

The Germans were able to penetrate into Heraklion, before Anglo-Greek forces cleared the town following heavy fighting. Despite many losses, the [[paratrooper]]s were able to dig-in on ridges around the brigade's positions.{{sfn|Long|1953|pp=281\u2013285}} Due to the deteriorating situation on Crete, the 14th Brigade was evacuated by [[Royal Navy]] ships on 29 May.{{sfn|Long|1953|pp=288\u2013291}} En route to Egypt, they were repeatedly bombed by the ''Luftwaffe'', suffering 800 casualties.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004|p=143}}\n\nBy late April, British attention had shifted to the [[Mediterranean and Middle East theatre of World War II|Middle East]] due to the [[Anglo-Iraqi War]], although the situation was resolved by the end of May. A greater concern was that [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|German]] and [[Royal Italian Army during World War II|Italian]] forces had intervened in [[Kingdom of Iraq|Iraq]], using bases in [[Vichy France|Vichy]] [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|Syria]]. With Germans and Italians threatening to gain full control of the French territory, thus jeopardising the British position in the Middle East, the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] invaded Syria ([[Syria\u2013Lebanon Campaign|Operation Exporter]]) on 8 June.{{sfn|Playfair|Flynn|Molony|Toomer|2004|pp=182, 196\u2013197, 203}} In the face of stiff resistance from the Vichy French, the British realised that reinforcements were needed.

Although isolated by land, the garrison was supplied by the Royal Navy and the first Axis attacks failed to take the port.

The Axis positions were well dug-in, behind mines and barbed wire, supported by machine guns and artillery. The first position, codenamed \"Butch\", was captured by 09:00, shortly followed by \"Jill\", but two attempts to capture \"Tugun\" were repulsed by the Italian defenders. The mix of Italian and German troops holding \"Tiger\" offered up the most resistance of the day. The supporting [[Matilda II|Matilda tanks]] ran into undetected minefields and were engaged periodically by Axis anti-tank guns. The Black Watch, under flanking fire from other Axis strong points and being fired upon directly by the defenders of \"Tiger\", led a bayonet charge to the sound of bagpipes and captured the position, in conjunction with elements of the [[1st Royal Tank Regiment]] (1 RTR) and the [[4th Royal Tank Regiment]] (4 RTR).

Unlike other video sharing sites, however, comments are overlaid directly onto the video, synced to specific playback times. This feature allows comments to respond directly to events occurring in the video, in sync with the viewer\u2014creating a sense of a shared watching experience. Together with [[Hiroyuki Nishimura]] serving as director at Niwango until February 2013,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2013-02-18/hiroyuki-nishimura-resigns-as-director-at-niconico-niwango|title=Hiroyuki Nishimura Resigns as Director at Niconico's Niwango|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|date=February 18, 2013|accessdate=March 13, 2013}}</ref> Niconico's atmosphere and cultural context are close to [[2channel]]'s or [[Futaba Channel]]'s. Many popular videos on this site have [[otaku]] tastes, such as [[anime]], [[computer game]]s, and [[pop music]]. Niconico offers a feature for users (not just the uploader of the video) to tag videos. Each video may have up to eleven tags, of which up to five the uploader may lock. Frequently, this functionality can be used not only as categorization, but also as critical commentary, satire, or other humor related to the video's content. The site is also known for its MAD videos and its [[medley (music)|medleys]] of popular songs on the website, most notably [[Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga]]. Niconico also distributed some [[original net animation]]s, such as ''[[Candy Boy]]'', ''[[Tentai Senshi Sunred]],'' and ''[[Penguin Musume|Penguin Musume Heart]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nagata, Kazuaki |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110609a1.html |title=Video-sharing website sparks Net revolution |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther features include:\n\n* '''Mylist''': Each user may create \"mylists\", which function similarly to a list of bookmarks. Users can have up to 25 mylist folders, but the number of videos per folder depends on the user's membership status. A basic account can have 100 videos per folder, while a premium (paid) account has five times that amount (500). Under this limit, a free member can have up to 2,500 mylisted videos, while premium members can mylist up to 12,500 videos. Daily mylist activity is used to compute the default ranking view, although one may also sort by view or comment count. Mylists may be optionally made public and linked to; for example, to make a list of uploader's works (e.g., original songs or gameplay videos).\n* '''Uploader comments''': The uploader of a video may attach permanent comments to the video. This feature is suitable for some cases as subtitles, lyrics, or corrections.\n* '''Nicoscript''': By using special commands in the uploader comments, the uploader can add special effects to the video, including voting, automatic transfer to another video, quiz scoring, and other features.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nobuo Kawakami at Niconico chokaigi 20120430.jpg|thumb|Nobuo Kawakami, the founder and CEO of Niconico]]\nThe first version of Niconico used [[YouTube]] as a video source. When the site grew, YouTube's server infrastructure strained due to increased traffic and bandwidth, forcing YouTube to block access from Niconico. As a result, Niconico ceased operations, but two weeks later, the site relaunched with an on-premises video server. On May 7, 2007, Niconico announced a [[mobile phone]] version of the website.

Many popular videos on this site have [[otaku]] tastes, such as [[anime]], [[computer game]]s, and [[pop music]]. Niconico offers a feature for users (not just the uploader of the video) to tag videos. Each video may have up to eleven tags, of which up to five the uploader may lock. Frequently, this functionality can be used not only as categorization, but also as critical commentary, satire, or other humor related to the video's content. The site is also known for its MAD videos and its [[medley (music)|medleys]] of popular songs on the website, most notably [[Kumikyoku Nico Nico Douga]]. Niconico also distributed some [[original net animation]]s, such as ''[[Candy Boy]]'', ''[[Tentai Senshi Sunred]],'' and ''[[Penguin Musume|Penguin Musume Heart]]''.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nagata, Kazuaki |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/nb20110609a1.html |title=Video-sharing website sparks Net revolution |work=[[The Japan Times]] |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOther features include:\n\n* '''Mylist''': Each user may create \"mylists\", which function similarly to a list of bookmarks. Users can have up to 25 mylist folders, but the number of videos per folder depends on the user's membership status. A basic account can have 100 videos per folder, while a premium (paid) account has five times that amount (500). Under this limit, a free member can have up to 2,500 mylisted videos, while premium members can mylist up to 12,500 videos. Daily mylist activity is used to compute the default ranking view, although one may also sort by view or comment count. Mylists may be optionally made public and linked to; for example, to make a list of uploader's works (e.g., original songs or gameplay videos).\n* '''Uploader comments''': The uploader of a video may attach permanent comments to the video. This feature is suitable for some cases as subtitles, lyrics, or corrections.\n* '''Nicoscript''': By using special commands in the uploader comments, the uploader can add special effects to the video, including voting, automatic transfer to another video, quiz scoring, and other features.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Nobuo Kawakami at Niconico chokaigi 20120430.jpg|thumb|Nobuo Kawakami, the founder and CEO of Niconico]]\nThe first version of Niconico used [[YouTube]] as a video source.

The Block 1\u2013plus version was designed for increased electrical power, secure communications, automatic landing, increased gross takeoff weight (GTOW), weapons growth, and streamlined payload integration capabilities. A new high-capacity starter generator offers increased electrical power capacity to provide growth capacity; a backup generator is also present and is sufficient for all flight-critical functions, improving the electrical power system's reliability via three independent power sources. New communications capabilities, including dual ARC-210 VHF/UHF radios with wingtip antennas, allow for simultaneous communications between multiple air-to-air and air-to-ground parties, secure data links, and an increased data transmission capacity. The new trailing arm main landing gear allows the carriage of heavier payloads or additional fuel. Development and testing were completed, and Milestone C was achieved in September 2012.  Follow-on aircraft will be redesignated ''MQ-9 Block 5''.<ref>(29 January 2013) [http://insidedefense.com/index.php?option=com_user&view=login&return=aHR0cDovL2luc2lkZWRlZmVuc2UuY29tL1VubWFubmVkLVN5c3RlbXMvV2Vla2x5LUFsZXJ0L3dlZWtseS1hbGVydC1qYW51YXJ5LTI5LTIwMTMvbWVudS1pZC04OTAuaHRtbA== USAF Works To Address Avionics Software Deficiencies In MQ-9 Reaper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403103617/http://insidedefense.com/index.php?option=com_user&view=login&return=aHR0cDovL2luc2lkZWRlZmVuc2UuY29tL1VubWFubmVkLVN5c3RlbXMvV2Vla2x5LUFsZXJ0L3dlZWtseS1hbGVydC1qYW51YXJ5LTI5LTIwMTMvbWVudS1pZC04OTAuaHRtbA== |date=3 April 2015 }} InsideDefence,com, Retrieved 3 March 2013</ref><ref>[http://www.suasnews.com/2012/09/18590/ga-asi-introduces-system-wide-enhancements-for-predator-bmq-9-reaper/ GA-ASI Introduces System-Wide Enhancements for Predator B/MQ-9 Reaper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130205013418/http://www.suasnews.com/2012/09/18590/ga-asi-introduces-system-wide-enhancements-for-predator-bmq-9-reaper/ |date=5 February 2013 }} \u2013 sUASNews.com, 5 September 2012</ref> On 15 October 2013, the USAF awarded General Atomics a $377.4 million contract for 24 MQ-9 Block 5 Reapers.<ref>[http://www.suasnews.com/2013/10/25674/air-force-to-buy-24-late-model-reaper-hunter-killer-uavs-under-terms-of-377-4-million-contract/ Air Force to buy 24 late-model Reaper hunter-killer UAVs under terms of $377.4 million contract] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031222914/http://www.suasnews.com/2013/10/25674/air-force-to-buy-24-late-model-reaper-hunter-killer-uavs-under-terms-of-377-4-million-contract/ |date=31 October 2013 }} \u2013 sUASNews.com, 22 October 2013</ref> The MQ-9 Block 5 flew its first combat mission on 23 June 2017.<ref name=Blk5>[https://www.defensetech.org/2017/06/30/air-forces-newest-mq-9-reaper-drone-now-hunting-isis/ The Air Force\u2019s Newest MQ-9 Reaper Drone Is Now Hunting ISIS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707201247/https://www.defensetech.org/2017/06/30/air-forces-newest-mq-9-reaper-drone-now-hunting-isis/ |date=7 July 2017 }} - Defensetech.org, 30 June 2017</ref>\n\n===SkyGuardian===\n[[File:MQ-9B Sky Guardian testing at Laguna Army Airfield.jpg|thumb|280px|The Sky Guardian at [[Laguna Army Airfield]] for testing and certification, including a 48.2-hour endurance record and first [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] certification of an unmanned aircraft to fly in civilian air space.<ref name=\"YPG airfield\">[https://www.army.mil/article/222712/game_changing_unmanned_aircraft_tested_at_us_army_yuma_proving_ground Game-changing unmanned aircraft tested at U.S. Army Yuma Proving Ground], Army.mil, by Mr. Mark Schauer (ATEC), dated 3 June 2019, last accessed 24 July 2019</ref>]]\nInternational demand for a MALE RPAS capable of being certified for operation within civilian airspace drove General Atomics to develop a version of the platform known by GA-ASI as ''MQ-9B SkyGuardian'', previously called Certifiable Predator B, to make it compliant with European flight regulations to get more sales in European countries.

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 284.</ref>\n\nChopin was born '''Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin''' in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and grew up in [[Warsaw]], which in 1815 became part of [[Congress Poland]]. A [[child prodigy]], he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with [[Franz Liszt]] and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including [[Robert Schumann]]). \n\nAfter a failed engagement to [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]] from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, [[George Sand]]). A brief and unhappy visit to [[Majorca]] with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer [[Jane Stirling]], who also arranged for him to visit [[Scotland]] in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of [[pericarditis]] aggravated by [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two [[piano concerto]]s, a few [[chamber music|chamber pieces]], and some 19 [[Polish songs (Chopin)|songs set to Polish lyrics]]. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ''ballade'']]. His major piano works also include [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]s, [[\u00e9tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, [[prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[sonata]]s, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish [[folk music]], the [[classical music|classical tradition]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&nbsp;S. Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, [[harmony]], and [[musical form]], and his association of music with [[nationalism]], were influential throughout and after the late [[romanticism|Romantic]] period.\n\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of [[#In literature, stage, film and television|numerous films and biographies]] of varying historical fidelity.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Manor house in \u017belazowa Wola.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Chopin's birthplace in [[\u017belazowa Wola]]]]\n\nFryderyk Chopin was born in [[\u017belazowa Wola]],<ref name=\"Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 \">Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 (locs. 115\u2013130).</ref> 46 kilometres ({{convert|46|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) west of Warsaw, in what was then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a Polish state established by [[Napoleon]].

Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace. During this period, Fryderyk was sometimes invited to the [[Belweder|Belweder Palace]] as playmate to the son of the ruler of [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]], [[Grand Duke Constantine Pavlovich of Russia]]; he played the piano for Constantine Pavlovich and composed a march for him. [[Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz]], in his dramatic [[eclogue]], \"''Nasze Przebiegi''\" (\"Our Discourses\", 1818), attested to \"little Chopin's\" popularity.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp. 11\u201312 (locs. 231\u2013248).</ref>\n\n===Education===\nFrom September 1823 to 1826, Chopin attended the Warsaw Lyceum, where he received [[organ (music)|organ]] lessons from the [[Czechs|Czech]] musician [[Wilhelm W\u00fcrfel]] during his first year. In the autumn of 1826 he began a three-year course under the [[Silesia]]n composer [[J\u00f3zef Elsner]] at the [[Fryderyk Chopin University of Music|Warsaw Conservatory]], studying [[music theory]], [[figured bass]], and [[musical composition|composition]].<ref name=\"Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a71, para. 5.</ref>{{refn|The Conservatory was affiliated with the [[University of Warsaw]]; hence Chopin is counted among the [[University of Warsaw#Notable alumni|university's alumni]].|group=n}} Throughout this period he continued to compose and to give recitals in concerts and salons in Warsaw. He was engaged by the inventors of the \"aeolomelodicon\" (a combination of piano and mechanical organ), and on this instrument, in May 1825 he performed his own improvisation and part of a concerto by [[Ignaz Moscheles|Moscheles]]. The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the \"aeolopantaleon\") before [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his [[Rondo in C minor (Chopin)|Rondo Op. 1]]. This was the first of his works to be commercially published and earned him his first mention in the foreign press, when the Leipzig ''[[Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung|Allgemeine Musikalische Zeitung]]'' praised his \"wealth of musical ideas\".<ref>Walker (2018), pp. 83\u201384.</ref>\n[[File:J\u00f3zef Elsner.PNG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[J\u00f3zef Elsner]] (after 1853)]]\nDuring 1824\u201328 Chopin spent his vacations away from Warsaw, at a number of locales.{{refn|At [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]] (in 1824&nbsp;\u2013 perhaps his first solo travel away from home&nbsp;\u2013 and in 1825), [[Duszniki-Zdr\u00f3j|Duszniki]] (1826), [[Pomerania]] (1827) and [[Sanniki, Masovian Voivodeship|Sanniki]] (1828).<ref>Szklener (2010), p. 8.</ref>|group=n}} In 1824 and 1825, at [[Szafarnia, Kuyavian-Pomeranian Voivodeship|Szafarnia]], he was a guest of [[Dominik Dziewanowski]], the father of a schoolmate.

During his years in Paris, he was to become acquainted with, among many others, [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Franz Liszt]], [[Ferdinand Hiller]], [[Heinrich Heine]], [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix]], and [[Alfred de Vigny]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 106 (loc. 1678).</ref> Chopin was also acquainted with the poet [[Adam Mickiewicz]], principal of the Polish Literary Society, some of whose verses he set as songs.<ref>Zamoyski (2010), p. 137 (loc. 2164).</ref>\n\nTwo Polish friends in Paris were also to play important roles in Chopin's life there. His fellow student at the Warsaw Conservatory, Julian Fontana, had originally tried unsuccessfully to establish himself in England; Fontana was to become, in the words of Micha\u0142owski and Samson, Chopin's \"general [[servant|factotum]] and copyist\".<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a73, para. 2.</ref>  [[Wojciech Grzyma\u0142a|Albert Grzyma\u0142a]], who in Paris became a wealthy financier and society figure, often acted as Chopin's adviser and \"gradually began to fill the role of elder brother in [his] life.\"<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;106\u201307 (locs. 1678\u20131696).</ref>\n\nAt the end of 1831, Chopin received the first major endorsement from an outstanding contemporary when [[Robert Schumann]], reviewing the Op. 2 Variations in the ''Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung'' (his first published article on music), declared: \"Hats off, gentlemen! A genius.\"<ref>Schumann (1988), pp. 15\u201317.</ref> On 25 February 1832 Chopin gave a debut Paris concert in the \"salons de MM Pleyel\u201c 9 rue Cadet  which drew universal admiration. The critic [[Fran\u00e7ois-Joseph F\u00e9tis]] wrote in the ''[[Revue et gazette musicale]]'': \"Here is a young man who&nbsp;... taking no model, has found, if not a complete renewal of piano music,&nbsp;... an abundance of original ideas of a kind to be found nowhere else&nbsp;...\"<ref>cited in Zamoyski (2010), p. 88 (loc. 1384).</ref> After this concert, Chopin realised that his essentially intimate keyboard technique was not optimal for large concert spaces. Later that year he was introduced to the wealthy [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]] banking family, whose patronage also opened doors for him to other private [[salon (gathering)|salons]] (social gatherings of the aristocracy and artistic and literary elite).<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/> By the end of 1832 Chopin had established himself among the Parisian musical elite and had earned the respect of his peers such as Hiller, Liszt, and Berlioz. He no longer depended financially upon his father, and in the winter of 1832, he began earning a handsome income from publishing his works and teaching piano to affluent students from all over Europe.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, paras. 4\u20135.</ref> This freed him from the strains of public concert-giving, which he disliked.<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\n\n[[File:Maria Wodzi\u0144ska.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]], self-portrait]]\nChopin seldom performed publicly in Paris. In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends. The musicologist [[Arthur Hedley]] has observed that \"As a pianist Chopin was unique in acquiring a reputation of the highest order on the basis of a minimum of public appearances\u2014few more than thirty in the course of his lifetime.\"<ref>Hedley (2005), pp. 263\u201364.</ref> The list of musicians who took part in some of his concerts indicates the richness of Parisian artistic life during this period. Examples include a concert on 23 March 1833, in which Chopin, Liszt, and Hiller performed (on pianos) a [[Harpsichord concertos (J. S. Bach)#Concertos for three harpsichords|concerto by J.S. Bach for three keyboards]]; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil [[Adolphe Gutmann]], [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], and Alkan's teacher [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann|Joseph Zimmermann]] performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th symphony]].<ref>Conway (2012), p. 226 and n. 9.</ref> Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]''; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with [[Maurice Schlesinger]], who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, para. 5. For Schlesinger's international network see Conway (2012), pp. 185\u201387, 238\u201339.</ref>\n\nIn the spring of 1834, Chopin attended the Lower Rhenish Music Festival in [[Aachen|Aix-la-Chapelle]] with Hiller, and it was there that Chopin met Felix Mendelssohn. After the festival, the three visited [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as [[Karl Friedrich Lessing|Lessing]], [[Eduard Bendemann|Bendemann]], [[Eduard Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] and [[Karl Ferdinand Sohn|Sohn]].<ref>Niecks (1980), p. 313.</ref> In 1835 Chopin went to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them. On his way back to Paris, he met old friends from Warsaw, the Wodzi\u0144skis. He had made the acquaintance of their daughter [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska|Maria]] in Poland five years earlier when she was eleven. This meeting prompted him to stay for two weeks in Dresden, when he had previously intended to return to Paris via [[Leipzig]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;118\u201319 (locs. 1861\u20131878).</ref> The sixteen-year-old girl's portrait of the composer is considered, along with Delacroix's, as among Chopin's best likenesses.<ref name=\"demonstrated\"/> In October he finally reached Leipzig, where he met Schumann, [[Clara Schumann|Clara Wieck]] and Mendelssohn, who organised for him a performance of his own oratorio ''[[St. Paul (oratorio)|St. Paul]]'', and who considered him \"a perfect musician\".<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;119\u201320 (locs. 1878\u20131896).</ref> In July 1836 Chopin travelled to [[Marienbad]] and [[Dresden]] to be with the Wodzi\u0144ski family, and in September he proposed to Maria, whose mother Countess Wodzi\u0144ska approved in principle. Chopin went on to Leipzig, where he presented Schumann with his [[Ballades (Chopin)#Ballade No. 1|G minor Ballade]].<ref>Zamoyski (2010), pp.&nbsp;126\u201327 (locs. 1983\u20132001).</ref> At the end of 1836, he sent Maria an album in which his sister Ludwika had inscribed seven of his songs, and his 1835 [[Nocturnes, Op. 27 (Chopin)#Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1|Nocturne in C-sharp minor, Op. 27, No. 1]].<ref>Jachimecki (1937), p. 423.</ref> The anodyne thanks he received from Maria proved to be the last letter he was to have from her.<ref>Chopin (1962), p. 144.</ref>\n\n===Franz Liszt===\n[[File:Franz-liszt-in-hungarian-costume-watercolour-by-josef-friehuber-1838.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Franz Liszt]], [[watercolor]] by [[Josef Kriehuber]], 1838]]\nAlthough it is not known exactly when Chopin first met [[Franz Liszt]] after arriving in Paris, on 12 December 1831 he mentioned in a letter to his friend Woyciechowski that \"I have met [[Gioachino Rossini|Rossini]], [[Luigi Cherubini|Cherubini]], [[Pierre Baillot|Baillot]], etc.\u2014also [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner|Kalkbrenner]]. You would not believe how curious I was about [[Henri Herz|Herz]], Liszt, Hiller, etc.\"<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 31.</ref> Liszt was in attendance at Chopin's Parisian debut on 26 February 1832 at the Salle Pleyel, which led him to remark: \"The most vigorous applause seemed not to suffice to our enthusiasm in the presence of this talented musician, who revealed a new phase of poetic sentiment combined with such happy innovation in the form of his art.\"<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nThe two became friends, and for many years lived close to each other in Paris, Chopin at 38 [[Rue de la Chauss\u00e9e-d'Antin]], and Liszt at the H\u00f4tel de France on the Rue Lafitte, a few blocks away.<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> They performed together on seven occasions between 1833 and 1841. The first, on 2 April 1833, was at a benefit concert organised by Hector Berlioz for his bankrupt Shakespearean actress wife [[Harriet Smithson]], during which they played [[George Onslow (composer)|George Onslow]]'s ''Sonata in F minor'' for piano duet.<ref name=\"Hall 32\">Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 32.</ref> Later joint appearances included a benefit concert for the Benevolent Association of Polish Ladies in Paris.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/> Their last appearance together in public was for a charity concert conducted for the [[Beethoven Monument (Bonn)|Beethoven Monument]] in Bonn, held at the Salle Pleyel and the Paris Conservatory on 25 and 26 April 1841.<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\nAlthough the two displayed great respect and admiration for each other, their friendship was uneasy and had some qualities of a love-hate relationship. [[Harold C. Schonberg]] believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\">Schonberg (1987), p. 151.</ref> and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 33.</ref>  Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them  prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\"<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\">Walker (1988), p. 184.</ref> However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress [[Marie d'Agoult]]'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with [[George Sand]].<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\n===George Sand===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chopin at 28, from [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s [[Portrait of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand|joint portrait of Chopin and Sand]], 1838]]\nIn 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Short (under five feet, or 152&nbsp;cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,<ref>Schonberg (1987), p. 152.</ref> she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person ''la Sand'' is.

He passed the winter in unremitting illness, but gave occasional lessons and was visited by friends, including Delacroix and Franchomme. Occasionally he played, or accompanied the singing of [[Delfina Potocka]], for his friends. During the summer of 1849, his friends found him an apartment in [[Chaillot]], out of the centre of the city, for which the rent was secretly subsidised by an admirer, Princess Obreskoff.

All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either [[piano concerto]]s, songs or [[chamber music]].<ref>Hedley (1980), p. 298.</ref>\n\nChopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], Mozart and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]]; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a76 para 7.</ref> Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of [[Italian opera]]. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his ''[[fioritura|fioriture]]'') is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the [[mode (music)|modes]] and features of the music of his native country, such as [[drone (music)|drones]].<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.). \u00a76, paras 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nChopin took the new salon genre of the [[nocturne]], invented by the Irish composer [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write [[ballade (classical music)|ballades]]<ref name=\"scholesballade\"/> and [[Scherzo|scherzi]] as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.&nbsp;28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert [[\u00e9tude]], already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi, and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.&nbsp;10 published in 1833, Op.&nbsp;25 in 1837).<ref>Ferguson (1980), pp. 304\u201305.</ref>\n\nChopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|Chopin's mazurkas]], while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the ''[[mazurka|mazurek]]''), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map.\"<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177.</ref> The series of seven [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op.&nbsp;26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.<ref name=\"chopin13\"/> His [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\">Jones (1998a), p. 162.</ref>\n\n===Titles, opus numbers and editions===\nSome of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the [[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude]] (Op.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;12), and the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' (Op.&nbsp;64,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1). However, except for his ''Funeral March'', the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.<ref>Hedley (2005), p. 264; Kennedy (1980), p. 130, ''Chopin, Fryderyk''.</ref> There is no evidence to suggest that the ''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.<ref>Hedley and Brown (1980), p. 294.</ref> The ''Funeral March'', the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.&nbsp;35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.<ref>Kallberg (2001), pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe last [[opus number]] that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66\u201373), published in 1855.<ref name=\"Piano Society\"/> In 1857, [[Polish songs (Chopin)|17 Polish songs]] that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.<ref name=\"Classical Archives\"/>\n\nWorks published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobyla\u0144ska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist [[Krystyna Kobyla\u0144ska]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/what-does-the-kk-mean/ \"What does the \"KK\" Mean?\"], The Chopin Project Website, accessed 21 December 2013.</ref>\n\nChopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.<ref>Atwood (1999), pp.&nbsp;166\u201367.</ref> His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.<ref>de Val (1998), p. 127.</ref> The first collected edition was by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] (1878\u20131902).<ref>de Val (1998), p. 129.</ref> Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish \"National Edition\", edited by [[Jan Ekier]], both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 306.</ref><ref>Jan Ekier, \"[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 Foundation for the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809202325/http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 |date=9 August 2014 }}\" on the website of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, (accessed 4 August 2014).</ref>\n\nChopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of \u2018first editions\u2019. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/contexts/historical-background/|website=Chopin's First Editions Online|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Form and harmony===\n[[File:Chopin Museum in Warsaw 03.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Chopin's last ([[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]]) piano, on which he composed in 1848\u201349.

Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme\", and adds that \"the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]] Op.&nbsp;60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody.\"<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;161\u201362.</ref> Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes.\"<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|pos=left|filename=Giorgi Latsabidze Plays Mazurka.ogg|title=Mazurka in A minor, Op. 17, No. 4|description=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano|filename2=Muriel-Nguyen-Xuan-Chopin-valse-opus64-1.ogg\n|title2=Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1 (so-called ''Minute Waltz'')|description2=Muriel Nguyen Xuan, piano|filename3=Frederic Chopin - Opus 10 - Twelve Grand Etudes - c minor.ogg|title3 = \u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (so-called ''Revolutionary'')|description3 = [[Martha Goldstein]] playing an 1851 [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard|\u00c9rard]] piano|filename4=Chopin Prelude Op 28 N 15 Giorgi Latsabidze performs.ogg|title4=Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 in D-flat major|description4=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano}}\nChopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward [[ternary form|ternary]] or episodic form, sometimes with a [[coda (music)|coda]].<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177; Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref> The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses.

As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.<ref>Reiss (1980), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe 21 [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]] are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.<ref>Brown (1980), p. 258.</ref>\n\nChopin's \u00e9tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\">Jones (1998a), p. 160.</ref> He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\u2014for instance playing double [[third (chord)|thirds]] ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 6 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;6]]), playing in octaves ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 10 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;10]]), and playing repeated notes ([[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 7 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp; 7]]).<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;160\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\".<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 161.</ref> Inspired by J.S. Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Chopin's preludes move up the [[circle of fifths]] (rather than Bach's [[chromatic scale]] sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 83.</ref> The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as [[Kenneth Hamilton]] suggests: he has noted a recording by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] of 1922, in which the Prelude Op.&nbsp;28 No.&nbsp;7 is followed by the \u00c9tude Op.&nbsp;10 No.&nbsp;5.<ref>Hamilton (2008), pp.&nbsp;101\u201302.</ref>\n\nThe two mature piano sonatas ([[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|No.&nbsp;2]], Op.&nbsp;35, written in 1839 and No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op.&nbsp;35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique\u2014\"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a79 para. 2.</ref> The sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven.

Temperley says that in his works \"novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary [[appoggiatura]]s or [[passing notes]] with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and [[cadence (music)|cadences]] are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ([[neapolitan sixth]]s and [[diminished seventh]]s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys. [[Chord progression]]s sometimes anticipate the shifting [[tonality]] of later composers such as [[Claude Debussy]], as does Chopin's use of modal harmony.<ref>Temperley (1980), pp.&nbsp;302\u201303.</ref>\n\n===Technique and performance style===\n[[File:Op 62-1ms.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|Extract from Chopin Nocturne Op. 62 no. 1 (1846, composer's manuscript)]]\n[[File:Chopin op 62-1 pr.png|thumb|right|upright=1.4|The same passage (1881 [[G. Schirmer Inc.|Schirmer]] edition). The examples show typical use by Chopin of [[trill (music)|trills]], [[grace note]]s and detailed [[pedal (piano)|pedalling]] and [[tempo]] instructions.]]\nIn 1841, [[L\u00e9on Escudier]] wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\"<ref>Samson (1994), p. 136.</ref> Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique. In his ''Projet de m\u00e9thode'' he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering&nbsp;... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 18.</ref> He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 23.</ref> The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double [[octave]]s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of [[grace notes]], and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.<ref>Eigeldinger (1988), pp.&nbsp;18\u201320.</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Bellman]] writes that modern concert performance style\u2014set in the \"[[music school|conservatory]]\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings\u2014militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 149\u201350.</ref> The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 150; the pupil was Emilie von Gretsch.</ref> Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 153\u201354.</ref>  Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery&nbsp;... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe&nbsp;... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\".<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 272.</ref> Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nChopin's music is frequently played with ''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]'', \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".<ref>Latham (n.d.).</ref> There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of ''rubato'' is appropriate for his works. [[Charles Rosen]] comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas&nbsp;... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart&nbsp;... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass&nbsp;... An allied form of this rubato is the [[arpeggio|arpeggiation]] of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil [[Karol Mikuli]], Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 413.</ref>\n\nFriederike M\u00fcller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: \"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full ''[[forte (dynamic)|forte]]'' or softest ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this ''[[legato]]'', ''[[cantabile]]'' style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He\u2014or she\u2014does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced ''rubatos'', as well as exaggerated ''[[Tempo|ritardandos]]''&nbsp;... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\"<ref name=\"nifc14\"/>\n\n===Polish heritage===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin:10px; background:khaki; color:black; width:40em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nThe \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas&nbsp;... which forms&nbsp;... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.&nbsp;... As an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation&nbsp;... For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\"&nbsp;\u2013 an inspired solution to his art&nbsp;\u2013 was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland&nbsp;... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 100%;\" |[[Karol Szymanowski]], 1923<ref>Cited from Szymanowski's 1923 essay, \"Fryderyk Chopin\", in Downes (2001), p. 63 and n. 58.</ref>\n|}With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of [[nationalism]]. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the [[November Uprising]] of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger&nbsp;... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. [[Nicholas I of Russia]]] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\"<ref>Schumann (1988), p. 114.</ref> The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]])<ref>Cooke (1966), pp. 856\u201361.</ref> states that Chopin \"must be ranked first among the first musicians&nbsp;... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation.\"<ref>Liszt (1880), loc. 1503.</ref>\n\nSome modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]] and [[Franciszek Lessel]], who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.<ref>Golos (1960), pp. 439\u201342.</ref> Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.<ref>Milewski (1999), pp. 113\u201321.</ref> [[Richard Taruskin]] impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronising<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 346; see also Rosen (1995), pp. 361\u201363.</ref>\n\nA reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World&nbsp;... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people&nbsp;...\"<ref>Atwood (1999), p. 57.</ref>\n\n===Reception and influence===\n{{See also|List of memorials to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n[[File:Pillar containing Chopin's heart.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Funerary monument on a pillar in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw]], enclosing Chopin's heart]]\nJones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\"<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\"/> He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831\u2014\"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"\u2014and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\"/> While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of [[romanticism]], the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir\u00e9es) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.<ref name=\"Hutchings 1968, p. 137\"/>\n\nChopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', and Chopin later dedicated his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2 in F major]] to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\"/> Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs. A less fraught friendship was with Alkan, with whom he discussed elements of folk music, and who was deeply affected by Chopin's death.<ref>Conway (2012), pp. 229\u201330.</ref>\n\nTwo of Chopin's long-standing pupils, Karol Mikuli (1821\u20131897) and Georges Mathias, were themselves piano teachers and passed on details of his playing to their own students, some of whom (such as [[Raoul Koczalski]]) were to make recordings of his music. Other pianists and composers influenced by Chopin's style include [[Louis Moreau Gottschalk]], \u00c9douard Wolff (1816\u20131880) and Pierre Zimmermann.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 150\u201351.</ref> Debussy dedicated [[\u00c9tudes (Debussy)|his own 1915 piano \u00c9tudes]] to the memory of Chopin; he frequently played Chopin's music during his studies at the [[Paris Conservatoire]], and undertook the editing of Chopin's piano music for the publisher [[Jacques Durand (publisher)|Jacques Durand]].<ref>Wheeldon (2009), {{pp.|55|62}}.</ref>\n\n[[File:Pomnik Fryderyka Chopina w \u0141azienkach (1 of 1).jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Monument in Warsaw|Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin Monument]], [[\u0141azienki Park]], Warsaw]]\nPolish composers of the following generation included virtuosi such as [[Moritz Moszkowski]], but, in the opinion of J.

He has maintained worldwide renown as a leading musician of his era, one whose \"poetic genius was based on a professional technique that was without equal in his generation.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 284.</ref>\n\nChopin was born '''Fryderyk Franciszek Chopin''' in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]] and grew up in [[Warsaw]], which in 1815 became part of [[Congress Poland]]. A [[child prodigy]], he completed his musical education and composed his earlier works in Warsaw before leaving Poland at the age of 20, less than a month before the outbreak of the [[November Uprising|November 1830 Uprising]]. At 21, he settled in Paris. Thereafter\u2014in the last 18 years of his life\u2014he gave only 30 public performances, preferring the more intimate atmosphere of the [[Salon (gathering)|salon]]. He supported himself by selling his compositions and by giving piano lessons, for which he was in high demand. Chopin formed a friendship with [[Franz Liszt]] and was admired by many of his other musical contemporaries (including [[Robert Schumann]]). \n\nAfter a failed engagement to [[Maria Wodzi\u0144ska]] from 1836 to 1837, he maintained an often troubled relationship with the French writer Amantine Dupin (known by her pen name, [[George Sand]]). A brief and unhappy visit to [[Majorca]] with Sand in 1838\u201339 would prove one of his most productive periods of composition. In his final years, he was supported financially by his admirer [[Jane Stirling]], who also arranged for him to visit [[Scotland]] in 1848. For most of his life, Chopin was in poor health. He died in Paris in 1849 at the age of 39, probably of [[pericarditis]] aggravated by [[tuberculosis]].\n\nAll of Chopin's compositions include the piano. Most are for solo piano, though he also wrote two [[piano concerto]]s, a few [[chamber music|chamber pieces]], and some 19 [[Polish songs (Chopin)|songs set to Polish lyrics]]. His piano writing was technically demanding and expanded the limits of the instrument: his own performances were noted for their nuance and sensitivity. Chopin invented the concept of the [[ballade (classical music)#Instrumental ballades|instrumental ''ballade'']]. His major piano works also include [[mazurka]]s, [[waltz]]es, [[nocturne]]s, [[polonaise (dance)|polonaise]]s, [[\u00e9tude]]s, [[impromptu]]s, [[scherzo]]s, [[prelude (music)|preludes]] and [[sonata]]s, some published only posthumously. Among the influences on his style of composition were Polish [[folk music]], the [[classical music|classical tradition]] of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J.&nbsp;S. Bach]], [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]], and [[Franz Schubert|Schubert]], and the atmosphere of the Paris salons of which he was a frequent guest. His innovations in style, [[harmony]], and [[musical form]], and his association of music with [[nationalism]], were influential throughout and after the late [[romanticism|Romantic]] period.\n\nChopin's music, his status as one of music's earliest superstars, his (indirect) association with political insurrection, his high-profile love-life, and his early death have made him a leading symbol of the Romantic era. His works remain popular, and he has been the subject of [[#In literature, stage, film and television|numerous films and biographies]] of varying historical fidelity.\n\n==Life==\n\n===Childhood===\n[[File:Manor house in \u017belazowa Wola.JPG|thumb|left|upright=1.3|Chopin's birthplace in [[\u017belazowa Wola]]]]\n\nFryderyk Chopin was born in [[\u017belazowa Wola]],<ref name=\"Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 \">Zamoyski (2010), pp. 4\u20135 (locs. 115\u2013130).</ref> 46 kilometres ({{convert|46|km|abbr=off|disp=output only}}) west of Warsaw, in what was then the [[Duchy of Warsaw]], a Polish state established by [[Napoleon]].

Fryderyk and his family moved to a building, which still survives, adjacent to the Kazimierz Palace.

The success of this concert led to an invitation to give a recital on a similar instrument (the \"aeolopantaleon\") before [[Alexander I of Russia|Tsar Alexander I]], who was visiting Warsaw; the Tsar presented him with a diamond ring. At a subsequent aeolopantaleon concert on 10 June 1825, Chopin performed his [[Rondo in C minor (Chopin)|Rondo Op. 1]].

In later years he generally gave a single annual concert at the Salle Pleyel, a venue that seated three hundred. He played more frequently at salons but preferred playing at his own Paris apartment for small groups of friends.

Bach for three keyboards]]; and, on 3 March 1838, a concert in which Chopin, his pupil [[Adolphe Gutmann]], [[Charles-Valentin Alkan]], and Alkan's teacher [[Pierre-Joseph-Guillaume Zimmermann|Joseph Zimmermann]] performed Alkan's arrangement, for eight hands, of two movements from [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]]'s [[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|7th symphony]].<ref>Conway (2012), p. 226 and n. 9.</ref> Chopin was also involved in the composition of Liszt's ''[[Hexameron (musical composition)|Hexameron]]''; he wrote the sixth (and final) variation on [[Vincenzo Bellini|Bellini]]'s theme. Chopin's music soon found success with publishers, and in 1833 he contracted with [[Maurice Schlesinger]], who arranged for it to be published not only in France but, through his family connections, also in Germany and England.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d), \u00a72, para. 5.

After the festival, the three visited [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], where Mendelssohn had been appointed musical director. They spent what Mendelssohn described as \"a very agreeable day\", playing and discussing music at his piano, and met [[Friedrich Wilhelm Schadow]], director of the Academy of Art, and some of his eminent pupils such as [[Karl Friedrich Lessing|Lessing]], [[Eduard Bendemann|Bendemann]], [[Eduard Hildebrandt|Hildebrandt]] and [[Karl Ferdinand Sohn|Sohn]].<ref>Niecks (1980), p. 313.</ref> In 1835 Chopin went to [[Karlovy Vary|Carlsbad]], where he spent time with his parents; it was the last time he would see them.

[[Harold C. Schonberg]] believes that Chopin displayed a \"tinge of jealousy and spite\" towards Liszt's virtuosity on the piano,<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\">Schonberg (1987), p. 151.</ref> and others have also argued that he had become enchanted with Liszt's theatricality, showmanship and success.<ref>Hall-Swadley (2011), p. 33.</ref>  Liszt was the dedicatee of Chopin's Op. 10 \u00c9tudes, and his performance of them  prompted the composer to write to Hiller, \"I should like to rob him of the way he plays my studies.\"<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\">Walker (1988), p. 184.</ref> However, Chopin expressed annoyance in 1843 when Liszt performed one of his nocturnes with the addition of numerous intricate embellishments, at which Chopin remarked that he should play the music as written or not play it at all, forcing an apology. Most biographers of Chopin state that after this the two had little to do with each other, although in his letters dated as late as 1848 he still referred to him as \"my friend Liszt\".<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Some commentators point to events in the two men's romantic lives which led to a rift between them; there are claims that Liszt had displayed jealousy of his mistress [[Marie d'Agoult]]'s obsession with Chopin, while others believe that Chopin had become concerned about Liszt's growing relationship with [[George Sand]].<ref name=\"Hall 32\"/>\n\n===George Sand===\n[[File:Eug\u00e8ne Ferdinand Victor Delacroix 043.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chopin at 28, from [[Eug\u00e8ne Delacroix|Delacroix]]'s [[Portrait of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin and George Sand|joint portrait of Chopin and Sand]], 1838]]\nIn 1836, at a party hosted by Marie d'Agoult, Chopin met the French author George Sand (born [Amantine] Aurore [Lucile] Dupin).<ref name=\"Schonberg 151\"/> Short (under five feet, or 152&nbsp;cm), dark, big-eyed and a cigar smoker,<ref>Schonberg (1987), p. 152.</ref> she initially repelled Chopin, who remarked, \"What an unattractive person ''la Sand'' is.

All his known works involve the piano, and only a few range beyond solo piano music, as either [[piano concerto]]s, songs or [[chamber music]].<ref>Hedley (1980), p. 298.</ref>\n\nChopin was educated in the tradition of Beethoven, [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]], Mozart and [[Muzio Clementi|Clementi]]; he used Clementi's piano method with his own students. He was also influenced by [[Johann Nepomuk Hummel|Hummel]]'s development of virtuoso, yet Mozartian, piano technique. He cited [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] and Mozart as the two most important composers in shaping his musical outlook.<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a76 para 7.</ref> Chopin's early works are in the style of the \"brilliant\" keyboard pieces of his era as exemplified by the works of [[Ignaz Moscheles]], [[Friedrich Kalkbrenner]], and others. Less direct in the earlier period are the influences of Polish folk music and of [[Italian opera]]. Much of what became his typical style of ornamentation (for example, his ''[[fioritura|fioriture]]'') is taken from singing. His melodic lines were increasingly reminiscent of the [[mode (music)|modes]] and features of the music of his native country, such as [[drone (music)|drones]].<ref>Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.). \u00a76, paras 1\u20134.</ref>\n\nChopin took the new salon genre of the [[nocturne]], invented by the Irish composer [[John Field (composer)|John Field]], to a deeper level of sophistication. He was the first to write [[ballade (classical music)|ballades]]<ref name=\"scholesballade\"/> and [[Scherzo|scherzi]] as individual concert pieces. He essentially established a new genre with his own set of free-standing preludes (Op.&nbsp;28, published 1839). He exploited the poetic potential of the concept of the concert [[\u00e9tude]], already being developed in the 1820s and 1830s by Liszt, Clementi, and Moscheles, in his two sets of studies (Op.&nbsp;10 published in 1833, Op.&nbsp;25 in 1837).<ref>Ferguson (1980), pp. 304\u201305.</ref>\n\nChopin also endowed popular dance forms with a greater range of melody and expression. [[Mazurkas (Chopin)|Chopin's mazurkas]], while originating in the traditional Polish dance (the ''[[mazurka|mazurek]]''), differed from the traditional variety in that they were written for the concert hall rather than the dance hall; as J. Barrie Jones puts it, \"it was Chopin who put the mazurka on the European musical map.\"<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177.</ref> The series of seven [[Polonaises (Chopin)|polonaises]] published in his lifetime (another nine were published posthumously), beginning with the Op.&nbsp;26 pair (published 1836), set a new standard for music in the form.<ref name=\"chopin13\"/> His [[Waltzes (Chopin)|waltzes]] were also written specifically for the salon recital rather than the ballroom and are frequently at rather faster tempos than their dance-floor equivalents.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\">Jones (1998a), p. 162.</ref>\n\n===Titles, opus numbers and editions===\nSome of Chopin's well-known pieces have acquired descriptive titles, such as the [[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (Chopin)|''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude]] (Op.&nbsp;10,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;12), and the ''[[Minute Waltz]]'' (Op.&nbsp;64,&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1). However, except for his ''Funeral March'', the composer never named an instrumental work beyond genre and number, leaving all potential extramusical associations to the listener; the names by which many of his pieces are known were invented by others.<ref>Hedley (2005), p. 264; Kennedy (1980), p. 130, ''Chopin, Fryderyk''.</ref> There is no evidence to suggest that the ''Revolutionary'' \u00c9tude was written with the failed Polish uprising against Russia in mind; it merely appeared at that time.<ref>Hedley and Brown (1980), p. 294.</ref> The ''Funeral March'', the third movement of his Sonata No. 2 (Op.&nbsp;35), the one case where he did give a title, was written before the rest of the sonata, but no specific event or death is known to have inspired it.<ref>Kallberg (2001), pp. 4\u20138.</ref>\n\nThe last [[opus number]] that Chopin himself used was 65, allocated to the Cello Sonata in G minor. He expressed a deathbed wish that all his unpublished manuscripts be destroyed. At the request of the composer's mother and sisters, however, his musical executor Julian Fontana selected 23 unpublished piano pieces and grouped them into eight further opus numbers (Opp. 66\u201373), published in 1855.<ref name=\"Piano Society\"/> In 1857, [[Polish songs (Chopin)|17 Polish songs]] that Chopin wrote at various stages of his life were collected and published as Op. 74, though their order within the opus did not reflect the order of composition.<ref name=\"Classical Archives\"/>\n\nWorks published since 1857 have received alternative catalogue designations instead of opus numbers. The present standard musicological reference for Chopin's works is the Kobyla\u0144ska Catalogue (usually represented by the initials 'KK'), named for its compiler, the Polish musicologist [[Krystyna Kobyla\u0144ska]].<ref>[http://chopin.wordpress.com/2007/12/11/what-does-the-kk-mean/ \"What does the \"KK\" Mean?\"], The Chopin Project Website, accessed 21 December 2013.</ref>\n\nChopin's original publishers included Maurice Schlesinger and Camille Pleyel.<ref>Atwood (1999), pp.&nbsp;166\u201367.</ref> His works soon began to appear in popular 19th-century piano anthologies.<ref>de Val (1998), p. 127.</ref> The first collected edition was by [[Breitkopf & H\u00e4rtel]] (1878\u20131902).<ref>de Val (1998), p. 129.</ref> Among modern scholarly editions of Chopin's works are the version under the name of [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski|Paderewski]] published between 1937 and 1966 and the more recent Polish \"National Edition\", edited by [[Jan Ekier]], both of which contain detailed explanations and discussions regarding choices and sources.<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 306.</ref><ref>Jan Ekier, \"[http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 Foundation for the National Edition of the Works of Fryderyk Chopin] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809202325/http://en.chopin.nifc.pl/chopin/institutions/text/cat/1/page/2/id/1527 |date=9 August 2014 }}\" on the website of the Fryderyk Chopin Institute, (accessed 4 August 2014).</ref>\n\nChopin published his music in France, England and the German states due to the copyright laws of the time. As such there are often three different kinds of \u2018first editions\u2019. Each edition is different from the other, as Chopin edited them separately and at times he did some revision to the music while editing it. Furthermore, Chopin provided his publishers with varying sources, including autographs, annotated proofsheets, and scribal copies. Only recently have these differences gained greater recognition.<ref>{{cite web|title=Historical Background|url=http://www.chopinonline.ac.uk/cfeo/contexts/historical-background/|website=Chopin's First Editions Online|accessdate=14 September 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Form and harmony===\n[[File:Chopin Museum in Warsaw 03.JPG|thumb|upright=1.5|Chopin's last ([[Pleyel et Cie|Pleyel]]) piano, on which he composed in 1848\u201349.

Barrie Jones suggests that \"amongst the works that Chopin intended for concert use, the four ballades and four scherzos stand supreme\", and adds that \"the [[Barcarole (Chopin)|Barcarolle]] Op.&nbsp;60 stands apart as an example of Chopin's rich harmonic palette coupled with an Italianate warmth of melody.\"<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;161\u201362.</ref> Temperley opines that these works, which contain \"immense variety of mood, thematic material and structural detail\", are based on an extended \"departure and return\" form; \"the more the middle section is extended, and the further it departs in key, mood and theme, from the opening idea, the more important and dramatic is the reprise when it at last comes.\"<ref>Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref>\n{{Listen|type=music|pos=left|filename=Giorgi Latsabidze Plays Mazurka.ogg|title=Mazurka in A minor, Op. 17, No. 4|description=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano|filename2=Muriel-Nguyen-Xuan-Chopin-valse-opus64-1.ogg\n|title2=Waltz in D-flat major, Op. 64, No. 1 (so-called ''Minute Waltz'')|description2=Muriel Nguyen Xuan, piano|filename3=Frederic Chopin - Opus 10 - Twelve Grand Etudes - c minor.ogg|title3 = \u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 12 (so-called ''Revolutionary'')|description3 = [[Martha Goldstein]] playing an 1851 [[S\u00e9bastien \u00c9rard|\u00c9rard]] piano|filename4=Chopin Prelude Op 28 N 15 Giorgi Latsabidze performs.ogg|title4=Prelude Op. 28, No. 15 in D-flat major|description4=[[Giorgi Latso]], piano}}\nChopin's mazurkas and waltzes are all in straightforward [[ternary form|ternary]] or episodic form, sometimes with a [[coda (music)|coda]].<ref>Jones (1998b), p. 177; Temperley (1980), p. 304.</ref> The mazurkas often show more folk features than many of his other works, sometimes including modal scales and harmonies and the use of drone basses.

As with the traditional polonaise, Chopin's works are in triple time and typically display a martial rhythm in their melodies, accompaniments, and cadences. Unlike most of their precursors, they also require a formidable playing technique.<ref>Reiss (1980), p. 51.</ref>\n\nThe 21 [[Nocturnes (Chopin)|nocturnes]] are more structured, and of greater emotional depth, than those of Field (whom Chopin met in 1833). Many of the Chopin nocturnes have middle sections marked by agitated expression (and often making very difficult demands on the performer) which heightens their dramatic character.<ref>Brown (1980), p. 258.</ref>\n\nChopin's \u00e9tudes are largely in straightforward ternary form.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\">Jones (1998a), p. 160.</ref> He used them to teach his own technique of piano playing<ref name=\"rjsfih\"/>\u2014for instance playing double [[third (chord)|thirds]] ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 6 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;6]]), playing in octaves ([[\u00c9tude Op. 25, No. 10 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;25, No.&nbsp;10]]), and playing repeated notes ([[\u00c9tude Op. 10, No. 7 (Chopin)|Op.&nbsp;10, No.&nbsp; 7]]).<ref>Jones (1998a), pp.&nbsp;160\u201361.</ref>\n\nThe preludes, many of which are very brief (some consisting of simple statements and developments of a single theme or figure), were described by Schumann as \"the beginnings of studies\".<ref>Jones (1998a), p. 161.</ref> Inspired by J.S. Bach's ''[[The Well-Tempered Clavier]]'', Chopin's preludes move up the [[circle of fifths]] (rather than Bach's [[chromatic scale]] sequence) to create a prelude in each major and minor tonality.<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 83.</ref> The preludes were perhaps not intended to be played as a group, and may even have been used by him and later pianists as generic preludes to others of his pieces, or even to music by other composers, as [[Kenneth Hamilton]] suggests: he has noted a recording by [[Ferruccio Busoni]] of 1922, in which the Prelude Op.&nbsp;28 No.&nbsp;7 is followed by the \u00c9tude Op.&nbsp;10 No.&nbsp;5.<ref>Hamilton (2008), pp.&nbsp;101\u201302.</ref>\n\nThe two mature piano sonatas ([[Piano Sonata No. 2 (Chopin)|No.&nbsp;2]], Op.&nbsp;35, written in 1839 and No.&nbsp;3, Op.&nbsp;58, written in 1844) are in four movements. In Op.&nbsp;35, Chopin was able to combine within a formal large musical structure many elements of his virtuosic piano technique\u2014\"a kind of dialogue between the public pianism of the brilliant style and the German sonata principle\".<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">Micha\u0142owski and Samson (n.d.), \u00a79 para. 2.</ref> The sonata has been considered as showing the influences of both Bach and Beethoven.

Temperley says that in his works \"novel harmonic effects frequently result from the combination of ordinary [[appoggiatura]]s or [[passing notes]] with melodic figures of accompaniment\", and [[cadence (music)|cadences]] are delayed by the use of chords outside the home key ([[neapolitan sixth]]s and [[diminished seventh]]s), or by sudden shifts to remote keys.

The examples show typical use by Chopin of [[trill (music)|trills]], [[grace note]]s and detailed [[pedal (piano)|pedalling]] and [[tempo]] instructions.]]\nIn 1841, [[L\u00e9on Escudier]] wrote of a recital given by Chopin that year, \"One may say that Chopin is the creator of a school of piano and a school of composition. In truth, nothing equals the lightness, the sweetness with which the composer preludes on the piano; moreover nothing may be compared to his works full of originality, distinction and grace.\"<ref>Samson (1994), p. 136.</ref> Chopin refused to conform to a standard method of playing and believed that there was no set technique for playing well. His style was based extensively on his use of a very independent finger technique. In his ''Projet de m\u00e9thode'' he wrote: \"Everything is a matter of knowing good fingering&nbsp;... we need no less to use the rest of the hand, the wrist, the forearm and the upper arm.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 18.</ref> He further stated: \"One needs only to study a certain position of the hand in relation to the keys to obtain with ease the most beautiful quality of sound, to know how to play short notes and long notes, and [to attain] unlimited dexterity.\"<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 23.</ref> The consequences of this approach to technique in Chopin's music include the frequent use of the entire range of the keyboard, passages in double [[octave]]s and other chord groupings, swiftly repeated notes, the use of [[grace notes]], and the use of contrasting rhythms (four against three, for example) between the hands.<ref>Eigeldinger (1988), pp.&nbsp;18\u201320.</ref>\n\n[[Jonathan Bellman]] writes that modern concert performance style\u2014set in the \"[[music school|conservatory]]\" tradition of late 19th- and 20th-century music schools, and suitable for large auditoria or recordings\u2014militates against what is known of Chopin's more intimate performance technique.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 149\u201350.</ref> The composer himself said to a pupil that \"concerts are never real music, you have to give up the idea of hearing in them all the most beautiful things of art.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 150; the pupil was Emilie von Gretsch.</ref> Contemporary accounts indicate that in performance, Chopin avoided rigid procedures sometimes incorrectly attributed to him, such as \"always crescendo to a high note\", but that he was concerned with expressive phrasing, rhythmic consistency and sensitive colouring.<ref>Bellman (2000), pp. 153\u201354.</ref>  Berlioz wrote in 1853 that Chopin \"has created a kind of chromatic embroidery&nbsp;... whose effect is so strange and piquant as to be impossible to describe&nbsp;... virtually nobody but Chopin himself can play this music and give it this unusual turn\".<ref>Cited in Eigeldinger (1988), p. 272.</ref> Hiller wrote that \"What in the hands of others was elegant embellishment, in his hands became a colourful wreath of flowers.\"<ref>Cited in Bellman (2000), p. 154.</ref>\n\nChopin's music is frequently played with ''[[Tempo rubato|rubato]]'', \"the practice in performance of disregarding strict time, 'robbing' some note-values for expressive effect\".<ref>Latham (n.d.).</ref> There are differing opinions as to how much, and what type, of ''rubato'' is appropriate for his works. [[Charles Rosen]] comments that \"most of the written-out indications of rubato in Chopin are to be found in his mazurkas&nbsp;... It is probable that Chopin used the older form of rubato so important to Mozart&nbsp;... [where] the melody note in the right hand is delayed until after the note in the bass&nbsp;... An allied form of this rubato is the [[arpeggio|arpeggiation]] of the chords thereby delaying the melody note; according to Chopin's pupil [[Karol Mikuli]], Chopin was firmly opposed to this practice.\"<ref>Rosen (1995), p. 413.</ref>\n\nFriederike M\u00fcller, a pupil of Chopin, wrote: \"[His] playing was always noble and beautiful; his tones sang, whether in full ''[[forte (dynamic)|forte]]'' or softest ''[[Dynamics (music)|piano]]''. He took infinite pains to teach his pupils this ''[[legato]]'', ''[[cantabile]]'' style of playing. His most severe criticism was 'He\u2014or she\u2014does not know how to join two notes together.' He also demanded the strictest adherence to rhythm. He hated all lingering and dragging, misplaced ''rubatos'', as well as exaggerated ''[[Tempo|ritardandos]]''&nbsp;... and it is precisely in this respect that people make such terrible errors in playing his works.\"<ref name=\"nifc14\"/>\n\n===Polish heritage===\n{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; font-size:85%; margin-left:0; margin-right:0; margin:10px; background:khaki; color:black; width:40em; max-width:25%;\" cellspacing=\"5\"\n| style=\"text-align: left;\" |\nThe \"Polish character\" of Chopin's work is unquestionable; not because he also wrote polonaises and mazurkas&nbsp;... which forms&nbsp;... were often stuffed with alien ideological and literary contents from the outside.&nbsp;... As an artist he looked for forms that stood apart from the literary-dramatic character of music which was a feature of Romanticism, as a Pole he reflected in his work the very essence of the tragic break in the history of the people and instinctively aspired to give the deepest expression of his nation&nbsp;... For he understood that he could invest his music with the most enduring and truly Polish qualities only by liberating art from the confines of dramatic and historical contents. This attitude toward the question of \"national music\"&nbsp;\u2013 an inspired solution to his art&nbsp;\u2013 was the reason why Chopin's works have come to be understood everywhere outside of Poland&nbsp;... Therein lies the strange riddle of his eternal vigour.\n|-\n| style=\"text-align: left; font-size: 100%;\" |[[Karol Szymanowski]], 1923<ref>Cited from Szymanowski's 1923 essay, \"Fryderyk Chopin\", in Downes (2001), p. 63 and n. 58.</ref>\n|}With his mazurkas and polonaises, Chopin has been credited with introducing to music a new sense of [[nationalism]]. Schumann, in his 1836 review of the piano concertos, highlighted the composer's strong feelings for his native Poland, writing that \"Now that the Poles are in deep mourning [after the failure of the [[November Uprising]] of 1830], their appeal to us artists is even stronger&nbsp;... If the mighty autocrat in the north [i.e. [[Nicholas I of Russia]]] could know that in Chopin's works, in the simple strains of his mazurkas, there lurks a dangerous enemy, he would place a ban on his music. Chopin's works are cannon buried in flowers!\"<ref>Schumann (1988), p. 114.</ref> The biography of Chopin published in 1863 under the name of Franz Liszt (but probably written by [[Carolyne zu Sayn-Wittgenstein]])<ref>Cooke (1966), pp. 856\u201361.</ref> states that Chopin \"must be ranked first among the first musicians&nbsp;... individualizing in themselves the poetic sense of an entire nation.\"<ref>Liszt (1880), loc. 1503.</ref>\n\nSome modern commentators have argued against exaggerating Chopin's primacy as a \"nationalist\" or \"patriotic\" composer. George Golos refers to earlier \"nationalist\" composers in Central Europe, including Poland's [[Micha\u0142 Kleofas Ogi\u0144ski]] and [[Franciszek Lessel]], who utilised polonaise and mazurka forms.<ref>Golos (1960), pp. 439\u201342.</ref> Barbara Milewski suggests that Chopin's experience of Polish music came more from \"urbanised\" Warsaw versions than from folk music, and that attempts (by Jachimecki and others) to demonstrate genuine folk music in his works are without basis.<ref>Milewski (1999), pp. 113\u201321.</ref> [[Richard Taruskin]] impugns Schumann's attitude toward Chopin's works as patronising<ref>Taruskin (2010), pp. 344\u201345.</ref> and comments that Chopin \"felt his Polish patriotism deeply and sincerely\" but consciously modelled his works on the tradition of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert, and Field.<ref>Taruskin (2010), p. 346; see also Rosen (1995), pp. 361\u201363.</ref>\n\nA reconciliation of these views is suggested by William Atwood: \"Undoubtedly [Chopin's] use of traditional musical forms like the polonaise and mazurka roused nationalistic sentiments and a sense of cohesiveness amongst those Poles scattered across Europe and the New World&nbsp;... While some sought solace in [them], others found them a source of strength in their continuing struggle for freedom. Although Chopin's music undoubtedly came to him intuitively rather than through any conscious patriotic design, it served all the same to symbolize the will of the Polish people&nbsp;...\"<ref>Atwood (1999), p. 57.</ref>\n\n===Reception and influence===\n{{See also|List of memorials to Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Chopin}}\n[[File:Pillar containing Chopin's heart.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|Funerary monument on a pillar in [[Holy Cross Church, Warsaw]], enclosing Chopin's heart]]\nJones comments that \"Chopin's unique position as a composer, despite the fact that virtually everything he wrote was for the piano, has rarely been questioned.\"<ref name=\"Jones 1998a, p. 160\"/> He also notes that Chopin was fortunate to arrive in Paris in 1831\u2014\"the artistic environment, the publishers who were willing to print his music, the wealthy and aristocratic who paid what Chopin asked for their lessons\"\u2014and these factors, as well as his musical genius, also fuelled his contemporary and later reputation.<ref name=\"Jones 1998a p 162\"/> While his illness and his love-affairs conform to some of the stereotypes of [[romanticism]], the rarity of his public recitals (as opposed to performances at fashionable Paris soir\u00e9es) led Arthur Hutchings to suggest that \"his lack of [[Lord Byron|Byronic]] flamboyance [and] his aristocratic reclusiveness make him exceptional\" among his romantic contemporaries, such as Liszt and Henri Herz.<ref name=\"Hutchings 1968, p. 137\"/>\n\nChopin's qualities as a pianist and composer were recognised by many of his fellow musicians. Schumann named a piece for him in his suite ''[[Carnaval (Schumann)|Carnaval]]'', and Chopin later dedicated his [[Ballade No. 2 (Chopin)|Ballade No. 2 in F major]] to Schumann. Elements of Chopin's music can be traced in many of Liszt's later works.<ref name=\"Walker 1988 184\"/> Liszt later transcribed for piano six of Chopin's Polish songs.

American soldiers nicknamed the road running past the manor \"Bloody Gulch\", after a place mentioned in a [[Destry Rides Again|popular western movie]].\n\n== Battle ==\nWhen the 101st Airborne entered the town of Carentan on June 12, 1944 (D-Day + 6) after [[Battle of Carentan|heavy fighting]] on the two previous days, they met relatively light resistance. The bulk of the surviving German defenders (from the 6th Fallschirmj\u00e4ger Regiment) had withdrawn to the southwest the previous night after a heavy [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] naval and [[artillery]] bombardment. Both sides realized the importance of the town: for the Americans, it was a link between [[Utah Beach]] and [[Omaha Beach]], and would provide a base for further attacks deeper into German-occupied France. For the Germans, recapturing Carentan would be the first step towards driving a wedge between the two U.S. landing beaches, severely disrupting and possibly even destroying the Allied invasion.\n\nThe remnants of the 6th Fallschirmj\u00e4ger resupplied and were reinforced by [[assault guns]] and [[panzergrenadier]]s of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division on the night of June 12\u201313. The combined force counterattacked northeast towards Carentan at dawn on June 13, just as the 506th and 501st PIR were attacking southwest to enlarge the American defensive perimeter around the town. The 506th took the brunt of the attack, and by 10:30&nbsp;a.m., the outnumbered and outgunned paratroopers were pushed almost back to the outskirts of the town.\n\nUnder intense German fire, F Company of the 506th's left flank broke and fell back. This exposed D Company's right flank, who also fell back, leaving [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|E Company]] all alone. Cpt. Thomas P. Mulvey, the [[commanding officer]] of F Company,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.506infantry.org/hiswwii/his2ndbnwwiiarticle15.html |title=History 2nd Bn. |work=506infantry.org |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120805024810/http://www.506infantry.org/hiswwii/his2ndbnwwiiarticle15.html |archivedate=August 5, 2012 }}</ref> was relieved on the spot by the battalion commander.\n\nWhen a German tank attempted to penetrate the left flank, two soldiers of E Company successfully destroyed it with a [[bazooka]]. Meanwhile, battalion headquarters stopped the retreat of D and F companies, pushing them forward 150 meters to cover the left flank.<ref name=\"Band of Brothers\">{{cite book |last= Ambrose |first= Stephen E. |coauthors= |title= [[Band of Brothers (book)|Band of Brothers]] |publisher= |date=September 2001 |isbn= 0-7434-2990-7}}</ref> The 2nd [[Battalion]] of the 502nd PIR took up positions to the right of the 506th, but by 1:00&nbsp;p.m. they too had suffered many casualties, and the German attack was on the verge of breaking through their defenses.\n\nAt this critical point, sixty [[tank]]s from [[Combat command|Combat Command]] A of the [[U.S. 2nd Armored Division|2nd Armored Division]] and accompanied by infantry of the [[29th Infantry Division (United States)|29th Division]],<ref name=\"Band of Brothers\"/> counterattacked southwest from Carentan at 4:30&nbsp;p.m.,<ref name=\"Band of Brothers\"/> inflicting severe casualties on the Germans and forcing them to withdraw at the loss of 4 tanks.<ref>{{Cite book|title=2nd Armored Division|last=Smith|first=Steven|publisher=Ian Allan Ltd|year=2003|isbn=0739437712|location=|pages=24}}</ref> The American victory led to the linkup of forces from Utah and Omaha beaches, creating a secure [[lodgement]] area for further American operations.\n\nThe actions of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment during the Graignes incident (better known as the [[Battle of Graignes]]) south-east of Carentan, played a part in the successful capture of Carentan and the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Had the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped the advance of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, it is possible that the German division could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. Furthermore, the 507th caused the Germans significant losses in the few days that they were holding Graignes and this likely influenced the battle at the Bloody Gulch.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== In popular culture ==\n;Television\n* ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', an HBO series, in its third episode ''Carentan'' portrays the 506th PIR's part in the battle.\n;Video games\n* ''[[Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30]]'' and ''[[Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood]]'' include the Battle of Bloody Gulch.\n* ''[[Company of Heroes]]'' also features the defense of Carentan.\n* ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'' features a multiplayer map set in Carentan.\n* ''[[Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45]]'' [[Mod (computer gaming)|modification]] ''[[Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45]]'' features a multiplayer Carentan map.\n* ''[[Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad]]'' modification ''Heroes of the West'' features a multiplayer Carentan map.\n''[[Call of Duty: WW2 modification]]'' features a multiplayer Carentan map.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/BOOKS/WWII/utah/utah5.htm| chapter =\"The Battle of Carentan, 8\u201315 June\" | url = http://www.history.army.mil/BOOKS/WWII/utah/utah.htm| title = Utah Beach to Cherbourg| id = CMH Pub 100-12| year = 1990| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}\n* {{cite book | title = Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Normandy | author = [[Donald Burgett]] | year = 2000 | publisher = Dell Publishing | isbn = 0-440-23630-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/currahee00dona }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers4.html \"The Battle of Bloody Gulch\" (near the bottom of the page) - www.101airborneww2.com]\n\n[[Category:1944 in France]]\n[[Category:Military history of Normandy|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:Operation Overlord|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:History of Manche]]\n[[Category:Battles of World War II involving Germany|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:Last stand battles|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:June 1944 events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict = Battle of Bloody Gulch\n| partof = the [[Battle of Carentan]], [[Operation Overlord|Battle of Normandy]]\n| image = Carentan.jpg\n| image_size = 250\n| caption = Battle of Carentan\n| date = June 13, 1944\n| place = [[Manoir de Donville]], [[M\u00e9autis]], [[Normandy]], France\n| coordinates = {{Coord|49|17|40|N|1|16|50|W|type:event_region:FR|display=inline,title}}\n| territory = \n| result = U.S. victory\n| status = \n| combatant1 = {{flag|United States|1912}}\n| combatant2 = {{flagcountry|Nazi Germany}}\n| combatant3 = \n| commander1 = {{flagicon|USA|1912}} Maj.

For the Germans, recapturing Carentan would be the first step towards driving a wedge between the two U.S. landing beaches, severely disrupting and possibly even destroying the Allied invasion.\n\nThe remnants of the 6th Fallschirmj\u00e4ger resupplied and were reinforced by [[assault guns]] and [[panzergrenadier]]s of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division on the night of June 12\u201313. The combined force counterattacked northeast towards Carentan at dawn on June 13, just as the 506th and 501st PIR were attacking southwest to enlarge the American defensive perimeter around the town. The 506th took the brunt of the attack, and by 10:30&nbsp;a.m., the outnumbered and outgunned paratroopers were pushed almost back to the outskirts of the town.\n\nUnder intense German fire, F Company of the 506th's left flank broke and fell back. This exposed D Company's right flank, who also fell back, leaving [[E Company, 506th Infantry Regiment (United States)|E Company]] all alone. Cpt. Thomas P.

Had the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped the advance of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, it is possible that the German division could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. Furthermore, the 507th caused the Germans significant losses in the few days that they were holding Graignes and this likely influenced the battle at the Bloody Gulch.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}\n\n== In popular culture ==\n;Television\n* ''[[Band of Brothers (TV miniseries)|Band of Brothers]]'', an HBO series, in its third episode ''Carentan'' portrays the 506th PIR's part in the battle.\n;Video games\n* ''[[Brothers in Arms: Road to Hill 30]]'' and ''[[Brothers in Arms: Earned in Blood]]'' include the Battle of Bloody Gulch.\n* ''[[Company of Heroes]]'' also features the defense of Carentan.\n* ''[[Call of Duty 2]]'' features a multiplayer map set in Carentan.\n* ''[[Red Orchestra: Ostfront 41-45]]'' [[Mod (computer gaming)|modification]] ''[[Darkest Hour: Europe '44-'45]]'' features a multiplayer Carentan map.\n* ''[[Red Orchestra 2: Heroes of Stalingrad]]'' modification ''Heroes of the West'' features a multiplayer Carentan map.\n''[[Call of Duty: WW2 modification]]'' features a multiplayer Carentan map.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{cite book| chapterurl = http://www.history.army.mil/BOOKS/WWII/utah/utah5.htm| chapter =\"The Battle of Carentan, 8\u201315 June\" | url = http://www.history.army.mil/BOOKS/WWII/utah/utah.htm| title = Utah Beach to Cherbourg| id = CMH Pub 100-12| year = 1990| publisher = [[United States Army Center of Military History]]}}\n* {{cite book | title = Currahee!: A Screaming Eagle at Normandy | author = [[Donald Burgett]] | year = 2000 | publisher = Dell Publishing | isbn = 0-440-23630-4 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/currahee00dona }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.101airborneww2.com/bandofbrothers4.html \"The Battle of Bloody Gulch\" (near the bottom of the page) - www.101airborneww2.com]\n\n[[Category:1944 in France]]\n[[Category:Military history of Normandy|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:Operation Overlord|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:History of Manche]]\n[[Category:Battles of World War II involving Germany|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:Last stand battles|Bloody Gulch]]\n[[Category:June 1944 events]]\n", "name_user": "Rodw", "label": "safe", "comment": "Disambiguating links toFallschirmj\u00e4ger(link changed toFallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II); link changed toFallschirmj\u00e4ger (World War II)) usingDisamAssist.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Bloody_Gulch"}

Nine and a half minutes later the around 150 remaining German Fallschirmj\u00e4ger soldiers surrendered to the Norwegian forces led by Sunde.<ref name=\"Hauge261\"/>\n\n===In exile===\nAfter Nygaardsvold's Cabinet requisitioned the Norwegian merchant navy Sunde was ordered to London together with [[\u00d8ivind Lorentzen]] og [[Benjamin Vogt (politician)|Benjamin Vogt]] to build a Norwegian shipping mission in exile; [[Nortraship]].<ref name=\"NK\"/><ref name=\"Riste118\"/> Sunde left Norway from the western port of \u00c5ndalsnes on the British cruiser [[HMS Galatea (71)|HMS ''Galatea'']] in the late hours of 23 April 1940, bringing 200 large crates of [[gold bar]]s belonging to the [[Flight of the Norwegian National Treasury|Norwegian National Treasury]] to the United Kingdom.<ref>\u00d8ksendal 1974: 51, 126</ref> The transport of the gold from the Bank of Norway central bank headquarters in Oslo had been guarded by troops led by his brother, [[Bj\u00f8rn Sunde]], who was also a major in the Norwegian Army.<ref name=\"\u00d8ksendal84\"/> After arriving in London on 25 April Sunde, being a banker, was given the responsibility for the exiled Norwegians' finances. Shortly after arriving in the UK Sunde managed to secure a {{\u00a3|100,000}} credit from [[Hambros Bank]].<ref name=nbl/> On 7 June 1940 Sunde was appointed consultative [[Norwegian Council of State|Councillor of State]] without portfolio,<ref name=\"Riste118\"/><ref name=\"Voks\u00f844\">Voks\u00f8 1995: 44</ref> as one of two new councillors not from the [[Norwegian Labour Party|Labour Party]], the other being the [[Centre Party (Norway)|Agrarian Party's]] [[Anders Fjeldstad]].<ref name=\"Voks\u00f844\"/> The appointment of the two new councillors of state was mentioned in a speech by King Haakon VII in a [[BBC World Service|radio address]] to the occupied Norwegian people on 26 August 1940.<ref name=\"VO\"/> At the same he time continued as a member of the consultative council of the shipping director. From 19 November 1940 to 1 November 1942 he headed the [[Norwegian Ministry of Provisioning and Reconstruction|Norwegian Ministry of Provisioning]]. When that ministry was restructured on 1 November 1942 Arne Sunde continued as [[Ministry of Shipping (Norway)|Minister of Shipping]]<ref name=\"NK\"/><ref name=\"Riste118\"/> until he left the cabinet on 25 June 1945, after the end of the Second World War and the return to Norway of the exiled Norwegian authorities.<ref name=\"NK\"/>\n\n====Conflicts====\nSunde's time in exile was marked by difficulties, with almost constant conflicts with the leaders of Nortraship. While Sunde and most of the other politicians wanted increased political control over the shipping company, the leadership of Nortraship wanted greater freedom to make business decisions. One result of the conflicts was that the Minister of Shipping's authority was decreased by Royal Resolution on 3 September 1943.<ref name=\"NK\"/>\n\nOne of the earliest and most dramatic conflicts involving Sunde in London was when he, supported by fellow non-Labour Party ministers Anders Fjelstad and [[Sven Nielsen]], on 6 August 1940 demanded that Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Halvdan Koht]] resign from his post. The conflict was based in personal animosities between Sunde and Koht, as well as the impression that Koht had been responsible for Norway's failed policy of neutrality before the German attack in April 1940. Sunde withdrew his demands when he realised that he did have the support of [[List of heads of government of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].<ref>Voks\u00f8 1995: 62</ref> At the time of the altercation Sunde was one of the leading candidates to take over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but was instead given the Ministry of Provisioning after [[Trygve Lie]] left that position to become Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref name=\"Riste118\"/>\n\nDespite the many internal conflicts within the various parts of the Norwegian authorities during their time in exile Sunde defended the Cabinet Nygaardsvold during a 21 October 1942 meeting with four priests of the [[Norwegian Church Abroad]] who were accusing Nygaardsvold of excluding people not associated with the Labour Party from influential positions. Sunde stated that in his opinion the Cabinet had always made it a priority to attract competent individuals to its service, regardless of those individuals' political affiliations.<ref>Voks\u00f8 1995: 274</ref>\n\n==Post-war==\n\n===Dissolving Nortraship===\nHaving left the government in 1945, Sunde's first task after the Second World War was to in 1946 head the last board of Nortraship, tasked with dissolving the company.<ref name=nbl/><ref name=\"NK\"/>\n\nFrom 1945 to 1948 Sunde again headed the Oslo office of Bergens Privatbank.<ref name=nbl/>\n\n===UN ambassador===\nIn 1949\u20131952 Arne Sunde was the Norwegian ambassador to the United Nations.<ref name=\"NK\"/> The perhaps pivotal moment of his career at the United Nations came on 7 July 1950 when he, as President of the Security Council,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/depts/dhl/resguide/scpres1950.htm |title=Presidents of the Security Council : 1950\u20131959 |accessdate=16 November 2008 |publisher=United Nations |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110828045749/http://www.un.org/depts/dhl/resguide/scpres1950.htm |archivedate=28 August 2011 |df=dmy }}</ref> led the meeting that adopted the [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 84]], recommending United Nations member states to assist the [[South Korea|Republic of Korea]] in resisting [[Korean War#Invasion of South Korea|the invasion]] initiated some two weeks earlier by the [[North Korea|Democratic People's Republic of Korea]].<ref name=\"Time1\">{{cite news |title=Strength on Double Seven |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,934971,00.html |work=Time |date=17 July 1950 |accessdate=16 November 2008 }}</ref> The resolution paved the way for a United States-led [[United Nations Command (Korea)|UN force]] in the Korean War.<ref>{{cite paper | title=84 (1950) Resolution of 7 July 1950 | version= | pages=5\u20136 | publisher=United Nations | date=7 July 1950 | url=http://daccessdds.un.org/doc/RESOLUTION/GEN/NR0/064/97/IMG/NR006497.pdf?OpenElement | format=[[Portable Document Format]] | id= | accessdate=16 November 2008 }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> During the negotiations leading up to the resolution Sunde clashed with US ambassador [[Warren Austin|Warren R.

Major Sunde demanded an unconditional surrender within 10 minutes or else he would resume the [[artillery]] bombardment of the surrounded German positions.

While Sunde and most of the other politicians wanted increased political control over the shipping company, the leadership of Nortraship wanted greater freedom to make business decisions. One result of the conflicts was that the Minister of Shipping's authority was decreased by Royal Resolution on 3 September 1943.<ref name=\"NK\"/>\n\nOne of the earliest and most dramatic conflicts involving Sunde in London was when he, supported by fellow non-Labour Party ministers Anders Fjelstad and [[Sven Nielsen]], on 6 August 1940 demanded that Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Halvdan Koht]] resign from his post. The conflict was based in personal animosities between Sunde and Koht, as well as the impression that Koht had been responsible for Norway's failed policy of neutrality before the German attack in April 1940. Sunde withdrew his demands when he realised that he did have the support of [[List of heads of government of Norway|Prime Minister]] [[Johan Nygaardsvold]].<ref>Voks\u00f8 1995: 62</ref> At the time of the altercation Sunde was one of the leading candidates to take over the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but was instead given the Ministry of Provisioning after [[Trygve Lie]] left that position to become Minister of Foreign Affairs.<ref name=\"Riste118\"/>\n\nDespite the many internal conflicts within the various parts of the Norwegian authorities during their time in exile Sunde defended the Cabinet Nygaardsvold during a 21 October 1942 meeting with four priests of the [[Norwegian Church Abroad]] who were accusing Nygaardsvold of excluding people not associated with the Labour Party from influential positions.
