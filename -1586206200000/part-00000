The global crisis was felt in all areas of human activity in the personal, social, economic, political and religious fields. By 1969, this small initial group had expanded into numerous groups in Argentina and [[Chile]] and their presence began to be noticed by the military regime of Argentina then in power. In the early years, the Humanist Movement was known as \"[[Siloism]]\", coined from the penname \"Silo\" of its founder [[Mario Rodr\u00edguez Cobos]].  The military regimes of Argentina and Chile began to censor and persecute the members during its meetings, gatherings, public acts and demonstrations. On May 4, 1969, the \"siloists\" gathered in [[Punta de Vacas]], Mendoza, Argentina and the speech \"The Healing of Suffering\" was given by Silo. This marks the foundation day for the Humanist Movement.\n\nThe systematic [[persecution]] of members in Chile and Argentina propelled the expansion of the movement to other countries. These countries included those in North America and Europe (i.e., [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[France]]) and the Asian countries of [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[India]] and [[China]].{{refn|group=n|<!--1--> Hong Kong, then a British protectorate but part of China.}}\n\n== Philippine beginnings (1970\u20131979) ==\n\nIn March 1973, four Chilean movement members{{refn|group=n|<!--2--> Pia Figueroa, Maria, Andres Burgos, Julian Burgos.}} arrived in the Philippines. On September of the previous year, [[martial law]] had been declared and the Philippines was experiencing the violence and suppression of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship. The press was controlled, the leftist and opposition groups had been neutralized or gone underground, curfews were enforced and fear permeated the political and university scenario. The Chilean humanists initially made contact with the students of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].\n\nIn 1974, soloist books ''Transcendental Meditation'' and ''Silo and the Liberation'' (Vol. II) were printed locally.{{refn|group=n|<!--3--> Kui-Feng Publishers, Dodo Cu Unying.}}\n\nIn 1975 the Chileans left and in the next years were followed by Argentinian members{{refn|group=n|<!--4--> Martha and Marcos Pampillon, Norma and Puchi Pelligrini, Fernando Garcia, Tito de Casas.}} who continued the tasks of organizing and transmitting the studies underlying the [[Humanist Movement]]. The Humanist Movement in the following years briefly went through internal stages at different moments and was then referred to as the School. The Synthesis Institute and enter of Inner Religion were launched in order to carry forward its studies but these were later discontinued.\n\nBy 1979, there was a core group of Filipinos who took on the challenge of organizing the movement in the Philippines. In December 1980, \"Silo\" or Mario Rodriguez Cobos visited the Philippines for a working seminar with Filipino members held at the AIT in the University of the Philippines in Diliman, [[Quezon City]].\n\n== Humanize the Earth: The Community (early 1980s) ==\n\nThe 1980s marked the stage of public demonstrations. A worldwide campaign \u201c[[Humanize the Earth]]\u201d was launched in a massive public act on November 1, 1981 at [[Chowpatty Beach]], [[Mumbai]], India by its newly formed socio-cultural organization The [[Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being]]. This was followed by large public acts done in the major cities of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], Europe and India. Speakers from various countries, among them members from India and the Philippines,{{refn|group=n|<!--5--> Ishak Binudin of Zamboanga officially represented Asia as part of the international panel of speakers for the public acts in the different countries.}} represented these public acts.\n\nIn 1982, the Community translated its materials into [[Filipino language|Pilipino]] and published its books{{refn|group=n|<!--6--> An ad hoc publication team called PROCOM was formed. The books were translated to Pilipino by Nestor Cabling and the publishing team included Silvestre Tapales, Boy Sevilla, Saturnino Filipino.}} \u201cAng Mga Gawain ng Komunidad\u201d and \u201cAng Tanawing Panloob\u201d.\n\nThe Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being was registered under the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]{{refn|group=n|<!--7--> SEC, Philippine regulatory body for organizations, associations and business enterprises.}} on July, 1981, with nine incorporators.{{refn|group=n|<!--8--> The nine incorporators of The Community (1981): Ishak Binudin, Osbert Santillan, Melinda Gutierrez, Willa Tecson, Homer Gutierrez, Karina Lagdameo, Silvestre Tapales, Alice Inzon, and Evaine Alleria.}} Meetings and activities{{refn|group=n|<!--9--> University of Sto.

Tuazon at Quezon City, Petrona Apartment in [[Manila]], Carolina's at Quezon Blvd., rented rooms, homes and ad hoc meeting places in schools and universities.\n\nAt this time Filipino society was gradually deteriorating under the Marcos dictatorship and the climate of apathy and suspicion surrounded its initial public activities. However, as a SEC registered organization espousing change through [[non-violence]], the initial obstacles placed by [[government official]]s on its public acts were gradually overcome. A flurry of public events and organizing activities marked the next three years carrying the banner \u201cHumanize the Earth\u201d. This was marked by numerous cultural open-air presentations,{{refn|group=n|<!--10--> Hugo Park in Sta.

The Community UP Chapter organized the \u201cHumanist Week\u201d composed of exhibits, film showing, seminars and workshops (April 30 to May 6, 1984, Diliman Campus in Quezon City). Workshops such as \"Student Power for Non-Violence\" were organized in schools and universities.\n\nOn May 4, 1984, the Movement in the Philippines launched a public concert called \"A Day of Joy\" held at the [[Glorietta Park]] in Makati.{{refn|group=n|<!--18--> Day of Joy:}}\n\nThere were metro-wide signature campaigns{{refn|group=n|<!--19--> \u201dLagda Laban Sa Karahasan\u201d (in favor of active non-violence), \u201c1000 Friends for Peace\u201d, \u201cLagda ng Bayan\u201d (signature campaign to abolish the penalties attached to the right of suffrage).}} done to create awareness on the violence, get support and participation, and to address [[social issues]].

Business [[investment]]s were pulling out, the economic and political future bleak. There was an exodus of Filipinos who left the country to look for better prospects or to seek [[political asylum]]. The majority of Filipinos were getting fed up but kept their views to themselves; in general, avoiding public outcry due to adverse reaction from the repressive government. It was in this general repressed scenario that The Community launched its public acts. Denouncements were made against violence, and active non-violence was proposed as a way of action. Forums, workshops, lectures, slide presentations and film showings were held in private as well as public municipal halls.\n\nOn August 21, 1983, the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno Aquino]], Marcos\u2019 political opponent, created ripples in Philippine society. It broke the political stupor of the Filipinos and their discontent could not be silenced anymore.\n\n== Humanist Party (1984\u20131989) ==\n\nIn 1984, the Humanist Movement, as an international structure, simultaneously launched the Humanist Party in different parts of the world. The [[Humanist Party]] is a [[political party]] to carry forward the humanist aspirations in the political arena. In 1984, a team of Italian humanists{{refn|group=n|<!--24--> Agostino Lotti, Claudio Miconi, Tomas Smidth, later Luciano Lagatola, Luis Milani.}} came to the Philippines to help establish the Humanist Party.\n\nIn 1985, it launched national campaigns with signature campaigns{{refn|group=n|<!--25--> \"Signature Campaign Laban Sa PDA\u201d (Preventive Detention Action)\", \"Makataong Pagsahod Sa Manggagawang Filipino\", \u201cBatas ng Pananagutang Pampulitika\u201d.}} against the Preventive Detention Action, [[Pasya ng Bayan]] (people's vote to oust Marcos), [[Magkaisa]] (awareness campaign against traditional political parties with the proposal for the people to organize themselves), labor and [[human rights]]. In 1985, The Humanist Party participated in labor rallies, conducted surveys and free medical and dental clinics. It organized chapters in the NCR, northern and southern [[Luzon]], and Mindanao{{refn|group=n|<!--26--> In the NCR, HP chapters were organized in Sta. Cruz, Manila (Patricio David), Manila Council (Scotty Estrera, Cora Cabue\u0148os, Richard Jacinto, Tess Tapang, Babes Leyretana, Sarita de Guzman), U.P. Diliman (Eloisa Bustamante), Makati (Rodelio Macando, Pedro Dadula), Novaliches (Carmen Cabling in Bagbag, Jojo Pascual in Ibayo, Rodolfo Buendia in Urbano, Avon Ped in Parochia). In other areas: Region 4 (Francisco Clemente), Iligan City (Raphia Maglinao, Arturo Ballestra, Letty Morales, Esmar), Zamboanga City (Anita Tagadiad), Zamboanga del Sur (Gervasio Rana).}}. In 1987 it organized and held Humanist Party internal elections in the base council levels.\n\nOn February 7, 1986, the national snap elections were held by the Marcos regime to try to pacify the increasing discontent of the Filipino people. [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Aquino]] (the widow of assassinated Benigno Aquino) ran for presidential office. Marcos\u2019victory was declared by the Commission on Elections but the majority of Filipino people refused to accept the rigged outcome. When the call for people's support came from the Enrile-Ramos breakaway military group in [[Camp Crame]] on February 22, spontaneous groups and organizations from different political positions, conscientious citizens, Catholic organizations rushed to the gates of Camp Crame. The spontaneous mobilization of people effectively blocked the main thoroughfare of the city. Subsequently, people from the other cities and provinces joined their support. The Humanist Party was among the first groups to answer the call for people's support, its political headquarters was located at P. Tuazon Street near Camp Crame. History recalls this moment as the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] (People Power 1 or the EDSA 1 Revolution), a non-violent phenomenon that gathered hundreds of thousands of people, finally culminating in the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship and placing Corazon Aquino as the president.\n\nIt was during the 1986 Snap Elections that the Humanist Party first fielded independent candidates{{refn|group=n|<!--27--> Emma Ortega (Quezon City), Saturnino Filipino (Manila).}} for Councilors of Manila and Quezon City as its first political campaign action.\n\nOn December 10, 1986 the Humanist Party was launched at the steps of the Arts and Science Building of the University of the Philippines, [[Diliman]], Quezon City. This launch was preceded by a metro-wide [[teaser campaign]] that consisted of posting large posters with the words DEC 10 all along the main streets and avenues. On December 14, 1986, the Humanist Party held its first National Congress at U.P. Diliman, Quezon City.\n\nWhen President Corazon Aquino took office, one of the priorities of the government was to abolish the [[1973 Philippine Constitution]] (which was in force during the Martial Law under the Marcos regime) and draft a new constitution by elected representatives to the Constitutional Assembly. One of the first campaigns launched by the Humanist Party after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship was \"[[Konsultahin Ang Tao]]\" as a requisite before drafting a new Philippine constitution.\n\nIn March 1987, the [[Humanist Party of the Philippines]] filed with the [[Commission on Elections]] for political party status and was granted{{refn|group=n|<!--28--> Ishak Binudin (General Secretary), Godofredo Gutierrez (Sec. of Political Action), Saturnino Filipino (Administrative Secretary), Silvestre Tapales (Sec. of Mass Media), Gemma Suzara (Sec. of Finance), Belen Garcia (Sec, of Public Relations), Rai Delacruz (Sec. of Organization), Florencio Hubo (Sec. of Labor), Willa Tecson (Sec. for Legal Affairs), Carmen Cabling (Sec. of Social Action), and Emma Ortega (Sec. for Women).}}.\n\nHowever, the Humanist Party was short-lived. Its members, at that time were more inclined towards socio-cultural activities rather than political expression. It experienced a loss of crucial leadership by emigration of some of its founding members to other countries; and when there was an emphasis and redirection towards structural Humanist Movement activities, the Humanist Party activities were dropped.\n\n== Humanist Movement in the 1990s ==\n\nOn May 2, 1988, \u201cUnzipped\u201d A Festival of Converging Diversity participated by various artists and musicians{{refn|group=n|<!--29--> Artists and bands were Grace Nono, Sampaguita, Dodo Crisol, Pinikpikan, Fatal Posporos, Glue, Purple Grass, Cany Audioline, and others.}} was organized at the [[Greenbelt Park]] at Makati, this time by the Humanist Movement in close coordination with the Greenbelt Organic Producers Market.{{refn|group=n|<!--30--> Greenbelt Organic Producers Market (Mara Pardo de Tavera), Humanist organizers: Gemma Suzara, Karina Lagdameo Santillan, Osbert Santillan, Ishak Binudin, Florencio Hubo, Willa Tecson.}}\n\nThe 1990s ushered in a new stage,  that of influencing the social and immediate environment and taking root in the community, work and school places where members belonged.  The Humanist Movement was the banner organization and numerous [[study group]]s, weekly meetings, workshops, \u201cencounters\u201d of self-development, \u201cretreats\u201d, \u201cpersonal works\u201d were organized to qualify members and plan activities. Neighborhood Centers were established in [[Baclaran]], [[Sampaloc, Quezon|Sampaloc]], [[Pasig]] at the Victory Theater Building, [[Taytay, Palawan|Taytay]], Makati, [[Mandaluyong]], [[Veterans Village|Mu\u00f1oz]]-[[Quezon City]], [[San Francisco del Monte]]-[[Quezon City]], Teachers Village-Quezon City, [[Iligan City]].{{refn|group=n|<!--31--> Baclaran (Ipe Perez), Sampaloc (Derek Constantino), Taytay (JV Villanueva, Aga Francisco, Dan), Makati (Ishak Binudin, Catherine Binudin, Liza Nakpil, Karina Santillan, Gemma Suzara, Ana, Paul, Willa Tecson), Mandaluyong (Osberto Santillan), Mu\u00f1oz-Quezon City (Fortune Bucud), Teachers Village (Carlo Maglinao, Carla Cantara), San Francisco del Monte-Quezon City (Carmen Cabling, Florencio Hubo), UP (Jun Custodio, Bogs, Bart Rodriguez), Iligan City (Raphia Maglinao).}}  The thrust was that the principles of new humanism take root not only in the inner life (in the heart and mind) but to find its expression (in action) in the social life of family, friends, school and work.\n\n=== Humanist clubs and action fronts ===\n\n==== The Green Party ====\n\nFrom 1988 to 1993, the Humanist Movement took up the ecological banner and launched activities under the [[Green Party of the Philippines]] and [[Green Future]]. Concerned with environmental deterioration due to indiscriminate logging and mining in the countryside and [[industrial pollution]], its members organized [[environmental awareness]] activities{{refn|group=n|<!--32--> Games and picnic (July 24, 1988, Parks and Wildlife, Quezon City);}} in the areas of Pasig, Mandaluyong, Pasay and Makati and the universities of Manila and Quezon City.\n\nInformation campaigns such as Unite and Sign to Oppose Killer Smog (USOK) were organized in public parks and high schools, art contests were sponsored, youth \"No Nukes\" parties were organized.\n\nIn Pasig City, the issue of industrial pollution by Chemphil{{refn|group=n|<!--33--> Chemphil was a chemical plant located in Kalawaan, Pasig and the subject of complaint by residents due to its heavy air emissions and chemical waste dumping in the Pasig river.}} led to an [[investigative committee]] composed of residents,{{refn|group=n|<!--34--> Wilson}} religious{{refn|group=n|<!--35--> Avenida Mayor, Edith Abalajin}} and community organizers, and Green Party members{{refn|group=n|<!--36--> Jess Lachica, Jun Tangco, Jojo Navarro, Roderick, Willa Tecson.}}. With this strong alliance of various organizations, a congressional hearing was held on [[Chemphil]] at the [[Batasang Pambansa Complex]].\n\n==== Humanist clubs ====\n\nIt was that in the mid and later years of the 1990s that neighborhood and university newsletters under the Humanist Movement began to proliferate.

Networking and linkages, both local and international, were developed.  Also, the use of media to spread the global consciousness for peace was a significant development.\n\nWith the World March, the call for a new world was launched and was taken up by millions of people from different latitudes and cultures. Time will tell if this signal was strong enough to resonate to the future in the coming decade.\n\n=== The next decade (2010-      ) ===\n\n==== The five organizations ====\nIn January 2010, the Humanist Movement met briefly in [[Argentina]] and officially de-structured itself. Existing internal councils functioning within the Humanist Movement were dissolved, allowing the independent development of the five organizations: the Community for Human Development, Convergence of Cultures, Center of Humanist Studies, Humanist Party and World Without Wars.\n\n== Footnotes ==\n{{reflist|group=n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.lacomunidadmundial.org/ The Community for Human Development website]\n\n[[Category:Humanism]]\n[[Category:Nonviolence organizations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{unreferenced|date=November 2013}}\n{{notability|Organizations|date=November 2013}}\n{{lead too short|date=January 2012}}\n}}\n\nThe '''Humanist Movement''' began in 1966 in [[Mendoza, Argentina|Mendoza]], [[Argentina]] as a small group of people who gathered together to find a new response to the crisis of [[dehumanization]] and [[violence]] experienced by peoples worldwide. The global crisis was felt in all areas of human activity in the personal, social, economic, political and religious fields. By 1969, this small initial group had expanded into numerous groups in Argentina and [[Chile]] and their presence began to be noticed by the military regime of Argentina then in power. In the early years, the Humanist Movement was known as \"[[Siloism]]\", coined from the penname \"Silo\" of its founder [[Mario Rodr\u00edguez Cobos]].  The military regimes of Argentina and Chile began to censor and persecute the members during its meetings, gatherings, public acts and demonstrations. On May 4, 1969, the \"siloists\" gathered in [[Punta de Vacas]], Mendoza, Argentina and the speech \"The Healing of Suffering\" was given by Silo. This marks the foundation day for the Humanist Movement.\n\nThe systematic [[persecution]] of members in Chile and Argentina propelled the expansion of the movement to other countries. These countries included those in North America and Europe (i.e., [[Spain]], [[Italy]], [[Portugal]] and [[France]]) and the Asian countries of [[Philippines]], [[South Korea]], [[India]] and [[China]].{{refn|group=n|<!--1--> Hong Kong, then a British protectorate but part of China.}}\n\n== Philippine beginnings (1970\u20131979) ==\n\nIn March 1973, four Chilean movement members{{refn|group=n|<!--2--> Pia Figueroa, Maria, Andres Burgos, Julian Burgos.}} arrived in the Philippines. On September of the previous year, [[martial law]] had been declared and the Philippines was experiencing the violence and suppression of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] dictatorship. The press was controlled, the leftist and opposition groups had been neutralized or gone underground, curfews were enforced and fear permeated the political and university scenario. The Chilean humanists initially made contact with the students of the [[University of the Philippines Diliman]].\n\nIn 1974, soloist books ''Transcendental Meditation'' and ''Silo and the Liberation'' (Vol. II) were printed locally.{{refn|group=n|<!--3--> Kui-Feng Publishers, Dodo Cu Unying.}}\n\nIn 1975 the Chileans left and in the next years were followed by Argentinian members{{refn|group=n|<!--4--> Martha and Marcos Pampillon, Norma and Puchi Pelligrini, Fernando Garcia, Tito de Casas.}} who continued the tasks of organizing and transmitting the studies underlying the [[Humanist Movement]]. The Humanist Movement in the following years briefly went through internal stages at different moments and was then referred to as the School. The Synthesis Institute and enter of Inner Religion were launched in order to carry forward its studies but these were later discontinued.\n\nBy 1979, there was a core group of Filipinos who took on the challenge of organizing the movement in the Philippines. In December 1980, \"Silo\" or Mario Rodriguez Cobos visited the Philippines for a working seminar with Filipino members held at the AIT in the University of the Philippines in Diliman, [[Quezon City]].\n\n== Humanize the Earth: The Community (early 1980s) ==\n\nThe 1980s marked the stage of public demonstrations. A worldwide campaign \u201c[[Humanize the Earth]]\u201d was launched in a massive public act on November 1, 1981 at [[Chowpatty Beach]], [[Mumbai]], India by its newly formed socio-cultural organization The [[Community for the Equilibrium and Development of the Human Being]]. This was followed by large public acts done in the major cities of [[North America|North]] and [[South America]], Europe and India. Speakers from various countries, among them members from India and the Philippines,{{refn|group=n|<!--5--> Ishak Binudin of Zamboanga officially represented Asia as part of the international panel of speakers for the public acts in the different countries.}} represented these public acts.\n\nIn 1982, the Community translated its materials into [[Filipino language|Pilipino]] and published its books{{refn|group=n|<!--6--> An ad hoc publication team called PROCOM was formed.

Business [[investment]]s were pulling out, the economic and political future bleak. There was an exodus of Filipinos who left the country to look for better prospects or to seek [[political asylum]]. The majority of Filipinos were getting fed up but kept their views to themselves; in general, avoiding public outcry due to adverse reaction from the repressive government. It was in this general repressed scenario that The Community launched its public acts. Denouncements were made against violence, and active non-violence was proposed as a way of action. Forums, workshops, lectures, slide presentations and film showings were held in private as well as public municipal halls.\n\nOn August 21, 1983, the assassination of [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.|Benigno Aquino]], Marcos\u2019 political opponent, created ripples in Philippine society.

In 1987 it organized and held Humanist Party internal elections in the base council levels.\n\nOn February 7, 1986, the national snap elections were held by the Marcos regime to try to pacify the increasing discontent of the Filipino people. [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon \u201cCory\u201d Aquino]] (the widow of assassinated Benigno Aquino) ran for presidential office. Marcos\u2019victory was declared by the Commission on Elections but the majority of Filipino people refused to accept the rigged outcome. When the call for people's support came from the Enrile-Ramos breakaway military group in [[Camp Crame]] on February 22, spontaneous groups and organizations from different political positions, conscientious citizens, Catholic organizations rushed to the gates of Camp Crame. The spontaneous mobilization of people effectively blocked the main thoroughfare of the city. Subsequently, people from the other cities and provinces joined their support. The Humanist Party was among the first groups to answer the call for people's support, its political headquarters was located at P. Tuazon Street near Camp Crame. History recalls this moment as the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] (People Power 1 or the EDSA 1 Revolution), a non-violent phenomenon that gathered hundreds of thousands of people, finally culminating in the overthrow of the Marcos dictatorship and placing Corazon Aquino as the president.\n\nIt was during the 1986 Snap Elections that the Humanist Party first fielded independent candidates{{refn|group=n|<!--27--> Emma Ortega (Quezon City), Saturnino Filipino (Manila).}} for Councilors of Manila and Quezon City as its first political campaign action.\n\nOn December 10, 1986 the Humanist Party was launched at the steps of the Arts and Science Building of the University of the Philippines, [[Diliman]], Quezon City. This launch was preceded by a metro-wide [[teaser campaign]] that consisted of posting large posters with the words DEC 10 all along the main streets and avenues. On December 14, 1986, the Humanist Party held its first National Congress at U.P. Diliman, Quezon City.\n\nWhen President Corazon Aquino took office, one of the priorities of the government was to abolish the [[1973 Philippine Constitution]] (which was in force during the Martial Law under the Marcos regime) and draft a new constitution by elected representatives to the Constitutional Assembly. One of the first campaigns launched by the Humanist Party after the fall of the Marcos dictatorship was \"[[Konsultahin Ang Tao]]\" as a requisite before drafting a new Philippine constitution.\n\nIn March 1987, the [[Humanist Party of the Philippines]] filed with the [[Commission on Elections]] for political party status and was granted{{refn|group=n|<!--28--> Ishak Binudin (General Secretary), Godofredo Gutierrez (Sec. of Political Action), Saturnino Filipino (Administrative Secretary), Silvestre Tapales (Sec. of Mass Media), Gemma Suzara (Sec. of Finance), Belen Garcia (Sec, of Public Relations), Rai Delacruz (Sec. of Organization), Florencio Hubo (Sec. of Labor), Willa Tecson (Sec. for Legal Affairs), Carmen Cabling (Sec. of Social Action), and Emma Ortega (Sec. for Women).}}.\n\nHowever, the Humanist Party was short-lived. Its members, at that time were more inclined towards socio-cultural activities rather than political expression. It experienced a loss of crucial leadership by emigration of some of its founding members to other countries; and when there was an emphasis and redirection towards structural Humanist Movement activities, the Humanist Party activities were dropped.\n\n== Humanist Movement in the 1990s ==\n\nOn May 2, 1988, \u201cUnzipped\u201d A Festival of Converging Diversity participated by various artists and musicians{{refn|group=n|<!--29--> Artists and bands were Grace Nono, Sampaguita, Dodo Crisol, Pinikpikan, Fatal Posporos, Glue, Purple Grass, Cany Audioline, and others.}} was organized at the [[Greenbelt Park]] at Makati, this time by the Humanist Movement in close coordination with the Greenbelt Organic Producers Market.{{refn|group=n|<!--30--> Greenbelt Organic Producers Market (Mara Pardo de Tavera), Humanist organizers: Gemma Suzara, Karina Lagdameo Santillan, Osbert Santillan, Ishak Binudin, Florencio Hubo, Willa Tecson.}}\n\nThe 1990s ushered in a new stage,  that of influencing the social and immediate environment and taking root in the community, work and school places where members belonged.  The Humanist Movement was the banner organization and numerous [[study group]]s, weekly meetings, workshops, \u201cencounters\u201d of self-development, \u201cretreats\u201d, \u201cpersonal works\u201d were organized to qualify members and plan activities. Neighborhood Centers were established in [[Baclaran]], [[Sampaloc, Quezon|Sampaloc]], [[Pasig]] at the Victory Theater Building, [[Taytay, Palawan|Taytay]], Makati, [[Mandaluyong]], [[Veterans Village|Mu\u00f1oz]]-[[Quezon City]], [[San Francisco del Monte]]-[[Quezon City]], Teachers Village-Quezon City, [[Iligan City]].{{refn|group=n|<!--31--> Baclaran (Ipe Perez), Sampaloc (Derek Constantino), Taytay (JV Villanueva, Aga Francisco, Dan), Makati (Ishak Binudin, Catherine Binudin, Liza Nakpil, Karina Santillan, Gemma Suzara, Ana, Paul, Willa Tecson), Mandaluyong (Osberto Santillan), Mu\u00f1oz-Quezon City (Fortune Bucud), Teachers Village (Carlo Maglinao, Carla Cantara), San Francisco del Monte-Quezon City (Carmen Cabling, Florencio Hubo), UP (Jun Custodio, Bogs, Bart Rodriguez), Iligan City (Raphia Maglinao).}}  The thrust was that the principles of new humanism take root not only in the inner life (in the heart and mind) but to find its expression (in action) in the social life of family, friends, school and work.\n\n=== Humanist clubs and action fronts ===\n\n==== The Green Party ====\n\nFrom 1988 to 1993, the Humanist Movement took up the ecological banner and launched activities under the [[Green Party of the Philippines]] and [[Green Future]]. Concerned with environmental deterioration due to indiscriminate logging and mining in the countryside and [[industrial pollution]], its members organized [[environmental awareness]] activities{{refn|group=n|<!--32--> Games and picnic (July 24, 1988, Parks and Wildlife, Quezon City);}} in the areas of Pasig, Mandaluyong, Pasay and Makati and the universities of Manila and Quezon City.\n\nInformation campaigns such as Unite and Sign to Oppose Killer Smog (USOK) were organized in public parks and high schools, art contests were sponsored, youth \"No Nukes\" parties were organized.\n\nIn Pasig City, the issue of industrial pollution by Chemphil{{refn|group=n|<!--33--> Chemphil was a chemical plant located in Kalawaan, Pasig and the subject of complaint by residents due to its heavy air emissions and chemical waste dumping in the Pasig river.}} led to an [[investigative committee]] composed of residents,{{refn|group=n|<!--34--> Wilson}} religious{{refn|group=n|<!--35--> Avenida Mayor, Edith Abalajin}} and community organizers, and Green Party members{{refn|group=n|<!--36--> Jess Lachica, Jun Tangco, Jojo Navarro, Roderick, Willa Tecson.}}.

The law did not affect anyone in the line of succession at the time of the referendum: the [[Margrethe II of Denmark|Queen]]'s two children are both male, as is the [[Frederik, Crown Prince of Denmark|Crown Prince's]] [[Prince Christian of Denmark|eldest child]], born in 2005. However, had the referendum not been successful, [[Prince Vincent of Denmark|Prince Vincent]], who was born in 2011, would have been higher in the line of succession than [[Princess Isabella of Denmark|Princess Isabella]], born in 2007.\n\n==In parliament==\nUnder the rules for change of constitution, the law must be passed by two Parliaments, before and after an election, and then approved by a referendum. The law was passed in 2006 with only one abstention (Simon Emil Ammitzb\u00f8ll of the [[Radikale Venstre|Social Liberal Party]], who later formed his own party, [[Borgerligt Centrum]]). The law was passed again by the new [[Folketing]] [[2007 Danish parliamentary election|elected in 2007]] on 24 February 2009 with two abstentions (of the left-wing [[Enhedslisten]]). It was then submitted to a referendum.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411366/738664 |title=Females get the nod in Denmark WORLD {{!}} NEWS |website= tvnz.co.nz |access-date=25 November 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20071113060421/http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411366/738664 |archive-date=13 November 2007 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"2005-06-L1\">[https://archive.is/20130212181534/http://www.ft.dk/doc.aspx?/Samling/20051/lovforslag/L1/index.htm 2005-06 - L 1 (oversigt): Forslag til lov om \u00e6ndring af tronf\u00f8lgeloven.

The rise in importance was due to the invention of the [[internal combustion engine]], the rise in [[commercial aviation]], and the importance of petroleum to industrial organic chemistry, particularly the synthesis of plastics, fertilisers, solvents, adhesives and pesticides.\n\nMore than 4000 years ago, according to [[Herodotus]] and [[Diodorus Siculus]], [[asphalt]] was used in the construction of the walls and towers of [[Babylon]]; there were oil pits near Ardericca (near Babylon), and a pitch spring on [[Zacynthus]].<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|wstitle=Petroleum |volume=21 |page=316 |first=Boverton |last=Redwood |inline=1}}</ref> Great quantities of it were found on the banks of the river [[Issus (river)|Issus]], one of the tributaries of the [[Euphrates]]. Ancient [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]] [[Persepolis Administrative Archives|tablets]] indicate the medicinal and lighting uses of petroleum in the upper levels of their society.\n\nThe use of petroleum in ancient China dates back to more than 2000 years ago. In [[I Ching]], one of the earliest Chinese writings cites that oil in its raw state, without refining, was first discovered, extracted, and used in China in the first century BCE.

Lines represent [[single bond]]s; black spheres represent [[carbon]]; white spheres represent [[hydrogen]].]]\n\nPetroleum is a mixture of a very large number of different [[hydrocarbon]]s; the most commonly found molecules are [[alkane]]s (paraffins), [[cycloalkane]]s ([[naphthene]]s), [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, or more complicated chemicals like [[asphaltene]]s. Each petroleum variety has a unique mix of [[molecule]]s, which define its physical and chemical properties, like color and [[viscosity]].\n\nThe ''alkanes'', also known as ''paraffins'', are [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] hydrocarbons with straight or branched chains which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] and have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. They generally have from 5 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule, although trace amounts of shorter or longer molecules may be present in the mixture.\n\nThe alkanes from [[pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) to [[octane]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) are [[oil refinery|refined]] into gasoline, the ones from [[nonane]] (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>) to [[hexadecane]] (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>) into [[diesel fuel]], [[kerosene]] and [[jet fuel]]. Alkanes with more than 16 carbon atoms can be refined into [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. At the heavier end of the range, [[paraffin wax]] is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while [[asphalt]] has 35 and up, although these are usually [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracked]] by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand and the cost of recovery, these gases are either [[flare stack|flared off]], sold as [[liquefied petroleum gas]] under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapour pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, but it is also a main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.\n\nThe ''cycloalkanes'', also known as ''naphthenes'', are saturated hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.\n\nThe ''aromatic hydrocarbons'' are [[degree of unsaturation|unsaturated hydrocarbons]] which have one or more planar six-carbon rings called [[benzene ring]]s, to which hydrogen atoms are attached with the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-6</sub>. They tend to burn with a sooty flame, and many have a sweet aroma. Some are [[carcinogenic]].\n\nThese different molecules are separated by [[fractional distillation]] at an oil refinery to produce gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and other hydrocarbons. For example, [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (isooctane), widely used in [[gasoline]], has a chemical formula of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> and it reacts with oxygen [[exothermic]]ally:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|title=Heat of Combustion of Fuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Webmo.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708085748/https://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n:2&nbsp;{{chem|C|8|H|18}}<sub>(''l'')</sub> + 25&nbsp;{{chem|O|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> \u2192 16&nbsp;{{chem|CO|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> + 18&nbsp;{{chem|H|2|O}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> (\u0394H = \u22125.51 MJ/mol of octane)\n\nThe number of various molecules in an oil sample can be determined by laboratory analysis.

TemaNord 2003:516.</ref> Due to the large number of co-eluted hydrocarbons within oil, many cannot be resolved by traditional gas chromatography and typically appear as a hump in the chromatogram. This [[unresolved complex mixture|Unresolved Complex Mixture]] (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the [[water associated fraction]] of the oil.\n\nIncomplete combustion of petroleum or gasoline results in production of toxic byproducts. Too little oxygen during combustion results in the formation of [[carbon monoxide]].

This process caused the organic matter to change, first into a waxy material known as [[kerogen]], found in various [[oil shale]]s around the world, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s via a process known as [[Catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]]. Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon [[pyrolysis]] in a variety of mainly [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reactions at high temperature or pressure, or both.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> These phases are described in detail below.\n\n;Anaerobic decay:\nIn the absence of plentiful oxygen, [[Aerobic organism|''aerobic'' bacteria]] were prevented from decaying the organic matter after it was buried under a layer of sediment or water. However, [[Anaerobic organism|''anaerobic'' bacteria]] were able to reduce [[sulfate]]s and [[nitrate]]s among the matter to [[Hydrogen sulfide|H<sub>2</sub>S]] and [[Nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]] respectively by using the matter as a source for other reactants. Due to such anaerobic bacteria, at first this matter began to break apart mostly via [[hydrolysis]]: [[polysaccharide]]s and [[protein]]s were hydrolyzed to [[Monosaccharide|simple sugars]] and [[amino acid]]s respectively. These were further anaerobically [[Redox|oxidized]] at an accelerated rate by the [[enzyme]]s of the bacteria: e.g., amino acids went through [[oxidative deamination]] to [[imino acid]]s, which in turn reacted further to [[ammonia]] and [[Keto acid|\u03b1-keto acids]]. [[Monosaccharide]]s in turn ultimately decayed to [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[methane]]. The anaerobic decay products of amino acids, monosaccharides, [[phenols]] and [[aldehyde]]s combined to [[fulvic acid]]s. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es were not extensively hydrolyzed under these mild conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n;Kerogen formation:\nSome phenolic compounds produced from previous reactions worked as [[bactericide]]s and the [[actinomycetales]] order of bacteria  also produced antibiotic compounds (e.g., [[streptomycin]]). Thus the action of anaerobic bacteria ceased at about 10 m below the water or sediment. The mixture at this depth contained fulvic acids, unreacted and partially reacted fats and waxes, slightly modified [[lignin]], resins and other hydrocarbons.<ref name=\":0\" /> As more layers of organic matter settled to the sea or lake bed, intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=R.L.|last2=Burnham|first2=A.K.|date=June 1993|title=Chemical reaction model for oil and gas generation from type 1 and type 2 kerogen|url=http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10169154-cT5xip/|journal=|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2172/10169154|via=}}</ref> As a consequence, compounds of this mixture began to combine in poorly understood ways to [[kerogen]]. Combination happened in a similar fashion as [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]] molecules react to [[Urea-formaldehyde|urea-formaldehyde resins]], but kerogen formation occurred in a more complex manner due to a bigger variety of reactants. The total process of kerogen formation from the beginning of anaerobic decay is called '''diagenesis''', a word that means a transformation of materials by dissolution and recombination of their constituents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Transformation of kerogen into fossil fuels:\nKerogen formation continued to the depth of about 1 [[Kilometre|km]] from the Earth's surface where temperatures may reach around 50 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. Kerogen formation represents a halfway point between organic matter and fossil fuels: kerogen can be exposed to oxygen, oxidize and thus be lost or it could be buried deeper inside the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] and be subjected to conditions which allow it to slowly transform into fossil fuels like petroleum. The latter happened through '''catagenesis''' in which the reactions were mostly [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[Rearrangement reaction|rearrangements]] of kerogen. These reactions took thousands to millions of years and no external reactants were involved. Due to radical nature of these reactions, kerogen reacted towards two classes of products: those with low H/C ratio ([[anthracene]] or products similar to it) and those with high H/C ratio ([[methane]] or products similar to it); i.e., carbon-rich or hydrogen-rich products. Because catagenesis was closed off from external reactants, the resulting composition of the fuel mixture was dependent on the composition of the kerogen via reaction [[stoichiometry]]. 3 main types of kerogen exist: type I (algal), II (liptinic) and III (humic), which were formed mainly from [[algae]], [[plankton]] and [[woody plant]]s (this term includes [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s) respectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCatagenesis was [[Pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] despite of the fact that it happened at relatively low temperatures (when compared to commercial pyrolysis plants) of 60 to several hundred \u00b0C. Pyrolysis was possible because of the long reaction times involved. Heat for catagenesis came from the decomposition of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] materials of the crust, especially [[Potassium-40|<sup>40</sup>K]], [[Thorium-232|<sup>232</sup>Th]], [[Uranium-235|<sup>235</sup>U]] and [[Uranium-238|<sup>238</sup>U]].

Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as [[oil reservoir|reservoirs]]) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an [[oil field]] forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by [[drill]]ing and [[pump]]ing.\n\nThe reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions. The latter set is regularly used in [[petrochemical]] plants and [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]].\n\nWells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil. \"Natural lift\" production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, such as in the Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using \"[[artificial lift]]\" means. Over time, these \"primary\" methods become less effective and \"secondary\" production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [[Water injection (oil production)|\"waterflood\"]] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or \"wellbore.\" Eventually \"tertiary\" or \"enhanced\" oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or \"bitumen\") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using \"in-situ\" methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping the liquid back out saturated with oil.\n\n===Unconventional oil reservoirs===\n{{See also|Unconventional oil|Oil sands|Oil shale reserves}}\nOil-eating bacteria [[biodegradation|biodegrade]] oil that has escaped to the surface. [[Oil sands]] are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present\u2014more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or extra-heavy crude oil in [[Venezuela]]. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[oil shales]] are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil. Technically speaking, oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil, but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called [[kerogen]]. The kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes. The method has been known for centuries and was patented in 1694 under British Crown Patent No. 330 covering, \"A way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tar, and oil out of a sort of stone.\" Although oil shales are found in many countries, the United States has the world's largest deposits.<ref name=\"Lambertson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10092|title=Oil Shale: Ready to Unlock the Rock|last=Lambertson|first=Giles|date=February 16, 2008|work=|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711112037/http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/redirect/10092?story=10092|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=live|publisher=Construction Equipment Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Some [[Benchmark (crude oil)|marker crudes]] with their [[sulfur]] content (horizontal) and [[API gravity]] (vertical) and relative production quantity.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Brent shown as sweeter than WTI, yet most sources claim the opposite.

Crude oil may be considered ''[[Light crude oil|light]]'' if it has low density or ''[[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]'' if it has high density; and it may be referred to as [[sweet crude oil|sweet]] if it contains relatively little sulfur or ''[[sour crude oil|sour]]'' if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery. ''Light'' crude oil is more desirable than ''heavy'' oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while ''sweet'' oil commands a higher price than ''sour'' oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries.

Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]].\n\nOil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin [[oil slick]] which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly [[bulldozed]] around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.\n\nControl of oil spills is difficult, requires ad hoc methods, and often a large amount of manpower.

Lines represent [[single bond]]s; black spheres represent [[carbon]]; white spheres represent [[hydrogen]].]]\n\nPetroleum is a mixture of a very large number of different [[hydrocarbon]]s; the most commonly found molecules are [[alkane]]s (paraffins), [[cycloalkane]]s ([[naphthene]]s), [[aromatic hydrocarbon]]s, or more complicated chemicals like [[asphaltene]]s. Each petroleum variety has a unique mix of [[molecule]]s, which define its physical and chemical properties, like color and [[viscosity]].\n\nThe ''alkanes'', also known as ''paraffins'', are [[Saturated and unsaturated compounds|saturated]] hydrocarbons with straight or branched chains which contain only [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] and have the general formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n+2</sub>. They generally have from 5 to 40 carbon atoms per molecule, although trace amounts of shorter or longer molecules may be present in the mixture.\n\nThe alkanes from [[pentane]] (C<sub>5</sub>H<sub>12</sub>) to [[octane]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub>) are [[oil refinery|refined]] into gasoline, the ones from [[nonane]] (C<sub>9</sub>H<sub>20</sub>) to [[hexadecane]] (C<sub>16</sub>H<sub>34</sub>) into [[diesel fuel]], [[kerosene]] and [[jet fuel]]. Alkanes with more than 16 carbon atoms can be refined into [[fuel oil]] and [[lubricating oil]]. At the heavier end of the range, [[paraffin wax]] is an alkane with approximately 25 carbon atoms, while [[asphalt]] has 35 and up, although these are usually [[Fluid catalytic cracking|cracked]] by modern refineries into more valuable products. The shortest molecules, those with four or fewer carbon atoms, are in a gaseous state at room temperature. They are the petroleum gases. Depending on demand and the cost of recovery, these gases are either [[flare stack|flared off]], sold as [[liquefied petroleum gas]] under pressure, or used to power the refinery's own burners. During the winter, butane (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>10</sub>), is blended into the gasoline pool at high rates, because its high vapour pressure assists with cold starts. Liquified under pressure slightly above atmospheric, it is best known for powering cigarette lighters, but it is also a main fuel source for many developing countries. Propane can be liquified under modest pressure, and is consumed for just about every application relying on petroleum for energy, from cooking to heating to transportation.\n\nThe ''cycloalkanes'', also known as ''naphthenes'', are saturated hydrocarbons which have one or more carbon rings to which hydrogen atoms are attached according to the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n</sub>. Cycloalkanes have similar properties to alkanes but have higher boiling points.\n\nThe ''aromatic hydrocarbons'' are [[degree of unsaturation|unsaturated hydrocarbons]] which have one or more planar six-carbon rings called [[benzene ring]]s, to which hydrogen atoms are attached with the formula C<sub>n</sub>H<sub>2n-6</sub>. They tend to burn with a sooty flame, and many have a sweet aroma. Some are [[carcinogenic]].\n\nThese different molecules are separated by [[fractional distillation]] at an oil refinery to produce gasoline, jet fuel, kerosene, and other hydrocarbons. For example, [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]] (isooctane), widely used in [[gasoline]], has a chemical formula of C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>18</sub> and it reacts with oxygen [[exothermic]]ally:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|title=Heat of Combustion of Fuels|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Webmo.net|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170708085748/https://www.webmo.net/curriculum/heat_of_combustion/heat_of_combustion_key.html|archive-date=2017-07-08|url-status=live|accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\n:2&nbsp;{{chem|C|8|H|18}}<sub>(''l'')</sub> + 25&nbsp;{{chem|O|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> \u2192 16&nbsp;{{chem|CO|2}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> + 18&nbsp;{{chem|H|2|O}}<sub>(''g'')</sub> (\u0394H = \u22125.51 MJ/mol of octane)\n\nThe number of various molecules in an oil sample can be determined by laboratory analysis.

This [[unresolved complex mixture|Unresolved Complex Mixture]] (UCM) of hydrocarbons is particularly apparent when analysing weathered oils and extracts from tissues of organisms exposed to oil. Some of the component of oil will mix with water: the [[water associated fraction]] of the oil.\n\nIncomplete combustion of petroleum or gasoline results in production of toxic byproducts. Too little oxygen during combustion results in the formation of [[carbon monoxide]].

This process caused the organic matter to change, first into a waxy material known as [[kerogen]], found in various [[oil shale]]s around the world, and then with more heat into liquid and gaseous [[hydrocarbon]]s via a process known as [[Catagenesis (geology)|catagenesis]]. Formation of petroleum occurs from hydrocarbon [[pyrolysis]] in a variety of mainly [[Endothermic process|endothermic]] reactions at high temperature or pressure, or both.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\" /> These phases are described in detail below.\n\n;Anaerobic decay:\nIn the absence of plentiful oxygen, [[Aerobic organism|''aerobic'' bacteria]] were prevented from decaying the organic matter after it was buried under a layer of sediment or water. However, [[Anaerobic organism|''anaerobic'' bacteria]] were able to reduce [[sulfate]]s and [[nitrate]]s among the matter to [[Hydrogen sulfide|H<sub>2</sub>S]] and [[Nitrogen|N<sub>2</sub>]] respectively by using the matter as a source for other reactants. Due to such anaerobic bacteria, at first this matter began to break apart mostly via [[hydrolysis]]: [[polysaccharide]]s and [[protein]]s were hydrolyzed to [[Monosaccharide|simple sugars]] and [[amino acid]]s respectively. These were further anaerobically [[Redox|oxidized]] at an accelerated rate by the [[enzyme]]s of the bacteria: e.g., amino acids went through [[oxidative deamination]] to [[imino acid]]s, which in turn reacted further to [[ammonia]] and [[Keto acid|\u03b1-keto acids]]. [[Monosaccharide]]s in turn ultimately decayed to [[Carbon dioxide|CO<sub>2</sub>]] and [[methane]]. The anaerobic decay products of amino acids, monosaccharides, [[phenols]] and [[aldehyde]]s combined to [[fulvic acid]]s. [[Fat]]s and [[wax]]es were not extensively hydrolyzed under these mild conditions.<ref name=\":0\" /> \n\n;Kerogen formation:\nSome phenolic compounds produced from previous reactions worked as [[bactericide]]s and the [[actinomycetales]] order of bacteria  also produced antibiotic compounds (e.g., [[streptomycin]]). Thus the action of anaerobic bacteria ceased at about 10 m below the water or sediment. The mixture at this depth contained fulvic acids, unreacted and partially reacted fats and waxes, slightly modified [[lignin]], resins and other hydrocarbons.<ref name=\":0\" /> As more layers of organic matter settled to the sea or lake bed, intense heat and pressure built up in the lower regions.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Braun|first=R.L.|last2=Burnham|first2=A.K.|date=June 1993|title=Chemical reaction model for oil and gas generation from type 1 and type 2 kerogen|url=http://www.osti.gov/servlets/purl/10169154-cT5xip/|journal=|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|volume=|pages=|doi=10.2172/10169154|via=}}</ref> As a consequence, compounds of this mixture began to combine in poorly understood ways to [[kerogen]]. Combination happened in a similar fashion as [[phenol]] and [[formaldehyde]] molecules react to [[Urea-formaldehyde|urea-formaldehyde resins]], but kerogen formation occurred in a more complex manner due to a bigger variety of reactants. The total process of kerogen formation from the beginning of anaerobic decay is called '''diagenesis''', a word that means a transformation of materials by dissolution and recombination of their constituents.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n;Transformation of kerogen into fossil fuels:\nKerogen formation continued to the depth of about 1 [[Kilometre|km]] from the Earth's surface where temperatures may reach around 50 [[Celsius|\u00b0C]]. Kerogen formation represents a halfway point between organic matter and fossil fuels: kerogen can be exposed to oxygen, oxidize and thus be lost or it could be buried deeper inside the [[Crust (geology)|Earth's crust]] and be subjected to conditions which allow it to slowly transform into fossil fuels like petroleum. The latter happened through '''catagenesis''' in which the reactions were mostly [[Radical (chemistry)|radical]] [[Rearrangement reaction|rearrangements]] of kerogen. These reactions took thousands to millions of years and no external reactants were involved. Due to radical nature of these reactions, kerogen reacted towards two classes of products: those with low H/C ratio ([[anthracene]] or products similar to it) and those with high H/C ratio ([[methane]] or products similar to it); i.e., carbon-rich or hydrogen-rich products. Because catagenesis was closed off from external reactants, the resulting composition of the fuel mixture was dependent on the composition of the kerogen via reaction [[stoichiometry]]. 3 main types of kerogen exist: type I (algal), II (liptinic) and III (humic), which were formed mainly from [[algae]], [[plankton]] and [[woody plant]]s (this term includes [[tree]]s, [[shrub]]s and [[liana]]s) respectively.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCatagenesis was [[Pyrolysis|pyrolytic]] despite of the fact that it happened at relatively low temperatures (when compared to commercial pyrolysis plants) of 60 to several hundred \u00b0C. Pyrolysis was possible because of the long reaction times involved.

Within these reservoirs, fluids will typically organize themselves like a three-layer cake with a layer of water below the oil layer and a layer of gas above it, although the different layers vary in size between reservoirs. Because most hydrocarbons are less dense than rock or water, they often migrate upward through adjacent rock layers until either reaching the surface or becoming trapped within porous rocks (known as [[oil reservoir|reservoirs]]) by impermeable rocks above. However, the process is influenced by underground water flows, causing oil to migrate hundreds of kilometres horizontally or even short distances downward before becoming trapped in a reservoir. When hydrocarbons are concentrated in a trap, an [[oil field]] forms, from which the liquid can be extracted by [[drill]]ing and [[pump]]ing.\n\nThe reactions that produce oil and natural gas are often modeled as first order breakdown reactions, where hydrocarbons are broken down to oil and natural gas by a set of parallel reactions, and oil eventually breaks down to natural gas by another set of reactions. The latter set is regularly used in [[petrochemical]] plants and [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]].\n\nWells are drilled into oil reservoirs to extract the crude oil. \"Natural lift\" production methods that rely on the natural reservoir pressure to force the oil to the surface are usually sufficient for a while after reservoirs are first tapped. In some reservoirs, such as in the Middle East, the natural pressure is sufficient over a long time. The natural pressure in most reservoirs, however, eventually dissipates. Then the oil must be extracted using \"[[artificial lift]]\" means. Over time, these \"primary\" methods become less effective and \"secondary\" production methods may be used. A common secondary method is [[Water injection (oil production)|\"waterflood\"]] or injection of water into the reservoir to increase pressure and force the oil to the drilled shaft or \"wellbore.\" Eventually \"tertiary\" or \"enhanced\" oil recovery methods may be used to increase the oil's flow characteristics by injecting steam, carbon dioxide and other gases or chemicals into the reservoir. In the United States, primary production methods account for less than 40 percent of the oil produced on a daily basis, secondary methods account for about half, and tertiary recovery the remaining 10 percent. Extracting oil (or \"bitumen\") from oil/tar sand and oil shale deposits requires mining the sand or shale and heating it in a vessel or retort, or using \"in-situ\" methods of injecting heated liquids into the deposit and then pumping the liquid back out saturated with oil.\n\n===Unconventional oil reservoirs===\n{{See also|Unconventional oil|Oil sands|Oil shale reserves}}\nOil-eating bacteria [[biodegradation|biodegrade]] oil that has escaped to the surface. [[Oil sands]] are reservoirs of partially biodegraded oil still in the process of escaping and being biodegraded, but they contain so much migrating oil that, although most of it has escaped, vast amounts are still present\u2014more than can be found in conventional oil reservoirs. The lighter fractions of the crude oil are destroyed first, resulting in reservoirs containing an extremely heavy form of crude oil, called crude bitumen in Canada, or extra-heavy crude oil in [[Venezuela]]. These two countries have the world's largest deposits of oil sands.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nOn the other hand, [[oil shales]] are source rocks that have not been exposed to heat or pressure long enough to convert their trapped hydrocarbons into crude oil. Technically speaking, oil shales are not always shales and do not contain oil, but are fined-grain sedimentary rocks containing an insoluble organic solid called [[kerogen]]. The kerogen in the rock can be converted into crude oil using heat and pressure to simulate natural processes. The method has been known for centuries and was patented in 1694 under British Crown Patent No. 330 covering, \"A way to extract and make great quantities of pitch, tar, and oil out of a sort of stone.\" Although oil shales are found in many countries, the United States has the world's largest deposits.<ref name=\"Lambertson\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cegltd.com/story.asp?story=10092|title=Oil Shale: Ready to Unlock the Rock|last=Lambertson|first=Giles|date=February 16, 2008|work=|accessdate=May 21, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711112037/http://www.constructionequipmentguide.com/redirect/10092?story=10092|archive-date=2017-07-11|url-status=live|publisher=Construction Equipment Guide}}</ref>\n\n==Classification==\n[[File:Crudes.PNG|thumb|upright=1.6|Some [[Benchmark (crude oil)|marker crudes]] with their [[sulfur]] content (horizontal) and [[API gravity]] (vertical) and relative production quantity.{{citation needed|date=March 2020|reason=Brent shown as sweeter than WTI, yet most sources claim the opposite.

Crude oil may be considered ''[[Light crude oil|light]]'' if it has low density or ''[[Heavy crude oil|heavy]]'' if it has high density; and it may be referred to as [[sweet crude oil|sweet]] if it contains relatively little sulfur or ''[[sour crude oil|sour]]'' if it contains substantial amounts of sulfur.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\nThe geographic location is important because it affects transportation costs to the refinery. ''Light'' crude oil is more desirable than ''heavy'' oil since it produces a higher yield of gasoline, while ''sweet'' oil commands a higher price than ''sour'' oil because it has fewer environmental problems and requires less refining to meet sulfur standards imposed on fuels in consuming countries.

Smaller spills have already proven to have a great impact on ecosystems, such as the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill|''Exxon Valdez'' oil spill]].\n\nOil spills at sea are generally much more damaging than those on land, since they can spread for hundreds of nautical miles in a thin [[oil slick]] which can cover beaches with a thin coating of oil. This can kill sea birds, mammals, shellfish and other organisms it coats. Oil spills on land are more readily containable if a makeshift earth dam can be rapidly [[bulldozed]] around the spill site before most of the oil escapes, and land animals can avoid the oil more easily.\n\nControl of oil spills is difficult, requires ad hoc methods, and often a large amount of manpower.
