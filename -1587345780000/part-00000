Samuel Mickle Fox (1763-1808), along with his brother George and brothers-in-law Joseph Parker Norris and George Roberts, purchased a number of tracts of land in western Pennsylvania from the Commonwealth during the 1790s. Six of these tracts, numbered #5725-5730, comprising {{convert|6600|acre|km2}}, were contiguous and located along the Allegheny north of its confluence with Toby's Creek (today's [[Clarion River]]). The present town of Foxburg is located on what was designated tract #5729.\n\nSamuel's son Joseph purchased these tracts from his father's estate in 1816 and established a residence here ten years later. This was south of the town near the mouth of the Clarion. It became known to generations as \"the Fox Mansion\" or simply \"the Mansion\". Succeeding generations would make it a seasonal residence for the next 140 years.\n[[Image:Foxburg Golf Course.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Foxburg Country Club]]\n\nThe town of Foxburg was founded amidst the oil developments in [[western Pennsylvania]] in 1870. At its height during the early 1870s it had a population of over 1,000. It remained a village until its incorporation as a borough on February 6, 1930. The borough was once served by two railroads. One was the [[Allegheny Division]] of the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]], and the other was the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]]. The B&O actually ran over the old [[Foxburg Bridge (1921)|Foxburg Bridge]] from 1921 to 1964.

Fish are normally caught [[Wild fisheries|in the wild]]. [[Fishing techniques|Techniques]] for catching fish include [[Gathering seafood by hand|hand gathering]], [[Spearfishing|spearing]], [[Fish net|netting]], [[angling]] and [[Fish trap|trapping]]. \u201cFishing\u201d may include catching [[aquatic animal]]s other than fish, such as [[mollusc]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. The term is not normally applied to catching [[Fish farm|farmed fish]], or to [[aquatic mammal]]s, such as whales where the term [[whaling]] is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be [[Fish as food|eaten]], fish are caught as [[Recreational fishing|recreational pastimes]]. [[Fishing tournament]]s are held, and caught fish are sometimes kept as [[Taxidermy|preserved]] or [[Fishkeeping|living]] [[Trophy hunting|trophies]]. When [[bioblitz]]es occur, fish are typically caught, identified, and then released.\n\nAccording to the United Nations [[Food and Agriculture Organization|FAO]] statistics, the total number of [[Commercial fishing|commercial fishermen]] and [[Fish farming|fish farmers]] is estimated to be 38 million.

However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at [[Lepenski Vir]], they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.\n\n===Trawling===\nThe British [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]] was an early type of sailing [[Trawler (fishing)|trawler]] from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of [[Brixham]]. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the [[overfishing|overfished]] waters of [[South Devon]]. The [[Brixham trawler]] that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall [[gaff rig]], which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long-distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.<ref name=\"kjappeal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kjappeal.org/history.html |title=History of a Brixham trawler |author= |date=2 March 2009 |website= |publisher=JKappeal.org |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202015738/http://kjappeal.org/history.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:A Brixham trawler.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of ''A Brixham trawler'' by [[William Adolphus Knell]].

The dock covered {{convert|25|acre|ha}} and was formally opened by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1854 as the first modern fishing port.\n\nThe elegant [[Brixham trawler]] spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/news/112001/27/brixham_trawler.shtml |title=Pilgrim's restoration under full sail |author= |date= |website= |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2 March 2009}}</ref> By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby.

Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sailing trawlers|url=http://issuu.com/tobyrussell/docs/brixham_sailing_trawlers}}</ref>\n\nThe earliest steam-powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the [[trawl]] system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually {{convert|80|-|90|ft}} in length with a beam of around {{convert|20|ft}}. They weighed 40\u201350 tons and travelled at {{convert|9|-|11|kn}}. The earliest purpose-built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in [[Leith]], Scotland in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first [[screw propeller|screw propelled]] [[steamship|steam trawler]] in the world.<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\">{{cite web|url=http://grantontrawlers.com/steam%20trawler.html|title=The Steam Trawler}}</ref>\n\nSteam trawlers were introduced at [[Grimsby]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby. Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by [[World War I]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[turbines]] by the end of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets. Since [[World War II]], [[radio navigation aid]]s and [[Fishfinder|fish finders]] have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the [[stern]]. The first purpose-built stern trawler was ''Fairtry'' built-in 1953 at [[Aberdeen]], Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|title=HISTORY|access-date=16 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821172332/http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|archive-date=21 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The ship served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\"/>\n\n===Recreational fishing===\n{{main|Recreational fishing}}\n[[File:Louis John Rhead - Izaak Wolton and his scholar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Izaak Walton]]'s ''[[The Compleat Angler|Compleat Angler]]'', published in 1653 helped popularise fly fishing as a sport.<br />Woodcut by [[Louis Rhead]]]]\nThe early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for [[fly fishing]] in Japan, however, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by [[Juliana Berners|Dame Juliana Berners]], the prioress of the Benedictine [[Sopwell Priory|Sopwell Nunnery]]. The essay was titled ''Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle'',<ref>Berners, Dame Juliana (1496) [http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/berners/berners.html ''A treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle''] (transcription by Risa S.

''[[The Compleat Angler|Compleat Angler]]'' was written by [[Izaak Walton]] in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the [[Derbyshire]] [[River Wye, Derbyshire|Wye]]. It was a celebration of the art and spirit of fishing in prose and verse. A second part to the book was added by Walton's friend [[Charles Cotton]].<ref name=\"Herdfly\">{{cite web|url=http://www.flyfishinghistory.com/tech15th.htm|title=Fly fishing techniques in the fifteenth century|author=Andrew N.

Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialised for different roles. Jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and [[bamboo]] came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.\n\nThe industry also became commercialised \u2013 rods and tackle were sold at the [[haberdashers]] store. After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, artisans moved to [[Redditch]] which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century. He received a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] from three successive monarchs starting with King [[George IV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greatflyfishingtips.com/welcome-to-great-fly-fishing-tips/|title=Welcome To Great Fly Fishing Tips|date=December 2011|access-date=16 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170627040414/http://www.greatflyfishingtips.com/welcome-to-great-fly-fishing-tips/|archive-date=27 June 2017|url-status=dead}}</ref> He also invented the [[fishing reel|multiplying winch]].

Instead of anglers twisting their lines \u2013 a laborious and time-consuming process \u2013 the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed.\n\nBritish fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th Century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques.\n\nBy the mid to late 19th century, expanding [[leisure]] opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or rivers for fishing.

The reel was a wide drum that spooled out freely and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift along way out with the current. Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where similar models were modified by [[George Snyder (fly reels)|George Snyder]] of [[Kentucky]] into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design in 1810.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyfishinghistory.com/tech18th.htm|title=Fly Fishing in the Eighteenth Century|author=Andrew N.

[[Bamboo]] rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form the light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. [[George Cotton]] and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish.\n<ref name=\"Brit\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/208708/fishing/2330/Early-history#ref70275|title=fishing|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Trout fishing 1860s.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing became a popular recreational activity in the 19th century.

The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of [[horse hair]]. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle \u2013 this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.<ref name=\"Brit\"/>\n\nThe American, Charles F. Orvis, designed and distributed a novel reel and fly design in 1874, described by reel historian Jim Brown as the \"benchmark of American reel design,\" and the first fully modern fly reel.<ref name=\"brown_reel_treasury\">Brown, Jim.

When casting Illingworth's reel design, the line was drawn off the leading edge of the spool but was restrained and rewound by a line pickup, a device which orbits around the stationary spool. Because the line did not have to pull against a rotating spool, much lighter lures could be cast than with conventional reels.<ref name=\"Brit\"/>\n\nThe development of inexpensive [[fiberglass]] rods, synthetic fly lines, and monofilament leaders in the early 1950s, that revived the popularity of fly fishing.\n\n== Techniques ==\n[[File:\u0110\u00f3.jpg|thumb|left|Fishermen with traditional fish traps, Vietnam]]\n{{main|Fishing techniques}}\n\nThere are many fishing techniques and tactics for catching fish. The term can also be applied to methods for catching other [[aquatic animal]]s such as [[molluscs]] ([[shellfish]], [[squid]], octopus) and edible marine [[invertebrate]]s.\n\nFishing techniques include [[Gathering seafood by hand|hand gathering]], [[spearfishing]], [[Fish net|netting]], [[angling]] and [[Fish trap|trapping]]. [[Recreational fishing|Recreational]], [[Commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure, sport, or to provide food for themselves, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in third-world countries, and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Usually, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods.\n\nWhy a fish bites a baited hook or lure involves several factors related to the sensory physiology, behaviour, feeding ecology, and biology of the fish as well as the environment and characteristics of the bait/hook/lure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lennox|first=Robert J|last2=Al\u00f3s|first2=Josep|last3=Arlinghaus|first3=Robert|last4=Horodysky|first4=Andrij|last5=Klefoth|first5=Thomas|last6=Monk|first6=Christopher T|last7=Cooke|first7=Steven J|title=What makes fish vulnerable to capture by hooks?

Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]], [[Fishing float|floats]], [[Fishing rod|rods]], [[Fishing reel|reels]], [[Fishing bait|baits]], [[Fishing lure|lures]], [[Spearfishing|spears]], [[Fishing net|nets]], [[Fishing gaff|gaffs]], [[Fishing trap|traps]], [[Waders (footwear)|waders]] and tackle boxes.\n\nTackle that is attached to the end of a [[fishing line]] is called '''terminal tackle'''. This includes [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]], [[Fishing float|floats]], leaders, [[Fishing swivel|swivels]], split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. People also tend to use dead or live fish as another form of bait.\n\nFishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas [[fishing techniques]] refers to the ways the tackle is used when fishing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fishing vessels ==\n[[File:Krabbenkutter Ivonne Pellworm P5242390jm.JPG|thumb|left|Commercial crab boat working in the [[Fishing in the North Sea|North Sea]]]]\n[[File:Small sport fishing boat.jpg|thumb|right|Small [[sport fishing boat]]]]\n{{see also|Fishing vessels|Traditional fishing boats}}\n\nA fishing vessel is a boat or ship used to catch fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Many different kinds of vessels are used in [[Commercial fishing|commercial]], [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] and [[recreational fishing]].\n\nAccording to the [[FAO]], in 2004 there were four million commercial fishing vessels.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\">FAO 2007</ref> About 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the [[Deck (ship)|undecked]] boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> These boats are used by [[Artisan fishing|artisan fishers]].\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many [[Recreational boat fishing|recreational fishing boats]] there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a [[fisherman]] periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from [[dugout canoe]]s, [[float tube]]s, [[kayaks]], [[raft]]s, [[pontoon boat]]s and small [[Dinghy|dinghies]] to [[Runabout (boat)|runabouts]], [[cabin cruiser]]s and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious [[Big-game fishing|big game]] rigs.<ref>[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/speciesid/fish_page/fish51a.html Sport fishing boat]</ref> Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open [[Cockpit (sailing)|cockpits]] at the [[stern]], designed for convenient fishing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Traditional fishing ==\n{{main|Artisan fishing}}\n\nTraditional fishing is any kind of small scale, [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] fishing practices using traditional techniques such as [[Fishing rod|rod]] and [[Fishing tackle|tackle]], [[arrow]]s and [[harpoon]]s, [[throw net]]s and drag nets, etc.\n\n== Recreational fishing ==\n[[File:An evening fishing - by Francis Hannaway.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Angling]]}}]]\n{{main|Recreational fishing}}\n\n[[Recreation]]al and sport fishing are fishing primarily for [[pleasure]] or competition. Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit how fish may be caught; typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[Fish hook|hooks]] and any one of a wide range of [[Bait (luring substance)|baits]] or [[Fishing lure|lures]] such as [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]]. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is generally known as [[angling]]. In angling, it is sometimes expected or required that fish be returned to the water ([[catch and release]]). Recreational or sport fishermen may log their catches or participate in fishing competitions.\n\n[[Big-game fishing]] is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as [[tuna]], [[shark]]s, and [[marlin]]. Sportfishing (sometimes game fishing) is recreational fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the [[culinary]] or financial value of the fish's flesh. Fish sought after include [[tarpon]], [[sailfish]], [[mackerel]] and many others.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fishing industry ==\n{{Main|Fishing industry}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"300px\">\nContribution of fish to animal protein supply, average 2013-2015.svg|Contribution of fish to animal protein supply, average 2013-2015\nFile:World capture fisheries and aquaculture production.svg|World capture fisheries and aquaculture production 1950 - 2015\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Albatun Dod.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Spanish [[tuna]] [[purse seiner]] in the [[Seychelles Islands]].]]\n\nThe fishing industry includes any industry or activity concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing or selling fish or fish products. It is defined by the [[FAO]] as including [[recreational fishing|recreational]], [[Artisan fishing|subsistence]] and [[commercial fishing]], and the harvesting, [[Fish processing|processing]], and [[Fish marketing|marketing]] sectors.<ref>FAO Fisheries Section: Glossary: [http://www.fao.org/fi/glossary/default.asp ''Fishing industry.''] Retrieved 28 May 2008.</ref> The commercial activity is aimed at the delivery of fish and other [[seafood products]] for human consumption or use as [[raw material]] in other industrial processes.\n\nThere are three principal industry sectors:{{NoteTag|The wording of the following definitions of the fishing industry are based on those used by the Australian government.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.frdc.com.au/industry/ |title=Today's Fishing Industry |date=10 December 2007 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20090614105342/http://frdc.com.au/industry/ |archive-date = 14 June 2009 |publisher=[[Fisheries Research and Development Corporation]] |access-date=26 July 2012}}</ref>}}\n* The [[Fishing industry#Commercial sector|commercial sector]] comprises enterprises and individuals associated with wild-catch or aquaculture resources and the various transformations of those resources into products for sale.\n* The [[Fishing industry#Traditional sector|traditional sector]] comprises enterprises and individuals associated with fisheries resources from which aboriginal people derive products following their traditions.\n* The [[Fishing industry#Recreational sector|recreational sector]] comprises enterprises and individuals associated with the purpose of recreation, sport or sustenance with fisheries resources from which products are derived that are not for sale.\n\n===Commercial fishing===\n{{main|Commercial fishing}}\n[[File:French Fishing Vessel 'Alf' in the Irish Sea MOD 45155246.jpg|thumb|Fishing boat in a heavy sea]]\n\nCommercial fishing is the capture of fish for commercial purposes. Those who practice it must often pursue fish far from the land under adverse conditions. Commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species, from [[tuna]], [[cod]] and [[salmon]] to [[shrimp]], [[krill]], [[lobster]], [[clam]]s, [[squid]] and [[crab]], in various [[fishery|fisheries]] for these species. Commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. [[Individual fishing quota]]s and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.\n\nA commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small boat with hand-casting nets or a few pot traps, to a huge fleet of [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] processing tons of fish every day.\n\nCommercial fishing gear includes weights, [[Fishing net|nets]] (e.g. purse [[Seine fishing|seine]]), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), [[trawl]]s (e.g. [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawl]]), dredges, [[Fish hook|hooks]] and line (e.g. [[Long-line fishing|long line]] and [[Hand-line fishing|handline]]), lift nets, [[gillnet]]s, entangling nets and [[Fishing trap|traps]].\n\nAccording to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, the total world [[Wild fisheries|capture fisheries]] production in 2000 was 86 million tons (FAO 2002). The top producing countries were, in order, the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan), Peru, Japan, the United States, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, India, Thailand, Norway, and Iceland. Those countries accounted for more than half of the world's production; China alone accounted for a third of the world's production. Of that production, over 90% was marine and less than 10% was inland.\n\nA small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], [[salmon]], crab, [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species as well are fished in smaller numbers.\n\n===Fish farms===\n{{main|Fish farm}}\nFish farming is the principal form of [[aquaculture]], while other methods may fall under [[mariculture]]. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks or enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases [[juvenile fish]] into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural population is generally referred to as a [[fish hatchery]]. Fish species raised by fish farms include [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon]], [[carp]], [[Aquaculture of tilapia|tilapia]], [[Aquaculture of catfish|catfish]] and  [[trout]].\n\nIncreased demands on [[wild fisheries]] by [[commercial fishing]] has caused widespread [[overfishing]]. Fish farming offers an alternative solution to the increasing market demand for fish.\n\n[[File:Derkovits, Gyula - Still-life with Fish I (1928).jpg|thumb|right|[[Gyula Derkovits]], ''still-life with fish'' (1928)]]\n\n===Fish products===\n{{see also|Fish processing|Fish products|Fish (food)|Seafood}}\nFish and fish products are [[Fish as food|consumed as food]] all over the world. With other [[seafood]]s, it provides the world's prime source of high-quality [[protein]]: 14\u201316 percent of the animal protein consumed worldwide. Over one billion people rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein.<ref>Tidwell, James H. and Allan, Geoff L.</ref>\n\nFish and other aquatic organisms are also processed into various food and non-food products, such as sharkskin leather, pigments made from the inky secretions of [[cuttlefish]], [[isinglass]] used for the [[clarification (wine)|clarification]] of wine and beer, [[fish emulsion]] used as a [[fertiliser]], [[Animal glue|fish glue]], [[fish oil]] and [[fish meal]].\n\nFish are also collected live for research and the [[aquarium]] trade.\n\n===Fish marketing===\n{{see also|Fish market|Fish marketing}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fisheries management ==\n[[File:Fishing down the food web.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Fishing down the food web]]}}]]\n{{main|Fisheries management|Fisheries science}}\n\nFisheries management draws on [[fisheries science]] to find ways to protect [[fishery]] resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of (hopefully appropriate) management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of [[monitoring control and surveillance]].\n\nFisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries. It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of [[oceanography]], [[marine biology]], [[marine conservation]], ecology, [[Population dynamics of fisheries|population dynamics]], economics and management in an attempt to provide an integrated picture of fisheries. In some cases new disciplines have emerged, such as [[bioeconomics (biology)|bioeconomics]].\n\n===Sustainability===\n{{main|Sustainable fishing}}\nIssues involved in the long term sustainability of fishing include [[overfishing]], [[by-catch]], [[marine pollution]], [[environmental effects of fishing]], [[Fisheries and climate change|climate change]] and [[fish farming]].\n\nConservation issues are part of [[marine conservation]], and are addressed in [[fisheries science]] programs. There is a growing gap between how many fish are available to be caught and humanity's desire to catch them, a problem that gets worse as the [[world population]] grows.\n\nSimilar to other [[environmental issues]], there can be conflict between the fishermen who depend on fishing for their livelihoods and [[Fisheries scientists|fishery scientists]] who realise that if future fish populations are to be [[Sustainable fishing|sustainable]] then some fisheries must limit fishing or cease operations.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Animal welfare concerns==\n{{Further|Animal welfare|Pain in fish}}\n\nHistorically, some doubted that fish could experience pain. Laboratory experiments have shown that fish do react to painful stimuli (e.g., injections of bee [[venom]]) in a similar way to mammals.<ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last = Sneddon\n  | first = LU\n  | title = Pain perception in fish: indicators and endpoints.\n  | journal = ILAR Journal\n  | volume = 50\n  | issue = 4\n  | pages = 38\u201342\n  | pmid = 19949250\n  | accessdate =\n  | year=2009\n  | doi=10.1093/ilar.50.4.338| doi-access = free\n  }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal\n  | last1 = Oidtmann\n  | first1 = B\n  | authorlink =\n  | last2 = Hoffman\n  | first2 = RW\n  | title = Pain and suffering in fish\n  | journal = Berliner und M\u00fcnchener Tier\u00e4rztliche Wochenschrift\n  | volume = 114\n  | issue = 7\u20138\n  | pages = 277\u2013282\n  | date = Jul\u2013Aug 2001\n  | url =\n  | issn =\n  | doi =\n  | pmid = 11505801\n  | accessdate = }}</ref> This is controversial and has been disputed.{{Explain|reason=|date=November 2019}}<ref>{{cite journal\n  | title = Do fish feel pain?

[[Fishing techniques|Techniques]] for catching fish include [[Gathering seafood by hand|hand gathering]], [[Spearfishing|spearing]], [[Fish net|netting]], [[angling]] and [[Fish trap|trapping]]. \u201cFishing\u201d may include catching [[aquatic animal]]s other than fish, such as [[mollusc]]s, [[cephalopod]]s, [[crustacean]]s, and [[echinoderm]]s. The term is not normally applied to catching [[Fish farm|farmed fish]], or to [[aquatic mammal]]s, such as whales where the term [[whaling]] is more appropriate. In addition to being caught to be [[Fish as food|eaten]], fish are caught as [[Recreational fishing|recreational pastimes]].

However, where there are early examples of permanent settlements (though not necessarily permanently occupied) such as those at [[Lepenski Vir]], they are almost always associated with fishing as a major source of food.\n\n===Trawling===\nThe British [[Dogger (boat)|dogger]] was an early type of sailing [[Trawler (fishing)|trawler]] from the 17th century, but the modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of [[Brixham]]. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the [[overfishing|overfished]] waters of [[South Devon]]. The [[Brixham trawler]] that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall [[gaff rig]], which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long-distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of 'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries'.<ref name=\"kjappeal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.kjappeal.org/history.html |title=History of a Brixham trawler |author= |date=2 March 2009 |website= |publisher=JKappeal.org |accessdate=13 September 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202015738/http://kjappeal.org/history.html |archivedate=2 December 2010 |df= }}</ref>\n\n[[File:A Brixham trawler.jpg|thumb|left|Painting of ''A Brixham trawler'' by [[William Adolphus Knell]].

These were large boats, usually {{convert|80|-|90|ft}} in length with a beam of around {{convert|20|ft}}. They weighed 40\u201350 tons and travelled at {{convert|9|-|11|kn}}. The earliest purpose-built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in [[Leith]], Scotland in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first [[screw propeller|screw propelled]] [[steamship|steam trawler]] in the world.<ref name=\"grantontrawlers\">{{cite web|url=http://grantontrawlers.com/steam%20trawler.html|title=The Steam Trawler}}</ref>\n\nSteam trawlers were introduced at [[Grimsby]] and [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]] in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby. Trawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by [[World War I]] to [[Diesel engine|diesel]] and [[turbines]] by the end of [[World War II]].\n\nIn 1931, the first powered drum was created by Laurie Jarelainen. The drum was a circular device that was set to the side of the boat and would draw in the nets. Since [[World War II]], [[radio navigation aid]]s and [[Fishfinder|fish finders]] have been widely used. The first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the [[stern]]. The first purpose-built stern trawler was ''Fairtry'' built-in 1953 at [[Aberdeen]], Scotland. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the 'super trawler'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\">{{cite web|url=http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|title=HISTORY|access-date=16 July 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821172332/http://www.hulltrawler.net/Stern/additions/History.htm|archive-date=21 August 2013|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The ship served as a basis for the expansion of 'super trawlers' around the world in the following decades.<ref name=\"hulltrawler\"/>\n\n===Recreational fishing===\n{{main|Recreational fishing}}\n[[File:Louis John Rhead - Izaak Wolton and his scholar.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Izaak Walton]]'s ''[[The Compleat Angler|Compleat Angler]]'', published in 1653 helped popularise fly fishing as a sport.<br />Woodcut by [[Louis Rhead]]]]\nThe early evolution of fishing as recreation is not clear. For example, there is anecdotal evidence for [[fly fishing]] in Japan, however, fly fishing was likely to have been a means of survival, rather than recreation. The earliest English essay on recreational fishing was published in 1496, by [[Juliana Berners|Dame Juliana Berners]], the prioress of the Benedictine [[Sopwell Priory|Sopwell Nunnery]]. The essay was titled ''Treatyse of Fysshynge wyth an Angle'',<ref>Berners, Dame Juliana (1496) [http://www.luminarium.org/renascence-editions/berners/berners.html ''A treatyse of fysshynge wyth an Angle''] (transcription by Risa S.

''[[The Compleat Angler|Compleat Angler]]'' was written by [[Izaak Walton]] in 1653 (although Walton continued to add to it for a quarter of a century) and described the fishing in the [[Derbyshire]] [[River Wye, Derbyshire|Wye]].

Running rings began to appear along the fishing rods, which gave anglers greater control over the cast line. The rods themselves were also becoming increasingly sophisticated and specialised for different roles. Jointed rods became common from the middle of the century and [[bamboo]] came to be used for the top section of the rod, giving it a much greater strength and flexibility.\n\nThe industry also became commercialised \u2013 rods and tackle were sold at the [[haberdashers]] store. After the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666, artisans moved to [[Redditch]] which became a centre of production of fishing related products from the 1730s. Onesimus Ustonson established his shop in 1761, and his establishment remained as a market leader for the next century.

Instead of anglers twisting their lines \u2013 a laborious and time-consuming process \u2013 the new textile spinning machines allowed for a variety of tapered lines to be easily manufactured and marketed.\n\nBritish fly-fishing continued to develop in the 19th Century, with the emergence of fly fishing clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and fly fishing techniques.\n\nBy the mid to late 19th century, expanding [[leisure]] opportunities for the middle and lower classes began to have its effect on fly fishing, which steadily grew in mass appeal. The expansion of the railway network in Britain allowed the less affluent for the first time to take weekend trips to the seaside or rivers for fishing.

The reel was a wide drum that spooled out freely and was ideal for allowing the bait to drift along way out with the current. Geared multiplying reels never successfully caught on in Britain, but had more success in the United States, where similar models were modified by [[George Snyder (fly reels)|George Snyder]] of [[Kentucky]] into his bait-casting reel, the first American-made design in 1810.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flyfishinghistory.com/tech18th.htm|title=Fly Fishing in the Eighteenth Century|author=Andrew N.

[[Bamboo]] rods became the generally favoured option from the mid 19th century, and several strips of the material were cut from the cane, milled into shape, and then glued together to form the light, strong, hexagonal rods with a solid core that were superior to anything that preceded them. [[George Cotton]] and his predecessors fished their flies with long rods, and light lines allowing the wind to do most of the work of getting the fly to the fish.\n<ref name=\"Brit\">{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/208708/fishing/2330/Early-history#ref70275|title=fishing|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Trout fishing 1860s.jpg|thumb|left|Fishing became a popular recreational activity in the 19th century.

The introduction of new woods to the manufacture of fly rods made it possible to cast flies into the wind on silk lines, instead of [[horse hair]]. These lines allowed for a much greater casting distance. However, these early fly lines proved troublesome as they had to be coated with various dressings to make them float and needed to be taken off the reel and dried every four hours or so to prevent them from becoming waterlogged. Another negative consequence was that it became easy for the much longer line to get into a tangle \u2013 this was called a 'tangle' in Britain, and a 'backlash' in the US. This problem spurred the invention of the regulator to evenly spool the line out and prevent tangling.<ref name=\"Brit\"/>\n\nThe American, Charles F.

The term can also be applied to methods for catching other [[aquatic animal]]s such as [[molluscs]] ([[shellfish]], [[squid]], octopus) and edible marine [[invertebrate]]s.\n\nFishing techniques include [[Gathering seafood by hand|hand gathering]], [[spearfishing]], [[Fish net|netting]], [[angling]] and [[Fish trap|trapping]]. [[Recreational fishing|Recreational]], [[Commercial fishing|commercial]] and [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] fishers use different techniques, and also, sometimes, the same techniques. Recreational fishers fish for pleasure, sport, or to provide food for themselves, while commercial fishers fish for profit. Artisanal fishers use traditional, low-tech methods, for survival in third-world countries, and as a cultural heritage in other countries. Usually, recreational fishers use angling methods and commercial fishers use netting methods.\n\nWhy a fish bites a baited hook or lure involves several factors related to the sensory physiology, behaviour, feeding ecology, and biology of the fish as well as the environment and characteristics of the bait/hook/lure.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Lennox|first=Robert J|last2=Al\u00f3s|first2=Josep|last3=Arlinghaus|first3=Robert|last4=Horodysky|first4=Andrij|last5=Klefoth|first5=Thomas|last6=Monk|first6=Christopher T|last7=Cooke|first7=Steven J|title=What makes fish vulnerable to capture by hooks?

Almost any equipment or gear used for fishing can be called fishing tackle. Some examples are [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing line|lines]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]], [[Fishing float|floats]], [[Fishing rod|rods]], [[Fishing reel|reels]], [[Fishing bait|baits]], [[Fishing lure|lures]], [[Spearfishing|spears]], [[Fishing net|nets]], [[Fishing gaff|gaffs]], [[Fishing trap|traps]], [[Waders (footwear)|waders]] and tackle boxes.\n\nTackle that is attached to the end of a [[fishing line]] is called '''terminal tackle'''. This includes [[Fishing hook|hooks]], [[Fishing sinker|sinkers]], [[Fishing float|floats]], leaders, [[Fishing swivel|swivels]], split rings and wire, snaps, beads, spoons, blades, spinners and clevises to attach spinner blades to fishing lures. People also tend to use dead or live fish as another form of bait.\n\nFishing tackle refers to the physical equipment that is used when fishing, whereas [[fishing techniques]] refers to the ways the tackle is used when fishing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fishing vessels ==\n[[File:Krabbenkutter Ivonne Pellworm P5242390jm.JPG|thumb|left|Commercial crab boat working in the [[Fishing in the North Sea|North Sea]]]]\n[[File:Small sport fishing boat.jpg|thumb|right|Small [[sport fishing boat]]]]\n{{see also|Fishing vessels|Traditional fishing boats}}\n\nA fishing vessel is a boat or ship used to catch fish in the sea, or on a lake or river. Many different kinds of vessels are used in [[Commercial fishing|commercial]], [[Artisan fishing|artisanal]] and [[recreational fishing]].\n\nAccording to the [[FAO]], in 2004 there were four million commercial fishing vessels.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\">FAO 2007</ref> About 1.3 million of these are decked vessels with enclosed areas. Nearly all of these decked vessels are mechanised, and 40,000 of them are over 100 tons. At the other extreme, two-thirds (1.8 million) of the [[Deck (ship)|undecked]] boats are traditional craft of various types, powered only by sail and oars.<ref name=\"FAO 2007\"/> These boats are used by [[Artisan fishing|artisan fishers]].\n\nIt is difficult to estimate how many [[Recreational boat fishing|recreational fishing boats]] there are, although the number is high. The term is fluid since most recreational boats are also used for fishing from time to time. Unlike most commercial fishing vessels, recreational fishing boats are often not dedicated just to fishing. Just about anything that will stay afloat can be called a recreational fishing boat, so long as a [[fisherman]] periodically climbs aboard with the intent to catch a fish. Fish are caught for recreational purposes from boats which range from [[dugout canoe]]s, [[float tube]]s, [[kayaks]], [[raft]]s, [[pontoon boat]]s and small [[Dinghy|dinghies]] to [[Runabout (boat)|runabouts]], [[cabin cruiser]]s and cruising yachts to large, hi-tech and luxurious [[Big-game fishing|big game]] rigs.<ref>[[NOAA]]: [http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/speciesid/fish_page/fish51a.html Sport fishing boat]</ref> Larger boats, purpose-built with recreational fishing in mind, usually have large, open [[Cockpit (sailing)|cockpits]] at the [[stern]], designed for convenient fishing.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Traditional fishing ==\n{{main|Artisan fishing}}\n\nTraditional fishing is any kind of small scale, [[commercial fishing|commercial]] or [[subsistence economy|subsistence]] fishing practices using traditional techniques such as [[Fishing rod|rod]] and [[Fishing tackle|tackle]], [[arrow]]s and [[harpoon]]s, [[throw net]]s and drag nets, etc.\n\n== Recreational fishing ==\n[[File:An evening fishing - by Francis Hannaway.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Angling]]}}]]\n{{main|Recreational fishing}}\n\n[[Recreation]]al and sport fishing are fishing primarily for [[pleasure]] or competition. Recreational fishing has conventions, rules, licensing restrictions and laws that limit how fish may be caught; typically, these prohibit the use of nets and the catching of fish with hooks not in the mouth. The most common form of recreational fishing is done with a [[fishing rod|rod]], [[fishing reel|reel]], [[fishing line|line]], [[Fish hook|hooks]] and any one of a wide range of [[Bait (luring substance)|baits]] or [[Fishing lure|lures]] such as [[Artificial fly|artificial flies]]. The practice of catching or attempting to catch fish with a hook is generally known as [[angling]]. In angling, it is sometimes expected or required that fish be returned to the water ([[catch and release]]). Recreational or sport fishermen may log their catches or participate in fishing competitions.\n\n[[Big-game fishing]] is fishing from boats to catch large open-water species such as [[tuna]], [[shark]]s, and [[marlin]]. Sportfishing (sometimes game fishing) is recreational fishing where the primary reward is the challenge of finding and catching the fish rather than the [[culinary]] or financial value of the fish's flesh. Fish sought after include [[tarpon]], [[sailfish]], [[mackerel]] and many others.\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fishing industry ==\n{{Main|Fishing industry}}\n\n<gallery widths=\"300px\">\nContribution of fish to animal protein supply, average 2013-2015.svg|Contribution of fish to animal protein supply, average 2013-2015\nFile:World capture fisheries and aquaculture production.svg|World capture fisheries and aquaculture production 1950 - 2015\n</gallery>\n\n[[File:Albatun Dod.jpg|thumb|right|Modern Spanish [[tuna]] [[purse seiner]] in the [[Seychelles Islands]].]]\n\nThe fishing industry includes any industry or activity concerned with taking, culturing, processing, preserving, storing, transporting, marketing or selling fish or fish products.

Those who practice it must often pursue fish far from the land under adverse conditions. Commercial fishermen harvest almost all aquatic species, from [[tuna]], [[cod]] and [[salmon]] to [[shrimp]], [[krill]], [[lobster]], [[clam]]s, [[squid]] and [[crab]], in various [[fishery|fisheries]] for these species. Commercial fishing methods have become very efficient using large nets and sea-going processing factories. [[Individual fishing quota]]s and international treaties seek to control the species and quantities caught.\n\nA commercial fishing enterprise may vary from one man with a small boat with hand-casting nets or a few pot traps, to a huge fleet of [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] processing tons of fish every day.\n\nCommercial fishing gear includes weights, [[Fishing net|nets]] (e.g. purse [[Seine fishing|seine]]), seine nets (e.g. beach seine), [[trawl]]s (e.g. [[Bottom trawling|bottom trawl]]), dredges, [[Fish hook|hooks]] and line (e.g. [[Long-line fishing|long line]] and [[Hand-line fishing|handline]]), lift nets, [[gillnet]]s, entangling nets and [[Fishing trap|traps]].\n\nAccording to the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the United Nations, the total world [[Wild fisheries|capture fisheries]] production in 2000 was 86 million tons (FAO 2002). The top producing countries were, in order, the People's Republic of China (excluding Hong Kong and Taiwan), Peru, Japan, the United States, Chile, Indonesia, Russia, India, Thailand, Norway, and Iceland. Those countries accounted for more than half of the world's production; China alone accounted for a third of the world's production. Of that production, over 90% was marine and less than 10% was inland.\n\nA small number of species support the majority of the world's fisheries. Some of these species are [[herring]], [[cod]], [[anchovy]], [[tuna]], [[flounder]], [[Mullet (fish)|mullet]], [[squid]], [[shrimp]], [[salmon]], crab, [[lobster]], [[oyster]] and [[scallop]]s. All except these last four provided a worldwide catch of well over a [[million]] [[tonne]]s in 1999, with [[herring]] and [[sardine]]s together providing a catch of over 22 million metric tons in 1999. Many other species as well are fished in smaller numbers.\n\n===Fish farms===\n{{main|Fish farm}}\nFish farming is the principal form of [[aquaculture]], while other methods may fall under [[mariculture]]. It involves raising fish commercially in tanks or enclosures, usually for food. A facility that releases [[juvenile fish]] into the wild for recreational fishing or to supplement a species' natural population is generally referred to as a [[fish hatchery]]. Fish species raised by fish farms include [[Aquaculture of salmon|salmon]], [[carp]], [[Aquaculture of tilapia|tilapia]], [[Aquaculture of catfish|catfish]] and  [[trout]].\n\nIncreased demands on [[wild fisheries]] by [[commercial fishing]] has caused widespread [[overfishing]]. Fish farming offers an alternative solution to the increasing market demand for fish.\n\n[[File:Derkovits, Gyula - Still-life with Fish I (1928).jpg|thumb|right|[[Gyula Derkovits]], ''still-life with fish'' (1928)]]\n\n===Fish products===\n{{see also|Fish processing|Fish products|Fish (food)|Seafood}}\nFish and fish products are [[Fish as food|consumed as food]] all over the world. With other [[seafood]]s, it provides the world's prime source of high-quality [[protein]]: 14\u201316 percent of the animal protein consumed worldwide. Over one billion people rely on fish as their primary source of animal protein.<ref>Tidwell, James H. and Allan, Geoff L.</ref>\n\nFish and other aquatic organisms are also processed into various food and non-food products, such as sharkskin leather, pigments made from the inky secretions of [[cuttlefish]], [[isinglass]] used for the [[clarification (wine)|clarification]] of wine and beer, [[fish emulsion]] used as a [[fertiliser]], [[Animal glue|fish glue]], [[fish oil]] and [[fish meal]].\n\nFish are also collected live for research and the [[aquarium]] trade.\n\n===Fish marketing===\n{{see also|Fish market|Fish marketing}}\n{{clear}}\n\n== Fisheries management ==\n[[File:Fishing down the food web.jpg|thumb|right|{{center|[[Fishing down the food web]]}}]]\n{{main|Fisheries management|Fisheries science}}\n\nFisheries management draws on [[fisheries science]] to find ways to protect [[fishery]] resources so sustainable exploitation is possible. Modern fisheries management is often referred to as a governmental system of (hopefully appropriate) management rules based on defined objectives and a mix of management means to implement the rules, which are put in place by a system of [[monitoring control and surveillance]].\n\nFisheries science is the academic discipline of managing and understanding fisheries. It is a multidisciplinary science, which draws on the disciplines of [[oceanography]], [[marine biology]], [[marine conservation]], ecology, [[Population dynamics of fisheries|population dynamics]], economics and management in an attempt to provide an integrated picture of fisheries.

It was serialized in ''[[Cookie (manga magazine)|Cookie]]'' magazine from July 2000 until June 2009 when it went on indefinite hiatus, with almost all its chapters collected into 21 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes published by [[Shueisha]]. The series derives its title from the name of the two main characters, both of whom are called Nana. [[Nana Komatsu (Nana)|Nana Komatsu]] is a small town girl who goes to [[Tokyo]] to follow her boyfriend and college friends, with the hope of having her dream life. [[List_of_Nana_characters#Nana_Oosaki|Nana Oosaki]] was in a popular [[punk rock]] band in her hometown. She goes to Tokyo with the goal of making it big as a singer. The two Nanas meet on the train ride to the city. Later, they run into each other again when they happen to check out the same apartment, and the girls decide to become roommates. The series chronicles their friendship and their lives as each chases her dreams.\n\nThe manga was adapted into a [[Nana (2005 film)|live-action film]] in 2005, with [[Nana 2|a sequel]] released in 2006. An [[anime]] adaptation created by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] aired on [[Nippon TV]] between April 5, 2006 and March 27, 2007. All ''Nana'' media has been licensed for English language release in North America by [[Viz Media]]. They serialized the manga in their ''[[Shojo Beat]]'' magazine until the August 2007 issue, while also publishing it in the ''tank\u014dbon'' format. They released both films in 2008 and their English dub of the anime was broadcast on the [[Funimation Channel]] beginning in September 2009. ''Nana'' won the 2002 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[Sh\u014djo manga|''Sh\u014djo'' manga]] and has sold over 43 million copies.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Nana characters|List of Nana chapters}}\n[[Nana Komatsu (Nana)|Nana Komatsu]] has a habit of falling in love at first sight all the time, and depending on other people to help her. When her friends, and her then boyfriend, leave for Tokyo, she decides to join them a year later after having saved enough money at the age of twenty.\n\n[[List_of_Nana_characters#Nana_Oosaki|Nana Oosaki]], the other Nana, is the [[Punk fashion|punk-styled]] lead vocalist of a band called Black Stones (BLAST for short). She had lived with her boyfriend, bassist Ren Honjou since she was 16, but when Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of a popular band called Trapnest, Nana chooses to continue on with BLAST and to cultivate her own career instead of following Ren, as she has too much ambition to be relegated to a rockstar's girlfriend. She eventually leaves for Tokyo at the age of twenty to start her musical career.\n\nThe two Nanas meet on a train by chance, both on their way to Tokyo. After a string of coincidences, they come to share an apartment. Despite having contrasting personalities and ideals, the Nanas respect each other and become close friends. While BLAST begins to gain popularity at live gigs, the two Nanas face many other issues together, especially in the areas of friendship and romance. The story of Nana revolves heavily around the romance and relationships of the two characters as one seeks fame and recognition while the other seeks love and happiness.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Nana chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by [[Ai Yazawa]], ''Nana'' premiered in ''[[Cookie (manga magazine)|Cookie]]'' in 2000 where it ran until June 2009, when the series was put on hiatus due to Yazawa falling ill.<ref name=\"AiIll\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-26/nana-ai-yazawa-puts-manga-on-hold-due-to-illness |title=Nana's Ai Yazawa Puts Manga on Hold Due to Illness|date=2009-06-26|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> Yazawa returned from the hospital in early April 2010, but has not specified when or if she will resume the manga.<ref name=\"AiWell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-25/nana-manga-creator-ai-yazawa-returns-from-hospital|title=Nana Manga Creator Ai Yazawa Returns from Hospital|date=2010-05-30|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> The individual chapters have been collected and published into 21 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes in Japan by [[Shueisha]] under the Ribon Mascot Comics Cookie imprint, except for the four last chapters which were published individually in ''Cookie'' but never released in tank\u014dbon form.\n\n''Nana'' is licensed for English-language release in North America by [[Viz Media]].

It was serialized in ''[[Cookie (manga magazine)|Cookie]]'' magazine from July 2000 until June 2009 when it went on indefinite hiatus, with almost all its chapters collected into 21 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes published by [[Shueisha]]. The series derives its title from the name of the two main characters, both of whom are called Nana. [[Nana Komatsu (Nana)|Nana Komatsu]] is a small town girl who goes to [[Tokyo]] to follow her boyfriend and college friends, with the hope of having her dream life. [[List_of_Nana_characters#Nana_Oosaki|Nana Oosaki]] was in a popular [[punk rock]] band in her hometown. She goes to Tokyo with the goal of making it big as a singer. The two Nanas meet on the train ride to the city. Later, they run into each other again when they happen to check out the same apartment, and the girls decide to become roommates. The series chronicles their friendship and their lives as each chases her dreams.\n\nThe manga was adapted into a [[Nana (2005 film)|live-action film]] in 2005, with [[Nana 2|a sequel]] released in 2006. An [[anime]] adaptation created by [[Madhouse (company)|Madhouse]] aired on [[Nippon TV]] between April 5, 2006 and March 27, 2007. All ''Nana'' media has been licensed for English language release in North America by [[Viz Media]]. They serialized the manga in their ''[[Shojo Beat]]'' magazine until the August 2007 issue, while also publishing it in the ''tank\u014dbon'' format. They released both films in 2008 and their English dub of the anime was broadcast on the [[Funimation Channel]] beginning in September 2009. ''Nana'' won the 2002 [[Shogakukan Manga Award]] for [[Sh\u014djo manga|''Sh\u014djo'' manga]] and has sold over 43 million copies.\n\n==Plot==\n{{See also|List of Nana characters|List of Nana chapters}}\n[[Nana Komatsu (Nana)|Nana Komatsu]] has a habit of falling in love at first sight all the time, and depending on other people to help her. When her friends, and her then boyfriend, leave for Tokyo, she decides to join them a year later after having saved enough money at the age of twenty.\n\n[[List_of_Nana_characters#Nana_Oosaki|Nana Oosaki]], the other Nana, is the [[Punk fashion|punk-styled]] lead vocalist of a band called Black Stones (BLAST for short). She had lived with her boyfriend, bassist Ren Honjou since she was 16, but when Ren is offered a chance to debut in Tokyo as a replacement member of a popular band called Trapnest, Nana chooses to continue on with BLAST and to cultivate her own career instead of following Ren, as she has too much ambition to be relegated to a rockstar's girlfriend. She eventually leaves for Tokyo at the age of twenty to start her musical career.\n\nThe two Nanas meet on a train by chance, both on their way to Tokyo. After a string of coincidences, they come to share an apartment. Despite having contrasting personalities and ideals, the Nanas respect each other and become close friends. While BLAST begins to gain popularity at live gigs, the two Nanas face many other issues together, especially in the areas of friendship and romance. The story of Nana revolves heavily around the romance and relationships of the two characters as one seeks fame and recognition while the other seeks love and happiness.\n\n==Media==\n\n===Manga===\n{{main|List of Nana chapters}}\nWritten and illustrated by [[Ai Yazawa]], ''Nana'' premiered in ''[[Cookie (manga magazine)|Cookie]]'' in 2000 where it ran until June 2009, when the series was put on hiatus due to Yazawa falling ill.<ref name=\"AiIll\">{{cite web |url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2009-06-26/nana-ai-yazawa-puts-manga-on-hold-due-to-illness |title=Nana's Ai Yazawa Puts Manga on Hold Due to Illness|date=2009-06-26|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> Yazawa returned from the hospital in early April 2010, but has not specified when or if she will resume the manga.<ref name=\"AiWell\">{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-04-25/nana-manga-creator-ai-yazawa-returns-from-hospital|title=Nana Manga Creator Ai Yazawa Returns from Hospital|date=2010-05-30|publisher=[[Anime News Network]]|accessdate=2010-05-30}}</ref> The individual chapters have been collected and published into 21 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes in Japan by [[Shueisha]] under the Ribon Mascot Comics Cookie imprint, except for the four last chapters which were published individually in ''Cookie'' but never released in tank\u014dbon form.\n\n''Nana'' is licensed for English-language release in North America by [[Viz Media]].

In his book ''[[Weaving the Web: The Original Design and Ultimate Destiny of the World Wide Web by its inventor|Weaving The Web]]'', he explains that he had repeatedly suggested to members of ''both'' technical communities that a marriage between the two technologies was possible. But, when no one took up his invitation, he finally assumed the project himself. In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web.

Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet|title=Internet legal definition of Internet|publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary|date=15 July 2009|encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2|accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref> Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www|title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition|publisher=TechTerms|accessdate=19 February 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015356/http://www.techterms.com/definition/www|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Web is an [[information space]] containing hyperlinked documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], identified by their URIs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ian|last2=Walsh|first2=Norman|title=Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|publisher=W3C|accessdate=11 February 2015|location=Introduction|date=15 December 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209063216/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].\n\nBerners-Lee was [[Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 2004 by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for \"services to the global development of the Internet\".<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite web|title=Supplement no.1, Diplomatic and Overseas List, K.B.E.|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|website=thegazette.co.uk|publisher=The Gazette|date=31 December 2003|accessdate=7 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203092022/https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Web's inventor gets a knighthood|publisher=BBC|date=31 December 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|accessdate=25 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223055131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He never patented his invention.\n\n== Function ==\n{{main|HTTP|HTML}}\n[[File:Internet Key Layers.png|thumb|The World Wide Web functions as an [[application layer]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] that is run \"on top of\" (figuratively) the Internet, helping to make it more functional.

However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]] and for HTTPS protocol it normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 443]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</source>\n\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</source>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>www.Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (<source lang=\"html\" inline><title></source>, <source lang=\"HTML\" inline><p></source> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n=== HTML ===\n{{main|HTML}}\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard [[markup language]] for creating [[web page]]s and [[web application]]s. With [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and [[JavaScript]], it forms a triad of [[cornerstone]] technologies for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=David|title=JavaScript \u2013 The definitive guide|page=1|edition=6|quote=JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of web pages.}}</ref>\n\n[[Web browser]]s receive HTML documents from a [[web server]] or from local storage and [[browser engine|render]] the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2013 W3C Recommendation \u2013 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Linking ===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<source lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">www.Example.org Homepage</a></source>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\" />\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n=== WWW prefix ===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming [[Internet]] hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[Usenet]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c |title=Why a domain's root can't be a CNAME \u2013 and other tidbits about the DNS |author=Dominic Fraser |date=May 13, 2018 |work=FreeCodeCamp}}</ref>{{Dubious |reason=While CNAMEs are more flexible than the bare domain requiring an A Record, load balancing is certainly possible even for sites that skip www and use the bare domain \u2014 see, for example, Twitter.|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''.

They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend <nowiki>http://</nowiki> to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\n\n===Pages===\n{{main|Web page}}\n[[File:Commons.png|thumb|A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons]]\nA ''web page'' (also written as ''webpage'') is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and [[web browser]]s. A web browser displays a web page on a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[mobile device]].\n\nThe term ''web page'' usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the [[computer file]] itself, which is usually a [[text file]] containing [[hypertext]] written in [[HTML]] or a comparable [[markup language]]. Typical web pages provide [[hypertext]] for browsing to other web pages via [[hyperlink]]s, often referred to as ''links''. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple [[web resource]] elements, such as reading [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], [[client-side scripting|scripts]], and images, while presenting each web page.\n\nOn a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote [[web server]]. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) to make such requests to the [[web server]].\n\nA [[static web page|''static'' web page]] is delivered exactly as stored, as [[web content]] in the web server's [[file system]]. In contrast, a [[dynamic web page|''dynamic'' web page]] is generated by a [[web application]], usually driven by [[server-side scripting|server-side software]]. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.\n\n==== Static page ====\n{{main|Static web page}}\nA ''static web page'' (sometimes called a ''flat page/stationary page'') is a [[web page]] that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to [[dynamic web page]]s which are generated by a [[web application]].\n\nConsequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a [[web server]] to [[content negotiation|negotiate]] [[MIME type|content-type]] or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.\n\n==== Dynamic pages ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[File:Scheme dynamic page en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting ([[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]).]]\nA ''server-side dynamic web page'' is a [[web page]] whose construction is controlled by an [[application server]] processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nA ''client-side dynamic web page'' processes the web page using [[HTML scripting]] running in the browser as it loads.  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the [[Document Object Model]], or DOM, that represents the loaded web page.  The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.\n\nA dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a [[computer program]] to change some variable content.  The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a ''dynamic web page update'' using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the [[web browsing history]] forward of the displayed page.  Using Ajax technologies the end [[User (computing)|user]] gets ''one dynamic page'' managed as a single page in the [[web browser]] while the actual [[web content]] rendered on that page can vary.  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, ''the'' DOM, for its client, from an application server.\n\n[[DHTML]] is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not [[static web page]]s, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.\n\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Website===\n[[File:United States Antarctic Program website from 2018 02 22.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[United States Antarctic Program|usap.gov]] website]]\n{{main|website}}\nA ''website''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Website|title=website|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=|access-date=2011-07-02}}</ref> is a collection of related web resources including [[web page]]s, [[multimedia]] content, typically identified with a common [[domain name]], and published on at least one [[web server]]. Notable examples are [[wikipedia]].org, [[google]].com, and [[Amazon (company)|amazon.com]].\n\nA website may be accessible via a public [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network, such as the [[Internet]], or a private [[local area network]] (LAN), by referencing a [[URL|uniform resource locator]] (URL) that identifies the site.\n\nWebsites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a [[personal website]], a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and [[social networking]] to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an [[intranet]].\n\nWeb pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are [[document]]s, typically composed in [[plain text]] interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language ([[HTML]], [[XHTML]]). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable [[HTML anchor|markup anchors]]. Web pages are accessed and transported with the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption ([[HTTP Secure]], HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often a [[web browser]], renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a [[Computer monitor|display terminal]].\n\n[[Hyperlink]]ing between web pages conveys to the reader the [[site map|site structure]] and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a [[home page]] containing a directory of the site [[web content]]. Some websites require user registration or [[subscription]] to access content. Examples of [[paywall|subscription websites]] include many business sites, news websites, [[academic journal]] websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, [[Internet forum|message boards]], web-based [[email]], [[social networking]] websites, websites providing real-time [[stock market]] data, as well as sites providing various other services. [[End user]]s can access websites on a range of devices, including [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop|laptop computers]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartphone]]s and [[smart TV]]s.\n\n===Browser===\n{{main|Web browser}}\nA ''web browser'' (commonly referred to as a ''browser'') is a [[software application|software]] [[user agent]] for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's [[web server|server]] and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format and display a web page on the user's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/internet/difference-between-search-engine-and-browser/ |title=Difference Between Search Engine and Browser}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing users to find, displaying and moving between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below) and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites.\n\nThe most popular browsers are [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Internet Explorer]],<!--note IE still widely used per Market Share below so keep it here--> and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]].\n\n===Server===\n{{main|Web server}}\n\n[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|right|The inside and front of a [[Dell PowerEdge]] web server, a computer designed for [[rack mount]]ing]]\nA ''Web server'' is [[server software]], or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related protocols.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to [[Client (computing)|clients]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0596001728|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content.\n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can also frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n===Cookie===\n{{main|HTTP cookie}}\nAn ''HTTP cookie'' (also called ''web cookie'', ''Internet cookie'', ''browser cookie'', or simply ''cookie'') is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's [[web browser]] while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember [[program state|stateful]] information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, [[access control|logging in]], or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.\n\nCookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, ''authentication cookies'' are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's [[comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities|web browser]], and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] for examples).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9918582-57.html |first=Robert |last=Vamosi |title=Gmail cookie stolen via Google Spreadsheets|website=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTracking cookies, and especially [[#Third-party cookie|third-party tracking cookies]], are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories {{En dash}} a potential [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European<ref>{{cite web |title=What about the \"EU Cookie Directive\"? |url=http://webcookies.org/faq/#Directive |year=2013 |publisher=WebCookies.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.<ref name=\"eulaw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen.

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as [[search engine results page]]s (SERPs). The information may be a mix of [[web page]]s, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers and other types of files. Some search engines also [[data mining|mine data]] available in [[database]]s or [[web directory|open directories]].  Unlike [[web directories]], which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain [[real-time computing|real-time]] information by running an [[algorithm]] on a [[web crawler]].\nInternet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the [[deep web]].\n\n===Deep web===\n{{main|Deep web}}\nThe deep web,<ref name=\"nhamilton\">{{cite journal|citeseerx=10.1.1.90.5847|title=The Mechanics of a Deep Net Metasearch Engine|last=Hamilton|first=Nigel}}</ref> ''invisible web'',<ref name=\"jal\">{{cite journal|title=Beyond google: the invisible web in the academic library |volume=30|issue=4|date=July 2004|pages=265\u2013269|last1=Devine|first1=Jane|last2=Egger-Sider|first2=Francine|journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship |doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2004.04.010 }}</ref> or ''hidden web''<ref name=\"cthw\">{{cite journal|title=Crawling the Hidden Web|journal=27th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases|date=September 11\u201314, 2001|first1=Sriram|last1=Raghavan|first2=Hector|last2=Garcia-Molina|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/725/}}</ref> are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] by standard [[web search engine]]s.

Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.\n\n== Security ==\nFor [[criminal]]s, the Web has become a venue to spread [[malware]] and engage in a range of

Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hide [[personally identifiable information]] is by using a [[VPN]]. A VPN [[encryption|encrypts]] online traffic and masks original IP address lowering the chance of user identification. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Web standards}}\nWeb standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the [[Internet]], not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and [[web service]]s. Considerations include the [[interoperability]], [[accessibility]] and [[usability]] of web pages and web sites.\n\nWeb standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:\n* ''Recommendations'' published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations |title=W3C Technical Reports and Publications | publisher=W3C | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* \"Living Standard\" made by the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG)\n* ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | title=IETF RFC page | publisher=IETF | accessdate=2009-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124230/http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=world+wide+web&published=on&active_tab=standards |title=Search for World Wide Web in ISO standards | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by [[Ecma International]] (formerly ECMA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html | title=Ecma formal publications  | publisher=Ecma | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Unicode]] Standard'' and various ''Unicode Technical Reports'' (UTRs) published by the [[Unicode Consortium]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/index.html | title=Unicode Technical Reports | publisher=Unicode Consortium | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* Name and number registries maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iana.org/ | title=IANA home page | publisher=IANA | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n\nWeb standards are not fixed sets of rules, but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Leslie Sikos | title= Web standards \u2013 Mastering HTML5, CSS3, and XML | publisher= [[Apress]] | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4302-4041-9 | url= http://www.masteringhtml5css3.com/}}</ref> Web standards are developed by [[standards organization]]s\u2014groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization\u2014not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in case of [[W3C]] specifications, the highest maturity level).\n\n== Accessibility ==\n{{Main|Web accessibility}}\nThere are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with [[disability|disabilities]]. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.<ref name=WAI>{{cite web|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402001730/http://www.w3.org/WAI/|archivedate=2 April 2009}}</ref> The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society.

In the process, he developed three essential technologies:\n* a system of globally unique identifiers for resources on the Web and elsewhere, the universal document identifier (UDI), later known as [[uniform resource locator]] (URL) and [[uniform resource identifier]] (URI);\n* the publishing language [[Hypertext Markup Language]] (HTML);\n* the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP).<ref>{{cite web|title=Inventor of the Week Archive: The World Wide Web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|publisher=[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]]: MIT School of Engineering|accessdate=23 July 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608081841/http://web.mit.edu/invent/iow/berners-lee.html|archivedate=8 June 2010}}</ref>\n\nThe World Wide Web had several differences from other hypertext systems available at the time. The Web required only unidirectional links rather than bidirectional ones, making it possible for someone to link to another resource without action by the owner of that resource. It also significantly reduced the difficulty of implementing web servers and browsers (in comparison to earlier systems), but in turn presented the chronic problem of ''[[link rot]]''. Unlike predecessors such as [[HyperCard]], the World Wide Web was non-proprietary, making it possible to develop servers and clients independently and to add extensions without licensing restrictions. On 30 April 1993, CERN announced that the World Wide Web would be free to anyone, with no fees due.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|title=Ten Years Public Domain for the Original Web Software|publisher=Tenyears-www.web.cern.ch|date=30 April 2003|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813032723/http://tenyears-www.web.cern.ch/tenyears-www/Welcome.html|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Coming two months after the announcement that the server implementation of the [[Gopher (protocol)|Gopher]] protocol was no longer free to use, this produced a rapid shift away from Gopher and toward the Web.

Mosaic's graphical user interface allowed the Web to become by far the most popular protocol on the Internet. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C) was founded by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994. It was founded at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] Laboratory for Computer Science (MIT/LCS) with support from the [[Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), which had pioneered the Internet; a year later, a second site was founded at [[INRIA]] (a French national computer research lab) with support from the [[European Commission]] DG InfSo; and in 1996, a third continental site was created in Japan at [[Keio University]]. By the end of 1994, the total number of websites was still relatively small, but many [[List of websites founded before 1995|notable websites]] were already active that foreshadowed or inspired today's most popular services.\n\nConnected by the Internet, other websites were created around the world. This motivated international standards development for protocols and formatting. Berners-Lee continued to stay involved in guiding the development of web standards, such as the [[markup language]]s to compose web pages and he advocated his vision of a [[Semantic Web]]. The World Wide Web enabled the spread of information over the Internet through an easy-to-use and flexible format. It thus played an important role in popularising use of the Internet.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Internet|title=Internet legal definition of Internet|publisher=Free Online Law Dictionary|date=15 July 2009|encyclopedia=West's Encyclopedia of American Law, edition 2|accessdate=25 November 2008}}</ref> Although the two terms are sometimes [[conflation|conflated]] in popular use, ''World Wide Web'' is not [[synonym]]ous with ''Internet''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://techterms.com/definition/www|title=WWW (World Wide Web) Definition|publisher=TechTerms|accessdate=19 February 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511015356/http://www.techterms.com/definition/www|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Web is an [[information space]] containing hyperlinked documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], identified by their URIs.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ian|last2=Walsh|first2=Norman|title=Architecture of the World Wide Web, Volume One|url=http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|publisher=W3C|accessdate=11 February 2015|location=Introduction|date=15 December 2004|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209063216/http://www.w3.org/TR/webarch/#intro|archivedate=9 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It is implemented as both client and server software using Internet protocols such as [[TCP/IP]] and [[HTTP]].\n\nBerners-Lee was [[Order of the British Empire|knighted]] in 2004 by Queen [[Elizabeth II]] for \"services to the global development of the Internet\".<ref name=\"gaz\">{{cite web|title=Supplement no.1, Diplomatic and Overseas List, K.B.E.|url=https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|website=thegazette.co.uk|publisher=The Gazette|date=31 December 2003|accessdate=7 February 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203092022/https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/57155/supplement/24/data.pdf|archivedate=3 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Web's inventor gets a knighthood|publisher=BBC|date=31 December 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|accessdate=25 May 2008|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071223055131/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/3357073.stm|archivedate=23 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref> He never patented his invention.\n\n== Function ==\n{{main|HTTP|HTML}}\n[[File:Internet Key Layers.png|thumb|The World Wide Web functions as an [[application layer]] [[communications protocol|protocol]] that is run \"on top of\" (figuratively) the Internet, helping to make it more functional.  The advent of the [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser helped to make the web much more usable, to include the display of images and moving images ([[GIF]]s).]]\n\nThe terms ''Internet'' and ''World Wide Web'' are often used without much distinction. However, the two terms do not mean the same thing. The Internet is a global system of interconnected [[computer network]]s. In contrast, the World Wide Web is a global collection of documents and other [[Web resource|resources]], linked by hyperlinks and [[Uniform Resource Identifier|URIs]]. Web resources are accessed using [[HTTP]] or [[HTTPS]], which are application-level Internet protocols that use the Internet's transport protocols.<ref>{{cite web|title=What is the difference between the Web and the Internet?|url=https://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=18 April 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422072749/http://www.w3.org/Help/#webinternet|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nViewing a [[web page]] on the World Wide Web normally begins either by typing the [[uniform resource locator|URL]] of the page into a web browser, or by following a hyperlink to that page or resource. The web browser then initiates a series of background communication messages to fetch and display the requested page. In the 1990s, using a browser to view web pages\u2014and to move from one web page to another through hyperlinks\u2014came to be known as 'browsing,' 'web surfing' (after [[channel surfing]]), or 'navigating the Web'. Early studies of this new behaviour investigated user patterns in using web browsers. One study, for example, found five user patterns: exploratory surfing, window surfing, evolved surfing, bounded navigation and targeted navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Muylle|first=Steve|author2=Rudy Moenaert|author3=Marc Despont|title=A grounded theory of World Wide Web search behaviour|journal=Journal of Marketing Communications|year=1999|volume=5|issue=3|page=143|doi=10.1080/135272699345644|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe following example demonstrates the functioning of a web browser when accessing a page at the URL <code><nowiki>http://www.example.org/home.html</nowiki></code>. The browser resolves the server name of the URL (<code>www.example.org</code>) into an [[IP address|Internet Protocol address]] using the globally distributed [[Domain Name System]] (DNS). This lookup returns an IP address such as ''203.0.113.4'' or ''2001:db8:2e::7334''. The browser then requests the resource by sending an [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] request across the Internet to the computer at that address. It requests service from a specific TCP port number that is well known for the HTTP service, so that the receiving host can distinguish an HTTP request from other network protocols it may be servicing.  The HTTP protocol normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 80]] and for HTTPS protocol it normally uses [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port number 443]]. The content of the HTTP request can be as simple as two lines of text:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nGET /home.html HTTP/1.1\nHost: www.example.org\n</source>\n\nThe computer receiving the HTTP request delivers it to web server software listening for requests on port 80. If the web server can fulfil the request it sends an HTTP response back to the browser indicating success:\n<source lang=\"http\">\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\n</source>\n\nfollowed by the content of the requested page. HyperText Markup Language ([[HTML]]) for a basic web page might look like this:\n<source lang=\"html\">\n<html>\n  <head>\n    <title>www.Example.org \u2013 The World Wide Web</title>\n  </head>\n  <body>\n    <p>The World Wide Web, abbreviated as WWW and commonly known ...</p>\n  </body>\n</html>\n</source>\n\nThe web browser [[parsing|parses]] the HTML and interprets the markup (<source lang=\"html\" inline><title></source>, <source lang=\"HTML\" inline><p></source> for paragraph, and such) that surrounds the words to format the text on the screen. Many web pages use HTML to reference the URLs of other resources such as images, other embedded media, [[Client-side scripting|scripts]] that affect page behaviour, and [[Cascading Style Sheets]] that affect page layout. The browser makes additional HTTP requests to the web server for these other [[Internet media type]]s. As it receives their content from the web server, the browser progressively [[Browser engine|renders]] the page onto the screen as specified by its HTML and these additional resources.\n\n=== HTML ===\n{{main|HTML}}\nHypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard [[markup language]] for creating [[web page]]s and [[web application]]s. With [[Cascading Style Sheets]] (CSS) and [[JavaScript]], it forms a triad of [[cornerstone]] technologies for the World Wide Web.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Flanagan|first1=David|title=JavaScript \u2013 The definitive guide|page=1|edition=6|quote=JavaScript is part of the triad of technologies that all Web developers must learn: HTML to specify the content of web pages, CSS to specify the presentation of web pages, and JavaScript to specify the behaviour of web pages.}}</ref>\n\n[[Web browser]]s receive HTML documents from a [[web server]] or from local storage and [[browser engine|render]] the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page [[Semantic Web|semantically]] and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.\n\n[[HTML element]]s are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, [[HTML element#Images and objects|images]] and other objects such as [[Fieldset|interactive forms]] may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create [[structured document]]s by denoting structural [[semantics]] for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, [[Hyperlink|links]], quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by ''tags'', written using [[Bracket#Angle brackets|angle brackets]]. Tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<img />}} and {{code|lang=html|<input />}} directly introduce content into the page. Other tags such as {{code|lang=html|code=<p>}} surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.\n\nHTML can embed programs written in a [[scripting language]] such as [[JavaScript]], which affects the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. The [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML {{as of|1997|lc=y|since=y|post=.}}<ref name=\"deprecated\">{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-html40-971218/conform.html#deprecated|title=HTML 4.0 Specification \u2013 W3C Recommendation \u2013 Conformance: requirements and recommendations|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|date=December 18, 1997|accessdate=July 6, 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== Linking ===\nMost web pages contain hyperlinks to other related pages and perhaps to downloadable files, source documents, definitions and other web resources. In the underlying HTML, a hyperlink looks like this:\n<source lang=\"html\" inline><a href=\"http://www.example.org/home.html\">www.Example.org Homepage</a></source>\n[[File:WorldWideWebAroundWikipedia.png|thumb|Graphic representation of a minute fraction of the WWW, demonstrating [[hyperlink]]s]]\nSuch a collection of useful, related resources, interconnected via hypertext links is dubbed a ''web'' of information. Publication on the Internet created what Tim Berners-Lee first called the ''WorldWideWeb'' (in its original [[CamelCase]], which was subsequently discarded) in November 1990.<ref name=\"W90\" />\n\nThe hyperlink structure of the WWW is described by the [[webgraph]]: the nodes of the web graph correspond to the web pages (or URLs) the directed edges between them to the hyperlinks. Over time, many web resources pointed to by hyperlinks disappear, relocate, or are replaced with different content. This makes hyperlinks obsolete, a phenomenon referred to in some circles as link rot, and the hyperlinks affected by it are often called [[dead link]]s. The ephemeral nature of the Web has prompted many efforts to archive web sites. The [[Internet Archive]], active since 1996, is the best known of such efforts.\n\n=== WWW prefix ===\n<!-- WWW prefix redirects here -->\nMany hostnames used for the World Wide Web begin with ''www'' because of the long-standing practice of naming [[Internet]] hosts according to the services they provide. The [[hostname]] of a [[web server]] is often ''www'', in the same way that it may be ''ftp'' for an [[FTP server]], and ''news'' or ''nntp'' for a [[Usenet]] [[news server]]. These host names appear as Domain Name System (DNS) or [[subdomain]] names, as in ''www.example.com''. The use of ''www'' is not required by any technical or policy standard and many web sites do not use it; the first web server was ''nxoc01.cern.ch''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|title=Frequently asked questions by the Press|first=Tim|last=Berners-Lee|publisher=W3C|accessdate=27 July 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090802051415/http://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/FAQ.html|archivedate=2 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> According to Paolo Palazzi,<ref>Palazzi, P (2011) [http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays 'The Early Days of the WWW at CERN'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723105704/http://soft-shake.ch/2011/en/conference/sessions.html?key=earlydays |date=23 July 2012 }}</ref> who worked at CERN along with Tim Berners-Lee, the popular use of ''www'' as subdomain was accidental; the World Wide Web project page was intended to be published at www.cern.ch while info.cern.ch was intended to be the CERN home page, however the DNS records were never switched, and the practice of prepending ''www'' to an institution's website domain name was subsequently copied. Many established websites still use the prefix, or they employ other subdomain names such as ''www2'', ''secure'' or ''en'' for special purposes. Many such web servers are set up so that both the main domain name (e.g., example.com) and the ''www'' subdomain (e.g., www.example.com) refer to the same site; others require one form or the other, or they may map to different web sites. The use of a subdomain name is useful for [[load balancing (computing)|load balancing]] incoming web traffic by creating a [[CNAME record]] that points to a cluster of web servers. Since, currently, only a subdomain can be used in a CNAME, the same result cannot be achieved by using the bare domain root.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://medium.freecodecamp.org/why-cant-a-domain-s-root-be-a-cname-8cbab38e5f5c |title=Why a domain's root can't be a CNAME \u2013 and other tidbits about the DNS |author=Dominic Fraser |date=May 13, 2018 |work=FreeCodeCamp}}</ref>{{Dubious |reason=While CNAMEs are more flexible than the bare domain requiring an A Record, load balancing is certainly possible even for sites that skip www and use the bare domain \u2014 see, for example, Twitter.|date=July 2019}}\n\nWhen a user submits an incomplete domain name to a web browser in its address bar input field, some web browsers automatically try adding the prefix \"www\" to the beginning of it and possibly \".com\", \".org\" and \".net\" at the end, depending on what might be missing. For example, entering '{{not a typo|microsoft}}' may be transformed to ''<nowiki>http://www.microsoft.com/</nowiki>'' and 'openoffice' to ''<nowiki>http://www.openoffice.org</nowiki>''.

They specify the communication protocol to use for the request and response. The HTTP protocol is fundamental to the operation of the World Wide Web, and the added encryption layer in HTTPS is essential when browsers send or retrieve confidential data, such as passwords or banking information. Web browsers usually automatically prepend <nowiki>http://</nowiki> to user-entered URIs, if omitted.\n\n===Pages===\n{{main|Web page}}\n[[File:Commons.png|thumb|A screenshot of a web page on Wikimedia Commons]]\nA ''web page'' (also written as ''webpage'') is a document that is suitable for the World Wide Web and [[web browser]]s. A web browser displays a web page on a [[computer display|monitor]] or [[mobile device]].\n\nThe term ''web page'' usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the [[computer file]] itself, which is usually a [[text file]] containing [[hypertext]] written in [[HTML]] or a comparable [[markup language]]. Typical web pages provide [[hypertext]] for browsing to other web pages via [[hyperlink]]s, often referred to as ''links''. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple [[web resource]] elements, such as reading [[Cascading Style Sheets|style sheets]], [[client-side scripting|scripts]], and images, while presenting each web page.\n\nOn a network, a web browser can retrieve a web page from a remote [[web server]]. The web server may restrict access to a private network such as a corporate intranet. The web browser uses the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) to make such requests to the [[web server]].\n\nA [[static web page|''static'' web page]] is delivered exactly as stored, as [[web content]] in the web server's [[file system]]. In contrast, a [[dynamic web page|''dynamic'' web page]] is generated by a [[web application]], usually driven by [[server-side scripting|server-side software]]. Dynamic web pages are used when each user may require completely different information, for example, bank websites, web email etc.\n\n==== Static page ====\n{{main|Static web page}}\nA ''static web page'' (sometimes called a ''flat page/stationary page'') is a [[web page]] that is delivered to the user exactly as stored, in contrast to [[dynamic web page]]s which are generated by a [[web application]].\n\nConsequently, a static web page displays the same information for all users, from all contexts, subject to modern capabilities of a [[web server]] to [[content negotiation|negotiate]] [[MIME type|content-type]] or language of the document where such versions are available and the server is configured to do so.\n\n==== Dynamic pages ====\n{{Main|Dynamic web page|Ajax (programming)}}\n[[File:Scheme dynamic page en.svg|thumb|right|500px|Dynamic web page: example of server-side scripting ([[PHP]] and [[MySQL]]).]]\nA ''server-side dynamic web page'' is a [[web page]] whose construction is controlled by an [[application server]] processing server-side scripts. In server-side scripting, [[Parameter (computer programming)|parameters]] determine how the assembly of every new web page proceeds, including the setting up of more client-side processing.\n\nA ''client-side dynamic web page'' processes the web page using [[HTML scripting]] running in the browser as it loads.  JavaScript and other scripting languages determine the way the HTML in the received page is parsed into the [[Document Object Model]], or DOM, that represents the loaded web page.  The same client-side techniques can then dynamically update or change the DOM in the same way.\n\nA dynamic web page is then reloaded by the user or by a [[computer program]] to change some variable content.  The updating information could come from the server, or from changes made to that page's DOM. This may or may not truncate the browsing history or create a saved version to go back to, but a ''dynamic web page update'' using [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] technologies will neither create a page to go back to, nor truncate the [[web browsing history]] forward of the displayed page.  Using Ajax technologies the end [[User (computing)|user]] gets ''one dynamic page'' managed as a single page in the [[web browser]] while the actual [[web content]] rendered on that page can vary.  The Ajax engine sits only on the browser requesting parts of its DOM, ''the'' DOM, for its client, from an application server.\n\n[[DHTML]] is the umbrella term for technologies and methods used to create web pages that are not [[static web page]]s, though it has fallen out of common use since the popularization of [[Ajax (programming)|AJAX]], a term which is now itself rarely used. Client-side-scripting, server-side scripting, or a combination of these make for the dynamic web experience in a browser.\n\n[[JavaScript]] is a [[scripting programming language|scripting language]] that was initially developed in 1995 by [[Brendan Eich]], then of [[Netscape]], for use within web pages.<ref name=Hamilton>{{cite web|author=Hamilton, Naomi|title=The A-Z of Programming Languages: JavaScript|url=http://computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|date=31 July 2008|work=Computerworld|publisher=IDG|accessdate=12 May 2009|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090524025720/http://www.computerworld.com.au/article/255293/-z_programming_languages_javascript|archivedate=24 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The standardised version is [[ECMAScript]].<ref name=Hamilton /> To make web pages more interactive, some web applications also use JavaScript techniques such as [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]] ([[Asynchronous I/O|asynchronous]] JavaScript and [[XML]]). [[Client-side scripting|Client-side script]] is delivered with the page that can make additional HTTP requests to the server, either in response to user actions such as mouse movements or clicks, or based on elapsed time. The server's responses are used to modify the current page rather than creating a new page with each response, so the server needs only to provide limited, incremental information. Multiple Ajax requests can be handled at the same time, and users can interact with the page while data is retrieved. Web pages may also regularly [[polling (computer science)|poll]] the server to check whether new information is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|title=jQuery Polling plugin|date=23 September 2008|last=Buntin|first=Seth|accessdate=2009-08-22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090813184848/http://buntin.org/2008/sep/23/jquery-polling-plugin/|archivedate=13 August 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Website===\n[[File:United States Antarctic Program website from 2018 02 22.png|thumb|right|240px|The [[United States Antarctic Program|usap.gov]] website]]\n{{main|website}}\nA ''website''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Website|title=website|last=|first=|date=|website=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|publisher=|access-date=2011-07-02}}</ref> is a collection of related web resources including [[web page]]s, [[multimedia]] content, typically identified with a common [[domain name]], and published on at least one [[web server]]. Notable examples are [[wikipedia]].org, [[google]].com, and [[Amazon (company)|amazon.com]].\n\nA website may be accessible via a public [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) network, such as the [[Internet]], or a private [[local area network]] (LAN), by referencing a [[URL|uniform resource locator]] (URL) that identifies the site.\n\nWebsites can have many functions and can be used in various fashions; a website can be a [[personal website]], a corporate website for a company, a government website, an organization website, etc. Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, ranging from entertainment and [[social networking]] to providing news and education. All publicly accessible websites collectively constitute the World Wide Web, while private websites, such as a company's website for its employees, are typically a part of an [[intranet]].\n\nWeb pages, which are the building blocks of websites, are [[document]]s, typically composed in [[plain text]] interspersed with formatting instructions of Hypertext Markup Language ([[HTML]], [[XHTML]]). They may incorporate elements from other websites with suitable [[HTML anchor|markup anchors]]. Web pages are accessed and transported with the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP), which may optionally employ encryption ([[HTTP Secure]], HTTPS) to provide security and privacy for the user. The user's application, often a [[web browser]], renders the page content according to its HTML markup instructions onto a [[Computer monitor|display terminal]].\n\n[[Hyperlink]]ing between web pages conveys to the reader the [[site map|site structure]] and guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a [[home page]] containing a directory of the site [[web content]]. Some websites require user registration or [[subscription]] to access content. Examples of [[paywall|subscription websites]] include many business sites, news websites, [[academic journal]] websites, gaming websites, file-sharing websites, [[Internet forum|message boards]], web-based [[email]], [[social networking]] websites, websites providing real-time [[stock market]] data, as well as sites providing various other services. [[End user]]s can access websites on a range of devices, including [[desktop computer|desktop]] and [[laptop|laptop computers]], [[tablet computer]]s, [[smartphone]]s and [[smart TV]]s.\n\n===Browser===\n{{main|Web browser}}\nA ''web browser'' (commonly referred to as a ''browser'') is a [[software application|software]] [[user agent]] for accessing information on the World Wide Web. To connect to a website's [[web server|server]] and display its pages, a user needs to have a web browser program. This is the program that the user runs to download, format and display a web page on the user's computer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.differencebetween.net/technology/internet/difference-between-search-engine-and-browser/ |title=Difference Between Search Engine and Browser}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to allowing users to find, displaying and moving between web pages, a web browser will usually have features like keeping bookmarks, recording history, managing cookies (see below) and home pages and may have facilities for recording passwords for logging into web sites.\n\nThe most popular browsers are [[Google Chrome|Chrome]], [[Firefox]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]], [[Internet Explorer]],<!--note IE still widely used per Market Share below so keep it here--> and [[Microsoft Edge|Edge]].\n\n===Server===\n{{main|Web server}}\n\n[[File:Inside and Rear of Webserver.jpg|thumb|right|The inside and front of a [[Dell PowerEdge]] web server, a computer designed for [[rack mount]]ing]]\nA ''Web server'' is [[server software]], or hardware dedicated to running said software, that can satisfy World Wide Web client requests. A web server can, in general, contain one or more websites. A web server processes incoming network requests over [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|HTTP]] and several other related protocols.\n\nThe primary function of a web server is to store, process and deliver [[web page]]s to [[Client (computing)|clients]].<ref>{{Cite book|title=Web performance tuning|last=Patrick|first=Killelea|date=2002|publisher=O'Reilly|isbn=978-0596001728|edition= 2nd|location=Beijing|pages=264|oclc=49502686}}</ref> The communication between client and server takes place using the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol|Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)]]. Pages delivered are most frequently [[HTML|HTML documents]], which may include [[image]]s, [[Style sheet (web development)|style sheets]] and [[JavaScript|scripts]] in addition to the text content.\n[[File:Wikimedia Foundation Servers-8055 35.jpg|thumb|275x275px|Multiple web servers may be used for a high traffic website; here, [[Dell]] servers are installed together being used for the [[Wikimedia Foundation]].]]\n\nA [[user agent]], commonly a [[web browser]] or [[web crawler]], initiates communication by making a [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#Request message|request]] for a specific resource using HTTP and the server responds with the content of that resource or an [[List of HTTP status codes#4xx Client Error|error message]] if unable to do so. The resource is typically a real file on the server's [[secondary memory|secondary storage]], but this is not necessarily the case and depends on how the web server is [[Implementation|implemented]].\n\nWhile the primary function is to serve content, a full implementation of HTTP also includes ways of receiving content from clients. This feature is used for submitting [[Form (web)|web forms]], including [[upload]]ing of files.\n\nMany generic web servers also support [[server-side scripting]] using [[Active Server Pages]] (ASP), [[PHP]] (Hypertext Preprocessor), or other [[scripting language]]s. This means that the behaviour of the web server can be scripted in separate files, while the actual server software remains unchanged. Usually, this function is used to generate HTML documents [[Dynamic web page|dynamically]] (\"on-the-fly\") as opposed to returning [[Static web page|static documents]]. The former is primarily used for retrieving or modifying information from [[database]]s. The latter is typically much faster and more easily [[web cache|cached]] but cannot deliver [[dynamic content]].\n\nWeb servers can also frequently be found [[embedded system|embedded]] in devices such as [[printer (computing)|printers]], [[Router (computing)|routers]], [[webcam]]s and serving only a [[Local area network|local network]]. The web server may then be used as a part of a system for monitoring or administering the device in question. This usually means that no additional software has to be installed on the client computer since only a web browser is required (which now is included with most [[operating system]]s).\n\n===Cookie===\n{{main|HTTP cookie}}\nAn ''HTTP cookie'' (also called ''web cookie'', ''Internet cookie'', ''browser cookie'', or simply ''cookie'') is a small piece of data sent from a website and stored on the user's computer by the user's [[web browser]] while the user is browsing. Cookies were designed to be a reliable mechanism for websites to remember [[program state|stateful]] information (such as items added in the shopping cart in an online store) or to record the user's browsing activity (including clicking particular buttons, [[access control|logging in]], or recording which pages were visited in the past). They can also be used to remember arbitrary pieces of information that the user previously entered into form fields such as names, addresses, passwords, and credit card numbers.\n\nCookies perform essential functions in the modern web. Perhaps most importantly, ''authentication cookies'' are the most common method used by web servers to know whether the user is logged in or not, and which account they are logged in with. Without such a mechanism, the site would not know whether to send a page containing sensitive information, or require the user to authenticate themselves by logging in. The security of an authentication cookie generally depends on the security of the issuing website and the user's [[comparison of web browsers#Vulnerabilities|web browser]], and on whether the cookie data is encrypted. Security vulnerabilities may allow a cookie's data to be read by a [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]], used to gain access to user data, or used to gain access (with the user's credentials) to the website to which the cookie belongs (see [[cross-site scripting]] and [[cross-site request forgery]] for examples).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-10789_3-9918582-57.html |first=Robert |last=Vamosi |title=Gmail cookie stolen via Google Spreadsheets|website=News.cnet.com |date=2008-04-14|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref>\n\nTracking cookies, and especially [[#Third-party cookie|third-party tracking cookies]], are commonly used as ways to compile long-term records of individuals' browsing histories {{En dash}} a potential [[Internet privacy#HTTP cookies|privacy concern]] that prompted European<ref>{{cite web |title=What about the \"EU Cookie Directive\"? |url=http://webcookies.org/faq/#Directive |year=2013 |publisher=WebCookies.org|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> and U.S. lawmakers to take action in 2011.<ref name=\"eulaw\">{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12668552 |work=BBC |title=New net rules set to make cookies crumble |date=2011-03-08 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://adage.com/article/digital/sen-rockefeller-ready-a-real-track-bill/227426/ |work=Adage.com |title=Sen.

The search results are generally presented in a line of results, often referred to as [[search engine results page]]s (SERPs). The information may be a mix of [[web page]]s, images, videos, infographics, articles, research papers and other types of files. Some search engines also [[data mining|mine data]] available in [[database]]s or [[web directory|open directories]].  Unlike [[web directories]], which are maintained only by human editors, search engines also maintain [[real-time computing|real-time]] information by running an [[algorithm]] on a [[web crawler]].\nInternet content that is not capable of being searched by a web search engine is generally described as the [[deep web]].\n\n===Deep web===\n{{main|Deep web}}\nThe deep web,<ref name=\"nhamilton\">{{cite journal|citeseerx=10.1.1.90.5847|title=The Mechanics of a Deep Net Metasearch Engine|last=Hamilton|first=Nigel}}</ref> ''invisible web'',<ref name=\"jal\">{{cite journal|title=Beyond google: the invisible web in the academic library |volume=30|issue=4|date=July 2004|pages=265\u2013269|last1=Devine|first1=Jane|last2=Egger-Sider|first2=Francine|journal=The Journal of Academic Librarianship |doi=10.1016/j.acalib.2004.04.010 }}</ref> or ''hidden web''<ref name=\"cthw\">{{cite journal|title=Crawling the Hidden Web|journal=27th International Conference on Very Large Data Bases|date=September 11\u201314, 2001|first1=Sriram|last1=Raghavan|first2=Hector|last2=Garcia-Molina|url=http://ilpubs.stanford.edu:8090/725/}}</ref> are parts of the World Wide Web whose contents are not [[Search engine indexing|indexed]] by standard [[web search engine]]s.

Most web browsers also implement a [[browser cache]] by writing recently obtained data to a local data storage device. HTTP requests by a browser may ask only for data that has changed since the last access. Web pages and resources may contain expiration information to control caching to secure sensitive data, such as in [[online banking]], or to facilitate frequently updated sites, such as news media. Even sites with highly dynamic content may permit basic resources to be refreshed only occasionally. Web site designers find it worthwhile to collate resources such as CSS data and JavaScript into a few site-wide files so that they can be cached efficiently. Enterprise [[Firewall (networking)|firewalls]] often cache Web resources requested by one user for the benefit of many users. Some [[search engines]] store cached content of frequently accessed websites.\n\n== Security ==\nFor [[criminal]]s, the Web has become a venue to spread [[malware]] and engage in a range of

Also, unless set not to do so, most web browsers record requested web pages in a viewable ''history'' feature, and usually [[Web cache|cache]] much of the content locally. Unless the server-browser communication uses HTTPS encryption, web requests and responses travel in plain text across the Internet and can be viewed, recorded, and cached by intermediate systems. Another way to hide [[personally identifiable information]] is by using a [[VPN]]. A VPN [[encryption|encrypts]] online traffic and masks original IP address lowering the chance of user identification. When a web page asks for, and the user supplies, personally identifiable information\u2014such as their real name, address, e-mail address, etc.\u2014web-based entities can associate current web traffic with that individual. If the website uses [[HTTP cookie]]s, username and password authentication, or other tracking techniques, it can relate other web visits, before and after, to the identifiable information provided. In this way it is possible for a web-based organisation to develop and build a profile of the individual people who use its site or sites. It may be able to build a record for an individual that includes information about their leisure activities, their shopping interests, their profession, and other aspects of their [[demographic profile]]. These profiles are obviously of potential interest to marketeers, advertisers and others. Depending on the website's [[terms and conditions]] and the local laws that apply information from these profiles may be sold, shared, or passed to other organisations without the user being informed. For many ordinary people, this means little more than some unexpected e-mails in their in-box or some uncannily relevant advertising on a future web page. For others, it can mean that time spent indulging an unusual interest can result in a deluge of further targeted marketing that may be unwelcome. Law enforcement, counter terrorism, and espionage agencies can also identify, target and track individuals based on their interests or proclivities on the Web.\n\n[[Social networking]] sites try to get users to use their real names, interests, and locations, rather than pseudonyms, as their executives believe that this makes the social networking experience more engaging for users. On the other hand, uploaded photographs or unguarded statements can be identified to an individual, who may regret this exposure. Employers, schools, parents, and other relatives may be influenced by aspects of social networking profiles, such as text posts or digital photos, that the posting individual did not intend for these audiences. [[Cyberbullying|On-line bullies]] may make use of personal information to harass or [[cyberstalking|stalk]] users. Modern social networking websites allow fine grained control of the privacy settings for each individual posting, but these can be complex and not easy to find or use, especially for beginners.<ref>{{cite journal|last=boyd|first=danah|author2=Hargittai, Eszter|title=Facebook privacy settings: Who cares?|journal=First Monday|date=July 2010|volume=15|issue=8|doi=10.5210/fm.v15i8.3086|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Photographs and videos posted onto websites have caused particular problems, as they can add a person's face to an on-line profile. With modern and potential [[Facial recognition system|facial recognition technology]], it may then be possible to relate that face with other, previously anonymous, images, events and scenarios that have been imaged elsewhere. Due to image caching, mirroring and copying, it is difficult to remove an image from the World Wide Web.\n\n== Standards ==\n{{Main|Web standards}}\nWeb standards include many interdependent standards and specifications, some of which govern aspects of the [[Internet]], not just the World Wide Web. Even when not web-focused, such standards directly or indirectly affect the development and administration of web sites and [[web service]]s. Considerations include the [[interoperability]], [[accessibility]] and [[usability]] of web pages and web sites.\n\nWeb standards, in the broader sense, consist of the following:\n* ''Recommendations'' published by the [[World Wide Web Consortium]] (W3C)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.w3.org/TR/#Recommendations |title=W3C Technical Reports and Publications | publisher=W3C | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* \"Living Standard\" made by the [[Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group]] (WHATWG)\n* ''[[Request for Comments]]'' (RFC) documents published by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | title=IETF RFC page | publisher=IETF | accessdate=2009-01-19 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202124230/http://www.ietf.org/rfc.html | archive-date=2 February 2009 | url-status=dead }}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iso.org/iso/search.htm?qt=world+wide+web&published=on&active_tab=standards |title=Search for World Wide Web in ISO standards | publisher=ISO | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''Standards'' published by [[Ecma International]] (formerly ECMA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/index.html | title=Ecma formal publications  | publisher=Ecma | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* ''The [[Unicode]] Standard'' and various ''Unicode Technical Reports'' (UTRs) published by the [[Unicode Consortium]]<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.unicode.org/reports/index.html | title=Unicode Technical Reports | publisher=Unicode Consortium | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n* Name and number registries maintained by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA)<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iana.org/ | title=IANA home page | publisher=IANA | accessdate=2009-01-19}}</ref>\n\nWeb standards are not fixed sets of rules, but are a constantly evolving set of finalized technical specifications of web technologies.<ref>{{cite book | author=Leslie Sikos | title= Web standards \u2013 Mastering HTML5, CSS3, and XML | publisher= [[Apress]] | year= 2011 | isbn= 978-1-4302-4041-9 | url= http://www.masteringhtml5css3.com/}}</ref> Web standards are developed by [[standards organization]]s\u2014groups of interested and often competing parties chartered with the task of standardization\u2014not technologies developed and declared to be a standard by a single individual or company. It is crucial to distinguish those specifications that are under development from the ones that already reached the final development status (in case of [[W3C]] specifications, the highest maturity level).\n\n== Accessibility ==\n{{Main|Web accessibility}}\nThere are methods for accessing the Web in alternative mediums and formats to facilitate use by individuals with [[disability|disabilities]]. These disabilities may be visual, auditory, physical, speech-related, cognitive, neurological, or some combination. Accessibility features also help people with temporary disabilities, like a broken arm, or ageing users as their abilities change.<ref name=WAI>{{cite web|title=Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)|url=http://www.w3.org/WAI|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium|accessdate=7 April 2009|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402001730/http://www.w3.org/WAI/|archivedate=2 April 2009}}</ref> The Web receives information as well as providing information and interacting with society.

Until the late 18th century, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes hunted and fished in the general Fox Chapel area.  [[Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]] both claimed the territory. The dispute was not resolved until after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070426122213/http://www.ohara.pa.us/history.htm]  Today, less than 1% of its population is [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].\n\n===George Washington===\nIt is probable that in December 1753, [[George Washington]], accompanied by [[Christopher Gist]], pushed his way across Fox Chapel land as he came south from [[Fort Le Boeuf]] where he had delivered a letter to the French commander, ordering him, in the name of the Governor of Virginia, to return to [[Canada]].[http://www.foxchapeldistrictassociation.org/history.htm]\n\n===French and Indian Wars===\nFor the next 10 years, all the land at the forks of the [[Ohio River]] was the subject of contention between French and British.  Indian allies of both empires fought settlers for control of the region. French soldiers built [[Fort Duquesne]] on the site of a former British outpost at the forks of the Ohio in 1754, and four years later British troops replaced it with a fort of their own, [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]].  The bloody battles of [[Braddock's defeat]], Bushy Run, and Colonel Bouquet's relief of the Indian siege of Pittsburgh provided many British and Virginia scalps, which were triumphantly brought home to adorn [[wigwam]]s situated in what is now Fox Chapel.  The [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], too, produced further military activity.\n\n===Guyasuta===\nThrough this warlike panorama moved the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] [[Tribal chief|chief]], [[Guyasuta]], closely associated with the district, involved in every clash, sometimes aiding the British and sometimes the French.  He first appeared as George Washington's guide during his journey from [[Logstown]] to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753.  Guyasuta led the Indians against [[James Grant (British Army officer)|General Grant]] in 1758.  He was probably the leader of the Seneca band that destroyed [[Fort Venango]] in 1763, butchering the entire garrison.  He was in a band of warriors that burned the frontier village of [[Hannastown, Pennsylvania|Hannastown]], north of [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]]. He was also at the [[Battle of Bushy Run]], where the Indians were defeated by Colonel Bouquet.\n\nDespite Chief Guyasuta's violent history, General O'Hara furnished a [[log cabin|cabin]] for him on O'Hara's estate north of the [[Allegheny River]] (now Fox Chapel), and provided necessities during the declining years of his life.  He died about 1800.\n\n===Settlement===\nThe first white settler in the area was James Powers, who arrived around 1790.[http://www.post-gazette.com/downloads/profile-foxchapel.htm]  The first schoolhouse was on Squaw Run, where it stood in 1806.  It was a [[log house]].  A church was organized in 1818 on Kittanning Road, on a branch of Pine Creek.\n\nAmong the early landowners was James O'Hara, a [[Revolutionary Army]] [[general]] and prominent Pittsburgh businessman.  During the depression of 1818, he was saved from financial ruin by the counsel of James Ross, a noted lawyer and former senator. In exchange for his help, O'Hara gave Ross {{convert|1700|acre|km2|0}} of land, which is now part of Fox Chapel, and comprises the Delafield Estates section of the borough, as well as the development along Buckingham Road known as the \"Ross Meadows Plan of Lots\".\n\nIn general, there was little growth or development throughout the 19th century, and it remained for the 20th, with the advent of the automobile, for Pittsburghers to become aware of the advantages of the Fox Chapel District as a suburb.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130920032852/http://www.foxchapeldistrictassociation.org/history.aspx]  The [[Pittsburgh Field Club]] opened in 1882, and the Fox Chapel Golf Club opened in 1919. [[Shady Side Academy]] opened its senior school on property that was formerly two large farms, a gift from prominent Pittsburgh industrialist Wallace H. Rowe, in 1922. A nearby private estate, built in 1928 by steel industrialist James E. Lewis, became the Academy's standalone middle school campus in 1958.\n\nFox Chapel was originally part of [[O'Hara Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|O'Hara]] and [[Indiana Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Indiana]] townships.  In 1928, approximately 40 landowners assembled at Shady Side Academy and voted to incorporate the Fox Chapel District Association.  The matters of immediate concern that they addressed were fire and police protection.  As time went on, the District Association named roads and handled development and zoning.  However, by 1933 the District Association had grown concerned that its interests were at variance with those of both townships, and a petition was filed to allow the formation of a new borough.  Despite vigorous opposition by both townships, on August 3, 1934, a court ordered the incorporation of Fox Chapel Borough from {{convert|6.8|sqmi|km2|1}} of O'Hara Township and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2|1}} of Indiana Township.  Over the years, other residents adjacent to the borough petitioned the council for annexation, increasing the area of the borough to approximately {{convert|8.5|sqmi|km2|1}}.\n\nIts wooded hills and uncrowded residential developments are a regional asset.  It strives to preserve openness and spaciousness in the midst of urbanization and industrialization. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060927070341/http://www.fox-chapel.pa.us/home_history.htm]\n\n===Name===\nThe name \"Fox Chapel\" comes from John Fox, who emigrated from [[Germany]] in 1831 and farmed the land around the present Faith [[United Methodist Church]] until his death in 1889.  Shortly after his death in 1889 his daughter, Eliza Fox Teats, donated some land to the Methodist Protestant Church for a [[chapel]] to be named in honor of her father.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060927070341/http://www.fox-chapel.pa.us/home_history.htm]\n\n==Schools==\n[[File:Rowe Hall Shady Side Academy Senior School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shady Side Academy]] upper school campus]]\nPublic education is provided by the [[Fox Chapel Area School District]].  The high school is located in O'Hara Township.  The middle school is located in [[Dorseyville, Pennsylvania|Dorseyville]], a small community five miles to the north of the borough in Indiana Township.  Elementary school children attend schools located in either Indiana Township or O'Hara Township. These are O'Hara Elementary, Kerr, Fairview, and Hartwood.

Shady Side Academy has operated in Fox Chapel since the early 1920s, when it relocated its upper school from nearby urban [[Shadyside (Pittsburgh)|Shadyside]] within the Pittsburgh. The middle school campus was a later addition, the result of the Academy's 1958 purchase of the former James E.

The resources and staff of the Lauri Ann West Memorial Library were retained and moved to Cooper-Siegel, which now houses the Lauri Ann West Children's Room. Other spaces available include the Scott Family Reading Room, a children's story time room and art room, the McIlroy Family Teen Room, three private study rooms, a large program  room, a conference room and the Fritz Mitnick Welcome Garden.\n\n==Arts==\nThe [[Hillman Center for Performing Arts]] on the campus of Shady Side Academy presents three to seven public performances each year featuring both local and touring artists in the Richard E. Rauh Theater.  These performances feature world music and culture as well as Pittsburgh artists.\n\nThe [[Lauri Ann West Community Center]], completed in 2016, provides cultural, educational, and recreational classes in addition to camps and workshops for local residents.\n\n[http://www.stagerightboyd.org Stage Right Community Theatre], is an all-volunteer organization which prides itself in having fun, while presenting quality theatre for the community. They began producing shows in the mid-1960s in the garage of a home in the Falconhurst housing plan, but eventually, the small group of enthusiastic actors moved into larger venues, including the O'Hara Elementary School, and finally the Boyd Community Center. They produce three shows each year, in the Fall, Winter and Spring.\n\n==Private clubs==\nThe Fox Chapel Golf Club and the [[Pittsburgh Field Club]] offer golf, tennis, swimming, and fine dining.  The Fox Chapel Racquet Club offers tennis, paddle tennis and swimming (pool rebuilt entirely in 2013) with a more casual club atmosphere. Fox Chapel residents are known as some of the most wealthy and educated in the state of Pennsylvania. The Chapel Gate Swimming & Tennis Club and the Community Swim Club are in O'Hara Township and near the border with Fox Chapel.\n\n==Religion==\nFour churches are located within the borough:  Faith [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] Church, Christ Church Fox Chapel, Fox Chapel [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church, and Good Shepherd [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Church.\n\nIn 1953 a group of families living in the Fox Chapel area began to worship together at Shady Side Academy; the congregation became Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church, located at the intersection of Fox Chapel Road and Field Club Road.  The Rev. Bickford Lang served as the first pastor. The congregation was officially organized in October 1953 with 339 charter members.  The chapel was erected in December 1953, and worship services began to be held on the site of the present church.  The church facility has grown to include a Christian Education building, atrium, fellowship hall and a Georgian sanctuary.  The Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church has been led by five senior pastors since its founding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxchapelpresby.com|title=Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church|website=foxchapelpresby.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307123140/http://www.foxchapelpresby.com/|archivedate=7 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nChabad Fox Chapel - The Jewish Center, opened in 2002 and serves the entire Fox Chapel Area with a Jewish community center, Jewish day camp, Hebrew school and full adult education program with no membership fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabadfoxchapel.com/templates/articlecco.html?AID=113696|title=Our Synogogue|author=|date=|website=www.chabadfoxchapel.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAdat Shalom, located on Guys Run Road in Indiana Township, serves approximately 240 Jewish families from the Fox Chapel area. [http://www.goadatshalom.org/]\n\n==Parks==\nThe borough owns over {{convert|300|acre|km2|1}} of parkland.  All but {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of this property (McCahill Park) is used as open space for passive recreation, e.g., walking trails or [[bird watching]].\n\nThe borough has {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of parkland on Squaw Run Road known as McCahill Park set aside for active recreational use.  It includes two youth league baseball fields, a basketball court, and a large open field used for rugby, [[Touch football (American)|touch football]], and soccer games, as well as a small, wooded area playground.   During the winter months an outdoor skating rink is installed and is open for community use as weather permits.\n\nThe remaining parkland is nature-oriented.  Those include Trillium Trail Park, which is a nature reserve that runs several miles along hills and valley of Squaw Run / Squaw Run Road, and can be accessed via several small parking lots in the valley.  Squaw run passes McCahill Park and eventually flows into Salamander Park, a sizable but comparatively smaller nature space with trail-head access on Fox Chapel Road.  Squaw Run and Salamander Park continue across and down Fox Chapel Road, with Salamander Park eventually blending into O'Hara Township's Squaw Valley Park.\n\nRegarding park-like nature spaces, the Fox Chapel Area Land Trust owns many acres of natural space outright, as well as many conservation easements around existing home structures, which lends to the undeveloped appearance of much of Fox Chapel.\n\n==Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve==\nHeadquarters of the [[Audubon Society]] of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP) since 1976, Beechwood Farms is one of the largest [[nature reserve]]s in [[western Pennsylvania]].

Until the late 18th century, [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indian]] tribes hunted and fished in the general Fox Chapel area.  [[Virginia]] and [[Pennsylvania]] both claimed the territory. The dispute was not resolved until after the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]].[https://web.archive.org/web/20070426122213/http://www.ohara.pa.us/history.htm]  Today, less than 1% of its population is [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]].\n\n===George Washington===\nIt is probable that in December 1753, [[George Washington]], accompanied by [[Christopher Gist]], pushed his way across Fox Chapel land as he came south from [[Fort Le Boeuf]] where he had delivered a letter to the French commander, ordering him, in the name of the Governor of Virginia, to return to [[Canada]].[http://www.foxchapeldistrictassociation.org/history.htm]\n\n===French and Indian Wars===\nFor the next 10 years, all the land at the forks of the [[Ohio River]] was the subject of contention between French and British.  Indian allies of both empires fought settlers for control of the region. French soldiers built [[Fort Duquesne]] on the site of a former British outpost at the forks of the Ohio in 1754, and four years later British troops replaced it with a fort of their own, [[Fort Pitt (Pennsylvania)|Fort Pitt]].  The bloody battles of [[Braddock's defeat]], Bushy Run, and Colonel Bouquet's relief of the Indian siege of Pittsburgh provided many British and Virginia scalps, which were triumphantly brought home to adorn [[wigwam]]s situated in what is now Fox Chapel.  The [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], too, produced further military activity.\n\n===Guyasuta===\nThrough this warlike panorama moved the [[Seneca nation|Seneca]] [[Tribal chief|chief]], [[Guyasuta]], closely associated with the district, involved in every clash, sometimes aiding the British and sometimes the French.  He first appeared as George Washington's guide during his journey from [[Logstown]] to Fort Le Boeuf in 1753.  Guyasuta led the Indians against [[James Grant (British Army officer)|General Grant]] in 1758.  He was probably the leader of the Seneca band that destroyed [[Fort Venango]] in 1763, butchering the entire garrison.  He was in a band of warriors that burned the frontier village of [[Hannastown, Pennsylvania|Hannastown]], north of [[Greensburg, Pennsylvania|Greensburg]]. He was also at the [[Battle of Bushy Run]], where the Indians were defeated by Colonel Bouquet.\n\nDespite Chief Guyasuta's violent history, General O'Hara furnished a [[log cabin|cabin]] for him on O'Hara's estate north of the [[Allegheny River]] (now Fox Chapel), and provided necessities during the declining years of his life.  He died about 1800.\n\n===Settlement===\nThe first white settler in the area was James Powers, who arrived around 1790.[http://www.post-gazette.com/downloads/profile-foxchapel.htm]  The first schoolhouse was on Squaw Run, where it stood in 1806.  It was a [[log house]].  A church was organized in 1818 on Kittanning Road, on a branch of Pine Creek.\n\nAmong the early landowners was James O'Hara, a [[Revolutionary Army]] [[general]] and prominent Pittsburgh businessman.  During the depression of 1818, he was saved from financial ruin by the counsel of James Ross, a noted lawyer and former senator. In exchange for his help, O'Hara gave Ross {{convert|1700|acre|km2|0}} of land, which is now part of Fox Chapel, and comprises the Delafield Estates section of the borough, as well as the development along Buckingham Road known as the \"Ross Meadows Plan of Lots\".\n\nIn general, there was little growth or development throughout the 19th century, and it remained for the 20th, with the advent of the automobile, for Pittsburghers to become aware of the advantages of the Fox Chapel District as a suburb.[https://web.archive.org/web/20130920032852/http://www.foxchapeldistrictassociation.org/history.aspx]  The [[Pittsburgh Field Club]] opened in 1882, and the Fox Chapel Golf Club opened in 1919. [[Shady Side Academy]] opened its senior school on property that was formerly two large farms, a gift from prominent Pittsburgh industrialist Wallace H. Rowe, in 1922. A nearby private estate, built in 1928 by steel industrialist James E. Lewis, became the Academy's standalone middle school campus in 1958.\n\nFox Chapel was originally part of [[O'Hara Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|O'Hara]] and [[Indiana Township, Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Indiana]] townships.  In 1928, approximately 40 landowners assembled at Shady Side Academy and voted to incorporate the Fox Chapel District Association.  The matters of immediate concern that they addressed were fire and police protection.  As time went on, the District Association named roads and handled development and zoning.  However, by 1933 the District Association had grown concerned that its interests were at variance with those of both townships, and a petition was filed to allow the formation of a new borough.  Despite vigorous opposition by both townships, on August 3, 1934, a court ordered the incorporation of Fox Chapel Borough from {{convert|6.8|sqmi|km2|1}} of O'Hara Township and {{convert|0.4|sqmi|km2|1}} of Indiana Township.  Over the years, other residents adjacent to the borough petitioned the council for annexation, increasing the area of the borough to approximately {{convert|8.5|sqmi|km2|1}}.\n\nIts wooded hills and uncrowded residential developments are a regional asset.  It strives to preserve openness and spaciousness in the midst of urbanization and industrialization. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060927070341/http://www.fox-chapel.pa.us/home_history.htm]\n\n===Name===\nThe name \"Fox Chapel\" comes from John Fox, who emigrated from [[Germany]] in 1831 and farmed the land around the present Faith [[United Methodist Church]] until his death in 1889.  Shortly after his death in 1889 his daughter, Eliza Fox Teats, donated some land to the Methodist Protestant Church for a [[chapel]] to be named in honor of her father.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060927070341/http://www.fox-chapel.pa.us/home_history.htm]\n\n==Schools==\n[[File:Rowe Hall Shady Side Academy Senior School.jpg|thumb|right|[[Shady Side Academy]] upper school campus]]\nPublic education is provided by the [[Fox Chapel Area School District]].

The resources and staff of the Lauri Ann West Memorial Library were retained and moved to Cooper-Siegel, which now houses the Lauri Ann West Children's Room. Other spaces available include the Scott Family Reading Room, a children's story time room and art room, the McIlroy Family Teen Room, three private study rooms, a large program  room, a conference room and the Fritz Mitnick Welcome Garden.\n\n==Arts==\nThe [[Hillman Center for Performing Arts]] on the campus of Shady Side Academy presents three to seven public performances each year featuring both local and touring artists in the Richard E. Rauh Theater.  These performances feature world music and culture as well as Pittsburgh artists.\n\nThe [[Lauri Ann West Community Center]], completed in 2016, provides cultural, educational, and recreational classes in addition to camps and workshops for local residents.\n\n[http://www.stagerightboyd.org Stage Right Community Theatre], is an all-volunteer organization which prides itself in having fun, while presenting quality theatre for the community. They began producing shows in the mid-1960s in the garage of a home in the Falconhurst housing plan, but eventually, the small group of enthusiastic actors moved into larger venues, including the O'Hara Elementary School, and finally the Boyd Community Center. They produce three shows each year, in the Fall, Winter and Spring.\n\n==Private clubs==\nThe Fox Chapel Golf Club and the [[Pittsburgh Field Club]] offer golf, tennis, swimming, and fine dining.  The Fox Chapel Racquet Club offers tennis, paddle tennis and swimming (pool rebuilt entirely in 2013) with a more casual club atmosphere. Fox Chapel residents are known as some of the most wealthy and educated in the state of Pennsylvania. The Chapel Gate Swimming & Tennis Club and the Community Swim Club are in O'Hara Township and near the border with Fox Chapel.\n\n==Religion==\nFour churches are located within the borough:  Faith [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] Church, Christ Church Fox Chapel, Fox Chapel [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] Church, and Good Shepherd [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] Church.\n\nIn 1953 a group of families living in the Fox Chapel area began to worship together at Shady Side Academy; the congregation became Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church, located at the intersection of Fox Chapel Road and Field Club Road.  The Rev. Bickford Lang served as the first pastor. The congregation was officially organized in October 1953 with 339 charter members.  The chapel was erected in December 1953, and worship services began to be held on the site of the present church.  The church facility has grown to include a Christian Education building, atrium, fellowship hall and a Georgian sanctuary.  The Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church has been led by five senior pastors since its founding.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxchapelpresby.com|title=Fox Chapel Presbyterian Church|website=foxchapelpresby.com|accessdate=25 April 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080307123140/http://www.foxchapelpresby.com/|archivedate=7 March 2008}}</ref>\n\nChabad Fox Chapel - The Jewish Center, opened in 2002 and serves the entire Fox Chapel Area with a Jewish community center, Jewish day camp, Hebrew school and full adult education program with no membership fees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chabadfoxchapel.com/templates/articlecco.html?AID=113696|title=Our Synogogue|author=|date=|website=www.chabadfoxchapel.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAdat Shalom, located on Guys Run Road in Indiana Township, serves approximately 240 Jewish families from the Fox Chapel area.

All but {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of this property (McCahill Park) is used as open space for passive recreation, e.g., walking trails or [[bird watching]].\n\nThe borough has {{convert|5|acre|m2}} of parkland on Squaw Run Road known as McCahill Park set aside for active recreational use.  It includes two youth league baseball fields, a basketball court, and a large open field used for rugby, [[Touch football (American)|touch football]], and soccer games, as well as a small, wooded area playground.   During the winter months an outdoor skating rink is installed and is open for community use as weather permits.\n\nThe remaining parkland is nature-oriented.  Those include Trillium Trail Park, which is a nature reserve that runs several miles along hills and valley of Squaw Run / Squaw Run Road, and can be accessed via several small parking lots in the valley.  Squaw run passes McCahill Park and eventually flows into Salamander Park, a sizable but comparatively smaller nature space with trail-head access on Fox Chapel Road.  Squaw Run and Salamander Park continue across and down Fox Chapel Road, with Salamander Park eventually blending into O'Hara Township's Squaw Valley Park.\n\nRegarding park-like nature spaces, the Fox Chapel Area Land Trust owns many acres of natural space outright, as well as many conservation easements around existing home structures, which lends to the undeveloped appearance of much of Fox Chapel.\n\n==Beechwood Farms Nature Reserve==\nHeadquarters of the [[Audubon Society]] of Western Pennsylvania (ASWP) since 1976, Beechwood Farms is one of the largest [[nature reserve]]s in [[western Pennsylvania]].  Its {{convert|134|acre|km2|1}}, most of which have been leased to ASWP by the [[Western Pennsylvania Conservancy]], contain more than {{convert|5|mi|km|0}} of walking trails which are open from dawn to dusk every day year-round.

With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the [[American frontier]] followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by ''The New York Telegraph'' in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.<ref>''The New York Telegraph'': \"What Tramps Cost Nation\", page D2.

In addition to the problems of being itinerant, poor, and far from home and support, plus the hostility of many train crews, they faced the railroads' security staff, nicknamed \"bulls\", who had a reputation of violence against trespassers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Rails |last=Mathers, Michael H.|date=1973|publisher=Gambit|isbn=0-87645-078-8|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30 30]|oclc=757486|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30}}</ref> Moreover, riding on a freight train is dangerous in itself.

Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include (see also photo at right):\n* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.<ref name=\"university\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 198. Indiana University Press, 1996.</ref>\n* A horizontal zigzag signifying a barking dog.<ref name=\"Moon\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 24. Indiana University Press, 1996.</ref>\n* A circle with two parallel arrows meaning \"Get out fast,\" as hobos are not welcome in the area.<ref name=\"Moon\" />\n* A cat signifying that a kind lady lives here.<ref name=\"Moon\" />\n\nReports of hoboes using these symbols appeared in newspapers and popular books straight through the Depression, and continue to turn up in American popular culture; for example, [[John Hodgman]]'s book ''The Areas of My Expertise'' features a section on hobo signs listing signs found in newspapers of the day as well as several whimsical ones invented by Hodgman,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hodgman, John.|title=The areas of my expertise : an almanac of complete world knowledge compiled with instructive annotation and arranged in useful order ...|date=2006|publisher=Riverhead|isbn=978-1-59448-222-9|edition=Riverhead trade pbk.|location=New York|oclc=70672414|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/areasofmyexperti00hodg}}</ref> and the [[Free Art and Technology Lab]] released a [[QR code|QR]] Hobo Code, with a QR stenciler, in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = QR Code Stencil Generator and QR Hobo Codes\n| work = F.A.T., Free Art and Technology Lab\n| accessdate = 2012-07-18\n| date = 2011-07-19\n| url = http://fffff.at/qr-stenciler-and-qr-hobo-codes/\n}}</ref> Displays on hobo signs have been exhibited in the [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] at [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], operated by the [[National Park Service]], and in the [[National Cryptologic Museum]] in [[Annapolis Junction, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Rothstein\">{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/arts/design/national-cryptologic-museum-is-the-nsas-public-face.html|title=Security Secrets, Dated but Real|date=August 1, 2014|work=New York Times|accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref><ref name=\"NCMLibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/museum/virtual_tour/museum_tour_text.shtml|title=National Cryptological Museum\u2014Virtual Tour|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> and Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' supplies a listing of hobo signs under the entry for \"hobo\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged|date=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster|others=Gove, Philip Babcock, 1902-1972., Merriam-Webster, Inc.|isbn=0-87779-201-1|location=Springfield, Mass.|oclc=27936328|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/webstersthirdne001gove}}</ref>\n\nDespite an apparently strong record of authentication, however, there is doubt as to whether hobo signs were ever actually in practical use by hoboes. The alternative hypothesis is that the signs were invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the fantastical mythos that began to surround hoboes soon after they first appeared; this fabrication, then, was perpetuated and embellished by writers over the years, aided occasionally by hoboes willing to make up a colorful story or pose for a photo.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/hobo-signs-code-of-the-road|title=Hobo Signs: Code of the Road?|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a [[University of Chicago]] master's thesis,<ref name=\":1\" /> wrote in 1932,<blockquote>Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 ''American Tramp and Underworld Slang''] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Nels|date=March 1932|title=American Tramp and Underworld Slang. Godfrey Irwin (book review)|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=842|doi=10.1086/215902}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough newspapers in the early and peak days of hoboing (1870s through the [[Great Depression|Depression]]) printed photos and drawings of hoboes leaving these signs, no known photos exist showing hobo signs found ''in situ'' where they would have served a practical purpose, leaving open the possibility that all the photographs published were staged in order to add color to the story.\n\nNonetheless, it is certain that hoboes have used some graffiti to communicate, in the form of \"monikers\" (sometimes \"monicas\"). These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. [[Jack London]], in recounting his hobo days, wrote,<blockquote>Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.<ref>{{Cite book|last=London|first=Jack|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14658/14658-h/14658-h.htm|title=The Road|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|orig-year=1907}}</ref></blockquote>The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and \u201980s estimated that in one year (\"where I went overboard\") he marked over 30,000 train cars.<ref name=\":2\">Daniel, Bill. ''Who Is Bozo Texino?'' (documentary). Self-published: billdaniel.net, 2005.</ref> However, not all moniker writers (or \"boxcar artists\") are hoboes; Bozo Texino in fact worked for the railroad, though others such as \"A No. 1\" and \"Palm Tree Herby\" rode trains as tramps or hoboes.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/moniker-mark-of-the-tramp|title=Moniker: Mark of the Tramp|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\n===Ethical code ===\nHobo culture\u2014though it has always, of course, had many points of contact with the mainstream American culture of its day\u2014has also always been somewhat separate and distinct, with different cultural norms. Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hobos and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hobos themselves from attempting the exercise. An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 (a hobo union created in the mid-1800s to dodge anti-vagrancy laws, which did not apply to union members)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54624/strange-states-iowas-hobo-convention|title=Iowa's Hobo Convention|date=2014-01-21|website=www.mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> during its 1889 National Hobo Convention:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hobo.com/whatisahobo/hobocode.html | title=Hobo Code | publisher=National Hobo Museum | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195757/http://www.hobo.com/whatisahobo/hobocode.html | archivedate=July 24, 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=April 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n# Decide your own life; don't let another person run or rule you.\n# When in town, always respect the local law and officials, and try to be a gentleman at all times.\n# Don't take advantage of someone who is in a vulnerable situation, locals or other hobos.\n# Always try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek out jobs nobody wants.

The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts.  Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or \"railroad days\". Others are quasi-private affairs, hosted by long-time hobos.  Still others are ad hoc\u2014that is, they are held surreptitiously on private land. Some of these conventions are held in abandoned quarries along major rivers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMost non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical [[Train station|railroad stops]]. The most notable is the [[National Hobo Convention]] held in [[Britt, Iowa]].<!--Why most notable?-->{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years.

Initially just a \"Hobo Convention\" museum, in the late 1990s it evolved into a fuller Hobo History museum. LeAnn Castillo, a local artist and the hobo painter, exhibits her portrait collection of hobo kings and queens since 1900.  All of her paintings are made from photos.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nFormal entertainment at the annual Convention begins before dusk, and is provided by a mix of active hobos, extended hobo families and non-hobo wannabees. Late after dark, the crowd leaves and the campfire becomes more informal. Satellite groups spring up. Stories are told\u2014small and tall, poetry is recited, and cants are sung to the muted vibrations of [[banjo]]s, [[guitar]]s and [[harmonica]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nActivities officially begin the Thursday of the convention weekend with a lighting of the campfire and exercise of some hobo cultural traditions (Honoring the Four Winds) before the opening entertainment. On Friday morning many visit the hobo-corner of the cemetery to pay tribute to those who have \"Caught the Westbound\", with a hobo memorial service preceded by a local contingent of ex-military colorguard. Names of deceased hobos are recited (Roll Call). At around five o'clock on Friday afternoon a poetry reading attracts participants and a small crowd of onlookers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHobo-king candidates are screened the days before the annual King and Queen election and coronation. They are expected to have knowledge and experience in riding trains, and are evaluated for how well they would represent the hobo community. A quasi-qualified candidate is occasionally allowed to run.  Any woman who is part of the hobo community may run for hobo Queen.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} On the Saturday morning there is a parade in the town pavilion, allowing onlookers to see those running for hobo king and queen in a last chance to campaign before the election in the early afternoon. Following the parade, [[Mulligan stew (food)|Mulligan stew]] is served to hundreds of people in the city park, cooked by local [[Boy Scouts]]. In early afternoon, the hobo King and Queen are elected by means of the volume of crowd applause.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA carnival, flea market, and an annual auto show are also part of the festivities.

With the end of the [[American Civil War]] in the 1860s, many discharged veterans returning home began hopping freight trains. Others looking for work on the [[American frontier]] followed the railways west aboard freight trains in the late 19th century.\n\nIn 1906, Professor Layal Shafee, after an exhaustive study, put the number of tramps in the United States at about 500,000 (about 0.6% of the US population at the time). His article \"What Tramps Cost Nation\" was published by ''The New York Telegraph'' in 1911, when he estimated the number had surged to 700,000.<ref>''The New York Telegraph'': \"What Tramps Cost Nation\", page D2.

In addition to the problems of being itinerant, poor, and far from home and support, plus the hostility of many train crews, they faced the railroads' security staff, nicknamed \"bulls\", who had a reputation of violence against trespassers.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Riding the Rails |last=Mathers, Michael H.|date=1973|publisher=Gambit|isbn=0-87645-078-8|location=Boston|page=[https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30 30]|oclc=757486|url=https://archive.org/details/ridingrails00math/page/30}}</ref> Moreover, riding on a freight train is dangerous in itself. British poet [[W. H. Davies]], author of ''[[The Autobiography of a Super-Tramp]]'', lost a foot when he fell under the wheels when trying to jump aboard a train.

Many listings of these symbols have been made. A few symbols include (see also photo at right):\n* A triangle with hands, signifying that the homeowner has a gun.<ref name=\"university\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 198. Indiana University Press, 1996.</ref>\n* A horizontal zigzag signifying a barking dog.<ref name=\"Moon\">Moon, Gypsy: \"Done and Been\", page 24. Indiana University Press, 1996.</ref>\n* A circle with two parallel arrows meaning \"Get out fast,\" as hobos are not welcome in the area.<ref name=\"Moon\" />\n* A cat signifying that a kind lady lives here.<ref name=\"Moon\" />\n\nReports of hoboes using these symbols appeared in newspapers and popular books straight through the Depression, and continue to turn up in American popular culture; for example, [[John Hodgman]]'s book ''The Areas of My Expertise'' features a section on hobo signs listing signs found in newspapers of the day as well as several whimsical ones invented by Hodgman,<ref>{{Cite book|last=Hodgman, John.|title=The areas of my expertise : an almanac of complete world knowledge compiled with instructive annotation and arranged in useful order ...|date=2006|publisher=Riverhead|isbn=978-1-59448-222-9|edition=Riverhead trade pbk.|location=New York|oclc=70672414|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/areasofmyexperti00hodg}}</ref> and the [[Free Art and Technology Lab]] released a [[QR code|QR]] Hobo Code, with a QR stenciler, in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web\n| title = QR Code Stencil Generator and QR Hobo Codes\n| work = F.A.T., Free Art and Technology Lab\n| accessdate = 2012-07-18\n| date = 2011-07-19\n| url = http://fffff.at/qr-stenciler-and-qr-hobo-codes/\n}}</ref> Displays on hobo signs have been exhibited in the [[Steamtown National Historic Site]] at [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]], operated by the [[National Park Service]], and in the [[National Cryptologic Museum]] in [[Annapolis Junction, Maryland]],<ref name=\"Rothstein\">{{cite news|last1=Rothstein|first1=Edward|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/08/02/arts/design/national-cryptologic-museum-is-the-nsas-public-face.html|title=Security Secrets, Dated but Real|date=August 1, 2014|work=New York Times|accessdate=2014-08-02}}</ref><ref name=\"NCMLibrary\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nsa.gov/about/cryptologic_heritage/museum/virtual_tour/museum_tour_text.shtml|title=National Cryptological Museum\u2014Virtual Tour|accessdate=2010-10-05}}</ref> and Webster's ''Third New International Dictionary'' supplies a listing of hobo signs under the entry for \"hobo\".<ref>{{Cite book|title=Webster's third new international dictionary of the English language, unabridged|date=1993|publisher=Merriam-Webster|others=Gove, Philip Babcock, 1902-1972., Merriam-Webster, Inc.|isbn=0-87779-201-1|location=Springfield, Mass.|oclc=27936328|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/webstersthirdne001gove}}</ref>\n\nDespite an apparently strong record of authentication, however, there is doubt as to whether hobo signs were ever actually in practical use by hoboes. The alternative hypothesis is that the signs were invented early on by a writer or writers seeking to add to the fantastical mythos that began to surround hoboes soon after they first appeared; this fabrication, then, was perpetuated and embellished by writers over the years, aided occasionally by hoboes willing to make up a colorful story or pose for a photo.<ref name=\":1\" /> Several hoboes during the days that the signs were reportedly most in use asserted that they were in fact a \"popular fancy\" or \"a fabrication\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/hobo-signs-code-of-the-road|title=Hobo Signs: Code of the Road?|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref> Nels Anderson, who both hoboed himself and studied hoboes extensively for a [[University of Chicago]] master's thesis,<ref name=\":1\" /> wrote in 1932,<blockquote>Another merit of the book [Godfrey Irwin's 1931 ''American Tramp and Underworld Slang''] is that the author has not subscribed to the fiction that American tramps have a sign language, as so many professors are wont to believe.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Nels|date=March 1932|title=American Tramp and Underworld Slang. Godfrey Irwin (book review)|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=37|issue=5|pages=842|doi=10.1086/215902}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThough newspapers in the early and peak days of hoboing (1870s through the [[Great Depression|Depression]]) printed photos and drawings of hoboes leaving these signs, no known photos exist showing hobo signs found ''in situ'' where they would have served a practical purpose, leaving open the possibility that all the photographs published were staged in order to add color to the story.\n\nNonetheless, it is certain that hoboes have used some graffiti to communicate, in the form of \"monikers\" (sometimes \"monicas\"). These generally consisted simply of a road name (moniker), a date, and the direction the hobo was heading then. This would be written in a prominent location where other hoboes would see it. [[Jack London]], in recounting his hobo days, wrote,<blockquote>Water-tanks are tramp directories. Not all in idle wantonness do tramps carve their monicas, dates, and courses. Often and often have I met hoboes earnestly inquiring if I had seen anywhere such and such a \"stiff\" or his monica. And more than once I have been able to give the monica of recent date, the water-tank, and the direction in which he was then bound. And promptly the hobo to whom I gave the information lit out after his pal. I have met hoboes who, in trying to catch a pal, had pursued clear across the continent and back again, and were still going.<ref>{{Cite book|last=London|first=Jack|url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/14658/14658-h/14658-h.htm|title=The Road|publisher=Project Gutenberg|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=|orig-year=1907}}</ref></blockquote>The use of monikers persists to this day, although since the rise of cell phones a moniker is more often used simply to \"tag\" a train car or location. Some moniker writers have tagged train cars extensively; one who tagged under the name Bozo Texino during the 1970s and \u201980s estimated that in one year (\"where I went overboard\") he marked over 30,000 train cars.<ref name=\":2\">Daniel, Bill. ''Who Is Bozo Texino?'' (documentary). Self-published: billdaniel.net, 2005.</ref> However, not all moniker writers (or \"boxcar artists\") are hoboes; Bozo Texino in fact worked for the railroad, though others such as \"A No. 1\" and \"Palm Tree Herby\" rode trains as tramps or hoboes.<ref name=\":2\" /><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.historicgraffiti.org/post/moniker-mark-of-the-tramp|title=Moniker: Mark of the Tramp|last=Wray|first=Mike|last2=Wray|first2=Charlie|date=2018|website=Historic Graffiti Society|language=en|access-date=2020-02-25}}</ref>\n\n===Ethical code ===\nHobo culture\u2014though it has always, of course, had many points of contact with the mainstream American culture of its day\u2014has also always been somewhat separate and distinct, with different cultural norms. Hobo culture's ethics have always been subject to disapproval from the mainstream culture; for example, hopping freight trains, an integral part of hobo life, has always been illegal in the U.S. Nonetheless, the ethics of hobo culture can be regarded as fairly coherent and internally consistent, at least to the extent that any culture's various individual people maintain the same ethical standards. That is to say, any attempt at an exhaustive enumeration of hobo ethics is bound to be foiled at least to some extent by the diversity of hobos and their ideas of the world. This difficulty has not kept hobos themselves from attempting the exercise. An ethical code was created by Tourist Union #63 (a hobo union created in the mid-1800s to dodge anti-vagrancy laws, which did not apply to union members)<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/54624/strange-states-iowas-hobo-convention|title=Iowa's Hobo Convention|date=2014-01-21|website=www.mentalfloss.com|language=en|access-date=2019-12-20}}</ref> during its 1889 National Hobo Convention:<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.hobo.com/whatisahobo/hobocode.html | title=Hobo Code | publisher=National Hobo Museum | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724195757/http://www.hobo.com/whatisahobo/hobocode.html | archivedate=July 24, 2011 | url-status=dead | access-date=April 20, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n# Decide your own life; don't let another person run or rule you.\n# When in town, always respect the local law and officials, and try to be a gentleman at all times.\n# Don't take advantage of someone who is in a vulnerable situation, locals or other hobos.\n# Always try to find work, even if temporary, and always seek out jobs nobody wants.

The ephemeral ways of hobo conventions are mostly dependent on the resources of their hosts.  Some conventions are part of railroad conventions or \"railroad days\". Others are quasi-private affairs, hosted by long-time hobos.  Still others are ad hoc\u2014that is, they are held surreptitiously on private land. Some of these conventions are held in abandoned quarries along major rivers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nMost non-mainstream conventions are held at current or historical [[Train station|railroad stops]]. The most notable is the [[National Hobo Convention]] held in [[Britt, Iowa]].<!--Why most notable?-->{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} The town first hosted the Convention in 1900, but there followed a hiatus of thirty-three years.

Initially just a \"Hobo Convention\" museum, in the late 1990s it evolved into a fuller Hobo History museum. LeAnn Castillo, a local artist and the hobo painter, exhibits her portrait collection of hobo kings and queens since 1900.  All of her paintings are made from photos.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nFormal entertainment at the annual Convention begins before dusk, and is provided by a mix of active hobos, extended hobo families and non-hobo wannabees. Late after dark, the crowd leaves and the campfire becomes more informal. Satellite groups spring up. Stories are told\u2014small and tall, poetry is recited, and cants are sung to the muted vibrations of [[banjo]]s, [[guitar]]s and [[harmonica]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nActivities officially begin the Thursday of the convention weekend with a lighting of the campfire and exercise of some hobo cultural traditions (Honoring the Four Winds) before the opening entertainment. On Friday morning many visit the hobo-corner of the cemetery to pay tribute to those who have \"Caught the Westbound\", with a hobo memorial service preceded by a local contingent of ex-military colorguard. Names of deceased hobos are recited (Roll Call). At around five o'clock on Friday afternoon a poetry reading attracts participants and a small crowd of onlookers.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nHobo-king candidates are screened the days before the annual King and Queen election and coronation. They are expected to have knowledge and experience in riding trains, and are evaluated for how well they would represent the hobo community. A quasi-qualified candidate is occasionally allowed to run.  Any woman who is part of the hobo community may run for hobo Queen.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} On the Saturday morning there is a parade in the town pavilion, allowing onlookers to see those running for hobo king and queen in a last chance to campaign before the election in the early afternoon. Following the parade, [[Mulligan stew (food)|Mulligan stew]] is served to hundreds of people in the city park, cooked by local [[Boy Scouts]]. In early afternoon, the hobo King and Queen are elected by means of the volume of crowd applause.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}\n\nA carnival, flea market, and an annual auto show are also part of the festivities.

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

This is because of how a [[social network]] may be built, expanded, and used for social action in the site.<ref>Dam, J. W. V., & Velden, M. V. D. (2015).

Retrieved fromhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2017.03.005</ref> which may then be used for author profiling.\n\nIn the context of [[Facebook]], author profiling involves mainly [[English language|English]] textual data, but also involves Non-english languages that include: [[Roman Urdu]], [[Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=\"Fatima et al\"/><ref name=\" Rangel\"/> While author profiling studies on [[Facebook]] have been predominantly for [[gender]] and [[ageing|age]] -group identification, there have been attempts to derive attributes to predict [[religiosity]], the IT background of users, and even basic [[emotion]] defined by [[Paul Ekman]] among others.<ref name=\"Hsieh_et_al\"/><ref name=\"Rangel & Rosso\">Rangel, F., & Rosso, P.

Retrieved from http://personales.upv.es/prosso/resources/RangelRosso_NLPCS13.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Weibo ====\n\n[[Sina Weibo]] is one of the few [[social media]] platforms originating from [[asia]]n countries with predominantly [[asia]]n languages that is analysed with author profiling. Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]]. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train [[algorithm]]s that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/>\n\n====Chat Logs====\n\nChat logs have been studied for author profiling as they include much textual [[discourse]], the analysis of which have contributed to applicational studies including social trends and [[forensic science]].

Important parts of the [[MIME]] (Multi-purpose Internet Mail Extensions that contain content of the emails are also included in the crucial analysis.

(n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef18/pan18-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Depending on its application, the task of author profiling can vary in terms of the characteristics to be identified, number of authors studied and number of texts available for analysis.\n\nAlthough its applications have traditionally been limited to written texts, such as literary works,  this has extended to online texts with the advancement of the computer and the Internet.\n\n=== Forensic Linguistics ===\nIn the context of [[forensic linguistics]], author profiling is used to identify characteristics of the author of anonymous, [[pseudonym]]ous or [[Forgery|forged]] text, based on the author\u2019s use of the language. Through linguistic analysis, forensic linguists seek to identify the suspect\u2019s motivation and ideology, along with other class features, such as the suspect\u2019s ethnicity or profession. While this does not always lead to decisive author identification, such information can help [[law enforcement]] narrow the pool of suspects.<ref>Foster, D. (2000). Author Unknown: On the Trial of Anonymous. Henry Holt and Company</ref>\n\nIn most cases, author profiling in the context of forensic linguistics involves a single text problem, in which there is either no or few comparison texts available and no external evidence that points to the author.<ref name= \"Grant 2008\">Grant, T.

Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg</ref>\n\nOne of the earliest and best-known examples of the use of author profiling is by [[Roger Shuy]], who was asked to examine a ransom note linked to a notorious kidnapping case in 1979. Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C. E. (2001). Empirical evaluations of language-based author identification techniques. Forensic Linguistics, 8, 1-65.</ref>\n\n=== Bot Detection ===\nAuthor profiling is adopted in the identification of [[social bot]]s, the most common being [[Twitter bot]]s. Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information. In the context of marketing, social bots can artificially inflate the popularity of a product by posting positive reviews, and undermine the reputation of competitive products with unfavourable reviews.<ref name= \"Bots and Gender Profiling 2019\">Bots and Gender Profiling 2019.

With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]].

These problems include: \n*Wide variation in lengths of texts used \n*Class imbalance in data\n\n== Author Profiling and the Internet ==\n\nThe rise of the internet in the 20th to 21st century catalysed an increase in author profiling research on data from the web including content mined from social media platforms, emails, and also blogs. Content from web media have been analysed in author profiling to identify age-groups, gender, geographic origins, nationality and also psychometric traits of web users. The information obtained have been used to serve various applications such as marketing and forensics.\n\nSome sources of data for author profiling on the internet include:\n\n*Social Media platforms\n**Facebook\n**Weibo\n**Chat logs\n**Blogs\n*Emails\n\n=== Social Media ===\n\nThe increased integration of [[Social media]] in people\u2019s daily lives in the 20th and 21st centuries have made them a rich source of textual data for author profiling. This is mainly because users frequently upload and share content for various purposes including self-expression, socializing, and personal businesses. The [[Social bot]] is also a frequent feature of social media platforms, especially Twitter, generating content that may be analysed for author profiling.<ref name=\"Rangel\">Rangel, F., & Russo, P. (2019).Overview of the 7th Author Profiling Task at PAN 2019: Bots and Gender Profiling in Twitter. CLEF. Retrieved from http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-2380/paper_263.pdf</ref> While different platforms contain similar data they may also contain different features depending on the format and structure of the particular platform.\n\n[[Social media]] platforms have a rich source of data that can be used for author profiling. Despite this there are still limitations in using social media as data sources for author profiling, because data obtained may not always be reliable or accurate. Users sometimes provide false information about themselves or withhold information.<ref name=\"Rosso\">Rosso, P., Rangel, F., Far\u00edas, I. H., Cagnina, L., Zaghouani, W., & Charfi, A. (2018).

Retrieved from http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com.remotexs.ntu.edu.sg/doi/pdf/10.1111/lnc3.12275</ref> As a result, the training of algorithms for author profiling may be impeded by data that is less accurate. Another limitation is the irregularity of text in [[social media]]. Features of irregularity include deviation from normal linguistic standards such as spelling errors, unstandardised transliteration as with the substitution of letters with numbers, shorthands, user-created abbreviations for phrases and et cetera, which may pose a challenge to author profiling.<ref name=\"G\u00f3mez-Adorno\">G\u00f3mez-Adorno, H., Markov, I., Sidorov, G., Posadas-Dur\u00e1n, J.-P., Sanchez-Perez, M.

This is because of how a [[social network]] may be built, expanded, and used for social action in the site.<ref>Dam, J. W. V., & Velden, M. V. D. (2015).

In:Decision Support Systems, 70, 60\u201372. doi: 10.1016/j.dss.2014.12.001</ref> In such processes, users share personal content that may be used for author profiling studies.

Retrieved fromhttps://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1016/j.ipm.2017.03.005</ref> which may then be used for author profiling.\n\nIn the context of [[Facebook]], author profiling involves mainly [[English language|English]] textual data, but also involves Non-english languages that include: [[Roman Urdu]], [[Arabic]], [[Brazilian Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]].<ref name=\"Fatima et al\"/><ref name=\" Rangel\"/> While author profiling studies on [[Facebook]] have been predominantly for [[gender]] and [[ageing|age]] -group identification, there have been attempts to derive attributes to predict [[religiosity]], the IT background of users, and even basic [[emotion]] defined by [[Paul Ekman]] among others.<ref name=\"Hsieh_et_al\"/><ref name=\"Rangel & Rosso\">Rangel, F., & Rosso, P.

Retrieved from http://personales.upv.es/prosso/resources/RangelRosso_NLPCS13.pdf</ref>\n\n==== Weibo ====\n\n[[Sina Weibo]] is one of the few [[social media]] platforms originating from [[asia]]n countries with predominantly [[asia]]n languages that is analysed with author profiling. Primary content of focus for author profiling on Weibo content include classical [[Chinese language|Chinese]] characters, [[hashtag]]s, [[emoticon]]s, kaomoji, homogenous [[punctuation]], [[Latin]] sequences (due to the multilingualism of text) and even poetic formats. Particularly popular [[Chinese language|Chinese]] expressions, parts-of-speech and word types are also tracked for author profiling.<ref name=\"Zhang\">Zhang, W., Caines, A., Alikaniotis, D., & Buttery, P. (2015). Predicting author [[ageing|age]] from Weibo [[microblogging]] posts. Retrieved from https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L16-1478.pdf</ref>\n\nAuthor profiling for Weibo content requires algorithms different from those utilised for other social media platforms, mainly due to the linguistic differences between [[Mandarin Chinese]] and Western languages. For example, Chinese emotions involve Chinese characters describing the gesture or facial expression in brackets, such as: e.g. [\u54c8\u54c8] \u2018laughter\u2019, [\u6cea] \u2018tears\u2019, [\u5077\u7b11] \u2018giggle\u2019, [\u7231\u4f60] \u2018love\u2019, [\u5fc3] \u2018heart\u2019.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/> This differs from the use of punctuation symbols for emoticons in Western languages, or the common use of the Unicode emojis in other platforms such as facebook, instagram, etc. Further, while there are around 161 western emoticons, there are around 2900 emoticons regularly used in Mainland China for web content as in Weibo.<ref name=\"Chen\">Chen, L., Qian, T., Wang, F., You, Z., Peng, Q., & Zhong, M. (2015). Age Detection for Chinese Users in Weibo. WAIM 2015, LNCS 9098, 83\u201395. Retrieved from https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-21042-1_7</ref> In order to tackle these differences, author profiling algorithms have been trained on Chinese emoticons and linguistic features. For example, author profiling algorithms have been designed to detect Chinese stylistic expressions expressing formality and sentiment, in place of algorithms detecting English linguistic features such as capital letters.<ref name=\"Chen\"/>\n\nThere is relatively less use of author profiling methods on Weibo content as compared to other more popular, globalised platforms. This may be due to the centralisation of Weibo in the Chinese population of [[Mainland China]], limiting its rates of usage to predominantly [[China National]]s{{disambiguation needed|date=April 2020}}. Studies done for this platform have utilised [[Automated bot|bot]]s, [[machine learning]] [[algorithm]]s to identify authors\u2019 [[ageing|age]] and [[gender]]. Data is acquired from Weibo microblog posts of willing participants to be analysed, and used to train [[algorithm]]s that build concept-based profiles of users to a certain accuracy.<ref name=\"Zhang\"/>\n\n====Chat Logs====\n\nChat logs have been studied for author profiling as they include much textual [[discourse]], the analysis of which have contributed to applicational studies including social trends and [[forensic science]].

(n.d.). Retrieved from https://pan.webis.de/clef18/pan18-web/author-profiling.html</ref> Depending on its application, the task of author profiling can vary in terms of the characteristics to be identified, number of authors studied and number of texts available for analysis.\n\nAlthough its applications have traditionally been limited to written texts, such as literary works,  this has extended to online texts with the advancement of the computer and the Internet.\n\n=== Forensic Linguistics ===\nIn the context of [[forensic linguistics]], author profiling is used to identify characteristics of the author of anonymous, [[pseudonym]]ous or [[Forgery|forged]] text, based on the author\u2019s use of the language. Through linguistic analysis, forensic linguists seek to identify the suspect\u2019s motivation and ideology, along with other class features, such as the suspect\u2019s ethnicity or profession. While this does not always lead to decisive author identification, such information can help [[law enforcement]] narrow the pool of suspects.<ref>Foster, D. (2000). Author Unknown: On the Trial of Anonymous. Henry Holt and Company</ref>\n\nIn most cases, author profiling in the context of forensic linguistics involves a single text problem, in which there is either no or few comparison texts available and no external evidence that points to the author.<ref name= \"Grant 2008\">Grant, T.

Based on his analysis of the kidnapper\u2019s [[idiolect]], Shuy was able to identify crucial elements of the kidnappers identity from his misspellings and a dialect item, that is, the kidnapper was well-educated and from [[Akron, Ohio]].<ref>Leonard, R. A. (2005). Applying the Scientific Principles of Language Analysis to Issues of the Law. International Journal of Humanities. 3. 1-9</ref> This eventually led to a successful arrest and confession by the suspect.\n\nHowever, there are criticisms that author profiling methods lack objectivity, since these methods are reliant on a forensic linguist\u2019s subjective identification of crucial [[Sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] markers . These methods, such as those adopted by literary critic [[Donald Wayne Foster]], are said to be speculative and based entirely on one\u2019s subjective experience, and therefore cannot be tested [[empirical research|empirically]].<ref>Chaski, C.

Social bots have been deemed as a threat given their commercial, political and ideological influence, such as the [[2016 United States presidential election|2016 United States Presidential Election]], during which they [[Group polarisation|polarised]] political conversations, and spread misinformation and unverified information.

LNCS (LNAI).</ref>\n\n=== Literary Works ===\n\nAuthor profiling techniques is used to study [[traditional media]] and [[literature]] to identify the [[writing style]] of various authors as well as their written topics of content. Author profiling for [[literature]] is also been done to deduce the [[social network]]s of authors and their literary influence based on their bibliographic records of co-authorship.\n\nSome examples of author profiling studies on literature and traditional media include studies on the following;:<ref>Company, J. S., & Wanner, L. (2017). On the Relevance of Syntactic and Discourse Features for Author Profiling and Identification.

(2009). Classifying library catalogues by author profiling. In: Proceedings of the 32nd International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval - SIGIR 09. {{doi|10.1145/1571941.1572057}}</ref> In this approach, author profiling techniques may improve the efficiency of [[library catalog|library cataloguing]] in which library resources are automatically classified based on the authors' [[bibliographic records]]. This was a significant issue in the early 21st century when much of library cataloguing was still done manually.\n\nIn using author profiling for library cataloguing, researchers have utilised [[machine learning]] for automatic processes in the [[library]], such as [[Support Vector Machine]] [[algorithms]] (SVMs). With the use of SVMs for author profiling, [[bibliographic records]] of authors within existing [[databases]] may be identified, tracked, and updated to identify an author based on her topics of literary content and [[expertise]] as indicated in his or her [[bibliographic records]]. In this case, author profiling utilises the [[social structures]] of authors that may be derived from physical copies of [[published]] media to catalogue library resources.<ref name=\"Nomoto\"/>\n\n== In Popular Culture ==\nAuthor profiling has been featured in popular culture:\n* The 2017 [[Discovery Channel]] mini-series [[Manhunt (2017 TV series)|Manhunt: Unabomber]] is a fictionalised account of the FBI investigation surrounding the [[Ted Kaczynski|Unabomber]]. It features a criminal profiler who identifies defining characteristics of the Unabomber\u2019s identity based on his analysis of the Unabomber\u2019s [[idiolect]] in his letters and published manifesto.\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Authorship debates]]\n[[Category:Computational fields of study]]\n", "name_user": "LBurris89", "label": "safe", "comment": "add link to source", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author_profiling"}

That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071116150927/http://www.raisport.rai.it/pub/sezione/raiSportSezioneIndex/0%2C5785%2C_205_60_1416%2C00.html|title= Zamparini Interview|language=Italian|publisher=raisport.it}}</ref> who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]].

The ''rosanero'' ended the season in first place, being crowned Serie B champions and promoted to [[Serie A]] after 31 years in the lower divisions.\n\n==Review and events==\nAmbitious Palermo failed to gain promotion to [[Serie A]] in the previous season following a 3-0 away defeat in the final match against [[U.S. Lecce|Lecce]], which were promoted at Palermo's place<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914131104/http://www.ilpalermocalcio.it/it/0304/numeri.jsp|title= Season 2002-30 Palermo |publisher=ilpalermocalcio.it|language=Italian}}</ref>. That dramatic defeat was also the last appearance in his playing career for team captain [[Antonino Asta]], who seriously injured during the match and did not manage to recover; he was part of the first team squad in the season 2003-04, without however making a single appearance. Following the events, Palermo made a number of prominent signings in the summer market, such as [[Eugenio Corini]], [[Andrea Gasbarroni]] and [[Luca Toni]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archiviostorico.gazzetta.it/2004/giugno/13/ultima_notte_Toni_ga_10_0406135443.shtml|publisher=gazzetta.it|title= The last night of Toni|language=Italian}}</ref>; in addition, Palermo-born star [[Gaetano Vasari]] agreed to join the ''rosanero'' with a salary based on the number of appearances he would have made in the season. [[Silvio Baldini]] was appointed as new boss to replace [[Nedo Sonetti]]. Several football pundits suggested Palermo to be the real favourite team to win the Serie B league because of the quality of its roster.\n\nThe team made a very impressive start by defeating [[Gianfranco Zola]]'s [[Cagliari Calcio]], and managed to be always in the promotion spots. However, following a surprising 3-1 home defeat to [[Salernitana Calcio 1919|Salernitana]] that brought Palermo down to third place, Baldini heavily criticized club chairman [[Maurizio Zamparini]] who consequently fired him and appointed [[Francesco Guidolin]] at his place. On the last day of the January transfer market, three new notable signings were made: [[Antonio Filippini]], [[Emanuele Filippini]] and [[Fabio Grosso]]. Palermo later returned to top the table and eventually won the league, ending with the same points than Cagliari, but being crowned as Serie B champions due to head-to-head matches.\n\n==2003-04 squad==\n{{Efs start|[[Serie B 2003-04|Serie B]]|[[Coppa Italia 2003-04|Coppa Italia]]}}\n{{Efs player|no=1|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Berti]]|pos=GK|42|-35|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=12|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Santoni]]|pos=GK|4|-4|4|-6}}\n{{Efs player|no=84|nat=Italy|name=[[Paolo Comi]]|pos=GK|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=4|nat=Italy|name=[[Gianluca Atzori]]|pos=DF|17|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=6|nat=Italy|name=[[Christian Terlizzi]]|pos=DF|12|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=13|nat=Italy|name=[[Pietro Accardi]]|pos=DF|32|0|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|21|1|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|19|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=25|nat=Sierra Leone|name=[[Kewullay Conteh]]|pos=DF|32|0|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=29|nat=Romania|name=[[Valentin N\u0103stase]]|pos=DF|16|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=81|nat=Italy|name=[[Michele Ferri]]|pos=DF|36|1|3|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=5|nat=Italy|name=[[Eugenio Corini]]|pos=MF|40|12|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=7|nat=Italy|name=[[Gaetano Vasari]]|pos=MF|26|1|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=8|nat=Italy|name=[[Daniele Di Donato]]|pos=MF|39|3|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=10|nat=Italy|name=[[Lamberto Zauli]]|pos=MF|21|4|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=11|nat=Italy|name=[[Salvatore Masiello]]|pos=MF|18|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=17|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonino Asta]]|pos=MF|0|0|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=22|nat=Italy|name=[[Massimo Mutarelli]]|pos=MF|41|2|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Emanuele Filippini]]|pos=MF|20|4|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=26|nat=Italy|name=[[Antonio Filippini]]|pos=MF|21|2|0|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=46|nat=Italy|name=[[Andrea Gasbarroni]]|pos=MF|39|6|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=79|nat=Italy|name=[[Evans Soligo]]|pos=MF|9|0|4|1}}\n{{Efs player|no=82|nat=Italy|name=[[Nicola Milano]]|pos=MF|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=9|nat=Italy|name=[[Luca Toni]]|pos=FW|45|30|2|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=20|nat=Italy|name=[[Simone Pepe]]|pos=FW|19|1|5|2}}\n{{Efs player|no=24|nat=Nigeria|name=[[John Otuagomah Olufemi]]|pos=FW|0|0|1|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=30|nat=Brazil|name=[[Jedaias Capucho Neves|Jeda]]|pos=FW|17|3|0|0}}\n|-\n|colspan=\"10\"|''Players sold or loaned out during the January transfer market:''\n{{Efs player|no=3|nat=Italy|name=[[Francesco Modesto]]|pos=DF|1|0|5|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Franco Brienza]]|pos=MF|18|1|3|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=21|nat=Romania|name=[[Paul Codrea]]|pos=MF|8|0|4|0}}\n{{Efs player|no=23|nat=Italy|name=[[Ighli Vannucchi]]|pos=MF|8|0|3|2}}\n|}\n\n===January transfer market bids===\n;'''In'''\n{|\n{{Football squad player|no=18|nat=Italy|name=[[Fabio Grosso]]|pos=DF|other=from [[Perugia Calcio|Perugia]]}}\n{{Football squad player|no=21|nat=Italy|name=[[Giuseppe Biava]]|pos=DF|other=from [[U.C.
