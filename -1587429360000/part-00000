She toured with the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1910, and moved to the United States soon after.\n\nLopokova married the renowned English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] in 1925, and was also known as the '''Lady Keynes'''. She largely disappeared from public view after Keynes's death in 1946, and spent her remaining years in [[Sussex]].\n\n==Early life==\nLopokova was born into a Russian family in [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name=obit/> Her father worked as the chief usher at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]]; her mother was descended from a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] engineer.<ref name=tele/> All the Lopukhov children became ballet dancers; one of them, [[Fyodor Lopukhov]], was a chief choreographer for the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] from 1922 to 1935 and again from 1951 to 1956.\n\nLydia trained at the [[Imperial Ballet School]], where she almost immediately became a star pupil.<ref name=obit/> \"She responded instinctively to the expressive choreography of [[Mikhail Fokine]], his rebellion against the stiff academicism of the classical style, and her chance came when she was chosen to join the [[Ballets russes]]... on their European tour in 1910.... [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] knocked a year off her age and promoted her as a child star.\"<ref name=\"Light, Lady Talky.\">[[Alison Light]], \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n24/ligh01_.html Lady Talky],\" ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 18 December 2008.</ref> She stayed with the ballet only briefly, knowing that she had little future in Russia (\"she was the wrong size and shape for the grand roles and there were already plenty of prima ballerinas in St. Petersburg\").<ref name=\"Light, Lady Talky.\"/>\n\n==America==\n[[File:Lydia Lopokova, ballet dancer (SAYRE 5958).jpg|thumb|Lydia Lopokova, 1917]]\nShe accepted an American offer of \u00a316,000 per month and after the summer tour left for the United States, where she remained for six years, enjoying tremendous success and legally changing her name to Lopokova in April 1914.<ref>''Lydia and Maynard: Letters between Lydia Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes'' (Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1989), p. 20.</ref>\n\nIn 1915, while in New York, she had become engaged to the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' sportswriter [[Heywood Broun]], later a member of the celebrated [[Algonquin Round Table]] coterie. In 1916 she broke off their engagement, or perhaps Broun did: according to [[Fred Lieb]], another sportswriter and a friend of Broun's at the time, Broun \"caught the enchanting Lydia Lapopka in the lap, so to speak, of her Russian director.... [Broun] walked east on one street, knocking over every garbage and trash can he passed. Then he walked west on the street giving it the same treatment. Just as he was getting really warmed up to the sport he ran into the hands of the law. Heywood spent the night in the hoosegow before friends bailed him out the next morning.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Lieb\n| first      = Fred\n| authorlink = Fred Lieb\n| coauthors  = \n| title      = Baseball As I Have Known It\n| publisher  = Coward, McCann & Geoghegan\n| year       = 1977\n| location   = New York\n| page       = 214\n}}</ref>\n\nActually, if Broun indeed caught her ''in flagrante'', it was not in the lap of \"her Russian director,\" Diaghilev, but the company's Italian business manager, Randolfo Barrocchi, whom she soon married. From her perspective, the union was ill-advised: \"A 'glossy man of the world', he stole her earnings and \u2014 luckily \u2014 turned out to be a bigamist; meanwhile, in the midst of a wartime European tour, she had an on-off affair with [[Igor Stravinsky]], who was married.\"<ref name=\"Light, Lady Talky.\"/>\n\nIn America she was basically a novelty act, and she rejoined Diaghilev in 1916, dancing with the Ballets Russes, and her former partner [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], in [[New York City|New York]] and later in [[London]]. She first came to the attention of Londoners in ''The Good-humoured Ladies'' in 1918, and followed this with a raucous performance with [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] in the [[Can-can|Can-Can]] of ''[[La Boutique fantasque]]''. When her marriage to Barrocchi broke down in 1919, the dancer abruptly disappeared for a time, as she had done before in America.\n\n==Relationship with Keynes==\n[[File:Lopokova and Keynes 1920s.jpg|thumb|235px|Lopokova with Keynes in the 1920s]]\nIn 1921, Diaghilev staged a lavish production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in which Lopokova danced the Lilac Fairy and Princess Aurora.

She toured with the [[Ballets Russes]] in 1910, and moved to the United States soon after.\n\nLopokova married the renowned English economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] in 1925, and was also known as the '''Lady Keynes'''. She largely disappeared from public view after Keynes's death in 1946, and spent her remaining years in [[Sussex]].\n\n==Early life==\nLopokova was born into a Russian family in [[St. Petersburg]].<ref name=obit/> Her father worked as the chief usher at the [[Alexandrinsky Theatre]]; her mother was descended from a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] engineer.<ref name=tele/> All the Lopukhov children became ballet dancers; one of them, [[Fyodor Lopukhov]], was a chief choreographer for the [[Mariinsky Theatre]] from 1922 to 1935 and again from 1951 to 1956.\n\nLydia trained at the [[Imperial Ballet School]], where she almost immediately became a star pupil.<ref name=obit/> \"She responded instinctively to the expressive choreography of [[Mikhail Fokine]], his rebellion against the stiff academicism of the classical style, and her chance came when she was chosen to join the [[Ballets russes]]... on their European tour in 1910.... [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] knocked a year off her age and promoted her as a child star.\"<ref name=\"Light, Lady Talky.\">[[Alison Light]], \"[http://www.lrb.co.uk/v30/n24/ligh01_.html Lady Talky],\" ''[[London Review of Books]]'', 18 December 2008.</ref> She stayed with the ballet only briefly, knowing that she had little future in Russia (\"she was the wrong size and shape for the grand roles and there were already plenty of prima ballerinas in St. Petersburg\").<ref name=\"Light, Lady Talky.\"/>\n\n==America==\n[[File:Lydia Lopokova, ballet dancer (SAYRE 5958).jpg|thumb|Lydia Lopokova, 1917]]\nShe accepted an American offer of \u00a316,000 per month and after the summer tour left for the United States, where she remained for six years, enjoying tremendous success and legally changing her name to Lopokova in April 1914.<ref>''Lydia and Maynard: Letters between Lydia Lopokova and John Maynard Keynes'' (Andr\u00e9 Deutsch, 1989), p. 20.</ref>\n\nIn 1915, while in New York, she had become engaged to the ''[[New York Morning Telegraph]]'' sportswriter [[Heywood Broun]], later a member of the celebrated [[Algonquin Round Table]] coterie. In 1916 she broke off their engagement, or perhaps Broun did: according to [[Fred Lieb]], another sportswriter and a friend of Broun's at the time, Broun \"caught the enchanting Lydia Lapopka in the lap, so to speak, of her Russian director.... [Broun] walked east on one street, knocking over every garbage and trash can he passed. Then he walked west on the street giving it the same treatment. Just as he was getting really warmed up to the sport he ran into the hands of the law. Heywood spent the night in the hoosegow before friends bailed him out the next morning.\"<ref>{{cite book\n| last       = Lieb\n| first      = Fred\n| authorlink = Fred Lieb\n| coauthors  = \n| title      = Baseball As I Have Known It\n| publisher  = Coward, McCann & Geoghegan\n| year       = 1977\n| location   = New York\n| page       = 214\n}}</ref>\n\nActually, if Broun indeed caught her ''in flagrante'', it was not in the lap of \"her Russian director,\" Diaghilev, but the company's Italian business manager, Randolfo Barrocchi, whom she soon married. From her perspective, the union was ill-advised: \"A 'glossy man of the world', he stole her earnings and \u2014 luckily \u2014 turned out to be a bigamist; meanwhile, in the midst of a wartime European tour, she had an on-off affair with [[Igor Stravinsky]], who was married.\"<ref name=\"Light, Lady Talky.\"/>\n\nIn America she was basically a novelty act, and she rejoined Diaghilev in 1916, dancing with the Ballets Russes, and her former partner [[Vaslav Nijinsky]], in [[New York City|New York]] and later in [[London]]. She first came to the attention of Londoners in ''The Good-humoured Ladies'' in 1918, and followed this with a raucous performance with [[L\u00e9onide Massine]] in the [[Can-can|Can-Can]] of ''[[La Boutique fantasque]]''. When her marriage to Barrocchi broke down in 1919, the dancer abruptly disappeared for a time, as she had done before in America.\n\n==Relationship with Keynes==\n[[File:Lopokova and Keynes 1920s.jpg|thumb|235px|Lopokova with Keynes in the 1920s]]\nIn 1921, Diaghilev staged a lavish production of ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in which Lopokova danced the Lilac Fairy and Princess Aurora.

Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling a shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the  shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the [[jackhammer]]s used were designed for drilling downward, rather than sideways. A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. TV viewers watched as paramedics and rescuers, drilling experts and contractors worked to save McClure's life.

Within hours of beginning the emergency procedure, the Midland Fire and Police Departments devised a plan that involved drilling a shaft parallel to the well and then drilling a tunnel at a right angle across to it. Enlisting the help of a variety of local (often out-of-work) oil drillers, the Midland officials had hoped to free McClure in minutes. However, the first workers to arrive on the scene found their tools barely adequate to penetrate the hard rock around the well. It took about six hours to drill the  shaft and longer to drill the tunnel, because the [[jackhammer]]s used were designed for drilling downward, rather than sideways. A mining engineer eventually arrived to help supervise and coordinate the rescue effort. TV viewers watched as paramedics and rescuers, drilling experts and contractors worked to save McClure's life. Meanwhile, they were reassured when they heard her singing \u201c[[Winnie the Pooh (song)|Winnie the Pooh]]\u201d from deep in the well.

Her mistress Lady Billows is organising the annual May Day festival and has gathered all the important people of the village to elect the [[May Queen]]. But Florence has dug up dirt on every single girl nominated, proving that none is worthy to wear the once-much-coveted crown. Lady Billows is depressed. Superintendent Budd suggests that the solution may be to select, this year, a May King instead. He knows of a young man in town who is as certainly virginal as the girls are not: Albert Herring.\n\nWorking at the greengrocer's, Albert is teased for his timidity by the easygoing butcher Sid. Sid's girlfriend Nancy comes in to do some shopping, and the couple shares a tender moment while Albert looks on. The lovers leave, and Albert reflects on his miserable existence under his mother's thumb. The Festival Committee arrives with the news of his selection as May King. Mrs. Herring is thrilled by the prize of \u00a325, but Albert balks at being paraded in swan-white and mother and son quarrel to the mocking commentary of the village children.\n\n===Act 2===\nIt is the day of the festival. Sid and Nancy are preparing the banquet tent, and they take the opportunity to slip some rum into Albert's lemonade glass. Together with a crown of flowers and the gruesome but improving Foxe's ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', Albert is awarded twenty-five pounds in prize money. Asked to make a speech, he is tongue-tied and becomes an object of pity at the feast in his honour, but after draining his lemonade glass (which Britten satirically underlines with a [[Tristan chord]], alluding to the philter in [[Tristan und Isolde|that opera]]).<ref>[[Tom Service]], [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,816967,00.html \"Albert Herring\" (Glyndebourne review)]. ''The Guardian'', 22 October 2002</ref> and having a fit of hiccups he manages a few hip-hip, hurrahs.\n\nThat night, Albert arrives home alone and quite drunk. In the street, Sid keeps a rendezvous with Nancy, and the two discuss their sympathetic pity for Albert before going off together. This is the breaking point for Albert, who has overheard. He takes the prize money and heads out looking for adventure.\n\n===Act 3===\nThe next morning Albert has not returned, and the village is in a panic. Superintendent Budd is leading the search, while the guilt-stricken Nancy tends to Mrs. Herring. A boy shouts that a \"Big White Something\" has been found in a well, and the village worthies file in to break the news ''en masse'' that Albert's crown of flowers has been discovered, crushed by a cart. A lengthy [[threnody]] of grief follows, but is interrupted by the surprise return of Albert. He thanks the Festival Committee for funding his night out. They, in turn, are outraged by his tale of drunken debauchery and leave in a huff. Albert finally stands up to his mother and invites the village children into the shop to enjoy some fruit at his expense.\n\n==Musical style and character themes==\n''Albert Herring'' is a musically complex work, despite its somewhat light-hearted subject matter.

Her mistress Lady Billows is organising the annual May Day festival and has gathered all the important people of the village to elect the [[May Queen]]. But Florence has dug up dirt on every single girl nominated, proving that none is worthy to wear the once-much-coveted crown. Lady Billows is depressed. Superintendent Budd suggests that the solution may be to select, this year, a May King instead. He knows of a young man in town who is as certainly virginal as the girls are not: Albert Herring.\n\nWorking at the greengrocer's, Albert is teased for his timidity by the easygoing butcher Sid. Sid's girlfriend Nancy comes in to do some shopping, and the couple shares a tender moment while Albert looks on. The lovers leave, and Albert reflects on his miserable existence under his mother's thumb. The Festival Committee arrives with the news of his selection as May King. Mrs. Herring is thrilled by the prize of \u00a325, but Albert balks at being paraded in swan-white and mother and son quarrel to the mocking commentary of the village children.\n\n===Act 2===\nIt is the day of the festival. Sid and Nancy are preparing the banquet tent, and they take the opportunity to slip some rum into Albert's lemonade glass. Together with a crown of flowers and the gruesome but improving Foxe's ''[[Foxe's Book of Martyrs|The Book of Martyrs]]'', Albert is awarded twenty-five pounds in prize money. Asked to make a speech, he is tongue-tied and becomes an object of pity at the feast in his honour, but after draining his lemonade glass (which Britten satirically underlines with a [[Tristan chord]], alluding to the philter in [[Tristan und Isolde|that opera]]).<ref>[[Tom Service]], [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/reviews/story/0,,816967,00.html \"Albert Herring\" (Glyndebourne review)]. ''The Guardian'', 22 October 2002</ref> and having a fit of hiccups he manages a few hip-hip, hurrahs.\n\nThat night, Albert arrives home alone and quite drunk. In the street, Sid keeps a rendezvous with Nancy, and the two discuss their sympathetic pity for Albert before going off together. This is the breaking point for Albert, who has overheard. He takes the prize money and heads out looking for adventure.\n\n===Act 3===\nThe next morning Albert has not returned, and the village is in a panic. Superintendent Budd is leading the search, while the guilt-stricken Nancy tends to Mrs. Herring. A boy shouts that a \"Big White Something\" has been found in a well, and the village worthies file in to break the news ''en masse'' that Albert's crown of flowers has been discovered, crushed by a cart. A lengthy [[threnody]] of grief follows, but is interrupted by the surprise return of Albert. He thanks the Festival Committee for funding his night out. They, in turn, are outraged by his tale of drunken debauchery and leave in a huff. Albert finally stands up to his mother and invites the village children into the shop to enjoy some fruit at his expense.\n\n==Musical style and character themes==\n''Albert Herring'' is a musically complex work, despite its somewhat light-hearted subject matter. The text is genuinely humorous, and the score, while matching the text in character, includes myriad [[musical quotation]]s as well as some complex forms. Like ''[[Peter Grimes]]'' and other works by Britten, this opera explores society's reaction to an odd individual, although, in this case at least, it is from a generally humorous and lighthearted perspective.<ref>Michael Kennedy,[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/1997/03/22/bmrher22.xml \"Herring stock soars\"], ''Telegraph'' (London), 22 March 1997</ref><ref>\nAndrew Clements, [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/critic/review/0,,890277,00.html \"Britten: Albert Herring; Gillett, Bedford et al.]\", ''The Guardian'', 7 February 2003</ref> Some of Britten's contemporaries saw in the title character a satirical self-portrait of the composer.<ref>Alfred Hickling, [https://www.theguardian.com/saturday_review/story/0,,647002,00.html 'It's quite New Labour'], ''The Guardian'', 9 February 2002.</ref>\n\n== Recordings ==\nThere are five audio recordings of ''Albert Herring'' and one DVD recording, with the following artists:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Width=\"140\"|Cast:<br />(Albert,<br />Lady Billows,<br />Sid,<br />Nancy,<br />Mrs Herring,<br />Florence Pike,<br />Miss Wordsworth,<br />Mr Gedge,<br />Mr Upfold,<br />Superintendent Budd)\n!Conductor,<br />Orchestra,<br />Notes\n!Label,<br />Cat.

Most sales were of the 803B version with more parallel paths internally, larger memory and hardware floating-point operations.\n\nThe Elliott 803 was the computer used in the ISI-609, the world's first process or [[industrial control system]], wherein the 803 was a [[data logger]]. It was used for this purpose at the world's first dual-purpose nuclear reactor, the [[N-Reactor]].\n\nA significant number of British universities had an Elliott 803.<ref name=\"hansard-19670306\">{{cite web |url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1967/mar/06/computers |title=Computers |last=Roberts |first=Goronwy |publisher=UK Parliament |work=Hansard |date=1967-03-06 |id=HC |volume=742 Deb 06 March 1967 vol 742 cc201-5W |access-date=2017-07-08}}</ref>\n\nElliott subsequently developed the much faster, software compatible, [[Elliott 503]].\n\nTwo complete Elliott 803 computers survive.

Circuitry is based on [[printed circuit boards]] with the circuits being rather simple and most of the signalling carried on wires.  There is a second cabinet about half the size used for the power supply, which is unusually based on a large [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery]] with charger, an early form of [[uninterruptible power supply]]. A third cabinet (the same size as the power cabinet) holds the extra working store on machines with 8192 word stores.

Tape is read at 500 characters per second and punched at 100 cps.\nThe operator's console, about 60 inches long, allows low-level instructions to be entered manually to manipulate addresses and data and can start, stop and step the machine: there is a loudspeaker (pulsed by the top bit of the [[instruction register]]) which allows the operator to judge the status of a computation.

At the time this was in use by the film industry to record sound tracks.  Elliott's factory at Borehamwood was close to the Elstree film studios which explains the use of the 35mm sprocketed media. The 1000-foot reels held 4096 blocks of 64 words per block (4096 x 64 x 39 = 10,223,616 bits, or the equivalent of about 1.27Mbytes).\n\nAnother unusual feature is the use of magnetic cores not only for memory but also as logic gates. These logic cores have 1, 2 or 3 input windings, a trigger (read) and an output winding.  Depending on their polarity, current pulses in the input windings either magnetise the core or cancel each other out. The magnetised state of the core indicates the result of a boolean logic function. [[two-phase clock|Two clock phases]] designated alpha and beta are used to trigger (reset to zero) alternate cores. A change from a one to a zero produces a pulse on the output winding. Cores which receive alpha trigger pulses (alpha cores) have inputs fed from gates which are triggered on the beta phase (beta cores). Transistors were expensive at the time and each logic gate requires only one to amplify the output winding pulse; however a single transistor drives the inputs of a small number of (typically 3) other cores. If more than 3 inputs are to be driven, up to two more transistors can be driven by each core.\n\n==Instruction set==\n\nInstructions and data are based on a 39-bit word length with binary representation in [[Two's complement|2's complement]] arithmetic. The [[instruction set]] operates on a single address and single accumulator register, with an additional auxiliary register for double length integer multiply and divide. Although it is believed that the single length divide and square root instructions were only enabled in 803s destined for process control applications, the one remaining operational 803B has been found to have these instructions enabled, probably because it was used by a software house to develop real time and  process control applications.  An instruction is composed of a 6-bit instruction (conventionally represented in [[octal]]) and a 13 bit address. This gives 64 instructions organised as 8 groups of 8 instructions. The 13-bit memory address field gives an addressable range of 8192 words. These 19-bit instructions are packed two to a word with an additional 39th bit between them, the so-called B-line or B digit (the term is a legacy from the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, where the A-line represented the accumulator and the B-line an instruction modifier, both displayed on a [[Williams tube]]). Setting the B digit has the effect of adding the contents of the memory address of the first instruction to the second instruction at execution time, enabling indirect addressing and other run-time instruction modifications. The bit time is 6 microseconds, jumps execute in 288 microseconds and simple arithmetic instructions in 576 microseconds. Floating point operations take several milliseconds.  IO is direct and there are no interrupts.\n\nIn the following descriptions, A and N represent the accumulator and the literal address, a and n represent the (initial) contents of the accumulator and addressed store location, and a' and n' the resultant contents.\n\n===Instruction Groups 0 \u2013 3===\n\nThese are fixed point arithmetic with 4 different combinations of operand and result destination:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Groups 0 \u2013 3\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 00\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Do nothing\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 01\n|align=\"left\"| Negate\n| -a\n| n\n|-\n| 02\n|align=\"left\"| Replace & count\n| n + 1\n| n\n|-\n| 03\n|align=\"left\"| Collate\n| a & n\n| n\n|-\n| 04\n|align=\"left\"| Add\n| a + n\n| n\n|-\n| 05\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract\n| a - n\n| n\n|-\n| 06\n|align=\"left\"| Clear\n| zero\n| n\n|-\n| 07\n|align=\"left\"| Negate & add\n| n - a\n| n\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 10\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Exchange\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 11\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and negate\n| -n\n| a\n|-\n| 12\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and count\n| n + 1\n| a\n|-\n| 13\n|align=\"left\"| Write and collate\n| a & n\n| a\n|-\n| 14\n|align=\"left\"| Write and add\n| a + n\n| a\n|-\n| 15\n|align=\"left\"| Write and subtract\n| a - n\n| a\n|-\n| 16\n|align=\"left\"| Write and clear\n| zero\n| a\n|-\n| 17\n|align=\"left\"| Write, negate and add\n| n - a\n| a\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 20\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Write\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 21\n|align=\"left\"| Write negatively\n| a\n| -a\n|-\n| 22\n|align=\"left\"| Count in store\n| a\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 23\n|align=\"left\"| Collate in store\n| a\n| a & n\n|-\n| 24\n|align=\"left\"| Add into store\n| a\n| a + n\n|-\n| 25\n|align=\"left\"| Negate store and add\n| a\n| a - n\n|-\n| 26\n|align=\"left\"| Clear store\n| a\n| zero\n|-\n| 27\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract from store\n| a\n| n - a\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 30\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Replace\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 31\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and negate store\n| n\n| -n\n|-\n| 32\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and count in store\n| n\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 33\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and collate in store\n| n\n| a & n\n|-\n| 34\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and add to store\n| n\n| a + n\n|-\n| 35\n|align=\"left\"| Replace, negate store and add\n| n\n| a - n\n|-\n| 36\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and clear store\n| n\n| zero\n|-\n| 37\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and subtract from store\n| n\n| n - a\n|}\n|}\n\n===Instruction Group 4===\n\nGroup 4 is conditional and unconditional jumps.

In accordance with the 803 convention, it is written with two instructions on each line, representing the contents of one word. The colon or slash between them represent a B digit value of zero or one respectively.\n<pre>\n 0:  26 4 : 06 0    Clear loc'n 4; Clear A\n 1:  22 4 / 16 3    Increment loc 4; Store A in loc'n (3 + content of loc'n 4) & clear A\n 2:  55 5 : 71 0    Left shift A 5 times; Read tape and \"or\" into A\n 3:  43 1 : 40 2    Jump to loc'n 1 if arith overflow; Jump to loc'n 2\n</pre>\nThere are several points to note in this very simple program:\n* There is no count. The inner loop (locations 2 and 3) packs 5-bit characters into the accumulator until overflow occurs. Thus a 39 bit word is formed of eight 5 bit characters. The most significant bit of the first character is discarded but must be a 1 (unless the next bit is a 1), in order to provoke arithmetic overflow (a change of the sign bit).\n* The first word read is stored into location 4, and this is then used as the address into which subsequent words are stored.\n* Blank leading and trailing tape is ignored since zeroes can be shifted left indefinitely without causing overflow.\n* There is no provision to terminate the outer loop (inner loop plus location 1). The tape can be stopped manually, or allowed to run out through the reader (since the blank trailer is ignored). More usually, Initial Instructions are used to read a more sophisticated secondary bootstrap (T23) into the top of store. After writing to the last store location (8191) the address is allowed to wrap round to 0. Writing zero to locations 0 \u2013 3 has no effect (since the contents of these locations are created by logic gates rather than being read from the core store), and a special value is then written to location 4. This value has 22 in the function code bits and the secondary bootstrap entry point minus 3 in the address bits. This means that the B digit has the effect of transforming the 16 (store) instruction in location 1 into a 40 (jump) instruction (16 + 22 = 40 in octal), and of adding 3 to the address bits. The net result is a jump to the entry point of the secondary bootstrap!\n\n(The data values for the wrapped-around locations 0 \u2013 3 must be zero since counter values 8192, 8193 etc. change the B-modified second half of location 1 from a 16 to a 17 instruction, which sets a to n - a instead of clearing it, as required by the inner loop.)\n\n===Interrupts===\n\nThe 803 has a little-known interrupt facility. Whilst it is not mentioned in the programming guide and is not used by any of the standard peripherals, the operation of the interrupt logic is described in the 803 hardware handbooks and the logic is shown in the 803 maintenance diagrams (Diagram 1:LB7 Gb).  Interrupts are probably used mostly in conjunction with custom interfaces provided as part of ARCH real time process control systems. Since all input and output instructions causes the 803 to become \"busy\" if input data is not available or if an output device has not completed a previous operation, interrupts are not needed and are not used for driving the standard peripherals.\n\nRaising the interrupt input to the computer causes a break in execution as follows: as soon as the machine is in a suitable state (in particular, when not \"busy\" and only in certain states of the fetch/execute cycle), the next instruction pair is fetched from store location 5, without changing the Sequence Control Register (SCR).  Location 5 is expected to contain a standard subroutine entry instruction pair (73 LINK : 40 N \u2013 see above), allowing the pre-interrupt execution address (still in the SCR) to be saved for later return. The external equipment raising the interrupt is relied upon to refrain from raising another interrupt until the first has been acknowledged by some suitable input/output instruction, so as to prevent interrupts from being nested. The Algol compiler does not regard location 5 as a reserved location, although this may have more to do with the unsuitability of Algol for process control applications than indicating that interrupts are never regarded as a mainstream facility.\n\n==Compilers==\nThe ''Initial Instructions'' described as the Example Program above is effectively a primary bootloader which is normally used to read a secondary bootloader known as ''T23'', prepended to all program tapes. T23 allows more flexible program loading facilities including sumchecking of the loaded code.\n\nMachine code programs are written in an octal/decimal representation exemplified in the Example Program above, and loaded by a rudimentary assembler known as the ''Translation Input Routine''. It has no symbolic addressing facilities, but instead allows the source to be broken into ''blocks'' which can be manually relocated to allow for the expansion or contraction of a previous block in development. There is also an [[Autocode]] for simple programming tasks, allowing faster program development without the need for a knowledge of machine code. This has no formula translation facilities and requires all calculations to be reduced to a series of assignments with no more than a single operator on the right hand side.\n\nThe 803B with 8192 words of memory is capable of running the Elliott [[ALGOL]] compiler,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ |title=Elliott 803 Algol |first=Bill |last=Purvis |date=2005-10-05}}</ref> a major subset of the Algol60 language, capable of loading and running several ALGOL programs in succession. This was largely written by [[C. A. R. Hoare|Tony Hoare]], employed by Elliotts as a programmer in August 1960.  Hoare recounts some of his experiences at Elliotts in his 1980 [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) [[Turing Award]] lecture.\n\nThe 803B at The National Museum of Computing is now working well enough to run this [[compiler]] again. There is a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxZ1i8pvZI short video] on YouTube of it compiling and running a simple program.\n\n== NCR involvement ==\n\nThe 803 was branded as the NCR-Elliott 803 when sold by NCR for commercial use. At this time, Elliott Automation were also making/assembling NCR 315's at Borehamwood.\n\n=== Do-it-yourself computing ===\n\nElliott 803's (and later Elliott 4100's) were used in NCR-Elliott's joint venture \"Computer Workshop\" computer bureau. The unique feature of this bureau was that they ran 3-day courses to teach their customers to write their own programmes, and these were often donated to a library of programmes that could be used. Customers would come to Borehamwood (and later Greenford) to operate the computers themselves \u2013 an early example of personal computing. Prices per hour were 8\u00a3 ({{Inflation|UK|8|1960|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from 9 am to 5 pm, 6\u00a3 ({{Inflation|UK|6|1960|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from 5 pm to midnight, and 4\u00a3 ({{Inflation|UK|4|1960|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}) from midnight to 9 am.{{Inflation/fn|UK|df=y}}\n\nThe most popular applications were in civil engineering and architecture, for structural analysis, cut and fill, survey correction, and bills of quantities.\n\n== Applications ==\nThe following were 803 users:<ref name=\"ourcomp\"/>\n* RMIT Melbourne utilised an Elliott 803 Computer for student use in 1966.\n* Brush Electrical Machines in Loughborough UK used an 803 for design calculation on power transformers and motors.\n* G.P.O. used an 803 at their Dollis Hill Research Labs for electronics design and telephone network simulations.\n* G.P.O. used an 803 at their Goonhiily Downs satellite earth station for calculating satellite passes and punching tapes to steer dishes.\n* Corah Knitware in Leicester UK used a pair of 803s for telephone order processing and production planning.\n* Thornber Farms in West Yorkshire UK used an 803 to process egg production data for breeding of chickens.<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=41973 Science and the Egg, Aka Chick Automation: Science Aids The Egg], Issue Date: 12/02/1962 \u2013 British Path\u00e9</ref>\n* Vickers da Costa, a London stockbroker, used an 803B for trade processing and payroll from 1961 to 1966 when it was replaced with a National Elliot 4300.\n* The RAF No1 Radio School RAF Locking used an 803 in 1968 to train the first RAF Computer Technician Apprentices.\n* The Medical Research Council Biophysics Research Unit at King's College London in Drury Lane used an 803 for detailed calculations to verify the structure of DNA and in early attempts to sequence RNA.<ref>Described in 'University of London King's College Biophysics Laboratories' (1964) HMSO pp 9-11.</ref>\n* United Steel's (later British Steel) [[Swinden House]] Laboratories  in Rotherham took delivery of an 803 in 1963.

They were used to teach Elliott Autocode as a primary language but also had an ALGOL compiler. The machines last ran in 1980 when they were replaced by a classroom full of BBC B's. The school also acquired the machine from Loughborough University for spares.\n* Felsted School once had two Elliott 803's, nowadays only the control console remains, it is hung up in the corner of one of the school's current IT rooms as a reminder to why the room is named \"Elliott\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://members.iinet.net.au/~humbert/thesis/chapter3/Chapter3.html |title=Practical Applications for School-based Intranets |last=Humbert |first=Pete}}</ref>\n* [[Haydon School]] had two Elliot 803B's with 8192 words of core until the early-1980s, one being used for spare parts. One of them came from the nearby Brunel University. Peripherals included two film handlers, two optical readers, two punches and a teleprinter for output, a hardware square-root unit and a drum plotter. It was used for running Algol, Autoode and a BASIC and Fortran compilers were available. It was installed in the early 1970s under the care of the Physics Department. At the time it was still [[St Nicholas Grammar School]] for boys.\n* [[Mill Hill School]] had an Elliott 803 with 8192 memory in the 1970s.

The short-lived 803A was built in 1959 and first delivered in 1960; the 803B was built in 1960 and first delivered in 1961.\n\nOver 200 Elliott 803 computers were delivered to customers, at a unit price of about \u00a329,000 in 1960<ref name=\"ourcomp\">[http://www.ourcomputerheritage.org/ccs-e3x1.pdf Version 3, November 2011  E3X1, Delivery lists and applications of the Elliott 800 series and 503 computers.]</ref> (roughly {{Inflation|UK|29000|1960|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}{{Inflation/fn|UK|df=y}}).

Circuitry is based on [[printed circuit boards]] with the circuits being rather simple and most of the signalling carried on wires.  There is a second cabinet about half the size used for the power supply, which is unusually based on a large [[nickel\u2013cadmium battery]] with charger, an early form of [[uninterruptible power supply]]. A third cabinet (the same size as the power cabinet) holds the extra working store on machines with 8192 word stores.

At the time this was in use by the film industry to record sound tracks.  Elliott's factory at Borehamwood was close to the Elstree film studios which explains the use of the 35mm sprocketed media. The 1000 foot reels held 4096 blocks of 64 words per block (4096 x 64 x 39 = 10,223,616 bits, or the equivalent of about 1.27Mbytes).\n\nAnother unusual feature is the use of magnetic cores not only for memory but also as logic gates. These logic cores have 1, 2 or 3 input windings, a trigger (read) and an output winding.  Depending on their polarity, current pulses in the input windings either magnetise the core or cancel each other out. The magnetised state of the core indicates the result of a boolean logic function. [[two-phase clock|Two clock phases]] designated alpha and beta are used to trigger (reset to zero) alternate cores. A change from a one to a zero produces a pulse on the output winding. Cores which receive alpha trigger pulses (alpha cores) have inputs fed from gates which are triggered on the beta phase (beta cores). Transistors were expensive at the time and each logic gate requires only one to amplify the output winding pulse; however a single transistor drives the inputs of a small number of (typically 3) other cores. If more than 3 inputs are to be driven, up to two more transistors can be driven by each core.\n\n==Instruction set==\n\nInstructions and data are based on a 39-bit word length with binary representation in [[Two's complement|2's complement]] arithmetic. The [[instruction set]] operates on a single address and single accumulator register, with an additional auxiliary register for double length integer multiply and divide. Although it is believed that the single length divide and square root instructions were only enabled in 803s destined for process control applications, the one remaining operational 803B has been found to have these instructions enabled, probably because it was used by a software house to develop real time and  process control applications.  An instruction is composed of a 6-bit instruction (conventionally represented in [[octal]]) and a 13 bit address. This gives 64 instructions organised as 8 groups of 8 instructions. The 13-bit memory address field gives an addressable range of 8192 words. These 19-bit instructions are packed two to a word with an additional 39th bit between them, the so-called B-line or B digit (the term is a legacy from the [[Ferranti Mark 1]] computer, where the A-line represented the accumulator and the B-line an instruction modifier, both displayed on a [[Williams tube]]). Setting the B digit has the effect of adding the contents of the memory address of the first instruction to the second instruction at execution time, enabling indirect addressing and other run-time instruction modifications. The bit time is 6 microseconds, jumps execute in 288 microseconds and simple arithmetic instructions in 576 microseconds. Floating point operations take several milliseconds.  IO is direct and there are no interrupts.\n\nIn the following descriptions, A and N represent the accumulator and the literal address, a and n represent the (initial) contents of the accumulator and addressed store location, and a' and n' the resultant contents.\n\n===Instruction Groups 0 \u2013 3===\n\nThese are fixed point arithmetic with 4 different combinations of operand and result destination:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Groups 0 \u2013 3\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| '''Fn'''\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| '''Operation'''\n|width=\"50\"| '''a''''\n|width=\"50\"| '''n''''\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 00\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Do nothing\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 01\n|align=\"left\"| Negate\n| -a\n| n\n|-\n| 02\n|align=\"left\"| Replace & count\n| n + 1\n| n\n|-\n| 03\n|align=\"left\"| Collate\n| a & n\n| n\n|-\n| 04\n|align=\"left\"| Add\n| a + n\n| n\n|-\n| 05\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract\n| a - n\n| n\n|-\n| 06\n|align=\"left\"| Clear\n| zero\n| n\n|-\n| 07\n|align=\"left\"| Negate & add\n| n - a\n| n\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 10\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Exchange\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 11\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and negate\n| -n\n| a\n|-\n| 12\n|align=\"left\"| Exchange and count\n| n + 1\n| a\n|-\n| 13\n|align=\"left\"| Write and collate\n| a & n\n| a\n|-\n| 14\n|align=\"left\"| Write and add\n| a + n\n| a\n|-\n| 15\n|align=\"left\"| Write and subtract\n| a - n\n| a\n|-\n| 16\n|align=\"left\"| Write and clear\n| zero\n| a\n|-\n| 17\n|align=\"left\"| Write, negate and add\n| n - a\n| a\n|}\n|-\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 20\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Write\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|width=\"50\"| a\n|-\n| 21\n|align=\"left\"| Write negatively\n| a\n| -a\n|-\n| 22\n|align=\"left\"| Count in store\n| a\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 23\n|align=\"left\"| Collate in store\n| a\n| a & n\n|-\n| 24\n|align=\"left\"| Add into store\n| a\n| a + n\n|-\n| 25\n|align=\"left\"| Negate store and add\n| a\n| a - n\n|-\n| 26\n|align=\"left\"| Clear store\n| a\n| zero\n|-\n| 27\n|align=\"left\"| Subtract from store\n| a\n| n - a\n|}\n|\n{| style=\"text-align: center; width: 100%\" cellspacing=\"2\" cellpadding=\"2\"\n|-\n|width=\"30\"| 30\n|width=\"auto\" align=\"left\"| Replace\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|width=\"50\"| n\n|-\n| 31\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and negate store\n| n\n| -n\n|-\n| 32\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and count in store\n| n\n| n + 1\n|-\n| 33\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and collate in store\n| n\n| a & n\n|-\n| 34\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and add to store\n| n\n| a + n\n|-\n| 35\n|align=\"left\"| Replace, negate store and add\n| n\n| a - n\n|-\n| 36\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and clear store\n| n\n| zero\n|-\n| 37\n|align=\"left\"| Replace and subtract from store\n| n\n| n - a\n|}\n|}\n\n===Instruction Group 4===\n\nGroup 4 is conditional and unconditional jumps.

In accordance with the 803 convention, it is written with two instructions on each line, representing the contents of one word. The colon or slash between them represent a B digit value of zero or one respectively.\n<pre>\n 0:  26 4 : 06 0    Clear loc'n 4; Clear A\n 1:  22 4 / 16 3    Increment loc 4; Store A in loc'n (3 + content of loc'n 4) & clear A\n 2:  55 5 : 71 0    Left shift A 5 times; Read tape and \"or\" into A\n 3:  43 1 : 40 2    Jump to loc'n 1 if arith overflow; Jump to loc'n 2\n</pre>\nThere are several points to note in this very simple program:\n* There is no count. The inner loop (locations 2 and 3) packs 5-bit characters into the accumulator until overflow occurs. Thus a 39 bit word is formed of eight 5 bit characters. The most significant bit of the first character is discarded but must be a 1 (unless the next bit is a 1), in order to provoke arithmetic overflow (a change of the sign bit).\n* The first word read is stored into location 4, and this is then used as the address into which subsequent words are stored.\n* Blank leading and trailing tape is ignored since zeroes can be shifted left indefinitely without causing overflow.\n* There is no provision to terminate the outer loop (inner loop plus location 1). The tape can be stopped manually, or allowed to run out through the reader (since the blank trailer is ignored). More usually, Initial Instructions are used to read a more sophisticated secondary bootstrap (T23) into the top of store. After writing to the last store location (8191) the address is allowed to wrap round to 0. Writing zero to locations 0 \u2013 3 has no effect (since the contents of these locations are created by logic gates rather than being read from the core store), and a special value is then written to location 4. This value has 22 in the function code bits and the secondary bootstrap entry point minus 3 in the address bits. This means that the B digit has the effect of transforming the 16 (store) instruction in location 1 into a 40 (jump) instruction (16 + 22 = 40 in octal), and of adding 3 to the address bits. The net result is a jump to the entry point of the secondary bootstrap!\n\n(The data values for the wrapped-around locations 0 \u2013 3 must be zero since counter values 8192, 8193 etc. change the B-modified second half of location 1 from a 16 to a 17 instruction, which sets a to n - a instead of clearing it, as required by the inner loop.)\n\n===Interrupts===\n\nThe 803 has a little-known interrupt facility. Whilst it is not mentioned in the programming guide and is not used by any of the standard peripherals, the operation of the interrupt logic is described in the 803 hardware handbooks and the logic is shown in the 803 maintenance diagrams (Diagram 1:LB7 Gb).  Interrupts are probably used mostly in conjunction with custom interfaces provided as part of ARCH real time process control systems. Since all input and output instructions causes the 803 to become \"busy\" if input data is not available or if an output device has not completed a previous operation, interrupts are not needed and are not used for driving the standard peripherals.\n\nRaising the interrupt input to the computer causes a break in execution as follows: as soon as the machine is in a suitable state (in particular, when not \"busy\" and only in certain states of the fetch/execute cycle), the next instruction pair is fetched from store location 5, without changing the Sequence Control Register (SCR).  Location 5 is expected to contain a standard subroutine entry instruction pair (73 LINK : 40 N \u2013 see above), allowing the pre-interrupt execution address (still in the SCR) to be saved for later return. The external equipment raising the interrupt is relied upon to refrain from raising another interrupt until the first has been acknowledged by some suitable input/output instruction, so as to prevent interrupts from being nested. The Algol compiler does not regard location 5 as a reserved location, although this may have more to do with the unsuitability of Algol for process control applications than indicating that interrupts are never regarded as a mainstream facility.\n\n==Compilers==\nThe ''Initial Instructions'' described as the Example Program above is effectively a primary bootloader which is normally used to read a secondary bootloader known as ''T23'', prepended to all program tapes. T23 allows more flexible program loading facilities including sumchecking of the loaded code.\n\nMachine code programs are written in an octal/decimal representation exemplified in the Example Program above, and loaded by a rudimentary assembler known as the ''Translation Input Routine''. It has no symbolic addressing facilities, but instead allows the source to be broken into ''blocks'' which can be manually relocated to allow for the expansion or contraction of a previous block in development. There is also an [[Autocode]] for simple programming tasks, allowing faster program development without the need for a knowledge of machine code. This has no formula translation facilities and requires all calculations to be reduced to a series of assignments with no more than a single operator on the right hand side.\n\nThe 803B with 8192 words of memory is capable of running the Elliott [[ALGOL]] compiler,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.billp.org/ccs/A104/ |title=Elliott 803 Algol |first=Bill |last=Purvis |date=2005-10-05}}</ref> a major subset of the Algol60 language, capable of loading and running several ALGOL programs in succession. This was largely written by [[C. A. R. Hoare|Tony Hoare]], employed by Elliotts as a programmer in August 1960.  Hoare recounts some of his experiences at Elliotts in his 1980 [[Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) [[Turing Award]] lecture.\n\nThe 803B at The National Museum of Computing is now working well enough to run this [[compiler]] again. There is a [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIxZ1i8pvZI short video] on YouTube of it compiling and running a simple program.\n\n== NCR involvement ==\n\nThe 803 was branded as the NCR-Elliott 803 when sold by NCR for commercial use.

Customers would come to Borehamwood (and later Greenford) to operate the computers themselves \u2013 an early example of personal computing.
