Thus Mahatma Gandhi started spinning himself and encouraging others to do so. He made it obligatory for all members of the Indian National Congress to spin cotton themselves and to pay their dues in yarn. He further made the chakri ([[spinning wheel]]) the symbol of the Nationalist movement. Initially the [[Indian flag]] was supposed to have a chakri, not the [[Ashoka Chakra]] at its centre. Mahatma Gandhi collected large sums of money to create a grass-roots organisation to encourage handloom weaving.

Thus Mahatma Gandhi started spinning himself and encouraging others to do so. He made it obligatory for all members of the Indian National Congress to spin cotton themselves and to pay their dues in yarn. He further made the chakri ([[spinning wheel]]) the symbol of the Nationalist movement. Initially the [[Indian flag]] was supposed to have a chakri, not the [[Ashoka Chakra]] at its centre. Mahatma Gandhi collected large sums of money to create a grass-roots organisation to encourage handloom weaving.

On this date, {{convert|100|t}} of supplies were airlifted to a promising spot on Ellesmere Island, and five prefabricated [[Jamesway hut]]s were constructed. Regular weather observations began on January 1, 1948. The station has expanded over the years. At its peak, in the 1970s, at least fifteen staff were on site; in 2005, it reported a permanent population of zero with at least 8 staff on a continuous rotational basis.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSeveral generations of buildings have been developed. The latest operations centre, with work areas and staff quarters in one large structure, was completed in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Climate==\nEureka experiences a [[polar climate]] (''ET''). The settlement sees the [[midnight sun]] between April 10 and August 29, with no sunlight at all between mid-October and late February. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and least precipitation of any weather station in Canada with an annual mean temperature of {{convert|-18.8|\u00b0C}}. However, summers are slightly warmer than other places in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic]] because Eureka is somewhat landlocked, being near the centre of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Even so, since record keeping began, the temperature has never exceeded {{convert|20.9|\u00b0C}}, first reached on July 14, 2009.<ref name=\"Eureka A\"/> Although a polar desert, evaporation is also very low, which allows the limited moisture to be made available for plants and wildlife.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Eureka, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes

diesel generators. The station is supplied once every six weeks with fresh food and mail by air, and annually in the late summer, a supply ship from [[Montreal]] brings heavy supplies. On July 3, 2009, a Danish [[Challenger 604 MMA]] jet landed at Eureka's aerodrome.<ref name=CasrChallengerDane>\n{{cite news\n |url         = http://www.casr.ca/id-arcticviking-challenger.htm\n |title       = Update: Denmark's Arctic Assets and Canada's Response \u2014 Danish Air Force Aircraft on a Mission over Canada's High Arctic\n |date        = July 2009\n |publisher   = [[Canadian American Strategic Review]]\n |accessdate  = 2009-07-12\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090709185835/http://www.casr.ca/id-arcticviking-challenger.htm\n |archivedate = 2009-07-09\n}}</ref>\nThe jet is a military observation aircraft based on the [[Challenger executive jet]]. This jet visited Eureka on a familiarization trip, in order to prepare for the possibility of Danish aircraft assisting in [[Search and Rescue]] missions over Canadian territory. The ''[[Canadian American Strategic Review]]'' noted critically that the first jet to fly a mission to Eureka was not Canadian.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nAt Eureka's latitude, a [[geosynchronous]] [[communications satellite]], if due south, would require an [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] to be pointed nearly horizontally; satellites farther east or west along that orbit would be below the horizon. Telephone access and television broadcasts arrived in 1982 when [[Operation Hurricane (Canada)|Operation Hurricane]] resulted in the establishment of a satellite receiving station at nearby Skull Point, which has an open view to the south. The low power Channel 9 TV transmitter at Skull Point was the world's most northern TV station at the time. In the 1980s, TV audio was often connected to the telephone to feed CBC-TV news to [[CHAR-FM]] in isolated [[Alert, Nunavut|Alert]]. More recently, CANDAC has installed what is likely the world's most northerly geosynchronous satellite ground-station to provide Internet-based communications to PEARL.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nOther settlements on Ellesmere Island include Alert and [[Grise Fiord, Nunavut|Grise Fiord]].\n\n==Flora and fauna==\nEureka has been described as \"The Garden Spot of the Arctic\" due to the flora and fauna abundant around the Eureka area, more so than anywhere else in the High Arctic. Fauna include [[musk ox]]en, [[Arctic Wolf|Arctic wolves]], [[Arctic fox]]es, [[Arctic hare]]s, and [[lemming]]s. In addition, summer nesting geese, ducks, owls, loons, ravens, gulls and many other smaller birds nest, raise their young, and return south in August.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n==See also==\n*[[List of research stations in the Arctic]]\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Couture, Nicole J.

On this date, {{convert|100|t}} of supplies were airlifted to a promising spot on Ellesmere Island, and five prefabricated [[Jamesway hut]]s were constructed. Regular weather observations began on January 1, 1948. The station has expanded over the years. At its peak, in the 1970s, at least fifteen staff were on site; in 2005, it reported a permanent population of zero with at least 8 staff on a continuous rotational basis.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\nSeveral generations of buildings have been developed. The latest operations centre, with work areas and staff quarters in one large structure, was completed in 2005.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==Climate==\nEureka experiences a [[polar climate]] (''ET''). The settlement sees the [[midnight sun]] between April 10 and August 29, with no sunlight at all between mid-October and late February. Eureka has the lowest average annual temperature and least precipitation of any weather station in Canada with an annual mean temperature of {{convert|-18.8|\u00b0C}}. However, summers are slightly warmer than other places in the [[Canadian Arctic Archipelago|Canadian Arctic]] because Eureka is somewhat landlocked, being near the centre of [[Ellesmere Island]]. Even so, since record keeping began, the temperature has never exceeded {{convert|20.9|\u00b0C}}, first reached on July 14, 2009.<ref name=\"Eureka A\"/> Although a polar desert, evaporation is also very low, which allows the limited moisture to be made available for plants and wildlife.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Eureka, 1981\u20132010 normals, extremes

Unlike [[welding]], soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In [[brazing]], the work piece metal also does not melt, but the filler metal is one that melts at a higher temperature than in soldering.

Small mechanical parts are often soldered or brazed as well. Soldering is also used to join lead [[came]] and [[Came glasswork|copper foil]] in [[Came glasswork|stained glass]] work.\n\nElectronic soldering connects [[electrical wiring]] and [[electronic component]]s to [[printed circuit board]]s  by utilizing a metallic alloy substance called [[solder]]. This special alloy is melted by using a soldering iron, a wave bath, or a specialized oven, as it joins conductors to PCBs, terminals, and wires.\n\nMusical instruments, especially brass and woodwind instruments, use a combination of soldering and brazing in their assembly. Brass bodies are often soldered together, while keywork and braces are most often brazed.\n\n== Solders ==\n{{main|Solder}}\n\nSoldering filler materials are available in many different [[alloy]]s for differing applications. In electronics assembly, the [[eutectic]] alloy with 63% tin and 37% lead (or 60/40, which is almost identical in melting point) has been the alloy of choice. Other alloys are used for plumbing, mechanical assembly, and other applications. Some examples of soft-solder are tin-lead for general purposes, tin-zinc for joining [[aluminium]], lead-silver for strength at higher than room temperature, cadmium-silver for strength at high temperatures, zinc-aluminium for aluminium and corrosion resistance, and tin-silver and tin-bismuth for electronics.\n\nA eutectic formulation has advantages when applied to soldering: the [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures are the same, so there is no plastic phase, and it has the lowest possible melting point. Having the lowest possible melting point minimizes heat stress on electronic components during soldering. And, having no plastic phase allows for quicker wetting as the solder heats up, and quicker setup as the solder cools. A non-eutectic formulation must remain still as the temperature drops through the liquidus and solidus temperatures. Any movement during the plastic phase may result in cracks, resulting in an unreliable joint.\n\nCommon [[Solder#Solder alloys|'''solder formulations''']] based on tin and lead are listed below. The fraction represent percentage of tin first, then lead, totaling 100%:\n\n* 63/37: melts at {{convert|183|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} (eutectic: the only mixture that melts at a ''point'', instead of over a range)\n* 60/40: melts between {{convert|183|\u2013|190|C|F}}\n* 50/50: melts between {{convert|183|\u2013|215|C|F}}\n\nFor environmental reasons (and the introduction of regulations such as the European RoHS ([[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]])), lead-free solders are becoming more widely used. They are also suggested anywhere young children may come into contact with (since young children are likely to place things into their mouths), or for outdoor use where rain and other precipitation may wash the lead into the groundwater. Unfortunately, most lead-free solders are not eutectic formulations, melting at around {{convert|250|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, making it more difficult to create reliable joints with them.\n\nOther common solders include low-temperature formulations (often containing [[bismuth]]), which are often used to join previously-soldered assemblies without unsoldering earlier connections, and high-temperature formulations (usually containing [[silver]]) which are used for high-temperature operation or for first assembly of items which must not become unsoldered during subsequent operations. Alloying silver with other metals changes the melting point, adhesion and wetting characteristics, and tensile strength. Of all the brazing alloys, silver solders have the greatest strength and the broadest applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinmantech.com/html/faq_brazing_versus_soldering.php|title=Brazing versus Soldering|first=Kent|last=White|website=TM Technologies, Tools & Methods for Better Metalworking|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623150638/http://www.tinmantech.com/html/faq_brazing_versus_soldering.php|archivedate=23 June 2017}}</ref> Specialty alloys are available with properties such as higher strength, the ability to solder aluminum, better electrical conductivity, and higher corrosion resistance.<ref name=\"Solder Product List\">{{cite web|last=Kapp Alloy & Wire, Inc|title=Products|url=http://www.kappalloy.com/products-solder.php|publisher=Kapp Alloy & Wire, Inc|accessdate=5 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716145255/http://kappalloy.com/products-solder.php|archivedate=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Flux==\n{{main|Flux (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe purpose of [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] is to facilitate the soldering process. One of the obstacles to a successful solder joint is an impurity at the site of the joint, for example, dirt, oil or [[oxidation]]. The impurities can be removed by mechanical cleaning or by chemical means, but the elevated temperatures required to melt the filler metal (the solder) encourages the work piece (and the solder) to re-oxidize. This effect is accelerated as the soldering temperatures increase and can completely prevent the solder from joining to the workpiece. One of the earliest forms of flux was [[charcoal]], which acts as a [[reducing agent]] and helps prevent oxidation during the soldering process. Some fluxes go beyond the simple prevention of oxidation and also provide some form of chemical cleaning (corrosion). Many fluxes also act as a [[wetting agent]] in the soldering process,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indium.com/products/solderfabrications/fluxes.php|title=Flux and epoxy products made by Indium Corporation|first=Quadsimia Internet Solutions -|last=http://www.quadsimia.com/|website=Indium Corporation|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820130704/http://www.indium.com/products/solderfabrications/fluxes.php|archivedate=20 August 2012}}</ref> reducing the [[surface tension]] of the molten solder and causing it to flow and wet the workpieces more easily.\n\nFor many years, the most common type of flux used in electronics (soft soldering) was [[rosin]]-based, using the rosin from selected [[pine tree]]s. It was nearly ideal in that it was non-corrosive and non-conductive at normal temperatures but became mildly reactive (corrosive) at elevated soldering temperatures. Plumbing and automotive applications, among others, typically use an acid-based ([[hydrochloric acid]]) flux which provides rather aggressive cleaning of the joint. These fluxes cannot be used in electronics because their residues are conductive leading to unintended electrical connections, and because they will eventually dissolve small diameter wires. [[Citric acid]] is an excellent water-soluble acid-type flux for copper and electronics <ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a295042.pdf |title=An Investigation of the Chemistry of Citric Acid in Military Soldering Applications  |date=1995-06-19}}</ref> but must be washed off afterwards.\n\nFluxes for soft solder are currently available in three basic formulations:\n* Water-soluble fluxes \u2013 higher activity fluxes which should be removed with water after soldering (no [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]]s required for removal).\n* No-clean fluxes \u2013 mild enough to not \"require\" removal due to their non-conductive and non-corrosive residues.<ref name=\"indiumcorporation\"/> These fluxes are called \"no-clean\" because the residue left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause electrical shorts; nevertheless they leave a plainly visible white residue that resembles diluted bird-droppings. No-clean flux residue is acceptable on all 3 classes of PCBs as defined by IPC-610 provided it does not inhibit visual inspection, access to test points, or have a wet, tacky or excessive residue that may spread onto other areas. Connector mating surfaces must also be free of flux residue.  Fingerprints in no-clean residue are a class 3 defect<ref>IPC-A-610 revision E section 10.6.4</ref>\n* Traditional [[rosin]] fluxes \u2013 available in non-activated (R), mildly activated (RMA) and activated (RA) formulations. RA and RMA fluxes contain rosin combined with an activating agent, typically an acid, which increases the wettability of metals to which it is applied by removing existing oxides. The residue resulting from the use of RA flux is [[corrosive]] and must be cleaned. RMA flux is formulated to result in a residue which is less corrosive, so that cleaning becomes optional, though usually preferred.  R flux is still less active and even less corrosive.\n\nFlux performance must be carefully evaluated for best results; a very mild 'no-clean' flux might be perfectly acceptable for production equipment, but not give adequate performance for more variable hand-soldering operations.\n\n==Processes==\n[[File:Brazing and soldering processes - AWS A3.0 2001.svg|thumb|right|300px|Brazing and soldering processes [[classification chart]]<ref>AWS A3.0:2001, Standard Welding Terms and Definitions Including Terms for Adhesive Bonding, Brazing, Soldering, Thermal Cutting, and Thermal Spraying, American Welding Society (2001), p. 118. {{ISBN|0-87171-624-0}}</ref>]]\nThere are three forms of soldering, each requiring progressively higher temperatures and producing an increasingly stronger joint strength:\n# soft soldering, which originally used a tin-lead [[alloy]] as the filler metal\n# silver soldering, which uses an alloy containing [[silver]]\n# [[brazing]] which uses a [[brass]] alloy for the filler\n\nThe alloy of the filler metal for each type of soldering can be adjusted to modify the melting temperature of the filler.

Soft solder filler metals are typically alloys (often containing [[lead]]) that have [[liquidus]] temperatures below {{convert|350|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn this soldering process, heat is applied to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in a surface alloying process called [[wetting]]. In stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire between the strands by [[capillary action]] in a process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces are very close together or touching. The joint's [[tensile strength]] is dependent on the filler metal used;  in electrical soldering little tensile strength comes from the added solder which is why it is advised that wires be twisted or folded together before soldering to provide some mechanical strength for a joint.  A good solder joint produces an electrically-conductive, water- and gas-tight join.\n\nEach type of solder offers advantages and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called because of the soft lead that is its primary ingredient. Soft soldering uses the lowest temperatures (and so thermally stresses components the least) but does not make a strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it loses strength, and eventually melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering. Brazing provides the strongest of the non-welded joints but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc.\n\nSoldering operations can be performed with hand tools, one joint at a time, or ''en masse'' on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a [[soldering iron]], [[soldering gun]], or a torch, or occasionally a [[hot-air pencil]]. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with \"soldering coppers\" directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in the mass of the soldering copper to complete a joint; gas torches (e.g. butane or propane) or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used and the application, cleaning of the joint may be required after it has cooled.\n\nEach solder alloy has characteristics that work best for certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term ''silver solder'' denotes the type of solder that is used. Some soft solders are \"silver-bearing\" alloys used to solder silver-plated items. Lead-based solders should not be used on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.\n\n===Soldering and brazing===\nThe distinction between soldering and brazing is based on the melting temperature of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450&nbsp;\u00b0C is usually used as a practical demarcation between soldering and brazing. Soft soldering can be done with a heated iron whereas the other methods typically require a higher temperature torch or a furnace to melt the filler metal.\n\nDifferent equipment is usually required since a [[soldering iron]] cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).\n\nSince the joint is produced using a metal with a lower melting temperature than the workpiece, the joint will weaken as the ambient temperature approaches the melting point of the filler metal. For that reason, the higher temperature processes produce joints which are effective at higher temperatures. Brazed connections can be as strong or nearly as strong as the parts they connect,<ref name=Bellman-MelcorInc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellmanmelcor.com/brazing_tips1.htm|title=Brazing tips|website=bellmanmelcor.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324144002/http://www.bellmanmelcor.com/brazing_tips1.htm|archivedate=24 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=WallColmonoy>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallcolmonoy.com/TechServices/NicrobrazNewsArchives/WCC_Article_Joint_Strength.htm|title=Technical Resource Center - Wall Colmonoy|website=wallcolmonoy.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425003941/http://www.wallcolmonoy.com/TechServices/NicrobrazNewsArchives/WCC_Article_Joint_Strength.htm|archivedate=25 April 2010}}</ref> even at elevated temperatures.<ref name=Colbus>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03215037 Properties of gold-nickel alloy brazed joints in high temperature materials], in ''Gold Bulletin'', June 1974, Volume 7, Issue 2, pp 42\u201349; by     Jakob Colbus and Karl Friedrich Zimmermann; https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03215037</ref>\n\n===Silver soldering===\n\"Hard soldering\" or \"silver soldering\" is used to join precious and semi-precious metals such as gold, silver, brass, and copper. The solder is usually described as easy, medium, or hard in reference to its melting temperature, not the strength of the joint. Extra-easy solder contains 56% silver and has a melting point of {{convert|1145|F|order=flip}}. Extra-hard solder has 80% silver and melts at {{convert|1370|F|order=flip}}. If multiple joints are needed, then the jeweler will start with hard or extra-hard solder and switch to lower-temperature solders for later joints.\n\nSilver solder is somewhat absorbed by the surrounding metal, resulting in a joint that is actually stronger than the metal being joined. The metal being joined must be perfectly flush, as silver solder cannot normally be used as a filler and will not fill gaps.\n\nAnother difference between brazing and soldering is how the solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated. With silver soldering, small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of boric acid and denatured alcohol, is used to keep the metal and solder clean and to prevent the solder from moving before it melts.\n\nWhen silver solder melts, it tends to flow towards the area of greatest heat. Jewelers can somewhat control the direction the solder moves by leading it with a torch; it will even sometimes run straight up along a seam.\n\n===Induction soldering===\nInduction soldering uses [[induction heating]] by high-frequency [[alternating current]] in a surrounding copper coil. This induces currents in the part being soldered, which generates heat because of the higher resistance of a joint versus its surrounding metal ([[resistive heating]]). These copper coils can be shaped to fit the joint more precisely. A filler metal (solder) is placed between the facing surfaces, and this solder melts at a fairly low temperature. Fluxes are commonly used in induction soldering. This technique is particularly suited to continuously soldering, in which case these coils wrap around a cylinder or a pipe that needs to be soldered.\n\nSome metals are easier to solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy. Iron, [[mild steel]] and [[nickel]] are next in difficulty. Because of their thin, strong oxide films, [[stainless steel]] and some aluminium alloys are even more difficult to solder. [[Titanium]], [[magnesium]], [[cast iron]]s, some high-carbon [[steel]]s, [[ceramic]]s, and [[graphite]] can be soldered but it involves a process similar to joining carbides: they are first plated with a suitable metallic element that induces interfacial bonding.\n\n==={{anchor|REBALLING|Cold joint}}Electronic components (PCBs)===\n[[File:Soldering a 0805.jpg|thumb|right|Desoldering of an SMD capacitor]]\n[[File:Ersin Multicore Solder Tube.jpg|thumb|right|A tube of multicore electronics solder used for manual soldering]]\n[[File:Cold solder joint2.jpg|thumb|An improperly soldered 'cold' joint]]\n[[File:Gebrochene loetstellen.jpg|thumb|Broken solder joints on a [[circuit board]]]]\n\nCurrently, mass-production printed circuit boards (PCBs) are mostly [[wave soldering|wave soldered]] or [[reflow soldering|reflow soldered]], though hand soldering of production electronics is also still widely used.\n\nIn wave soldering, components are prepped (trimmed or modified) and installed on the PCB. Sometimes, to prevent movement they are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive or secured with a fixture, then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a bulk container.  This solder flow is forced to produce a standing wave so the whole PCB is not submerged in solder, but rather just touched. The end result is that solder stays on pins and pads, but not on the PCB itself.\n\nReflow soldering is a process in which a [[solder paste]] (a mixture of prealloyed solder powder and a flux-vehicle that has a peanut butter-like consistency<ref name=\"indiumcorporation\"/>) is used to stick the components to their attachment pads, after which the assembly is heated by an infrared lamp, a hot air pencil, or, more commonly, by passing it through a carefully controlled oven.\n\nSince different components can be best assembled by different techniques, it is common to use two or more processes for a given PCB. For example, [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted]] parts may be reflow soldered first, with a wave soldering process for the [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] mounted components coming next, and bulkier parts hand-soldered last.\n\n====Hand soldering====\nFor hand soldering,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@soldertools.net/hand-soldering-1673ad20e3d2|title=Hand Soldering|last=Jones|first=Mike|date=2018-02-07|website=Mike Jones|access-date=2018-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709094531/https://medium.com/@soldertools.net/hand-soldering-1673ad20e3d2|archive-date=2018-07-09}}</ref> the heat source tool should be selected to provide adequate heat for the size of joint to be completed. A 100-watt soldering iron may provide too much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25-watt iron will not provide enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or under powered can also cause heat damage, perhaps even detaching PCB traces from the substrate.\n\nHand-soldering techniques require a great deal of skill for the fine-pitch soldering of surface mount [[integrated circuit|chip]] packages. In particular [[ball grid array|ball grid array (BGA)]] devices are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to rework by hand.\n\nFor attachment of electronic components to a PCB, proper selection and use of flux helps prevent oxidation during soldering;  it is essential for good wetting and heat transfer. The soldering iron tip must be clean and pre-tinned with solder to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating. After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off, leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal mounting clips or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and reduce joint stresses.\n\nA heat sink may be used on the leads of heat sensitive components to reduce heat transfer to the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts. The heat sink will mean the use of more heat to complete the joint, since heat taken up by the heat sink will not heat the work pieces. If all metal surfaces have not been properly cleaned (\"fluxed\") or brought entirely above the melting temperature of the solder used, the result will be an unreliable (\"cold solder\") joint, even though its appearance may suggest otherwise.\n\nTo simplify soldering, beginners are usually advised to apply the soldering iron and the solder separately to the joint, rather than the solder being applied directly to the iron. When sufficient solder is applied, the solder wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the solder will flow around the workpieces. The iron is then removed from the joint.\n\n====Soldering defects====\nSince non-eutectic solder alloys have a small plastic range, the joint must not be moved until the solder has cooled down through both the liquidus and solidus temperatures. When visually inspected, a good solder joint will appear smooth and shiny, with the outline of the soldered wire clearly visible. A matte gray surface is a good indicator of a joint that was moved during soldering.  The boundary between the solder and the workpiece in a good joint will have a low angle.\n\nOther solder defects can be detected visually as well. Cold solder joints are dull and sometimes cracked or pock-marked. Too little solder will result in a \"dry\" and unreliable joint; too much solder (the familiar 'solder blob' to beginners) is not necessarily unsound, but tends to mean poor wetting. With some fluxes, flux residue remaining on the joint may need to be removed, using water, alcohol or other solvents compatible with the parts involved.\n\nExcess solder and unconsumed flux and residue is sometimes wiped from the soldering iron tip between joints. The tip of the bit (commonly iron plated to reduce erosion) is kept wetted with solder (\"tinned\") when hot to assist soldering, and to minimize oxidation and corrosion of the tip itself.\n\n====Hot-bar reflow====\n''Hot-bar reflow'' is a selective soldering process where two pre-fluxed, solder coated parts are heated with heating element (called a thermode) to a sufficient temperature to melt the solder.\n\nPressure is applied through the whole process (usually 15 seconds) to ensure that components stay in place during cooling. The heating element is heated and cooled for each connection. Up to 4000 [[Watt|W]] can be used in the heating element allowing fast soldering, good results with connections requiring high energy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unitek Eapro: Electronic Assembly Products|url=http://www.unitekeapro.com/pages.php?id=85|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506083947/http://www.unitekeapro.com/pages.php?id=85 |archivedate = 2008-05-06}}</ref>\n\n====Laser====\n''Laser soldering'' is a technique where a 30\u201350&nbsp;[[Watt|W]] [[laser]] is used to melt and solder an electrical connection joint.

Process recipes will differ depending on the [[alloy]] composition. For soldering 44-pin chip carriers to a board using soldering preforms, power levels were on the order of 10 watts and solder times approximately 1 second. Low power levels can lead to incomplete wetting and the formation of voids, both of which can weaken the joint.\n\n====Environmental regulation and RoHS====\nEnvironmental legislation in many countries, and the whole of the [[European Community]] area (see [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]]), has led to a change in formulation of both solders and fluxes. Water-soluble non-rosin-based fluxes have been increasingly used since the 1980s so that soldered boards can be cleaned with water or water-based cleaners. This eliminates hazardous solvents from the production environment, and from factory effluents.  Those regulations have also reduced the use of lead based solders, and caused the melting temperatures of solders in use to increase by up to {{convert|100|F-change|-1|order=flip}}.\n\n===Fiber focus infrared soldering===\nFiber focus infrared soldering is technique where many [[infrared]] sources are led through [[optical fiber|fibers]], then focused onto a single spot at which the connection is soldered.<ref name=\"nofiss\">{{cite web|title=NovaBrite RGB Full Color High Power LED Application Note|url=http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324142456/http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}} 070927 vincenc.com.tw (mentioned as a technique)</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Pipe soldering===<!-- [[Sweat fitting]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Fitting1537.JPG|thumb|210px|Soldered copper pipes]]\n[[File:Weichlot.jpg|thumb|210px|Solder]]\n[[File:LeadFree CadmiumFree solder.jpg|thumb|210px|Lead-free solder]]\nCopper pipe, or 'tube', is commonly joined by soldering. When applied in a plumbing trade context in the United  States, soldering is often referred to as ''sweating'', and a tubing connection so made is referred to as a ''sweated joint''.\n\nCopper tubing conducts heat away much faster than a conventional hand-held soldering iron or gun can provide, so a [[propane torch]] is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a [[MAPP gas|MAPP]]-fueled, [[acetylene]]-fueled, or [[propylene]]-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature is much higher than the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable ''swirl tips'' is employed to deliver the needed heating power. In the hands of a skilled [[tradesman]], the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour without damage to copper tempering.\n\nHowever, it is possible to use an electrical tool to solder joints in copper pipe sized from {{cvt|8|to|22|mm|in|frac=8}}.  For example, the Antex Pipemaster is recommended for use in tight spaces, when [[open flame]]s are hazardous, or by [[do-it-yourself]] users.  The [[pliers]]-like tool uses heated fitted jaws that completely encircle the pipe, allowing a joint to be melted in as little as 10 seconds.<ref name=SPP>{{cite web|title=Pipemaster Soldering Tool|url=http://smartplumbingproducts.com/product/pipemaster-soldering-tool|work=Smart Plumbing Products|publisher=Smart Contractor Products|accessdate=2014-05-20|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521084653/http://smartplumbingproducts.com/product/pipemaster-soldering-tool|archivedate=2014-05-21}}</ref>\n\nSolder fittings, also known as ''capillary fittings'', are usually used for copper joints. These fittings are short sections of smooth pipe designed to slide over the outside of the mating tube. Commonly used fittings include for straight connectors, reducers, bends, and tees. There are two types of solder fittings: ''end feed fittings'' which contain no solder, and ''[[solder ring fitting]]s'' (also known as Yorkshire fittings), in which there is a ring of solder in a small circular recess inside the fitting.\n\nAs with all solder joints, all parts to be joined must be clean and oxide free. Internal and external wire brushes are available for the common pipe and fitting sizes; [[emery cloth]] and wire-wool are frequently used as well, although metal wool products are discouraged, as they can contain oil, which would contaminate the joint.\n\nBecause of the size of the parts involved, and the high activity and contaminating tendency of the flame, plumbing fluxes are typically much more chemically active, and often more acidic, than electronic fluxes. Because plumbing joints may be done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated as pastes which stay in place better than liquids. Flux should be applied to all surfaces of the joint, inside and out. Flux residues should be removed after the joint is complete or they can, eventually, erode through the copper substrates and cause failure of the joint.\n\nMany plumbing solder formulations are available, with different characteristics, such as higher or lower melting temperature, depending on the specific requirements of the job. Building codes currently almost universally require the use of lead-free solder for potable water piping, though traditional tin-lead solder is still available. Studies have shown that lead-soldered plumbing pipes can result in elevated levels of lead in drinking water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plumbingpages.com/featurepages/Pipeworkfluxsolder.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218234432/http://plumbingpages.com/featurepages/Pipeworkfluxsolder.cfm |archivedate=2009-02-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T110211.asp|title=Lead Poisoning - Ask Dr Sears|website=askdrsears.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110120545/http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T110211.asp|archivedate=10 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSince copper pipe quickly conducts heat away from a joint, great care must be taken to ensure that the joint is properly heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible around the edge of the fitting and allowed to cool.\n\nOf the three methods of connecting copper tubing, solder connections require the most skill, but soldering copper is a very reliable process, provided some basic conditions are met:\n\n* The tubing and fittings must be cleaned to bare metal with no tarnish\n* Any pressure which is formed by heating of the tubing must have an outlet\n* The joint must be dry (which can be challenging when repairing water pipes)\n\nCopper is only one material that is joined in this manner. Brass fittings are often used for valves or as a connection fitting between copper and other metals. Brass piping is soldered in this manner in the making of [[brass instruments]] and some [[woodwind]] (saxophone and flute) musical instruments\n\n===Mechanical and aluminium soldering===\nA number of solder materials, primarily [[zinc]] alloys, are used for soldering aluminium metal and alloys and to a lesser extent steel and zinc. This mechanical soldering is similar to a low temperature brazing operation, in that the mechanical characteristics of the joint are reasonably good and it can be used for structural repairs of those materials.\n\nThe [[American Welding Society]] defines brazing as using filler metals with melting points over {{convert|450|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} \u2014 or, by the traditional definition in the United States, above {{convert|800|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.

When current is conducted through a resistive material a certain level of heat is generated. By regulating the amount of current conducted and the level of resistance encountered, the amount of heat produced can be predetermined and controlled.\n\nElectrical resistance (usually described as a material's opposition to the flow of an electric current) is used to convert electric energy into thermal energy as an electric current (''I'') conducted through a material with resistance (''R'') releases power (''P'') equal to ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''I''{{isup|2}}''R'', where ''P'' is the power measured in watts, ''I'' is the current measured in amperes and ''R'' is the resistance measured in ohms.\n\nResistance soldering is unlike using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then passed through a thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, can be used for difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.\n\n===Stained glass soldering===\nHistorically, [[stained glass]] soldering tips were copper, heated by being placed in a [[charcoal]]-burning [[brazier]]. Multiple tips were used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back in the brazier of charcoal and the next tip was used.\n\nMore recently, electrically heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside the tip of the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change tips. Soldering irons designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work.\nOleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve solderability.\n\nTiffany-type stained glass is made by gluing copper foil around the edges of the pieces of glass and then soldering them together. This method makes it possible to create three-dimensional stained glass pieces.\n\n===Active soldering===\nFlux-less soldering with aid of conventional [[soldering iron]], [[ultrasonic soldering]] iron or specialized solder pot and active solder that contains an active element, most often [[titanium]], [[zirconium]] or [[chromium]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2012/WCE2012_pp1727-1732.pdf|journal=World Congress on Engineering|date=Jul 2012|volume=3|issn=2078-0966|title=Study of Active Soldering of Al2O3 Sputtering Targets on Copper Substrates|author=M.

Another common additive is [[gallium]] \u2013 usually introduced as a wetting promoter. Mechanical activation, needed for active soldering, can be performed by brushing (for example with use of stainless wire brush or steel spatula) or ultrasonic vibration (20\u201360&nbsp;kHz).

Once the solder's capacity for the base metal has been achieved it will no longer properly bond with the base metal, usually resulting in a brittle cold solder joint with a crystalline appearance.\n\nIt is good practice to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering\u2014[[desoldering braid]]s or vacuum desoldering equipment ([[solder sucker]]s) can be used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a bright, shiny, clean junction to be resoldered.\n\nThe lower melting point of solder means it can be melted away from the base metal, leaving it mostly intact, though the outer layer will be \"tinned\" with solder. Flux will remain which can easily be removed by abrasive or chemical processes. This tinned layer will allow solder to flow into a new joint, resulting in a new joint, as well as making the new solder flow very quickly and easily.\n\n== Lead-free electronic soldering ==\nMore recently environmental legislation has specifically targeted the wide use of lead in the electronics industry. The RoHS directives in Europe required many new electronic circuit boards to be lead-free by 1 July 2006, mostly in the consumer goods industry, but in some others as well. In Japan lead was phased out prior to legislation by manufacturers due to the additional expense in recycling products containing lead.<ref name=\"sol1\">[http://www.dklmetals.co.uk/PDF%20Files/Factorfiction.pdf FACT AND FICTION IN LEAD FREE SOLDERING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311125906/http://www.dklmetals.co.uk/PDF%20Files/Factorfiction.pdf |date=2011-03-11 }} from ''www.dkmetals.co.uk''</ref> However, even without the presence of lead, soldering can release fumes that are harmful and/or toxic to humans. It is highly recommended to use a device that can remove the fumes from the work area either by ventilating outside or filtering the air.<ref name=\"sol2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sentryair.com/solder-fumes.htm|title=The Hazards of Solder Fumes - Sentry Air Systems|website=www.sentryair.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025184710/http://www.sentryair.com/solder-fumes.htm|archivedate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nLead free soldering requires higher soldering temperatures than lead/tin soldering.  SnPb 63/37 Eutectic solder melts at {{val|183|u=degC}}.  SAC lead free solder melts at {{val|217|-|220|u=degC}}.\nNevertheless, many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to reduce the melting point of tin-based solder alloys various new alloys have had to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of solder baths etc.<ref name=\"sol1\"/>\n\nLead-free construction has also extended to components, pins, and connectors. Most of these pins used copper frames, and either lead, tin, gold or other finishes. Tin finishes are the most popular of lead-free finishes. Nevertheless, this brings up the issue of how to deal with [[whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]]. The current movement brings the electronics industry back to the problems solved in the 1960s by adding lead. [[JEDEC]] has created a classification system to help lead-free electronic manufacturers decide what provisions to take against whiskers, depending upon their application.\n\n==Soldering defects==\nIn the joining of copper tube, failure to properly heat and fill a joint may lead to a 'void' being formed. This is usually a result of improper placement of the flame. If the heat of the flame is not directed at the back of the fitting cup, and the solder wire applied degrees{{howmany|date=September 2016}} opposite the flame, then solder will quickly fill the opening of the fitting, trapping some flux inside the joint. This bubble of trapped flux is the void; an area inside a soldered joint where solder is unable to completely fill the fittings' cup, because flux has become sealed inside the joint, preventing solder from occupying that space.\n\n===Electronics===\nVarious problems may arise in the soldering process which lead to joints which are nonfunctional either immediately or after a period of use.\n\nThe most common defect when hand-soldering results from the parts being joined not exceeding the solder's liquidus temperature, resulting in a \"cold solder\" joint. This is usually the result of the soldering iron being used to heat the solder directly, rather than the parts themselves. Properly done, the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt the solder, guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic hand soldering the flux is embedded in the solder. Therefore, heating the solder first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans the surfaces being soldered. A cold-soldered joint may not conduct at all, or may conduct only intermittently. Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after sometimes years of operation.  A \"dry joint\" occurs when the cooling solder is moved, and often occurs because the joint moves when the soldering iron is removed from the joint.\n\nAn improperly selected or applied flux can cause joint failure. If not properly cleaned, a flux may corrode the joint and cause eventual joint failure. Without flux the joint may not be clean, or may be oxidized, resulting in an unsound joint.\n\nIn electronics non-corrosive fluxes are often used. Therefore, cleaning flux off may merely be a matter of aesthetics or to make visual inspection of joints easier in specialised 'mission critical' applications such as medical devices, military and aerospace. For satellites, this will also reduce weight, slightly but usefully. In high humidity, even non-corrosive flux might remain slightly active, therefore the flux may be removed to reduce corrosion over time. In some applications, the PCB might also be coated in some form of protective material such as a [[lacquer]] to protect it and exposed solder joints from the environment.\n\nMovement of metals being soldered before the solder has cooled will cause a highly unreliable cracked joint. In electronics soldering terminology this is known as a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A dry joint is weak mechanically and a poor conductor electrically.\n\nIn general a good-looking soldered joint ''is'' a good joint. As mentioned, it should be smooth, bright, and shiny. If the joint has lumps or balls of otherwise shiny solder the metal has not 'wetted' properly. Not being bright and shiny suggests a weak 'dry' joint. However, technicians trying to apply this guideline when using lead-free solder formulations may experience frustration, because these types of solders readily cool to a dull surface even if the joint is good. The solder looks shiny while molten, and suddenly hazes over as it solidifies even though it has not been disturbed during cooling.\n\nIn electronics a '[[wikt:concave|concave]]' fillet is ideal. This indicates good wetting and minimal use of solder (therefore minimal ''heating'' of heat sensitive components). A joint may be good, but if a large amount of unnecessary solder is used then more heating is obviously required. Excessive heating of a PCB may result in 'delamination' - the copper track may actually lift off the board, particularly on single sided PCBs without [[Through-hole technology|through hole plating]].\n\n==Tools==\nIn principle any type of soldering tool can carry out any work using solder at temperatures it can generate. In practice different tools are more suitable for different applications.\n\nHand-soldering tools widely used for electronics work include the electric soldering iron, which can be fitted with a variety of tips ranging from blunt to very fine, to chisel heads for hot-cutting plastics rather than soldering. The simplest irons do not have temperature regulation; small irons rapidly cool when used to solder to, say, a metal chassis, while large irons have tips too cumbersome for working on PCBs and similar fine work. Temperature-controlled irons have a reserve of power and can maintain temperature over a wide range of work. The [[soldering gun]] heats faster but has a larger and heavier body. Gas-powered irons using a catalytic tip to heat a bit, without flame, are used for portable applications. Hot-air guns and pencils allow [[rework (electronics)|rework]] of component packages which cannot easily be performed with electric irons and guns.\n\nFor non-electronic applications soldering torches use a flame rather than a soldering tip to heat solder. Soldering torches are often powered by butane<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toolingu.com/definition-660130-28677-soldering-torch.html|title=Soldering Training Equipment - Tooling U-SME|website=www.toolingu.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203005020/http://www.toolingu.com/definition-660130-28677-soldering-torch.html|archivedate=3 December 2015}}</ref> and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel torches suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, can be used for soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or without a soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch by directly applying the open flame.\n\nA soldering copper is a tool with a large copper head and a long handle which is heated in a [[blacksmith]]'s forge fire and used to apply heat to [[sheet metal]] for soldering. Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four pounds. The head provides a large [[thermal mass]] to store enough heat for soldering large areas before needing re-heating in the fire; the larger the head, the longer the working time. Historically, soldering coppers were standard tools used in auto bodywork, although [[body solder]] has been mostly superseded by [[spot welding]] for mechanical connection, and non-metallic fillers for contouring.\n\n[[Toaster oven#Toaster ovens|Toaster ovens]] and hand held infrared lights have been used by hobbyists to replicate production soldering processes on a much smaller scale.\n\nBristle brushes are usually used to apply plumbing paste flux. For electronic work, flux-core solder is generally used, but additional flux may be used from a [[flux pen]] or dispensed from a small bottle with a syringe-like needle.\n\n[[Wire brush]], [[wire wool]] and emery cloth are commonly used to prepare plumbing joints for connection. Electronic joints are usually made between surfaces that have been tinned and rarely require mechanical cleaning, though tarnished component leads and copper traces with a dark layer of oxide passivation (due to aging), as on a new prototyping board that has been on the shelf for about a year or more, may need to be mechanically cleaned.\n\nSome fluxes for electronics are designed to be stable and inactive when cool and do not need to be cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.\n\nA [[heat sink]], such as a crocodile clip, can be used to prevent damaging heat-sensitive components while hand-soldering. The heat sink limits the temperature of the component body by absorbing and dissipating heat (reducing the thermal resistance between the component and the air), while the thermal resistance of the leads maintains the temperature difference between the part of the leads being soldered and the component body so that the leads become hot enough to melt the solder while the component body remains cooler.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dip soldering]]\n* [[Electronics technician]]\n* [[Solder fatigue]]\n* [[Solder mask]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Practical Electronics/Soldering}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Brazing and Soldering}}\n* [http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/desolderpix.htm Desoldering guide]\n* [http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/166 A short video explanation of how solder works]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090101042813/http://www.solderinguide.com/ Soldering 101 (Archived)]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|formopen}}\n\n[[Category:Soldering| ]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Laser applications]]<!-- For laser soldering -->\n[[Category:Metalworking]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the process|the material|Solder}}\n{{redir|Dry joint|types of switch or relay contacts|Dry contact}}\n{{redir|Cold joint|thermocouple contacts|Cold junction (thermocouple)}}\n\n[[File:Desoldering.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Desoldering a contact from a wire]]\n'''Soldering''' ([[General American|AmE]]: {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u0252|d|\u0259r|\u026a|\u014b}}, [[Received Pronunciation|BrE]]: {{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|o\u028a|l|d|\u0259r|\u026a|\u014b}}) is a process in which two or more items  are joined together by melting and putting a [[filler metal]] ([[solder]]) into the joint, the filler metal having a lower [[melting point]] than the adjoining metal. Unlike [[welding]], soldering does not involve melting the work pieces. In [[brazing]], the work piece metal also does not melt, but the filler metal is one that melts at a higher temperature than in soldering. In the past, nearly all solders contained [[lead]], but environmental and health concerns have increasingly dictated use of [[lead-free solder|lead-free alloys]] for electronics and plumbing purposes.\n\n== Origins ==\n[[File:Solder sugarlabs.jpg|thumb|right|Small figurine being created by soldering]]\n\nThere is evidence that soldering was employed as early as 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia.<ref>{{cite book | title = Materials Handbook | first = George | last = Brady | publisher = McGraw Hill | pages = [https://archive.org/details/materialshandboo14geor/page/768 768\u201370] | isbn = 978-0-07-007084-4 | year = 1996 | display-authors = etal | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/materialshandboo14geor/page/768 }}</ref> Soldering and [[brazing]] are thought to have originated very early in the history of metal-working, probably before 4000 BC.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/brazing/bh_pre1900s.html|title=A History of Welding|website=weldinghistory.org|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425153916/http://www.weldinghistory.org/whistoryfolder/brazing/bh_pre1900s.html|archivedate=25 April 2012}}</ref> Sumerian swords from {{circa|3000 BC}} were assembled using hard soldering.\n\nSoldering was historically used to make jewelry items, cooking ware and tools, as well as other uses such as in assembling [[stained glass]].\n\n== Applications ==\nSoldering is used in plumbing, electronics, and metalwork from [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|flashing]] to jewellery and musical instruments.\n \nSoldering provides reasonably permanent but reversible connections between copper pipes in [[plumbing]] systems as well as joints in sheet metal objects such as food cans, [[Flashing (weatherproofing)|roof flashing]], [[rain gutter]]s and automobile [[radiator]]s.\n\n[[Jewelry]] components, machine tools and some refrigeration and plumbing components are often assembled and repaired by the higher temperature silver soldering process. Small mechanical parts are often soldered or brazed as well. Soldering is also used to join lead [[came]] and [[Came glasswork|copper foil]] in [[Came glasswork|stained glass]] work.\n\nElectronic soldering connects [[electrical wiring]] and [[electronic component]]s to [[printed circuit board]]s  by utilizing a metallic alloy substance called [[solder]]. This special alloy is melted by using a soldering iron, a wave bath, or a specialized oven, as it joins conductors to PCBs, terminals, and wires.\n\nMusical instruments, especially brass and woodwind instruments, use a combination of soldering and brazing in their assembly. Brass bodies are often soldered together, while keywork and braces are most often brazed.\n\n== Solders ==\n{{main|Solder}}\n\nSoldering filler materials are available in many different [[alloy]]s for differing applications. In electronics assembly, the [[eutectic]] alloy with 63% tin and 37% lead (or 60/40, which is almost identical in melting point) has been the alloy of choice. Other alloys are used for plumbing, mechanical assembly, and other applications. Some examples of soft-solder are tin-lead for general purposes, tin-zinc for joining [[aluminium]], lead-silver for strength at higher than room temperature, cadmium-silver for strength at high temperatures, zinc-aluminium for aluminium and corrosion resistance, and tin-silver and tin-bismuth for electronics.\n\nA eutectic formulation has advantages when applied to soldering: the [[liquidus]] and [[Solidus (chemistry)|solidus]] temperatures are the same, so there is no plastic phase, and it has the lowest possible melting point. Having the lowest possible melting point minimizes heat stress on electronic components during soldering. And, having no plastic phase allows for quicker wetting as the solder heats up, and quicker setup as the solder cools. A non-eutectic formulation must remain still as the temperature drops through the liquidus and solidus temperatures. Any movement during the plastic phase may result in cracks, resulting in an unreliable joint.\n\nCommon [[Solder#Solder alloys|'''solder formulations''']] based on tin and lead are listed below. The fraction represent percentage of tin first, then lead, totaling 100%:\n\n* 63/37: melts at {{convert|183|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} (eutectic: the only mixture that melts at a ''point'', instead of over a range)\n* 60/40: melts between {{convert|183|\u2013|190|C|F}}\n* 50/50: melts between {{convert|183|\u2013|215|C|F}}\n\nFor environmental reasons (and the introduction of regulations such as the European RoHS ([[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]])), lead-free solders are becoming more widely used. They are also suggested anywhere young children may come into contact with (since young children are likely to place things into their mouths), or for outdoor use where rain and other precipitation may wash the lead into the groundwater. Unfortunately, most lead-free solders are not eutectic formulations, melting at around {{convert|250|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}, making it more difficult to create reliable joints with them.\n\nOther common solders include low-temperature formulations (often containing [[bismuth]]), which are often used to join previously-soldered assemblies without unsoldering earlier connections, and high-temperature formulations (usually containing [[silver]]) which are used for high-temperature operation or for first assembly of items which must not become unsoldered during subsequent operations. Alloying silver with other metals changes the melting point, adhesion and wetting characteristics, and tensile strength. Of all the brazing alloys, silver solders have the greatest strength and the broadest applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tinmantech.com/html/faq_brazing_versus_soldering.php|title=Brazing versus Soldering|first=Kent|last=White|website=TM Technologies, Tools & Methods for Better Metalworking|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170623150638/http://www.tinmantech.com/html/faq_brazing_versus_soldering.php|archivedate=23 June 2017}}</ref> Specialty alloys are available with properties such as higher strength, the ability to solder aluminum, better electrical conductivity, and higher corrosion resistance.<ref name=\"Solder Product List\">{{cite web|last=Kapp Alloy & Wire, Inc|title=Products|url=http://www.kappalloy.com/products-solder.php|publisher=Kapp Alloy & Wire, Inc|accessdate=5 March 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130716145255/http://kappalloy.com/products-solder.php|archivedate=16 July 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Flux==\n{{main|Flux (metallurgy)}}\n\nThe purpose of [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] is to facilitate the soldering process. One of the obstacles to a successful solder joint is an impurity at the site of the joint, for example, dirt, oil or [[oxidation]]. The impurities can be removed by mechanical cleaning or by chemical means, but the elevated temperatures required to melt the filler metal (the solder) encourages the work piece (and the solder) to re-oxidize. This effect is accelerated as the soldering temperatures increase and can completely prevent the solder from joining to the workpiece. One of the earliest forms of flux was [[charcoal]], which acts as a [[reducing agent]] and helps prevent oxidation during the soldering process. Some fluxes go beyond the simple prevention of oxidation and also provide some form of chemical cleaning (corrosion). Many fluxes also act as a [[wetting agent]] in the soldering process,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.indium.com/products/solderfabrications/fluxes.php|title=Flux and epoxy products made by Indium Corporation|first=Quadsimia Internet Solutions -|last=http://www.quadsimia.com/|website=Indium Corporation|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820130704/http://www.indium.com/products/solderfabrications/fluxes.php|archivedate=20 August 2012}}</ref> reducing the [[surface tension]] of the molten solder and causing it to flow and wet the workpieces more easily.\n\nFor many years, the most common type of flux used in electronics (soft soldering) was [[rosin]]-based, using the rosin from selected [[pine tree]]s. It was nearly ideal in that it was non-corrosive and non-conductive at normal temperatures but became mildly reactive (corrosive) at elevated soldering temperatures. Plumbing and automotive applications, among others, typically use an acid-based ([[hydrochloric acid]]) flux which provides rather aggressive cleaning of the joint. These fluxes cannot be used in electronics because their residues are conductive leading to unintended electrical connections, and because they will eventually dissolve small diameter wires. [[Citric acid]] is an excellent water-soluble acid-type flux for copper and electronics <ref>{{cite web|url=https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a295042.pdf |title=An Investigation of the Chemistry of Citric Acid in Military Soldering Applications  |date=1995-06-19}}</ref> but must be washed off afterwards.\n\nFluxes for soft solder are currently available in three basic formulations:\n* Water-soluble fluxes \u2013 higher activity fluxes which should be removed with water after soldering (no [[Volatile organic compound|VOC]]s required for removal).\n* No-clean fluxes \u2013 mild enough to not \"require\" removal due to their non-conductive and non-corrosive residues.<ref name=\"indiumcorporation\"/> These fluxes are called \"no-clean\" because the residue left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause electrical shorts; nevertheless they leave a plainly visible white residue that resembles diluted bird-droppings. No-clean flux residue is acceptable on all 3 classes of PCBs as defined by IPC-610 provided it does not inhibit visual inspection, access to test points, or have a wet, tacky or excessive residue that may spread onto other areas. Connector mating surfaces must also be free of flux residue.  Fingerprints in no-clean residue are a class 3 defect<ref>IPC-A-610 revision E section 10.6.4</ref>\n* Traditional [[rosin]] fluxes \u2013 available in non-activated (R), mildly activated (RMA) and activated (RA) formulations. RA and RMA fluxes contain rosin combined with an activating agent, typically an acid, which increases the wettability of metals to which it is applied by removing existing oxides. The residue resulting from the use of RA flux is [[corrosive]] and must be cleaned. RMA flux is formulated to result in a residue which is less corrosive, so that cleaning becomes optional, though usually preferred.  R flux is still less active and even less corrosive.\n\nFlux performance must be carefully evaluated for best results; a very mild 'no-clean' flux might be perfectly acceptable for production equipment, but not give adequate performance for more variable hand-soldering operations.\n\n==Processes==\n[[File:Brazing and soldering processes - AWS A3.0 2001.svg|thumb|right|300px|Brazing and soldering processes [[classification chart]]<ref>AWS A3.0:2001, Standard Welding Terms and Definitions Including Terms for Adhesive Bonding, Brazing, Soldering, Thermal Cutting, and Thermal Spraying, American Welding Society (2001), p. 118. {{ISBN|0-87171-624-0}}</ref>]]\nThere are three forms of soldering, each requiring progressively higher temperatures and producing an increasingly stronger joint strength:\n# soft soldering, which originally used a tin-lead [[alloy]] as the filler metal\n# silver soldering, which uses an alloy containing [[silver]]\n# [[brazing]] which uses a [[brass]] alloy for the filler\n\nThe alloy of the filler metal for each type of soldering can be adjusted to modify the melting temperature of the filler.

Soft solder filler metals are typically alloys (often containing [[lead]]) that have [[liquidus]] temperatures below {{convert|350|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn this soldering process, heat is applied to the parts to be joined, causing the solder to melt and to bond to the workpieces in a surface alloying process called [[wetting]]. In stranded wire, the solder is drawn up into the wire between the strands by [[capillary action]] in a process called 'wicking'. Capillary action also takes place when the workpieces are very close together or touching. The joint's [[tensile strength]] is dependent on the filler metal used;  in electrical soldering little tensile strength comes from the added solder which is why it is advised that wires be twisted or folded together before soldering to provide some mechanical strength for a joint.  A good solder joint produces an electrically-conductive, water- and gas-tight join.\n\nEach type of solder offers advantages and disadvantages. Soft solder is so called because of the soft lead that is its primary ingredient. Soft soldering uses the lowest temperatures (and so thermally stresses components the least) but does not make a strong joint and is unsuitable for mechanical load-bearing applications. It is also unsuitable for high-temperature applications as it loses strength, and eventually melts. Silver soldering, as used by jewelers, machinists and in some plumbing applications, requires the use of a torch or other high-temperature source, and is much stronger than soft soldering. Brazing provides the strongest of the non-welded joints but also requires the hottest temperatures to melt the filler metal, requiring a torch or other high temperature source and darkened goggles to protect the eyes from the bright light produced by the white-hot work. It is often used to repair cast-iron objects, wrought-iron furniture, etc.\n\nSoldering operations can be performed with hand tools, one joint at a time, or ''en masse'' on a production line. Hand soldering is typically performed with a [[soldering iron]], [[soldering gun]], or a torch, or occasionally a [[hot-air pencil]]. Sheetmetal work was traditionally done with \"soldering coppers\" directly heated by a flame, with sufficient stored heat in the mass of the soldering copper to complete a joint; gas torches (e.g. butane or propane) or electrically-heated soldering irons are more convenient. All soldered joints require the same elements of cleaning of the metal parts to be joined, fitting up the joint, heating the parts, applying flux, applying the filler, removing heat and holding the assembly still until the filler metal has completely solidified. Depending on the nature of flux material used and the application, cleaning of the joint may be required after it has cooled.\n\nEach solder alloy has characteristics that work best for certain applications, notably strength and conductivity, and each type of solder and alloy has different melting temperatures. The term ''silver solder'' denotes the type of solder that is used. Some soft solders are \"silver-bearing\" alloys used to solder silver-plated items. Lead-based solders should not be used on precious metals because the lead dissolves the metal and disfigures it.\n\n===Soldering and brazing===\nThe distinction between soldering and brazing is based on the melting temperature of the filler alloy. A temperature of 450&nbsp;\u00b0C is usually used as a practical demarcation between soldering and brazing. Soft soldering can be done with a heated iron whereas the other methods typically require a higher temperature torch or a furnace to melt the filler metal.\n\nDifferent equipment is usually required since a [[soldering iron]] cannot achieve high enough temperatures for hard soldering or brazing. Brazing filler metal is stronger than silver solder, which is stronger than lead-based soft solder. Brazing solders are formulated primarily for strength, silver solder is used by jewelers to protect the precious metal and by machinists and refrigeration technicians for its tensile strength but lower melting temperature than brazing, and the primary benefit of soft solder is the low temperature used (to prevent heat damage to electronic components and insulation).\n\nSince the joint is produced using a metal with a lower melting temperature than the workpiece, the joint will weaken as the ambient temperature approaches the melting point of the filler metal. For that reason, the higher temperature processes produce joints which are effective at higher temperatures. Brazed connections can be as strong or nearly as strong as the parts they connect,<ref name=Bellman-MelcorInc>{{cite web|url=http://www.bellmanmelcor.com/brazing_tips1.htm|title=Brazing tips|website=bellmanmelcor.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324144002/http://www.bellmanmelcor.com/brazing_tips1.htm|archivedate=24 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=WallColmonoy>{{cite web|url=http://www.wallcolmonoy.com/TechServices/NicrobrazNewsArchives/WCC_Article_Joint_Strength.htm|title=Technical Resource Center - Wall Colmonoy|website=wallcolmonoy.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425003941/http://www.wallcolmonoy.com/TechServices/NicrobrazNewsArchives/WCC_Article_Joint_Strength.htm|archivedate=25 April 2010}}</ref> even at elevated temperatures.<ref name=Colbus>[https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF03215037 Properties of gold-nickel alloy brazed joints in high temperature materials], in ''Gold Bulletin'', June 1974, Volume 7, Issue 2, pp 42\u201349; by     Jakob Colbus and Karl Friedrich Zimmermann; https://doi.org/10.1007/BF03215037</ref>\n\n===Silver soldering===\n\"Hard soldering\" or \"silver soldering\" is used to join precious and semi-precious metals such as gold, silver, brass, and copper. The solder is usually described as easy, medium, or hard in reference to its melting temperature, not the strength of the joint. Extra-easy solder contains 56% silver and has a melting point of {{convert|1145|F|order=flip}}. Extra-hard solder has 80% silver and melts at {{convert|1370|F|order=flip}}. If multiple joints are needed, then the jeweler will start with hard or extra-hard solder and switch to lower-temperature solders for later joints.\n\nSilver solder is somewhat absorbed by the surrounding metal, resulting in a joint that is actually stronger than the metal being joined. The metal being joined must be perfectly flush, as silver solder cannot normally be used as a filler and will not fill gaps.\n\nAnother difference between brazing and soldering is how the solder is applied. In brazing, one generally uses rods that are touched to the joint while being heated. With silver soldering, small pieces of solder wire are placed onto the metal prior to heating. A flux, often made of boric acid and denatured alcohol, is used to keep the metal and solder clean and to prevent the solder from moving before it melts.\n\nWhen silver solder melts, it tends to flow towards the area of greatest heat. Jewelers can somewhat control the direction the solder moves by leading it with a torch; it will even sometimes run straight up along a seam.\n\n===Induction soldering===\nInduction soldering uses [[induction heating]] by high-frequency [[alternating current]] in a surrounding copper coil. This induces currents in the part being soldered, which generates heat because of the higher resistance of a joint versus its surrounding metal ([[resistive heating]]). These copper coils can be shaped to fit the joint more precisely. A filler metal (solder) is placed between the facing surfaces, and this solder melts at a fairly low temperature. Fluxes are commonly used in induction soldering. This technique is particularly suited to continuously soldering, in which case these coils wrap around a cylinder or a pipe that needs to be soldered.\n\nSome metals are easier to solder than others. Copper, silver, and gold are easy. Iron, [[mild steel]] and [[nickel]] are next in difficulty. Because of their thin, strong oxide films, [[stainless steel]] and some aluminium alloys are even more difficult to solder. [[Titanium]], [[magnesium]], [[cast iron]]s, some high-carbon [[steel]]s, [[ceramic]]s, and [[graphite]] can be soldered but it involves a process similar to joining carbides: they are first plated with a suitable metallic element that induces interfacial bonding.\n\n==={{anchor|REBALLING|Cold joint}}Electronic components (PCBs)===\n[[File:Soldering a 0805.jpg|thumb|right|Desoldering of an SMD capacitor]]\n[[File:Ersin Multicore Solder Tube.jpg|thumb|right|A tube of multicore electronics solder used for manual soldering]]\n[[File:Cold solder joint2.jpg|thumb|An improperly soldered 'cold' joint]]\n[[File:Gebrochene loetstellen.jpg|thumb|Broken solder joints on a [[circuit board]]]]\n\nCurrently, mass-production printed circuit boards (PCBs) are mostly [[wave soldering|wave soldered]] or [[reflow soldering|reflow soldered]], though hand soldering of production electronics is also still widely used.\n\nIn wave soldering, components are prepped (trimmed or modified) and installed on the PCB. Sometimes, to prevent movement they are temporarily kept in place with small dabs of adhesive or secured with a fixture, then the assembly is passed over flowing solder in a bulk container.  This solder flow is forced to produce a standing wave so the whole PCB is not submerged in solder, but rather just touched. The end result is that solder stays on pins and pads, but not on the PCB itself.\n\nReflow soldering is a process in which a [[solder paste]] (a mixture of prealloyed solder powder and a flux-vehicle that has a peanut butter-like consistency<ref name=\"indiumcorporation\"/>) is used to stick the components to their attachment pads, after which the assembly is heated by an infrared lamp, a hot air pencil, or, more commonly, by passing it through a carefully controlled oven.\n\nSince different components can be best assembled by different techniques, it is common to use two or more processes for a given PCB. For example, [[Surface-mount technology|surface mounted]] parts may be reflow soldered first, with a wave soldering process for the [[Through-hole technology|through-hole]] mounted components coming next, and bulkier parts hand-soldered last.\n\n====Hand soldering====\nFor hand soldering,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/@soldertools.net/hand-soldering-1673ad20e3d2|title=Hand Soldering|last=Jones|first=Mike|date=2018-02-07|website=Mike Jones|access-date=2018-07-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180709094531/https://medium.com/@soldertools.net/hand-soldering-1673ad20e3d2|archive-date=2018-07-09}}</ref> the heat source tool should be selected to provide adequate heat for the size of joint to be completed. A 100-watt soldering iron may provide too much heat for printed circuit boards, while a 25-watt iron will not provide enough heat for large electrical connectors, joining copper roof flashing, or large stained-glass lead came. Using a tool with too high a temperature can damage sensitive components, but protracted heating by a tool that is too cool or under powered can also cause heat damage, perhaps even detaching PCB traces from the substrate.\n\nHand-soldering techniques require a great deal of skill for the fine-pitch soldering of surface mount [[integrated circuit|chip]] packages. In particular [[ball grid array|ball grid array (BGA)]] devices are notoriously difficult, if not impossible, to rework by hand.\n\nFor attachment of electronic components to a PCB, proper selection and use of flux helps prevent oxidation during soldering;  it is essential for good wetting and heat transfer. The soldering iron tip must be clean and pre-tinned with solder to ensure rapid heat transfer. Components which dissipate large amounts of heat during operation are sometimes elevated above the PCB to avoid PCB overheating. After inserting a through-hole mounted component, the excess lead is cut off, leaving a length of about the radius of the pad. Plastic or metal mounting clips or holders may be used with large devices to aid heat dissipation and reduce joint stresses.\n\nA heat sink may be used on the leads of heat sensitive components to reduce heat transfer to the component. This is especially applicable to germanium parts. The heat sink will mean the use of more heat to complete the joint, since heat taken up by the heat sink will not heat the work pieces. If all metal surfaces have not been properly cleaned (\"fluxed\") or brought entirely above the melting temperature of the solder used, the result will be an unreliable (\"cold solder\") joint, even though its appearance may suggest otherwise.\n\nTo simplify soldering, beginners are usually advised to apply the soldering iron and the solder separately to the joint, rather than the solder being applied directly to the iron. When sufficient solder is applied, the solder wire is removed. When the surfaces are adequately heated, the solder will flow around the workpieces. The iron is then removed from the joint.\n\n====Soldering defects====\nSince non-eutectic solder alloys have a small plastic range, the joint must not be moved until the solder has cooled down through both the liquidus and solidus temperatures. When visually inspected, a good solder joint will appear smooth and shiny, with the outline of the soldered wire clearly visible. A matte gray surface is a good indicator of a joint that was moved during soldering.  The boundary between the solder and the workpiece in a good joint will have a low angle.\n\nOther solder defects can be detected visually as well. Cold solder joints are dull and sometimes cracked or pock-marked. Too little solder will result in a \"dry\" and unreliable joint; too much solder (the familiar 'solder blob' to beginners) is not necessarily unsound, but tends to mean poor wetting. With some fluxes, flux residue remaining on the joint may need to be removed, using water, alcohol or other solvents compatible with the parts involved.\n\nExcess solder and unconsumed flux and residue is sometimes wiped from the soldering iron tip between joints. The tip of the bit (commonly iron plated to reduce erosion) is kept wetted with solder (\"tinned\") when hot to assist soldering, and to minimize oxidation and corrosion of the tip itself.\n\n====Hot-bar reflow====\n''Hot-bar reflow'' is a selective soldering process where two pre-fluxed, solder coated parts are heated with heating element (called a thermode) to a sufficient temperature to melt the solder.\n\nPressure is applied through the whole process (usually 15 seconds) to ensure that components stay in place during cooling. The heating element is heated and cooled for each connection. Up to 4000 [[Watt|W]] can be used in the heating element allowing fast soldering, good results with connections requiring high energy.<ref>{{cite web|title=Unitek Eapro: Electronic Assembly Products|url=http://www.unitekeapro.com/pages.php?id=85|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506083947/http://www.unitekeapro.com/pages.php?id=85 |archivedate = 2008-05-06}}</ref>\n\n====Laser====\n''Laser soldering'' is a technique where a 30\u201350&nbsp;[[Watt|W]] [[laser]] is used to melt and solder an electrical connection joint.

Process recipes will differ depending on the [[alloy]] composition. For soldering 44-pin chip carriers to a board using soldering preforms, power levels were on the order of 10 watts and solder times approximately 1 second. Low power levels can lead to incomplete wetting and the formation of voids, both of which can weaken the joint.\n\n====Environmental regulation and RoHS====\nEnvironmental legislation in many countries, and the whole of the [[European Community]] area (see [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive|RoHS]]), has led to a change in formulation of both solders and fluxes. Water-soluble non-rosin-based fluxes have been increasingly used since the 1980s so that soldered boards can be cleaned with water or water-based cleaners. This eliminates hazardous solvents from the production environment, and from factory effluents.  Those regulations have also reduced the use of lead based solders, and caused the melting temperatures of solders in use to increase by up to {{convert|100|F-change|-1|order=flip}}.\n\n===Fiber focus infrared soldering===\nFiber focus infrared soldering is technique where many [[infrared]] sources are led through [[optical fiber|fibers]], then focused onto a single spot at which the connection is soldered.<ref name=\"nofiss\">{{cite web|title=NovaBrite RGB Full Color High Power LED Application Note|url=http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324142456/http://www.vincenc.com.tw/download/Full%20color%20%20Hi%20POWER%20LED%20Application%20Note.pdf|archivedate=2012-03-24}} 070927 vincenc.com.tw (mentioned as a technique)</ref>{{Failed verification|date=November 2010}}\n\n===Pipe soldering===<!-- [[Sweat fitting]] redirects here -->\n[[File:Fitting1537.JPG|thumb|210px|Soldered copper pipes]]\n[[File:Weichlot.jpg|thumb|210px|Solder]]\n[[File:LeadFree CadmiumFree solder.jpg|thumb|210px|Lead-free solder]]\nCopper pipe, or 'tube', is commonly joined by soldering. When applied in a plumbing trade context in the United  States, soldering is often referred to as ''sweating'', and a tubing connection so made is referred to as a ''sweated joint''.\n\nCopper tubing conducts heat away much faster than a conventional hand-held soldering iron or gun can provide, so a [[propane torch]] is most commonly used to deliver the necessary power; for large tubing sizes and fittings a [[MAPP gas|MAPP]]-fueled, [[acetylene]]-fueled, or [[propylene]]-fueled torch is used with atmospheric air as the oxidizer; MAPP/oxygen or acetylene/oxygen are rarely used because the flame temperature is much higher than the melting point of copper. Too much heat destroys the temper of hard-tempered copper tubing, and can burn the flux out of a joint before the solder is added, resulting in a faulty joint. For larger tubing sizes, a torch fitted with various sizes of interchangeable ''swirl tips'' is employed to deliver the needed heating power. In the hands of a skilled [[tradesman]], the hotter flame of acetylene, MAPP, or propylene allows more joints to be completed per hour without damage to copper tempering.\n\nHowever, it is possible to use an electrical tool to solder joints in copper pipe sized from {{cvt|8|to|22|mm|in|frac=8}}.  For example, the Antex Pipemaster is recommended for use in tight spaces, when [[open flame]]s are hazardous, or by [[do-it-yourself]] users.  The [[pliers]]-like tool uses heated fitted jaws that completely encircle the pipe, allowing a joint to be melted in as little as 10 seconds.<ref name=SPP>{{cite web|title=Pipemaster Soldering Tool|url=http://smartplumbingproducts.com/product/pipemaster-soldering-tool|work=Smart Plumbing Products|publisher=Smart Contractor Products|accessdate=2014-05-20|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521084653/http://smartplumbingproducts.com/product/pipemaster-soldering-tool|archivedate=2014-05-21}}</ref>\n\nSolder fittings, also known as ''capillary fittings'', are usually used for copper joints. These fittings are short sections of smooth pipe designed to slide over the outside of the mating tube. Commonly used fittings include for straight connectors, reducers, bends, and tees. There are two types of solder fittings: ''end feed fittings'' which contain no solder, and ''[[solder ring fitting]]s'' (also known as Yorkshire fittings), in which there is a ring of solder in a small circular recess inside the fitting.\n\nAs with all solder joints, all parts to be joined must be clean and oxide free. Internal and external wire brushes are available for the common pipe and fitting sizes; [[emery cloth]] and wire-wool are frequently used as well, although metal wool products are discouraged, as they can contain oil, which would contaminate the joint.\n\nBecause of the size of the parts involved, and the high activity and contaminating tendency of the flame, plumbing fluxes are typically much more chemically active, and often more acidic, than electronic fluxes. Because plumbing joints may be done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated as pastes which stay in place better than liquids. Flux should be applied to all surfaces of the joint, inside and out. Flux residues should be removed after the joint is complete or they can, eventually, erode through the copper substrates and cause failure of the joint.\n\nMany plumbing solder formulations are available, with different characteristics, such as higher or lower melting temperature, depending on the specific requirements of the job. Building codes currently almost universally require the use of lead-free solder for potable water piping, though traditional tin-lead solder is still available. Studies have shown that lead-soldered plumbing pipes can result in elevated levels of lead in drinking water.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.plumbingpages.com/featurepages/Pipeworkfluxsolder.cfm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-09-16 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218234432/http://plumbingpages.com/featurepages/Pipeworkfluxsolder.cfm |archivedate=2009-02-18 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T110211.asp|title=Lead Poisoning - Ask Dr Sears|website=askdrsears.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110120545/http://www.askdrsears.com/html/10/T110211.asp|archivedate=10 November 2009}}</ref>\n\nSince copper pipe quickly conducts heat away from a joint, great care must be taken to ensure that the joint is properly heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as flux residue before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible around the edge of the fitting and allowed to cool.\n\nOf the three methods of connecting copper tubing, solder connections require the most skill, but soldering copper is a very reliable process, provided some basic conditions are met:\n\n* The tubing and fittings must be cleaned to bare metal with no tarnish\n* Any pressure which is formed by heating of the tubing must have an outlet\n* The joint must be dry (which can be challenging when repairing water pipes)\n\nCopper is only one material that is joined in this manner. Brass fittings are often used for valves or as a connection fitting between copper and other metals. Brass piping is soldered in this manner in the making of [[brass instruments]] and some [[woodwind]] (saxophone and flute) musical instruments\n\n===Mechanical and aluminium soldering===\nA number of solder materials, primarily [[zinc]] alloys, are used for soldering aluminium metal and alloys and to a lesser extent steel and zinc. This mechanical soldering is similar to a low temperature brazing operation, in that the mechanical characteristics of the joint are reasonably good and it can be used for structural repairs of those materials.\n\nThe [[American Welding Society]] defines brazing as using filler metals with melting points over {{convert|450|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} \u2014 or, by the traditional definition in the United States, above {{convert|800|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}}.

When current is conducted through a resistive material a certain level of heat is generated. By regulating the amount of current conducted and the level of resistance encountered, the amount of heat produced can be predetermined and controlled.\n\nElectrical resistance (usually described as a material's opposition to the flow of an electric current) is used to convert electric energy into thermal energy as an electric current (''I'') conducted through a material with resistance (''R'') releases power (''P'') equal to ''P''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''I''{{isup|2}}''R'', where ''P'' is the power measured in watts, ''I'' is the current measured in amperes and ''R'' is the resistance measured in ohms.\n\nResistance soldering is unlike using a conduction iron, where heat is produced within an element and then passed through a thermally conductive tip into the joint area. A cold soldering iron requires time to reach working temperature and must be kept hot between solder joints. Thermal transfer may be inhibited if the tip is not kept properly wetted during use. With resistance soldering an intense heat can be rapidly developed directly within the joint area and in a tightly controlled manner. This allows a faster ramp up to the required solder melt temperature and minimizes thermal travel away from the solder joint, which helps to minimize the potential for thermal damage to materials or components in the surrounding area. Heat is only produced while each joint is being made, making resistance soldering more energy efficient. Resistance soldering equipment, unlike conduction irons, can be used for difficult soldering and brazing applications where significantly higher temperatures may be required. This makes resistance comparable to flame soldering in some situations. When the required temperature can be achieved by either flame or resistance methods the resistance heat is more localized because of direct contact, whereas the flame will spread thus heating a potentially larger area.\n\n===Stained glass soldering===\nHistorically, [[stained glass]] soldering tips were copper, heated by being placed in a [[charcoal]]-burning [[brazier]]. Multiple tips were used; when one tip cooled down from use, it was placed back in the brazier of charcoal and the next tip was used.\n\nMore recently, electrically heated soldering irons are used. These are heated by a coil or ceramic heating element inside the tip of the iron. Different power ratings are available, and temperature can be controlled electronically. These characteristics allow longer beads to be run without interrupting the work to change tips. Soldering irons designed for electronic use are often effective though they are sometimes underpowered for the heavy copper and lead came used in stained glass work.\nOleic acid is the classic flux material that has been used to improve solderability.\n\nTiffany-type stained glass is made by gluing copper foil around the edges of the pieces of glass and then soldering them together. This method makes it possible to create three-dimensional stained glass pieces.\n\n===Active soldering===\nFlux-less soldering with aid of conventional [[soldering iron]], [[ultrasonic soldering]] iron or specialized solder pot and active solder that contains an active element, most often [[titanium]], [[zirconium]] or [[chromium]].<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.iaeng.org/publication/WCE2012/WCE2012_pp1727-1732.pdf|journal=World Congress on Engineering|date=Jul 2012|volume=3|issn=2078-0966|title=Study of Active Soldering of Al2O3 Sputtering Targets on Copper Substrates|author=M.

The active solders can be protected against excessive oxidation of their active element by addition of [[rare earth elements]] with higher affinity to oxygen (typically [[cerium]] or [[lanthanum]]). Another common additive is [[gallium]] \u2013 usually introduced as a wetting promoter. Mechanical activation, needed for active soldering, can be performed by brushing (for example with use of stainless wire brush or steel spatula) or ultrasonic vibration (20\u201360&nbsp;kHz).

Once the solder's capacity for the base metal has been achieved it will no longer properly bond with the base metal, usually resulting in a brittle cold solder joint with a crystalline appearance.\n\nIt is good practice to remove solder from a joint prior to resoldering\u2014[[desoldering braid]]s or vacuum desoldering equipment ([[solder sucker]]s) can be used. Desoldering wicks contain plenty of flux that will lift the contamination from the copper trace and any device leads that are present. This will leave a bright, shiny, clean junction to be resoldered.\n\nThe lower melting point of solder means it can be melted away from the base metal, leaving it mostly intact, though the outer layer will be \"tinned\" with solder. Flux will remain which can easily be removed by abrasive or chemical processes. This tinned layer will allow solder to flow into a new joint, resulting in a new joint, as well as making the new solder flow very quickly and easily.\n\n== Lead-free electronic soldering ==\nMore recently environmental legislation has specifically targeted the wide use of lead in the electronics industry. The RoHS directives in Europe required many new electronic circuit boards to be lead-free by 1 July 2006, mostly in the consumer goods industry, but in some others as well. In Japan lead was phased out prior to legislation by manufacturers due to the additional expense in recycling products containing lead.<ref name=\"sol1\">[http://www.dklmetals.co.uk/PDF%20Files/Factorfiction.pdf FACT AND FICTION IN LEAD FREE SOLDERING] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311125906/http://www.dklmetals.co.uk/PDF%20Files/Factorfiction.pdf |date=2011-03-11 }} from ''www.dkmetals.co.uk''</ref> However, even without the presence of lead, soldering can release fumes that are harmful and/or toxic to humans. It is highly recommended to use a device that can remove the fumes from the work area either by ventilating outside or filtering the air.<ref name=\"sol2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.sentryair.com/solder-fumes.htm|title=The Hazards of Solder Fumes - Sentry Air Systems|website=www.sentryair.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161025184710/http://www.sentryair.com/solder-fumes.htm|archivedate=25 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nLead free soldering requires higher soldering temperatures than lead/tin soldering.  SnPb 63/37 Eutectic solder melts at {{val|183|u=degC}}.  SAC lead free solder melts at {{val|217|-|220|u=degC}}.\nNevertheless, many new technical challenges have arisen with this endeavor; to reduce the melting point of tin-based solder alloys various new alloys have had to be researched, with additives of copper, silver, bismuth as typical minor additives to reduce melting point and control other properties, additionally tin is a more corrosive metal, and can eventually lead to the failure of solder baths etc.<ref name=\"sol1\"/>\n\nLead-free construction has also extended to components, pins, and connectors. Most of these pins used copper frames, and either lead, tin, gold or other finishes. Tin finishes are the most popular of lead-free finishes. Nevertheless, this brings up the issue of how to deal with [[whisker (metallurgy)|tin whiskers]]. The current movement brings the electronics industry back to the problems solved in the 1960s by adding lead. [[JEDEC]] has created a classification system to help lead-free electronic manufacturers decide what provisions to take against whiskers, depending upon their application.\n\n==Soldering defects==\nIn the joining of copper tube, failure to properly heat and fill a joint may lead to a 'void' being formed. This is usually a result of improper placement of the flame. If the heat of the flame is not directed at the back of the fitting cup, and the solder wire applied degrees{{howmany|date=September 2016}} opposite the flame, then solder will quickly fill the opening of the fitting, trapping some flux inside the joint. This bubble of trapped flux is the void; an area inside a soldered joint where solder is unable to completely fill the fittings' cup, because flux has become sealed inside the joint, preventing solder from occupying that space.\n\n===Electronics===\nVarious problems may arise in the soldering process which lead to joints which are nonfunctional either immediately or after a period of use.\n\nThe most common defect when hand-soldering results from the parts being joined not exceeding the solder's liquidus temperature, resulting in a \"cold solder\" joint. This is usually the result of the soldering iron being used to heat the solder directly, rather than the parts themselves. Properly done, the iron heats the parts to be connected, which in turn melt the solder, guaranteeing adequate heat in the joined parts for thorough wetting. In electronic hand soldering the flux is embedded in the solder. Therefore, heating the solder first may cause the flux to evaporate before it cleans the surfaces being soldered. A cold-soldered joint may not conduct at all, or may conduct only intermittently. Cold-soldered joints also happen in mass production, and are a common cause of equipment which passes testing, but malfunctions after sometimes years of operation.  A \"dry joint\" occurs when the cooling solder is moved, and often occurs because the joint moves when the soldering iron is removed from the joint.\n\nAn improperly selected or applied flux can cause joint failure. If not properly cleaned, a flux may corrode the joint and cause eventual joint failure. Without flux the joint may not be clean, or may be oxidized, resulting in an unsound joint.\n\nIn electronics non-corrosive fluxes are often used. Therefore, cleaning flux off may merely be a matter of aesthetics or to make visual inspection of joints easier in specialised 'mission critical' applications such as medical devices, military and aerospace. For satellites, this will also reduce weight, slightly but usefully. In high humidity, even non-corrosive flux might remain slightly active, therefore the flux may be removed to reduce corrosion over time. In some applications, the PCB might also be coated in some form of protective material such as a [[lacquer]] to protect it and exposed solder joints from the environment.\n\nMovement of metals being soldered before the solder has cooled will cause a highly unreliable cracked joint. In electronics soldering terminology this is known as a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A dry joint is weak mechanically and a poor conductor electrically.\n\nIn general a good-looking soldered joint ''is'' a good joint. As mentioned, it should be smooth, bright, and shiny. If the joint has lumps or balls of otherwise shiny solder the metal has not 'wetted' properly. Not being bright and shiny suggests a weak 'dry' joint. However, technicians trying to apply this guideline when using lead-free solder formulations may experience frustration, because these types of solders readily cool to a dull surface even if the joint is good. The solder looks shiny while molten, and suddenly hazes over as it solidifies even though it has not been disturbed during cooling.\n\nIn electronics a '[[wikt:concave|concave]]' fillet is ideal. This indicates good wetting and minimal use of solder (therefore minimal ''heating'' of heat sensitive components). A joint may be good, but if a large amount of unnecessary solder is used then more heating is obviously required. Excessive heating of a PCB may result in 'delamination' - the copper track may actually lift off the board, particularly on single sided PCBs without [[Through-hole technology|through hole plating]].\n\n==Tools==\nIn principle any type of soldering tool can carry out any work using solder at temperatures it can generate. In practice different tools are more suitable for different applications.\n\nHand-soldering tools widely used for electronics work include the electric soldering iron, which can be fitted with a variety of tips ranging from blunt to very fine, to chisel heads for hot-cutting plastics rather than soldering. The simplest irons do not have temperature regulation; small irons rapidly cool when used to solder to, say, a metal chassis, while large irons have tips too cumbersome for working on PCBs and similar fine work. Temperature-controlled irons have a reserve of power and can maintain temperature over a wide range of work. The [[soldering gun]] heats faster but has a larger and heavier body. Gas-powered irons using a catalytic tip to heat a bit, without flame, are used for portable applications. Hot-air guns and pencils allow [[rework (electronics)|rework]] of component packages which cannot easily be performed with electric irons and guns.\n\nFor non-electronic applications soldering torches use a flame rather than a soldering tip to heat solder. Soldering torches are often powered by butane<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.toolingu.com/definition-660130-28677-soldering-torch.html|title=Soldering Training Equipment - Tooling U-SME|website=www.toolingu.com|accessdate=2 May 2018|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151203005020/http://www.toolingu.com/definition-660130-28677-soldering-torch.html|archivedate=3 December 2015}}</ref> and are available in sizes ranging from very small butane/oxygen units suitable for very fine but high-temperature jewelry work, to full-size oxy-fuel torches suitable for much larger work such as copper piping. Common multipurpose propane torches, the same kind used for heat-stripping paint and thawing pipes, can be used for soldering pipes and other fairly large objects either with or without a soldering tip attachment; pipes are generally soldered with a torch by directly applying the open flame.\n\nA soldering copper is a tool with a large copper head and a long handle which is heated in a [[blacksmith]]'s forge fire and used to apply heat to [[sheet metal]] for soldering. Typical soldering coppers have heads weighing between one and four pounds. The head provides a large [[thermal mass]] to store enough heat for soldering large areas before needing re-heating in the fire; the larger the head, the longer the working time. Historically, soldering coppers were standard tools used in auto bodywork, although [[body solder]] has been mostly superseded by [[spot welding]] for mechanical connection, and non-metallic fillers for contouring.\n\n[[Toaster oven#Toaster ovens|Toaster ovens]] and hand held infrared lights have been used by hobbyists to replicate production soldering processes on a much smaller scale.\n\nBristle brushes are usually used to apply plumbing paste flux. For electronic work, flux-core solder is generally used, but additional flux may be used from a [[flux pen]] or dispensed from a small bottle with a syringe-like needle.\n\n[[Wire brush]], [[wire wool]] and emery cloth are commonly used to prepare plumbing joints for connection. Electronic joints are usually made between surfaces that have been tinned and rarely require mechanical cleaning, though tarnished component leads and copper traces with a dark layer of oxide passivation (due to aging), as on a new prototyping board that has been on the shelf for about a year or more, may need to be mechanically cleaned.\n\nSome fluxes for electronics are designed to be stable and inactive when cool and do not need to be cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove flux residue after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.\n\nA [[heat sink]], such as a crocodile clip, can be used to prevent damaging heat-sensitive components while hand-soldering. The heat sink limits the temperature of the component body by absorbing and dissipating heat (reducing the thermal resistance between the component and the air), while the thermal resistance of the leads maintains the temperature difference between the part of the leads being soldered and the component body so that the leads become hot enough to melt the solder while the component body remains cooler.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dip soldering]]\n* [[Electronics technician]]\n* [[Solder fatigue]]\n* [[Solder mask]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikibooks|Practical Electronics/Soldering}}\n{{EB1911 poster|Brazing and Soldering}}\n* [http://www.epemag.wimborne.co.uk/desolderpix.htm Desoldering guide]\n* [http://vega.org.uk/video/programme/166 A short video explanation of how solder works]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20090101042813/http://www.solderinguide.com/ Soldering 101 (Archived)]\n\n{{Metalworking navbox|formopen}}\n\n[[Category:Soldering| ]]\n[[Category:Electronics manufacturing]]\n[[Category:Laser applications]]<!-- For laser soldering -->\n[[Category:Metalworking]]\n", "name_user": "112.206.13.218", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soldering"}

Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing from October through April and exceed {{convert|+10|C}} from June through August, with the intervening months of May and September constituting very short transitional seasons. Despite being located within the Arctic circle, Verkhoyansk has an extreme [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfd/Dwd'') dominated much of the year by [[anticyclone|high pressure]].

Average monthly temperatures range from {{convert|-45.4|C}} in January to {{convert|+16.5|C}} in July. Mean monthly temperatures are below freezing from October through April and exceed {{convert|+10|C}} from June through August, with the intervening months of May and September constituting very short transitional seasons. Despite being located within the Arctic circle, Verkhoyansk has an extreme [[subarctic climate]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] ''Dfd'') dominated much of the year by [[anticyclone|high pressure]]. This has the effect of cutting off the region from warming influences in winter and together with a lack of cloud cover leads to extensive heat losses during the cooler months.\n\nVerkhoyansk is one of the places considered the northern [[Pole of Cold]], the other being [[Oymyakon]], located 629 km (391 miles) away by air.

Prosecution officers work together with public prosecutors at the [[Attorney-General's Chambers]] to ensure that offenders are lawfully detained and given trial. Examples of common offences include the harbouring of immigration offenders, employing immigrants illegally or entering [[Marriage of convenience|marriages of convenience]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/till-prison-do-us-part-ica-officers-crack-one-of-the-largest-9949218|title=Till prison do us part: ICA officers crack one of the largest sham marriage cases|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-05-04|language=en-US}}</ref> Home owners who have been found guilty of renting their houses to immigration offenders and not carrying out one or more of the mandatory checks may be sentenced to a jail term, fine or both.\n\n===== Counter-terrorism =====\nICA is Singapore's first line of defence against potential terrorist threats by restricting the movement of security sensitive persons across international borders. After the escape of [[Mas Selamat Kastari|Mas Selamat]] in 2008, all checkpoints immediately stepped up security checks. During the lead-up to the 2018 [[2018 North Korea\u2013United States summit|Trump-Kim Summit]], Home Affairs Minister [[K. Shanmugam]] revealed that four people had been turned away at the checkpoints for terrorism related reasons.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/shanmugam-confident-security-in-place-for-trump-kim-summit-10415630|title=Shanmugam confident security in place for Trump-Kim summit|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nICA is part of the Inter-Agency Coordination Group within the [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]'s [[Maritime Security Task Force]].

Entry control began when the [[Crown colony|colonial government]] enacted the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in 1915.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_si|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>  In 1933, the Immigration Department was established to administer the Aliens Ordinance which placed quotas on newcomers entering Singapore. This effectively ended the freedom of travel in Singapore.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite book | title=Policing | publisher=Straits Times Press | author=Asad Latif | year=2017 | location=Singapore | pages=80\u201386 | isbn=978-981-47-4720-2}}</ref>\n\nOrdinance No. 5 of 1952 (The Immigration Ordinance) came into force on 1 August 1953, setting the foundation of immigration law in Singapore. The Immigration Ordinance was amended in 1959 after Singapore was granted sovereignty. The amendment gave Singaporeans the right of entry into the Colony.<ref name=\":4\" /> A new Immigration Depot was built at Telok Ayer Basin (East Wharf) while the head office was moved to Empress Place Building. Round-the-clock immigration clearance for [[Ship|vessels]] was started 1 June 1961.\n\nBirth registration started in 1872 which was then used for health and statistical purposes. However, by 1938 registration of births became compulsory by [[Law of Singapore|law]]. At the start of the second World War, the British introduced paper identity cards for the first time. This was suspended after the British surrender in 1945. The colonial government began issuing identity cards again in 1948 to counter the [[Communism|communist]] [[Malayan Emergency|insurgency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_nrd|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> The desire to limit the entry of those who might have communist sympathies extended to the creation of a new Immigration Bill in 1950. When Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, immigration came under the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Immigration Department became a federal agency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n==== Customs and Excise ====\nCustoms control was started when the Monopolies Department was founded in 1910 to collect excise duties on goods such as [[hard liquor]]s and [[opium]]. In 1916, the colonial government began taxing [[tobacco products]] on import to raise funds for the war effort.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_ced|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>  In 1932, the Customs headquarters was shifted to the Customs House from Cecil Street.  The Excise Department replaced the Monopolies Department in 1936 and in 1938, the Excise Department was renamed the Department of Customs & Excise.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Post-independence (1965 - 2002) ===\n\n==== Stricter immigration control ====\nAfter Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, freedom of movement continued to exist between the two countries for a short period of time. Two [[border checkpoint]]s were gazetted for travel between the two countries. They were the [[Tanjong Pagar Railway Station]] and the [[Woodlands Checkpoint]]. Malaysians had to produce [[identity card]]s to be able to enter Singapore, until passports were required on both sides in July 1967. To travel to [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Singapore restricted passport and the Singapore Certificate of Identity was required. The Restricted Passport Centre was at [[South Quay]] and was moved to [[Outram Road]] in 1976, but closed on 31 December 1994.\n\nIn the 1970s, illegal immigration and over-stayers became a serious problem in Singapore. A task force was set up in 1974 to deal with the immigration problem. Laws were introduced that allowed immigration officers to seize and detain vessels and vehicles used to convey illegal immigrants. Those who harboured or employed illegal immigrants could also be punished. Data on foreigners' movements within Singapore were processed by the new Immigration Data Processing Centre.\n\nThe Last Port Clearance was introduced in 1980 to attract more passenger liners to Singapore.\n\nA passport office was opened at Joo Chiat Complex in 1984. This office issued both international and restricted passports and was closed in 1999. The Immigration Department moved its head office to the Pidemco Centre in June 1986. Immigration officers were also deployed to places such as [[India]] and Hong Kong to open consulates and [[high commission]]s. All passports issued by Singapore immigration after 1990 were computerised and machine-readable. The Entry and Exit Control Integrated System implemented in the early 1990s was a computerized immigration system that was used at checkpoints to speed up the processing of travellers. A hotline for information was set up in 1992, with restricted access to countries lifted.\n\n==== National Registration Office ====\nThe independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the National Registration Act in 1966. The distinctive pink identity cards were issued for the first time. The National Registration Office (NRO) replaced the former Registry of Persons.\n\nAt the time, the NRO and the [[Registry of Births and Deaths]] (RBD) came under the former Ministry of Labour. The Registry of Societies (ROS), Martial Arts Control Unit (MACU) came under the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 16 October 1981, the NRO, RBD, ROC, MACU and ROS merged to form the National Registration Department (NRD). The NRD consisted of four registries: the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Registry of Citizens, the Registry of Societies and the National Registration Office. The NRD was located at the [[Empress Place Building]] until 1986 when the building was transformed into the now defunct Empress Place Museum.\n\n==== Customs and Excise Department ====\n[[Tobacco]], [[liquor]], [[motor vehicle]]s and [[petroleum]] became restricted goods after Singapore was granted independence as a sovereign nation. The Customs and Excise Department ([[Singapore Customs|CED]]) cooperated closely with other government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau. When the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] was introduced in 1994, the work scope of the CED was expanded. The red and green channel customs system was implemented in 1991 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] and at sea checkpoints.\n\nThe CED was located first at [[Cecil Street]] from 1910 till 1932 and later the White House at Maxwell Road from 1932 until 1989 when it moved to [[World Trade Centre, Singapore|World Trade Centre]] (now [[HarbourFront Centre]]).\n\n==== Singapore Immigration and Registration ====\nIn 1995, the Immigration Department was renamed Singapore Immigration. An immigration checkpoint was established at the Changi Ferry Terminal in May that year. There was a change in the passport application and collection in the 1990s, reducing the need for applicants to report to the building. To further reduce that need, applications by mail and internet were introduced and rebates were given for such applications.\n\nA new logo was launched by then-[[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Wong Kan Seng]] at the [[foundation stone]] ceremony for the SI Building in 1995. The West Coast Barter Trade Centre closed in June 1995. Singaporeans were sent renewal forms for passports nine months before their passports expired.\n\nSI became an autonomous agency in 1996 as well as launching its first website. All immigration offices moved from the Pidemco Centre to the new building at Kallang Road in 1997. The Singapore Immigration and the National Registration Department merged to form Singapore Immigration & Registration in 1998. A new land checkpoint at Tuas was opened on 2 January.\n\n=== 21st century: Merger and integration (2003 - Present) ===\nOn 1 April 2003, SIR and the border control functions of CED were merged to form ICA in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] plots. The remaining functions of the CED was reorganised and renamed into Singapore Customs. ICA was to be part of the Home Team and a new, blue uniform was introduced to reflect that change. The first Commissioner of ICA was Lock Wai Han, who was in the Singapore Police Force before he oversaw the merger of the two agencies.\n\nICA's first major challenge came with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, testing the agency's ability to control Singapore's borders and screen passengers for contagious diseases.\n\nIn 2005, the then-Director CNB Eric Tan became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\nIn 2010, Deputy Commissioner Clarence Yeo became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\n==== Integrated Checkpoints Command ====\nOn 2 January 2015, the Integrated Checkpoints Command concept was introduced. Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command, ICA checkpoints are split into three domains: Land, Sea and Air.  Each domain is headed by a Domain Commander who reports directly to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20AR%202015-FINAL-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ICA website|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  All Home Team agencies deployed at the checkpoints must report to the Domain Commander.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ica-launches-integrated-checkpoints-command-to-strengthen-coordination-among-agencies|title=ICA launches Integrated Checkpoints Command to strengthen coordination among agencies|last=migration|date=2015-01-02|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 March 2017, it was announced that Woodlands Town Centre would be absorbed by the new Woodlands Checkpoint extension.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woodlands-checkpoint-to-be-expanded-to-old-woodlands-town-centre|title=Woodlands Checkpoint to be extended to Old Woodlands Town Centre; two land plots to be acquired|last=hermesauto|date=2017-03-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2018 the amended Immigration Act was introduced. ICA officers would now perform roles as first responders. The amendment gave immigration officers the legal powers of police officers in relation to offences committed in the vicinity of checkpoints.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-ica-officers-get-enhanced-powers-to-conduct-searches-arrest-people-at|title=Parliament: ICA officers get enhanced powers to conduct searches, arrest people at checkpoints|last=hermesauto|date=2018-01-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Marvin Sim became the Commissioner of ICA.

The organisation's values remain unchanged.\n\n==== 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic ====\nICA officers became the first line of defense against the Covid-10 outbreak. The Singapore government announced travel bans on foreign visitors arriving from affected areas, temperature screening, Stay-Home Notices (SHN)  and other measures in order to contain the outbreak. \n\nStay-Home Notices were issued by ICA to travellers who were deemed to be \"at-risk\". Such travellers were not allowed to leave their house for a 14 day period, staying from the day of arrival. A man who had been issued a SHN posted on social media a photo of [[Bak kut teh|Bak Kut Teh]], a popular meat soup dish in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/03/shn-eat-bak-kut-teh-kena-warning/|title=S\u2019porean man who breached Stay-Home Notice for bak kut teh receives warning from ICA|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> ICA subsequently said that the man would be referred to the Attorney-General Chambers for further action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/follow-up-response-to-media-queries-on-man-breaching-shn-requirements-to-eat-bak-kut-teh|title=ICA {{!}} Follow-up Response To Media Queries On Man Breaching SHN Requirements To Eat Bak Kut Teh|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAs of 03 April 2020, no foreign visitors are allowed transit or entry into Singapore. All Long Term Pass Holders (i.e. foreign residents) must obtain entry approval before arriving in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19|title=ICA {{!}} Updates on Border Control Measures in Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Checkpoints ==\nBelow is a list of Singapore's ports of entries for persons, conveyances and goods.

Under the current [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Services (HAS) (ICA) Unified scheme, new junior officers and senior officers join as Direct-Entry Sergeants and Direct-Entry Inspectors respectively. Direct-Entry Sergeants range from [[Institute of Technical Education|ITE]] graduates to polytechnic diploma holders.  Direct-Entry Inspectors must be graduates from a university accredited by its home country.  New Sergeants will become Primary Screening Officers, while Inspectors will become Team Leaders in their foundation posting. Regardless, all new officers will be posted to Tuas, Woodlands or Coastal Command.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_position|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAll ICA direct-entry Sergeants and Inspectors must attend and pass the ICA Basic Course which is held regularly at the [[Home Team Academy]]. The Basic Course includes lessons on document examination, basic unarmed combat and basic firearms training. The Basic Course lasts twenty weeks for Direct-Entry Inspectors <ref name=\":1\" /> and sixteen weeks for Direct-Entry Sergeants.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both courses are non-residential, are fully paid-for the duration of the courses and trainees will receive their substantive rank pay as well. In return, officers have to serve bonds of one to two years after graduation. Direct-Entry Sergeants also receive sign-on bonuses and retention pay-outs. To remain in service, officers will have to pass law examinations and a firearms shooting test.\n\nAdvanced courses are also conducted by ICA's Training Command. Direct Entry Sergeants are typically trained into specialists in different fields such as profiling, cargo examination and firearms shooting. Senior officers will first be exposed to ICA's ground operations before being sent to enforcement, service or staff units. Overseas postings at Singapore's consulates are also available. Furthermore, suitable officers at any level below that of Inspector may also secure scholarships and promotion into the rank of senior officers as part of the new unified scheme.\n\nThere is also a separate scheme for Management Executives who are deployed to the Services Centres. These officers are not considered immigration officers and do not don the blue uniform.\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nBefore the merger, both SIR and CED had their own distinct rank progression. However, they were similar in that there was a separate scheme for Senior and Junior officers. This continued to be the case post-merger until 2017.\n\nSince 2017, ICA officer ranks have fallen under the HAS (ICA) Unified scheme.<ref>https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2017.pdf</ref> All Immigration Officers are placed under this scheme regardless of education level.\n\nAs part of the unified scheme, the ranks of Corporal and Staff Sergeant were collapsed into a single Sergeant rank with numerical increments. The ranks of Senior Checkpoint Inspector were removed and suitable Checkpoint Inspectors would be promoted to Inspectors instead.

In practice, only qualified officers serving in protective security related roles are issued firearms.\n\nThe service firearm is the 5-shot [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Other equipment include [[handcuffs]], [[Plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable batons]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nIn the early 1970s, Singapore Immigration had a brown and cream uniform. The colour of the uniforms did not vary for more than 20 years, with only modifications in style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_faf|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> In 1997, uniforms in green and white were introduced.\n\nIn 1996, the Customs uniforms and accessories were changed to a shade of blue reminiscent of the current design.\n\nIn 2003, the uniform was updated to its current design. The uniform became Navy Blue, which was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team.\n\nThe uniform comes in different designs to suit the varied operating environments of ICA. The basic field uniform consists of a short-sleeved dress shirt and pants with a dress or [[Police duty belt|duty belt]] as appropriate. This uniform can be most often seen in the Land and Sea checkpoints. Senior officers typically wear a [[Safari jacket|bush jacket]] (for men) or a tunic (for women). A dress skirt is also available for female staff officer. Air Domain officers working at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] wear two-piece suits with ties to conform with airport guidelines, while sea-going clearance team officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms that resemble the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]]'s Number 4 uniform. Cargo examination officers are issued [[polo shirt]]s due to their warm operational environment.\n\nIn 2016, a distinctive ICC domain insignia was designed for each domain to serve as a symbol of common identity for all HT officers operating in the domain. The domain insignia also encourages a greater sense of belonging and closer collaboration among Home Team officers.<ref name=\"ica badges\" />\n\n=== Technology ===\nICA integrates [[information technology]] to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travelers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at ICA's land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycles.\n\nIn 2018, the ICA released the MyICA app which allowed citizens to process multiple transactions in a single payment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myica-e-services-web-portal-passport-entry-visa-applications-10482494|title=ICA launches web portal for passport, entry visa applications|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt ICA's 2019 Workplan Seminar, the New Clearance Concept was introduced. Foreigners would be allowed to use ICA's automated immigration gates upon arrival. They would fill in an electronic disembarkation card or e-DE card. Singaporeans will no longer have to present their passports or their thumbprints for immigration clearance at the automated gates. Instead, facial recognition technology will be utilised.<ref>{{Citation|last=ICAOutreach|title=New Clearance Concept|date=2019-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq803fcfU5s|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, ICA announced the cessation of physical embarkation cards. Arriving travellers would be directed to use the SG Arrival Card, an electronic embarkation card with apps in [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|Apple's App Store]]. In view of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] outbreak, all travellers entering Singapore from 27 March 2020 were to fill in electronic health cards integrated into the SG Arrival Card website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service|title=ICA {{!}} All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Biometric verification ====\nICA has progressively implemented the use of biometric verification to improve security at its checkpoints. ICA employs the use of biometry to find persons of interests and has deployed a suitcase sized facial recognition system to different checkpoints <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.htx.gov.sg/news/featured-news-identifying-a-face-amongst-thousands-at-our-borders|title=[Featured News] Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders|website=HTX|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the Checkpoint Access Cards used fingerprint data to facilitate entry.\n\nIn October 2006, ICA began issuing biometric passports to Singapore citizens.

At its Kallang Road headquarters, services are provided from \"cradle to grave\", starting from birth registration to the issuance of identity cards and finally to the registering of deaths.

Immigration officers are authorised to act on behalf of the Controller of Immigration (who is de facto the Commissioner of ICA). Officers may also be empowered as registration officers under the [https://sso.agc.gov.sg/Act/NRA1965 National Registration Act] (Cap 201).\n\nImmigration officers can prohibit entry to any person or class of persons for any reason related to the conditions of Singapore.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.thanhniennews.com/travel/singapore-explains-why-many-vietnamese-women-have-been-denied-entry-49360.html|title=Singapore explains why many Vietnamese women have been denied entry|date=2015-07-26|work=Thanh Nien Daily|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref>  Since 2018, immigration officers have limited policing powers within the checkpoints and in their immediate vicinity.<ref name=\":2\" /> Under the ICC concept, ICA is ultimately responsible for border security at Singapore's checkpoints.\n\nTo facilitate entry for [[Alien (law)|aliens]] arriving in Singapore, ICA issues a variety of passes.

The Registry of Births and Deaths is also under the Citizen Services Centre.\n\nThe Permanent Resident Centre issues the blue NRIC for permanent residents as well as entry and re-entry permits.\n\nThe Visitor Services Centre issues visit pass extensions, visas and long term visit passes.\n\n=== Structure ===\nICA is divided into staff and line units. Staff units are involved in manpower, training and corporate services. Line units deal with the front-line operations of ICA. The senior executive management is called the Leadership Group (LG).<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica-annual-2018-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20ANNUAL%202004.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2004|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n[[File:OrgChart.jpg|center|thumb|987x987px|ICA organization chart.

Entry control began when the [[Crown colony|colonial government]] enacted the Quarantine and Prevention of Disease Ordinance in 1915.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_si|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-11}}</ref>  In 1933, the Immigration Department was established to administer the Aliens Ordinance which placed quotas on newcomers entering Singapore. This effectively ended the freedom of travel in Singapore.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":4\">{{cite book | title=Policing | publisher=Straits Times Press | author=Asad Latif | year=2017 | location=Singapore | pages=80\u201386 | isbn=978-981-47-4720-2}}</ref>\n\nOrdinance No. 5 of 1952 (The Immigration Ordinance) came into force on 1 August 1953, setting the foundation of immigration law in Singapore. The Immigration Ordinance was amended in 1959 after Singapore was granted sovereignty. The amendment gave Singaporeans the right of entry into the Colony.<ref name=\":4\" /> A new Immigration Depot was built at Telok Ayer Basin (East Wharf) while the head office was moved to Empress Place Building. Round-the-clock immigration clearance for [[Ship|vessels]] was started 1 June 1961.\n\nBirth registration started in 1872 which was then used for health and statistical purposes. However, by 1938 registration of births became compulsory by [[Law of Singapore|law]]. At the start of the second World War, the British introduced paper identity cards for the first time. This was suspended after the British surrender in 1945. The colonial government began issuing identity cards again in 1948 to counter the [[Communism|communist]] [[Malayan Emergency|insurgency]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_nrd|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-07}}</ref> The desire to limit the entry of those who might have communist sympathies extended to the creation of a new Immigration Bill in 1950. When Singapore merged with Malaya, [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to form the Federation of [[Malaysia]] in 1963, immigration came under the jurisdiction of the federal government and the Immigration Department became a federal agency in [[Kuala Lumpur]].\n\n==== Customs and Excise ====\nCustoms control was started when the Monopolies Department was founded in 1910 to collect excise duties on goods such as [[hard liquor]]s and [[opium]]. In 1916, the colonial government began taxing [[tobacco products]] on import to raise funds for the war effort.<ref name=\"history\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_ced|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-07-05}}</ref>  In 1932, the Customs headquarters was shifted to the Customs House from Cecil Street.  The Excise Department replaced the Monopolies Department in 1936 and in 1938, the Excise Department was renamed the Department of Customs & Excise.<ref name=\"history\"/>\n\n=== Post-independence (1965 - 2002) ===\n\n==== Stricter immigration control ====\nAfter Singapore separated from Malaysia on 9 August 1965, freedom of movement continued to exist between the two countries for a short period of time. Two [[border checkpoint]]s were gazetted for travel between the two countries. They were the [[Tanjong Pagar Railway Station]] and the [[Woodlands Checkpoint]]. Malaysians had to produce [[identity card]]s to be able to enter Singapore, until passports were required on both sides in July 1967. To travel to [[Peninsular Malaysia]], the Singapore restricted passport and the Singapore Certificate of Identity was required. The Restricted Passport Centre was at [[South Quay]] and was moved to [[Outram Road]] in 1976, but closed on 31 December 1994.\n\nIn the 1970s, illegal immigration and over-stayers became a serious problem in Singapore. A task force was set up in 1974 to deal with the immigration problem. Laws were introduced that allowed immigration officers to seize and detain vessels and vehicles used to convey illegal immigrants. Those who harboured or employed illegal immigrants could also be punished. Data on foreigners' movements within Singapore were processed by the new Immigration Data Processing Centre.\n\nThe Last Port Clearance was introduced in 1980 to attract more passenger liners to Singapore.\n\nA passport office was opened at Joo Chiat Complex in 1984. This office issued both international and restricted passports and was closed in 1999. The Immigration Department moved its head office to the Pidemco Centre in June 1986. Immigration officers were also deployed to places such as [[India]] and Hong Kong to open consulates and [[high commission]]s. All passports issued by Singapore immigration after 1990 were computerised and machine-readable. The Entry and Exit Control Integrated System implemented in the early 1990s was a computerized immigration system that was used at checkpoints to speed up the processing of travellers. A hotline for information was set up in 1992, with restricted access to countries lifted.\n\n==== National Registration Office ====\nThe independence of Singapore in 1965 brought with it the National Registration Act in 1966. The distinctive pink identity cards were issued for the first time. The National Registration Office (NRO) replaced the former Registry of Persons.\n\n==== At the time, the NRO and the [[Registry of Births and Deaths]] (RBD) came under the former Ministry of Labour. The Registry of Societies (ROS), Martial Arts Control Unit (MACU) came under the Ministry of Home Affairs. On 16 October 1981, the NRO, RBD, ROC, MACU and ROS merged to form the National Registration Department (NRD). The NRD consisted of four registries: the Registry of Births and Deaths, the Registry of Citizens, the Registry of Societies and the National Registration Office. The NRD was located at the [[Empress Place Building]] until 1986 when the building was transformed into the now defunct Empress Place Museum. ====\n\n==== Customs and Excise Department ====\n[[Tobacco]], [[liquor]], [[motor vehicle]]s and [[petroleum]] became restricted goods after Singapore was granted independence as a sovereign nation. The Customs and Excise Department ([[Singapore Customs|CED]]) cooperated closely with other government agencies such as the Agri-Food & Veterinary Authority and the Central Narcotics Bureau. When the [[Goods and Services Tax (Singapore)|GST]] was introduced in 1994, the work scope of the CED was expanded. The red and green channel customs system was implemented in 1991 at [[Singapore Changi Airport]] and at sea checkpoints.\n\nThe CED was located first at [[Cecil Street]] from 1910 till 1932 and later the White House at Maxwell Road from 1932 until 1989 when it moved to [[World Trade Centre, Singapore|World Trade Centre]] (now [[HarbourFront Centre]]).\n\n==== Singapore Immigration and Registration ====\nIn 1995, the Immigration Department was renamed Singapore Immigration. An immigration checkpoint was established at the Changi Ferry Terminal in May that year. There was a change in the passport application and collection in the 1990s, reducing the need for applicants to report to the building. To further reduce that need, applications by mail and internet were introduced and rebates were given for such applications.\n\nA new logo was launched by then-[[Minister for Home Affairs (Singapore)|Minister for Home Affairs]] [[Wong Kan Seng]] at the [[foundation stone]] ceremony for the SI Building in 1995. The West Coast Barter Trade Centre closed in June 1995. Singaporeans were sent renewal forms for passports nine months before their passports expired.\n\nSI became an autonomous agency in 1996 as well as launching its first website. All immigration offices moved from the Pidemco Centre to the new building at Kallang Road in 1997. The Singapore Immigration and the National Registration Department merged to form Singapore Immigration & Registration in 1998. A new land checkpoint at Tuas was opened on 2 January.\n\n=== 21st century: Merger and integration (2003 - Present) ===\nOn 1 April 2003, SIR and the border control functions of CED were merged to form ICA in response to the [[September 11 attacks|9/11 attacks]] and the [[Jemaah Islamiyah]] plots. The remaining functions of the CED was reorganised and renamed into Singapore Customs. ICA was to be part of the Home Team and a new, blue uniform was introduced to reflect that change. The first Commissioner of ICA was Lock Wai Han, who was in the Singapore Police Force before he oversaw the merger of the two agencies.\n\nICA's first major challenge came with the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic in 2003, testing the agency's ability to control Singapore's borders and screen passengers for contagious diseases.\n\nIn 2005, the then-Director CNB Eric Tan became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\nIn 2010, Deputy Commissioner Clarence Yeo became the Commissioner of ICA.\n\n==== Integrated Checkpoints Command ====\nOn 2 January 2015, the Integrated Checkpoints Command concept was introduced. Under the Integrated Checkpoints Command, ICA checkpoints are split into three domains: Land, Sea and Air.  Each domain is headed by a Domain Commander who reports directly to the Commissioner.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/cms/files/ICA%20AR%202015-FINAL-web.pdf|title=ICA Annual 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=ICA website|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>  All Home Team agencies deployed at the checkpoints must report to the Domain Commander.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/ica-launches-integrated-checkpoints-command-to-strengthen-coordination-among-agencies|title=ICA launches Integrated Checkpoints Command to strengthen coordination among agencies|last=migration|date=2015-01-02|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 30 March 2017, it was announced that Woodlands Town Centre would be absorbed by the new Woodlands Checkpoint extension.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/woodlands-checkpoint-to-be-expanded-to-old-woodlands-town-centre|title=Woodlands Checkpoint to be extended to Old Woodlands Town Centre; two land plots to be acquired|last=hermesauto|date=2017-03-30|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-07-11|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 1 April 2018 the amended Immigration Act was introduced. ICA officers would now perform roles as first responders. The amendment gave immigration officers the legal powers of police officers in relation to offences committed in the vicinity of checkpoints.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/politics/parliament-ica-officers-get-enhanced-powers-to-conduct-searches-arrest-people-at|title=Parliament: ICA officers get enhanced powers to conduct searches, arrest people at checkpoints|last=hermesauto|date=2018-01-08|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOn 3 September 2018, Marvin Sim became the Commissioner of ICA. He was previously senior director of Joint Operations Group at MHA and deputy director at CNB.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/leadership-changes-at-ica-and-home-team-academy-10577146|title=Leadership changes at ICA and Home Team Academy|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-09-21|language=en-GB}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 May 2019 during its Work Plan Seminar, ICA announced its new crest, mission and vision. The organisation's values remain unchanged.\n\n==== 2020 Covid-19 Pandemic ====\nICA officers became the first line of defense against the Covid-10 outbreak. The Singapore government announced travel bans on foreign visitors arriving from affected areas, temperature screening, Stay-Home Notices (SHN)  and other measures in order to contain the outbreak. \n\nStay-Home Notices were issued by ICA to travellers who were deemed to be \"at-risk\". Such travellers were not allowed to leave their house for a 14 day period, staying from the day of arrival. A man who had been issued a SHN posted on social media a photo of [[Bak kut teh|Bak Kut Teh]], a popular meat soup dish in Singapore.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2020/03/shn-eat-bak-kut-teh-kena-warning/|title=S\u2019porean man who breached Stay-Home Notice for bak kut teh receives warning from ICA|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> ICA subsequently said that the man would be referred to the Attorney-General Chambers for further action.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/follow-up-response-to-media-queries-on-man-breaching-shn-requirements-to-eat-bak-kut-teh|title=ICA {{!}} Follow-up Response To Media Queries On Man Breaching SHN Requirements To Eat Bak Kut Teh|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nAs of 03 April 2020, no foreign visitors are allowed transit or entry into Singapore. All Long Term Pass Holders (i.e. foreign residents) must obtain entry approval before arriving in Singapore. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/covid-19|title=ICA {{!}} Updates on Border Control Measures in Response to COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019)|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n== Checkpoints ==\nBelow is a list of Singapore's ports of entries for persons, conveyances and goods.

Under the current [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Singapore)|Home Affairs]] Services (HAS) (ICA) Unified scheme, new junior officers and senior officers join as Direct-Entry Sergeants and Direct-Entry Inspectors respectively. Direct-Entry Sergeants range from [[Institute of Technical Education|ITE]] graduates to polytechnic diploma holders.  Direct-Entry Inspectors must be graduates from a university accredited by its home country.  New Sergeants will become Primary Screening Officers, while Inspectors will become Team Leaders in their foundation posting. Regardless, all new officers will be posted to Tuas, Woodlands or Coastal Command.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_position|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-03-31}}</ref>\n\nAll ICA direct-entry Sergeants and Inspectors must attend and pass the ICA Basic Course which is held regularly at the [[Home Team Academy]]. The Basic Course includes lessons on document examination, basic unarmed combat and basic firearms training. The Basic Course lasts twenty weeks for Direct-Entry Inspectors <ref name=\":1\" /> and sixteen weeks for Direct-Entry Sergeants.<ref name=\":1\" /> Both courses are non-residential, are fully paid-for the duration of the courses and trainees will receive their substantive rank pay as well. In return, officers have to serve bonds of one to two years after graduation. Direct-Entry Sergeants also receive sign-on bonuses and retention pay-outs. To remain in service, officers will have to pass law examinations and a firearms shooting test.\n\nAdvanced courses are also conducted by ICA's Training Command. Direct Entry Sergeants are typically trained into specialists in different fields such as profiling, cargo examination and firearms shooting. Senior officers will first be exposed to ICA's ground operations before being sent to enforcement, service or staff units. Overseas postings at Singapore's consulates are also available. Furthermore, suitable officers at any level below that of Inspector may also secure scholarships and promotion into the rank of senior officers as part of the new unified scheme.\n\nThere is also a separate scheme for Management Executives who are deployed to the Services Centres. These officers are not considered immigration officers and do not don the blue uniform.\n\n=== Ranks ===\n\nBefore the merger, both SIR and CED had their own distinct rank progression. However, they were similar in that there was a separate scheme for Senior and Junior officers. This continued to be the case post-merger until 2017.\n\nSince 2017, ICA officer ranks have fallen under the HAS (ICA) Unified scheme.<ref>https://www.ica.gov.sg/docs/default-source/ica/ica-annuals/ica_annual_2017.pdf</ref> All Immigration Officers are placed under this scheme regardless of education level.\n\nAs part of the unified scheme, the ranks of Corporal and Staff Sergeant were collapsed into a single Sergeant rank with numerical increments. The ranks of Senior Checkpoint Inspector were removed and suitable Checkpoint Inspectors would be promoted to Inspectors instead. A new rank, Deputy Assistant Commissioner was added to provide more opportunities for officers at the [[middle management]] level.\n\nAt present, ICA ranks follow those in the [[Singapore Police Force]] with some exceptions in insignia and naming (see table below).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/careers/careers_joinica|title=ICA -

In practice, only qualified officers serving in protective security related roles are issued firearms.\n\nThe service firearm is the 5-shot [[Taurus Model 85]] revolver. Other equipment include [[handcuffs]], [[Plastic handcuffs|flexicuffs]] and [[Baton (law enforcement)|expandable batons]].\n\n=== Uniform ===\nIn the early 1970s, Singapore Immigration had a brown and cream uniform. The colour of the uniforms did not vary for more than 20 years, with only modifications in style.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/aboutus/aboutus_history_faf|title=ICA - Immigration & Checkpoints Authority of Singapore|website=www.ica.gov.sg|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}</ref> In 1997, uniforms in green and white were introduced.\n\nIn 1996, the Customs uniforms and accessories were changed to a shade of blue reminiscent of the current design.\n\nIn 2003, the uniform was updated to its current design. The uniform became Navy Blue, which was chosen to establish ICA as a member of the Home Team.\n\nThe uniform comes in different designs to suit the varied operating environments of ICA. The basic field uniform consists of a short-sleeved dress shirt and pants with a dress or [[Police duty belt|duty belt]] as appropriate. This uniform can be most often seen in the Land and Sea checkpoints. Senior officers typically wear a [[Safari jacket|bush jacket]] (for men) or a tunic (for women). A dress skirt is also available for female staff officer. Air Domain officers working at [[Singapore Changi Airport|Changi Airport]] wear two-piece suits with ties to conform with airport guidelines, while sea-going clearance team officers wear long-sleeve coastal uniforms that resemble the [[Singapore Armed Forces|SAF]]'s Number 4 uniform. Cargo examination officers are issued [[polo shirt]]s due to their warm operational environment.\n\nIn 2016, a distinctive ICC domain insignia was designed for each domain to serve as a symbol of common identity for all HT officers operating in the domain. The domain insignia also encourages a greater sense of belonging and closer collaboration among Home Team officers.<ref name=\"ica badges\" />\n\n=== Technology ===\nICA integrates [[information technology]] to streamline the entry and exit procedure at checkpoints. Singapore citizens, permanent residents and other registered travelers can use automated lanes called enhanced-Immigration Automated Clearance System (eIACS). The Biometric Identification of Motorbikers (BIKES) System at ICA's land checkpoints can be used by residents and work pass holders entering and leaving Singapore by motorcycles.\n\nIn 2018, the ICA released the MyICA app which allowed citizens to process multiple transactions in a single payment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/myica-e-services-web-portal-passport-entry-visa-applications-10482494|title=ICA launches web portal for passport, entry visa applications|work=Channel NewsAsia|access-date=2018-07-04|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nAt ICA's 2019 Workplan Seminar, the New Clearance Concept was introduced. Foreigners would be allowed to use ICA's automated immigration gates upon arrival. They would fill in an electronic disembarkation card or e-DE card. Singaporeans will no longer have to present their passports or their thumbprints for immigration clearance at the automated gates. Instead, facial recognition technology will be utilised.<ref>{{Citation|last=ICAOutreach|title=New Clearance Concept|date=2019-05-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wq803fcfU5s|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref>\n\nIn 2020, ICA announced the cessation of physical embarkation cards. Arriving travellers would be directed to use the SG Arrival Card, an electronic embarkation card with apps in [[Google Play]] and [[App Store (iOS)|Apple's App Store]]. In view of the [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] outbreak, all travellers entering Singapore from 27 March 2020 were to fill in electronic health cards integrated into the SG Arrival Card website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ica.gov.sg/news-and-publications/media-releases/media-release/all-travellers-arriving-in-singapore-from-27-march-2020-0900-hours-must-submit-health-declaration-via-the-sg-arrival-card-e-service|title=ICA {{!}} All Travellers Arriving In Singapore From 27 March 2020, 0900 Hours, Must Submit Health Declaration Via The SG Arrival Card E-Service|website=www.ica.gov.sg|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Biometric verification ====\nICA has progressively implemented the use of biometric verification to improve security at its checkpoints. ICA employs the use of biometry to find persons of interests and has deployed a suitcase sized facial recognition system to different checkpoints <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.htx.gov.sg/news/featured-news-identifying-a-face-amongst-thousands-at-our-borders|title=[Featured News] Identifying a Face amongst Thousands at Our Borders|website=HTX|language=en|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 1997, the Checkpoint Access Cards used fingerprint data to facilitate entry.\n\nIn October 2006, ICA began issuing biometric passports to Singapore citizens. In October 2017, ICA started issuance of new biometric passports that comes with additional security features.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/new-design-for-singapore-passport-with-additional-security-features-ica|title=New design for Singapore passport with additional security features: ICA|last=hermesauto|date=2017-10-26|work=The Straits Times|access-date=2018-06-17|language=en}}</ref> This marked the second series of biometrics passports issued by Singapore.

In the meantime, Axis mortars had opened fire along the whole front and the other two columns had started moving forward: the two German grenadier battalions together with the attached company of the Italian Brescia Alpine battalion attacked successfully in the center down the Serchio valley, east of the river. West of the river, the other Brescia companies overcame a weak initial resistance, but their opponents were already falling back and the attackers advanced to Fornaci almost without opposition. Fornaci itself fell quickly, although the two German battalions were heavily criticized for their sluggishness and lack of aggressiveness.<ref name=\"Bersaglieri\"/> The first column, however, faced more vigorous opposition on the right of the front. The elements of the San Marco division easily seized the village of Molazzano and pushed the defenders back, but the Regimental Headquarters Company suffered losses and could not take the village of Brucciano. The Cadelo Group (of the Monte Rosa Division), supported by the Intra battalion which made small diversionary attacks, occupied Calomini, but the Vergemoli garrison ([[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|370th Infantry Regiment]] and some partisan groups) could not be dislodged.

All the offensive was under leadership of Italian Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]], who promoted the attack with Mussolini.\n\nTheir objective: conquest of the small towns of [[Barga]], Sommocolonia, Vergemoli, Treppignana, Coreglia, Fornaci di Barga, Promiana, Castelvecchio and Calomini located north-west of [[Lucca]].<ref>Fiaschi, p. 93</ref>\n\nThe Order of Battle was:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://digilander.libero.it/lacorsainfinita/guerra2/44/wintergewitter.htm |title=Wintergewitter, Winter Storm, la Bastogne italiana |website=Digilander.libero.it |date=1944-10-20 |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.flamesofwar.com/Default.aspx?tabid=110&art_id=214&kb_cat_id=28 |title=Modelling |website=Flamesofwar.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-01}}</ref>\n* First column (toward Vergemoli-Calomini): Italian Alpini Intra battalion; HQ defence company of 1st Reggimento Alpini; Divisional Reconnaissance group (Monterosa Div.); Two battalion, 6th Marine Infantry Regiment (San Marco Division);\n* Second column (toward Treppignana-Castelvecchio): Italian Alpini Brescia Battalion ; 1st and 2nd battalions of 286th German Grenadier Regiment;\n* Third column (toward Sommocolonia-Barga):  German Mountain battalion Mittenwald; Groups of Kesselring battalion.\n[[File:RSI Italian soldier cleaning his weapon before the battle.jpg|thumb|RSI Italian soldier cleaning his weapon before the battle]]\nEarly on 26 December elements of the two German assault battalions from the third column attacked the Sommocolonia garrisoned by elements of Company F of the 2nd Battalion, [[366th Infantry Regiment (United States)|366th Regiment]], supported by some partisans.<ref name=\"Bersaglieri\">{{cite web| url=http://digilander.libero.it/lacorsainfinita/guerra2/44/wintergewitter.htm| title=Garfagnana and Operation Wintergewitter| work=I Bersaglieri ne la Seconda Guerra Mondiale website|accessdate=26 July 2011}}</ref> Some authors state that the resistance there was tough but quickly overwhelmed. In the morning, 200 men of the Mittenwald battalion seized the American positions south of Sommocolonia at Bebbio and Scarpello held by the 92nd Recon Troop, which withdrew to Coreglia. In the meantime, Axis mortars had opened fire along the whole front and the other two columns had started moving forward: the two German grenadier battalions together with the attached company of the Italian Brescia Alpine battalion attacked successfully in the center down the Serchio valley, east of the river. West of the river, the other Brescia companies overcame a weak initial resistance, but their opponents were already falling back and the attackers advanced to Fornaci almost without opposition. Fornaci itself fell quickly, although the two German battalions were heavily criticized for their sluggishness and lack of aggressiveness.<ref name=\"Bersaglieri\"/> The first column, however, faced more vigorous opposition on the right of the front. The elements of the San Marco division easily seized the village of Molazzano and pushed the defenders back, but the Regimental Headquarters Company suffered losses and could not take the village of Brucciano. The Cadelo Group (of the Monte Rosa Division), supported by the Intra battalion which made small diversionary attacks, occupied Calomini, but the Vergemoli garrison ([[370th Infantry Regiment (United States)|370th Infantry Regiment]] and some partisan groups) could not be dislodged. Under threat of encirclement and being cut off it eventually withdrew leaving in place a partisan group as a covering party.<ref name=\"Bersaglieri\"/>\n\nBy 27 December the limited offensive was over. In the morning, the German assault troops entered Pian di Coreglia, their final objective and Italian patrols went forward as far as the village of [[Calavorno]], reporting that the enemy still was in full retreat. The other columns had also reached their objective points, and an entire Allied division had been routed.<ref name=\"Bersaglieri\"/> Over 250 prisoners were captured with many weapons, food and equipment.<ref>{{cite book| last=Arena| first=Nino| title=R.S.I.

It had been a success with a penetration of more than 25 kilometres inside the Allies lines.\n\nAs troops of the 92nd Division streamed back, they were ordered to take up positions on the left flank of the Indian positions. All Allied troops forming the defence were placed under command of Major General Russell, the 8th Indian Division commander. However, the Axis objectives were short of the Indian line and so the Axis attack was not pressed forward. By late afternoon on December 27, all objectives having been attained, the offensive ended and by the following day the Axis troops were pulling back towards their start lines with the withdrawal being completed by 30 December.<ref name=\"Jackson, p. 128\"/>  The 8th Indian Divisions performed a bloodless advance simply following on the Axis retreat and no fighting took place.

But the air superiority of the Allies stopped any further Axis attack to break south of the Gothic line.\n\nFascist propaganda of the RSI gave huge importance to the Offensive in Garfagnana, claiming it was a small Italian version of the [[Ardennes Offensive]] that happened in the same December 1944.<ref name=\"PellegrinettiX\"/>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Gothic Line]]\n* [[Gothic Line order of battle]]\n* [[Italian Campaign (World War II)]]\n* [[Rodolfo Graziani]]\n* [[Military history of Italy during World War II]]\n* [[92nd Infantry Division]]\n* [[John R.

Its summer months are typically dry, often resulting in moderate [[drought]] conditions, usually in July and August. In contrast, the rest of the year is [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainy]], especially between October and March.\n\nLike the rest of the [[British Columbia Coast]], the city is tempered by the [[North Pacific Current]], which has its origins in the milder [[Kuroshio Current]] and is also, to an extent, sheltered by the [[Vancouver Island Ranges|mountains of Vancouver Island]] to the west.\n\n==General conditions==\nThe climatology of Vancouver applies to the entire [[Metro Vancouver|Greater Vancouver region]] and not just to the City of Vancouver itself. While Vancouver's coastal location serves to moderate its temperatures, [[sea breeze]]s and mountainous terrain make Greater Vancouver a region of [[microclimate]]s, with local variations in weather sometimes being more exaggerated than those experienced in other coastal areas.\n\nPredicting [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the Greater Vancouver area is particularly complex. It is a rule of thumb that for every rise of {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} in elevation, there is an additional {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1.2|in|abbr=on||order=flip|disp=sqbr}} per {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on||order=flip|disp=sqbr}}) of precipitation, so places such as the [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|District of North Vancouver]] on the [[North Shore Mountains]] get more rain. [[Snow]] is problematic for [[Meteorology|meteorologists]] to predict due to temperatures remaining close to freezing during snow events.\n\n===Temperatures===\nThe average annual temperature in Vancouver is {{convert|11.0|C|1}} downtown and {{convert|10.4|C|1}} at YVR airport in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]. This is one of the warmest in Canada. Greater Vancouver is in [[Hardiness zone|USDA plant hardiness zone]] 8,<ref name=\"Richter's\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richters.com/show.cgi?page=Zones/NA.html|title= Plant Hardiness Zone Map for North America}}</ref> similar to other coastal or near-coastal cities such as [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Amsterdam]], and [[London]], as well as places such as [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], far to the south (though these locations have far more growing degree days due to their much warmer summers). The semi-mild climate sustains plants such as the [[Windmill Palm]]. Vancouver's [[growing season]] averages 221 days, from March 29 until November 5. This is 72 days longer than [[Toronto]]'s, and longer than any other major urban centre in Canada.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title=Frost Chart for Canada\n| publisher=The Old Farmers Almanac\n| url=http://www.almanac.com/content/frost-chart-canada\n| accessdate=2012-10-01}}\n</ref>\n\nDespite normally semi-mild winters due to the onshore air flow over the North Pacific Current, occasional cold arctic outflows (sinking cold continental air that flows down through the [[Fraser Valley]] coastward) in winter can sometimes last a week or more. These arctic outflows occur on average one to three times per winter. The coldest month on record at [[Vancouver International Airport]] was January 1950 when an arctic air inflow moved in from the Fraser Valley and remained locked over the city, with an average low of {{convert|-9.7|\u00b0C|0}} and an average high of only {{convert|-2.9|\u00b0C|0}}, making for a daily average of {{convert|-6.3|\u00b0C|1}}, {{convert|10|C-change|0}} colder than normal. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was {{convert|-18.3|\u00b0C|0}} on December 29, 1968.<ref>{{cite web\n| title=Weather Data \u2013 VANCOUVER UBC\n| publisher=Environment Canada\n| url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1957-09-01%7C1995-06-30&mlyRange=1957-01-01%7C1995-06-01&StationID=903&Prov=BC&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=1970&selRowPerPage=25&Line=42&searchMethod=contains&Month=12&Day=1&txtStationName=vancouver&timeframe=2&Year=1968\n| accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> The coldest temperature across Metro Vancouver, however, is {{convert|-23.3|\u00b0C|0}} recorded on January 23, 1969.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title=Weather Data \u2013 PITT POLDER\n| publisher=Environment Canada\n| url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1951-11-01%7C2010-01-31&mlyRange=1951-01-01%7C2007-02-01&StationID=842&Prov=BC&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=1&Day=1&txtStationName=pitt+polder&timeframe=2&Year=1969\n| accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith snow being an infrequent occurrence over a typically mild winter, many cold hardy flowers remain in bloom and are common in gardens and office exteriors throughout the winter. The arrival of spring is often first noticed in February with slightly milder temperatures and the return of flowering perennials. It's also not uncommon for cherry trees to begin blooming later in the month, as was seen prominently during the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Greater Vancouver region is also subject to significant variations in summer temperatures, which can differ by as much as {{convert|5|\u2013|10|C-change|0}} between inland areas of the Fraser Valley and the ocean-tempered coastal regions when localized on-shore breezes are in effect. Conversely, winter temperatures tend to be cooler inland by a couple of degrees.\n\n===Daylight===\nThe relatively high [[latitude]] of 49\u00b0 15\u2032 0\u2033 N (similar to [[Paris]], France, at 48\u00b0 85\u2032 66\u2033) means [[sunset]]s as early as 4:15 pm and [[sunrise]]s as late as 8:10 am. From November to February, at the sunshine measuring station at the airport in Richmond, on average more than 70% of the already short daytime is completely cloudy. The percentage of cloudiness is higher in Vancouver and especially the [[North Shore (Greater Vancouver)|North Shore]] because upslope winds going up the mountainsides lead to the development of clouds.\n\nSummers, in contrast, are characterized by a nearly opposite weather pattern, with consistent high pressure and sunshine. July and August are the sunniest months. Near the summer [[solstice]], there are less than 8 hours between sunset and sunrise, with [[twilight]] lasting past 10 pm.\n\n==Statistics==\n\n{{Vancouver weatherbox}}\n\n{{Weather box\n|location =

Summers can be quite dry, and, as such, grass that has not been watered may not need to be cut for a month or even longer. Some summers may have no rain for five weeks or more, while others might have several very wet days in a row. In addition, Vancouver is one of the driest cities in Canada during the summer season, but the rest of the year the high pressure that locks in during the summer moves out and is replaced by the usual low pressure systems (rainy weather) by fall through to mid-spring.\n\nJuly is historically the driest month in Vancouver and, in fact, Vancouver International Airport recorded no rainfall at all during the whole month of July 2013;<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/driest-july-ever-in-vancouver-record-rain-in-toronto-1.1343906 Driest July ever in Vancouver, record rain in Toronto]</ref> the first time ever in recorded history.

The City budgets $400,000 per year for the maintenance of snow removal equipment, for the purchasing of [[deicing]] [[salt]], and for the training of staff, but the costs of actual snow removal are funded separately from contingency reserve funds, and vary widely from season to season.

Its summer months are typically dry, often resulting in moderate [[drought]] conditions, usually in July and August. In contrast, the rest of the year is [[Precipitation (meteorology)|rainy]], especially between October and March.\n\nLike the rest of the [[British Columbia Coast]], the city is tempered by the [[North Pacific Current]], which has its origins in the milder [[Kuroshio Current]] and is also, to an extent, sheltered by the [[Vancouver Island Ranges|mountains of Vancouver Island]] to the west.\n\n==General conditions==\nThe climatology of Vancouver applies to the entire [[Metro Vancouver|Greater Vancouver region]] and not just to the City of Vancouver itself. While Vancouver's coastal location serves to moderate its temperatures, [[sea breeze]]s and mountainous terrain make Greater Vancouver a region of [[microclimate]]s, with local variations in weather sometimes being more exaggerated than those experienced in other coastal areas.\n\nPredicting [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] in the Greater Vancouver area is particularly complex. It is a rule of thumb that for every rise of {{convert|100|m|abbr=on}} in elevation, there is an additional {{convert|100|mm|abbr=on}} ({{convert|1.2|in|abbr=on||order=flip|disp=sqbr}} per {{convert|100|ft|abbr=on||order=flip|disp=sqbr}}) of precipitation, so places such as the [[North Vancouver (district municipality)|District of North Vancouver]] on the [[North Shore Mountains]] get more rain. [[Snow]] is problematic for [[Meteorology|meteorologists]] to predict due to temperatures remaining close to freezing during snow events.\n\n===Temperatures===\nThe average annual temperature in Vancouver is {{convert|11.0|C|1}} downtown and {{convert|10.4|C|1}} at YVR airport in [[Richmond, British Columbia|Richmond]]. This is one of the warmest in Canada. Greater Vancouver is in [[Hardiness zone|USDA plant hardiness zone]] 8,<ref name=\"Richter's\">{{cite web|url=http://www.richters.com/show.cgi?page=Zones/NA.html|title= Plant Hardiness Zone Map for North America}}</ref> similar to other coastal or near-coastal cities such as [[Seattle]], [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]], [[Amsterdam]], and [[London]], as well as places such as [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]] and [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], far to the south (though these locations have far more growing degree days due to their much warmer summers). The semi-mild climate sustains plants such as the [[Windmill Palm]]. Vancouver's [[growing season]] averages 221 days, from March 29 until November 5. This is 72 days longer than [[Toronto]]'s, and longer than any other major urban centre in Canada.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title=Frost Chart for Canada\n| publisher=The Old Farmers Almanac\n| url=http://www.almanac.com/content/frost-chart-canada\n| accessdate=2012-10-01}}\n</ref>\n\nDespite normally semi-mild winters due to the onshore air flow over the North Pacific Current, occasional cold arctic outflows (sinking cold continental air that flows down through the [[Fraser Valley]] coastward) in winter can sometimes last a week or more. These arctic outflows occur on average one to three times per winter. The coldest month on record at [[Vancouver International Airport]] was January 1950 when an arctic air inflow moved in from the Fraser Valley and remained locked over the city, with an average low of {{convert|-9.7|\u00b0C|0}} and an average high of only {{convert|-2.9|\u00b0C|0}}, making for a daily average of {{convert|-6.3|\u00b0C|1}}, {{convert|10|C-change|0}} colder than normal. The coldest temperature ever recorded in the city was {{convert|-18.3|\u00b0C|0}} on December 29, 1968.<ref>{{cite web\n| title=Weather Data \u2013 VANCOUVER UBC\n| publisher=Environment Canada\n| url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1957-09-01%7C1995-06-30&mlyRange=1957-01-01%7C1995-06-01&StationID=903&Prov=BC&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=1970&selRowPerPage=25&Line=42&searchMethod=contains&Month=12&Day=1&txtStationName=vancouver&timeframe=2&Year=1968\n| accessdate=22 July 2018}}</ref> The coldest temperature across Metro Vancouver, however, is {{convert|-23.3|\u00b0C|0}} recorded on January 23, 1969.<ref>\n{{cite web\n| title=Weather Data \u2013 PITT POLDER\n| publisher=Environment Canada\n| url=http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_data/daily_data_e.html?hlyRange=%7C&dlyRange=1951-11-01%7C2010-01-31&mlyRange=1951-01-01%7C2007-02-01&StationID=842&Prov=BC&urlExtension=_e.html&searchType=stnName&optLimit=yearRange&StartYear=1840&EndYear=2016&selRowPerPage=25&Line=0&searchMethod=contains&Month=1&Day=1&txtStationName=pitt+polder&timeframe=2&Year=1969\n| accessdate=17 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nWith snow being an infrequent occurrence over a typically mild winter, many cold hardy flowers remain in bloom and are common in gardens and office exteriors throughout the winter. The arrival of spring is often first noticed in February with slightly milder temperatures and the return of flowering perennials. It's also not uncommon for cherry trees to begin blooming later in the month, as was seen prominently during the 2010 Winter Olympics.\n\nThe Greater Vancouver region is also subject to significant variations in summer temperatures, which can differ by as much as {{convert|5|\u2013|10|C-change|0}} between inland areas of the Fraser Valley and the ocean-tempered coastal regions when localized on-shore breezes are in effect. Conversely, winter temperatures tend to be cooler inland by a couple of degrees.\n\n===Daylight===\nThe relatively high [[latitude]] of 49\u00b0 15\u2032 0\u2033 N (similar to [[Paris]], France, at 48\u00b0 85\u2032 66\u2033) means [[sunset]]s as early as 4:15 pm and [[sunrise]]s as late as 8:10 am. From November to February, at the sunshine measuring station at the airport in Richmond, on average more than 70% of the already short daytime is completely cloudy. The percentage of cloudiness is higher in Vancouver and especially the [[North Shore (Greater Vancouver)|North Shore]] because upslope winds going up the mountainsides lead to the development of clouds.\n\nSummers, in contrast, are characterized by a nearly opposite weather pattern, with consistent high pressure and sunshine. July and August are the sunniest months. Near the summer [[solstice]], there are less than 8 hours between sunset and sunrise, with [[twilight]] lasting past 10 pm.\n\n==Statistics==\n\n{{Vancouver weatherbox}}\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location

per year. As measured at Vancouver Airport in Richmond, Vancouver receives {{convert|1153.1|mm|abbr=on}} of rain per year. In North Vancouver, about {{convert|20|km|abbr=on}} away from the Vancouver airport, the amount of rain received doubles to {{convert|2477|mm|abbr=on}} per year as measured at the base of [[Grouse Mountain]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Osborn|first=Liz |url=http://www.currentresults.com/Weather-Extremes/Canada/wettest-cities.php |title=Canada's Rainiest Cities |publisher=CurrentResults.com |accessdate=2013-12-26}}</ref>\n\n[[Thunderstorm]]s are rare, with an average of 6.1 thunderstorm days per year.<ref name=WeatherWinners>[https://web.archive.org/web/20071101043343/http://www.on.ec.gc.ca/weather/winners/element.cfm?lang=e Weather Winners WebSites]</ref> The weather in spring and autumn is usually showery and cool.\n\nThe grass-cutting season often begins in March and continues through October. Summers can be quite dry, and, as such, grass that has not been watered may not need to be cut for a month or even longer. Some summers may have no rain for five weeks or more, while others might have several very wet days in a row. In addition, Vancouver is one of the driest cities in Canada during the summer season, but the rest of the year the high pressure that locks in during the summer moves out and is replaced by the usual low pressure systems (rainy weather) by fall through to mid-spring.\n\nJuly is historically the driest month in Vancouver and, in fact, Vancouver International Airport recorded no rainfall at all during the whole month of July 2013;<ref>[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/driest-july-ever-in-vancouver-record-rain-in-toronto-1.1343906 Driest July ever in Vancouver, record rain in Toronto]</ref> the first time ever in recorded history.

It is also common in places close to or at [[sea level]], however in lesser amounts. There is a general misconception among visitors and residents of other parts of [[Canada]] that Vancouver does not receive any snow at all, but in fact there has never been a year in which traceable snow has not been observed at Vancouver International Airport. The year 2015 marked an entire year of no measurable snow; only a trace was recorded on December 17, 2015. [[Environment Canada]] has ranked Vancouver in 3rd place under the category of \"Lowest Snowfall\" among 100 major Canadian cities as the annual average of days with snowfall above 0.2&nbsp;cm is only at 8.7 days.<ref name=\"climate.weather.gc.ca\">[http://climate.weather.gc.ca/climate_normals/results_1981_2010_e.html?searchType=stnName&txtStationName=vancouver&searchMethod=contains&txtCentralLatMin=0&txtCentralLatSec=0&txtCentralLongMin=0&txtCentralLongSec=0&stnID=889&dispBack=0 Canadian Climate Normals 1981\u20132010 Station Data \u2013 Climate \u2013 Environment Canada]</ref> Vancouver's coastal climate has nonetheless allowed it to be ranked in 59th place under the category of \"Most huge snowfall days (25 cm or more)\", placing it above cities like Calgary and Toronto as Vancouver averages 0.13 days annually with snowfall accumulations above 25&nbsp;cm (within a calendar day).<ref name=\"climate.weather.gc.ca\"/><ref name=WeatherWinners/>{{dead link|date=January 2017}}\n\nSnow in Vancouver tends to be quite wet, which, combined with typical winter temperatures rising above and falling below {{convert|0|C|abbr=on}} throughout the course of the day, can make for icy road conditions.\n\nYears or months with snowfall surpassing {{convert|100|cm|abbr=on}} are not completely exceptional.

However, even small amounts of snow in the Vancouver area can cause [[snow day|school closure]]s, as well as produce traffic problems. The low frequency of snowfall makes it hard to justify the [[public works]] [[infrastructure]] necessary for more effective [[snow removal]], as the city is usually in a thaw situation long before plowing of streets are completed. The City budgets $400,000 per year for the maintenance of snow removal equipment, for the purchasing of [[deicing]] [[salt]], and for the training of staff, but the costs of actual snow removal are funded separately from contingency reserve funds, and vary widely from season to season. For example, $1.1 million was spent in 1998, compared to $0 in 2001.<ref>[http://vancouver.ca/engsvcs/streets/snow.htm Engineering Services, Streets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> [[Blizzard]]s are extremely rare, but heavy snowfall events are more common.

The prison is operated by [[Sodexo Justice Services]].\n\n==History==\n\nForest Bank Prison was constructed on the site of the former [[Agecroft Power Station]]. The 25-year design, construct, manage and finance (DCMF) contract was won by Kalyx (formerly UKDS) in 1997 and it opened in January 2000.\n\nIn November 2002 a report from [[Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Prisons]] praised Forest Bank for its staff-prisoner relations, management structure, increased staffing levels and levels of association between inmates. However the report also noted that many of the prison staff at Forest Bank lacked experience and that there was insufficient purposeful activity, with fewer than half the prisoners engaged in meaningful work or education.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/2516977.stm|title=Mixed report for private prison|date=27 November 2002|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn 2004 it emerged that a prison officer at Forest Bank had been caught trying to sell [[heroin]] to inmates. The officer was caught with 147 wraps of the drug hidden in his shoes when he started his shift. The officer was jailed for the offence.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/nolpda/ukfs_news/hi/newsid_3747000/3747176.stm|title=Prison officer sold inmates drugs|date=15 October 2004|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2005 an inmate escaped from Forest Bank while being taken to hospital in a taxi. The prisoner was handcuffed to two prison officers as they travelled from the prison to the nearby [[Hope Hospital]], when the taxi was stopped by two men who threatened the guards with a gun, forcing them to let the inmate free.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/4313745.stm|title=Prisoner hunted after taxi escape|date=3 March 2005|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nIn December of the same year the prison was severely criticised by the Chief Inspector of Prisons for high levels of violence and drug taking amongst inmates. The inspection found that in one month alone more than 2&nbsp;kg of cannabis, 60g of heroin and 4.6g of cocaine were found at Forest Bank, and 40 per cent of compulsory drug tests were positive. The report also found a significant deterioration in safety for staff and inmates at the prison with routine intimidation of staff, prisoner assaults on other prisoners running at 25 a month and staff turnover of 25 per cent a year. There had also been 2,500 prisoner discipline hearings in six months.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article775046.ece|title=Private prison where 40% of prisoners are on drugs|author=Ford, Richard|date=21 December 2005|work=The Times}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2006 another inmate escaped from Forest Bank while visiting hospital.

The inmate cut off a section of his own ear in order to gain release from the facility in an ambulance, albeit with three prison guards in attendance. The ambulance was stopped in Agecroft Road (A6044) by a gang of armed men who released O'Donnell and made off.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/manchester/8657960.stm|title=Prisoner cuts off ear in escape bid|date=3 May 2010|work=BBC News}}</ref>\n\nO'Donnell was recaptured 28 May 2010. He was sentenced to 9\u00bd years on 29 May 2010 and was sent to HMP Strangeways. He was found hanged in his cell at HMP Strangeways Wednesday 23 June 2010.[https://www.bbc.com/news/10404201] \n\nIn November 2010 HM Chief Inspector of Prisons Nick Hardwick noted in his report on the prison that some young inmates had been tied up in their bed linen and beaten by other prisoners.  The report also acknowledged that in other matters there were many signs of improvement.<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-11714899</ref>\n\nOn 10 February 2011, former Forest Bank Prison Nurse Leanne Cartledge, 23, was sentenced to four months in prison for taking a mobile phone into the prison to give to Michael O'Donnell, with whom she was in a relationship, and which he used to help his escape.\n\nIn 2011 it emerged that three former members of staff at Forest Bank successfully sued Kalyx for unfair dismissal and their treatment by the serving deputy director of the prison.\n\nAlso in 2011 Kalyx changed their name for the second time becoming known as Sodexo Justice Services.\n\nA 2013 report from the Chief Inspector of Prisons noted that there was a need for more work, education and training to be made available, with \"over 40% of prisoners ... locked up doing nothing during the working day\".  Since inspection in 2010 there had been \"some deterioration in the quality of activity and learning and skills provided\".<ref>https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-manchester-21661954</ref>\n\n==Present day==\nHMP Forest Bank is a Category B local prison although the majority of the inmates are category C. The term ''local'' means that this prison holds people on [[Detention of suspects|remand]] to the local courts as well as sentenced prisoners. Adult inmates at Forest Bank come from the courts at [[Wigan]], [[Leigh, Greater Manchester|Leigh]], [[Bolton]] and [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]]. Young offenders come from courts at [[Manchester]], [[Oldham]], [[Stockport]], [[Trafford]], [[Tameside]], [[Rochdale]] and [[High Peak, Derbyshire|High Peak]].\n\nThe prison is divided into eight wings (A-H), a healthcare unit and a Care and Separation unit. Accommodation at the prison consists mostly of single cells, with some double cells. All the cells are designed to be safer, having almost no ligature points due to modularisation being the method of construction. The Healthcare Unit at Forest bank has a 20-bed in-patient facility, with a 24-hour nursing care service. There is also a full-time Senior Medical Officer and a Locum Medical Officer at the prison.\n\nActivities at the prison include production workshops, training workshops and vocational training courses in Motor Mechanics, Industrial [[cleaner|Cleaning]], [[Catering]] and [[Welding]]. There is a Visits Hall at Forest Bank, with facilities including a [[WRVS]] run canteen, and a play area for children aged 2\u201312 years.\n\nA prisoner has died after a suspected drug overdose.
