They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[Downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego]]. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1968 NBA draft]], the Rockets were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] and selected power forward [[Elvin Hayes]], who would lead the team to its [[1969 NBA playoffs|first playoff appearance]] in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] center [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] in [[1976\u201377 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. During the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record. Despite their losing record, they qualified for the [[1981 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Led by Malone, the Rockets stunned the entire league by making their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], becoming only the second team in NBA history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]], [[Robert Parish]], and future Rockets' head coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. {{As of|2019}}, the [[1980\u201381 Houston Rockets season|1980\u201381 Rockets]] are the last team since the [[1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers season|1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers]] to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.\n\nIn the [[1984 NBA draft]], once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second round defeat to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in [[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]]. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a franchise record 58 wins and went to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. During the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], reinforced by another All-Star, [[Clyde Drexler]], the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] of the [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.\n\nThe Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time]] (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisition of franchise player [[James Harden]] in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s.\n\n[[Moses Malone]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[James Harden]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Rockets}}\n\n===1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets===\n[[File:Elvin Hayes.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Elvin Hayes]] was selected first overall by the San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft.]]\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]] by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75&nbsp;million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]].<ref name=\"chronhistory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Owners-fans-waited-years-before-Rockets-took-off-2045395.php|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119064025/http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The NBA wanted to add more teams in the [[Western United States]], and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an [[ice hockey]] team owned by Breitbard, the [[San Diego Gulls (1966\u201374)|San Diego Gulls]].

The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms.

They compete in the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) as a member team of the league's [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]] [[Southwest Division (NBA)|Southwest Division]]. The team plays its home games at the [[Toyota Center]], located in [[Downtown Houston]]. The Rockets have won two NBA championships and four Western Conference titles. The team was established in 1967 as the '''San Diego Rockets''', an [[expansion team]] originally based in [[San Diego]]. In 1971, the Rockets [[Relocation of professional sports teams|moved]] to Houston.\n\nThe Rockets won only 15 games in their debut season as a franchise in 1967. In the [[1968 NBA draft]], the Rockets were awarded the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] and selected power forward [[Elvin Hayes]], who would lead the team to its [[1969 NBA playoffs|first playoff appearance]] in his rookie season. The Rockets did not finish a season with a winning record for almost a decade until the 1976\u201377 season, when they traded for [[List of NBA All-Stars|All-Star]] center [[Moses Malone]]. Malone went on to win the [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|NBA Most Valuable Player]] (MVP) award twice while playing with the Rockets and led Houston to the [[NBA Conference Finals|Eastern Conference Finals]] in [[1976\u201377 NBA season|his first year]] with the team. During the [[1980\u201381 NBA season|1980\u201381 season]], the Rockets finished the regular season with a 40\u201342 record. Despite their losing record, they qualified for the [[1981 NBA playoffs|playoffs]]. Led by Malone, the Rockets stunned the entire league by making their first [[NBA Finals]] appearance in [[1981 NBA Finals|1981]], becoming only the second team in NBA history to make the NBA Finals with a losing record. They would lose in six games to the 62\u201320 [[Boston Celtics]], led by [[Larry Bird]], [[Robert Parish]], and future Rockets' head coach [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]]. {{As of|2019}}, the [[1980\u201381 Houston Rockets season|1980\u201381 Rockets]] are the last team since the [[1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers season|1954\u201355 Minneapolis Lakers]] to make it all the way to the NBA Finals with a losing record.\n\nIn the [[1984 NBA draft]], once again with the first overall pick, the Rockets drafted center [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], who would become the cornerstone of the most successful period in franchise history. Paired with {{convert|7|ft|4|inch|m}} [[Ralph Sampson]], they formed one of the tallest front courts in the NBA. Nicknamed the \"Twin Towers\", they led the team to the [[1986 NBA Finals]]\u2014the second NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014where Houston was again defeated by Larry Bird and the 67-win Boston Celtics. The Rockets continued to reach the playoffs throughout the 1980s, but failed to advance past the first round for several years following a second round defeat to the [[Seattle SuperSonics]] in [[1987 NBA playoffs|1987]]. [[Rudy Tomjanovich]] took over as head coach midway through the 1991\u201392 season, ushering in the most successful period in franchise history. Led by Olajuwon, the Rockets dominated the 1993\u201394 season, setting a franchise record 58 wins and went to the [[1994 NBA Finals]]\u2014the third NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014and won the franchise's first championship against [[Patrick Ewing]] and the [[New York Knicks]]. During the [[1994\u201395 NBA season|following season]], reinforced by another All-Star, [[Clyde Drexler]], the Rockets\u2014in their fourth NBA Finals appearance in franchise history\u2014repeated as champions with a four-game [[Whitewash (sport)|sweep]] of the [[Orlando Magic]], who were led by a young [[Shaquille O'Neal]] and [[Penny Hardaway]]. Houston, which finished the season with a 47\u201335 record and was seeded sixth in the Western Conference during the 1995 playoffs, became the lowest-seeded team in NBA history to win the title.\n\nThe Rockets acquired all-star [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Charles Barkley]] in 1996, but the presence of three of the [[50 Greatest Players in NBA History|NBA's 50 greatest players of all-time]] (Olajuwon, Drexler, and Barkley) was not enough to propel Houston past the Western Conference Finals. Each one of the aging trio had left the team by 2001. The Rockets of the early 2000s, led by superstars [[Tracy McGrady]] and [[Yao Ming]], followed the trend of consistent regular season respectability followed by playoff underachievement as both players struggled with injuries. After Yao's early retirement in 2011, the Rockets entered a period of rebuilding, completely dismantling and retooling their roster. The acquisition of franchise player [[James Harden]] in 2012 has launched the Rockets back into championship contention in the mid-2010s.\n\n[[Moses Malone]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[James Harden]] have been named the NBA's [[NBA Most Valuable Player Award|Most Valuable Player]] while playing for the Rockets, for a total of four MVP awards. The Rockets, under general manager [[Daryl Morey]], are notable for popularizing the use of advanced statistical analytics (similar to [[sabermetrics]] in baseball) in player acquisitions and style of play.\n\n==Franchise history==\n{{Main|History of the Houston Rockets}}\n\n===1967\u20131971: San Diego Rockets===\n[[File:Elvin Hayes.jpg|left|upright|thumb|[[Elvin Hayes]] was selected first overall by the San Diego Rockets in the 1968 NBA Draft.]]\nThe Rockets were founded in 1967 in [[San Diego]] by Robert Breitbard, who paid an entry fee of US$1.75&nbsp;million to join the NBA as an expansion team for the [[1967\u201368 NBA season|1967\u201368 season]].<ref name=\"chronhistory\">{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/life/article/Owners-fans-waited-years-before-Rockets-took-off-2045395.php|title=Owners, fans waited years before Rockets took off|work=Houston Chronicle|date=September 20, 2001|accessdate=May 13, 2008}}</ref><ref name=uniforms>{{cite web |url=http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |title=Going Retro: Houston Rockets |publisher=NBA.com |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119064025/http://www.nba.com/history/uniforms_rockets.html |archive-date=November 19, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The NBA wanted to add more teams in the [[Western United States]], and chose San Diego based on the city's strong economic and population growth, along with the local success of an [[ice hockey]] team owned by Breitbard, the [[San Diego Gulls (1966\u201374)|San Diego Gulls]].

Road uniforms featured the city name, while the home uniforms feature the team name, both in a serifed block lettering. This was the only uniform design the Rockets would use throughout their years in San Diego. The Rockets' first logo featured a rocket streaking with a basketball surrounded by the team name.<ref name=breitbard/>\n\nUpon moving to Houston in 1971, the Rockets replaced green with red.<ref name=uniforms/> They kept the same design from their San Diego days, save for the change of color and city name. The logo used is of a player with a spinning basketball launching upward, with boosters on his back, leaving a trail of red and gold flames and the words \"Houston Rockets\" below it.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFor the 1972\u201373 season, the Rockets introduced the famous \"ketchup and mustard\" logo, so dubbed by fans, featuring a gold basketball surrounded by two red trails, with \"Houston\" atop the first red trail and \"Rockets\" (all [[capitalization|capitalized]] save for the lowercase 'E' and 'T') in black surrounding the basketball. The initial home uniforms, used until the 1975\u201376 season, features the city name, numbers and serifed player name in red with gold trim, while the away uniforms feature the city name (all capitalized except for the lower case 'T' and 'N'), numbers and serifed player name in gold with white trim.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nIn the 1976\u201377 season, the Rockets modified their uniforms, featuring a monotone look on the [[Cooper Black]] fonts and white lettering on the road uniforms. On the home shorts, the team logo is located on the right leg, while the away shorts feature the team name wordmark on the same location. With minor modifications in the number font, this version was used in all four of their NBA Finals appearances, including their {{nbafy|1994}} and {{nbafy|1995}} championships.<ref name=uniforms/>\n\nFollowing the 1995 title, the Rockets opted to modernize their look. After a fan contest with over 5,000 entries, the team went with the idea of [[Missouri City, Texas|Missouri City]] artist Thomas Nash of a rocket orbiting a basketball, which was then reworked by Houston designer Chris Hill.<ref name=\"Barron, David\"/> Nash would later sue the Rockets for [[breach of contract]], given they were using his idea despite not having paid the contest prizes.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Daily/Issues/1997/06/27/Franchises/ROCKETS-WIN-LOGO-SUIT-BUT-STILL-MAY-HAVE-TO-PAY-ARTIST.aspx|title=Rockets Win Logo Suit But Still May Have to Pay Artist|date=June 27, 1997|newspaper=Houston Chronicle|accessdate=June 2, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120061258/http://www.legalmetric.com/cases/copyright/txsd/txsd_496cv04406.html|archivedate=November 20, 2015|title=Nash v.

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the [[archiepiscopal see]] of all the [[Nordic countries]], dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the Nordic countries\". At the time of its construction, Lund and the cathedral belonged to Denmark. The main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"[[Fin (troll)|The giant Finn and his wife]]\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658, the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1668. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes implemented during the 19th century were extensive; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and works of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. Lund was at the time part of Denmark. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see overseeing all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The [[crypt]], the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a [[bishopric]] and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have prompted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates of the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars of the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin to be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where [[baptism]]s were conducted.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=4}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, for example in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe to Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was similar to the one seen today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, the need for  repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of [[Helgo Zettervall]]]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the structure in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while at the same time making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] was appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately managed to implement most of his ideas for the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862, Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades to rebuild the cathedral largely in line with his design from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nBetween 1832 and 1893, the cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

A short flight of stairs thus connect the nave with the [[choir (architecture)|choir]] as well as with the crypt under the choir. The choir ends in an apse. Inside, the bays of the cathedral are supported by [[groin vault]]s. The number of bays in the aisles are the double of that in the nave. The arches that separate the nave from the aisles are supported by piers and pillars of alternating width. The crypt has over forty shallow [[groin vault]]s supported by pillars with cushion-cap capitals. It is sparsely lit by low small windows.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=45}}\n\nSeen from outside, the different elements of the building are clearly discernible as independent volumes, \"as if they could be taken apart and put together again\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=181}} The apse of the cathedral is a \"forcefully articulated\" semi-circle of three storeys.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The apse is the most well-preserved part of the Romanesque building and has been described as \"the artistic high point of the exterior\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=124}} The southern portal of the nave is perhaps the oldest of the cathedral.

The artist was [[Johannes Ganssog]] from [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] in present-day Germany. It is attached with unusual technical skill to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar. The building material is sandstone, black [[limestone]] and black and white [[marble]], and it is partially painted and [[gilding|gilded]]. Reliefs of [[alabaster]] on the side show scenes from the New Testament.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=60\u201364}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}\n\n===Graves and funerary monuments===\n[[File:Herman af Slesvig (gravsten).JPG|thumb|right|The grave of Hermann, [[List of the bishops of Schleswig|bishop of Schleswig]], 12th century, the oldest grave in the crypt]]\nThe crypt contains the oldest grave in the cathedral, the grave of Hermann, [[List of the bishops of Schleswig|bishop of Schleswig]], who played an important role as an emissary of archbishop Eskil of Lund during the negotiations to establish Lund as an independent archdiocese. The simple Romanesque [[sarcophagus]], which has an inscription in Latin and a depiction of the bishop, is located in the apse of the crypt. It dates from the middle of the 12th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=48}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=46}} The crypt also contains the much larger grave monument of the last archbishop, {{ill|Birger Gunnersen|sv}}, which is centrally placed in the crypt. It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van D\u00fcren in 1512.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=94}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=48\u201349}} The cathedral's largest grave monument is that of bishop [[Hans Brostorp]], who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the [[University of Copenhagen]].

It is the seat of the [[List of bishops of Lund|Bishop of Lund]] and the main church of the [[Diocese of Lund]]. It was built as the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] cathedral of the [[archiepiscopal see]] of all the [[Nordic countries]], dedicated to [[Lawrence of Rome|Saint Lawrence]]. It is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.\n\nLund Cathedral has been called \"the most powerful representative of [[Romanesque architecture]] in the Nordic countries\". At the time of its construction, Lund and the cathedral belonged to Denmark. The main altar was consecrated in 1145 and the cathedral was by that time largely finished; the western towers were built somewhat later. Its architecture show clear influences from contemporary north Italian architecture, conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]]. The earliest architect was named Donatus, though his precise role in the construction of the cathedral is difficult to determine. The new cathedral was richly decorated with stone sculpture, including two unusual statues in the crypt traditionally called \"[[Fin (troll)|The giant Finn and his wife]]\" about which a local legend has developed. The cathedral was severely damaged in a fire in 1234, and major restoration works were carried out in the early 16th century under the leadership of [[Adam van D\u00fcren]]. Following the [[Reformation in Denmark\u2013Norway and Holstein|Reformation]], the cathedral suffered from lost income and dilapidation. In 1658, the city of Lund and the cathedral became a part of Sweden following the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]. Lund Cathedral was the site of the ceremony founding [[Lund University]] in 1688. Repairs were made during the 18th century but in 1832 a complete restoration of the cathedral was recommended. Subsequently much of the cathedral was restored and rebuilt during most of the 19th century. The work was first led by [[Carl Georg Brunius]] and later by architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] and not entirely finished until 1893. The changes implemented during the 19th century were extensive; among other things, Zettervall had the entire western part, including the towers, demolished and rebuilt to his own designs.\n\nThe medieval cathedral contains several historic furnishings and works of art. Its main altarpiece was donated to the cathedral in 1398, and it also contains [[Gothic art|Gothic]] choir stalls, bronzes and an [[astronomical clock]] from the 15th century (although heavily restored in 1923). When it was built, Lund Cathedral was lavishly decorated with Romanesque stone sculptures. It also contains late medieval stone sculptures from the time of Adam van D\u00fcren's renovation. After the Reformation the cathedral was also equipped with a decorated [[pulpit]]. Of more recent date is the large [[mosaic]] in the [[apse]], by [[Joakim Skovgaard]], installed in 1927. Lund Cathedral has six [[church organ]]s, one of which is the largest in Sweden, and is also used as a concert venue.\n\n==Historical background==\nChristian missionaries from present-day Germany and England were active in the [[Christianization of Scandinavia|Christianisation of Denmark]], and Denmark eventually became part of the [[Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen|Archdiocese of Hamburg-Bremen]]. Lund was at the time part of Denmark. With the consolidation of Danish monarchy during the second half of the 11th century, and with a political crisis in continental Europe, there arose an opportunity for the Danish monarchs to bypass the German influence over church policy in Denmark.{{sfn|Ryd\u00e9n|1999|p=99\u2013100}} An [[episcopal see]] was created in Lund in 1060.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25}} At the same time, another see was created in [[Dalby, Lund Municipality|Dalby]], very close to Lund. However, when the first bishop of Lund ([[Henry of Lund]]) died, the erstwhile bishop of Dalby, [[Egino (Bishop of Dalby)|Egino]], was installed in Lund and Dalby abandoned as the seat of a bishop. At the same time, in 1103, Lund was proclaimed an archiepiscopal see overseeing all Nordic countries.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=25\u201329}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=4\u20135}}\n\nSome kind of rudimentary settlement probably existed at the site of Lund Cathedral at the end of the 10th and early 11th centuries, but no remains of buildings have been found there.{{sfn|Cinthio|1990|p=1}} Lund Cathedral is one of the oldest stone buildings still in use in Sweden.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=7}} During the [[Middle Ages]], the cathedral was surrounded by several buildings serving the diocese, of which only [[Liberiet]], which at one point served as a library, survives.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=69\u201371}}\n\n==History==\n===Foundation and construction===\n[[File:Lund domkyrka - crypt (by Pudelek).JPG|thumb|right|The [[crypt]], the oldest part of Lund Cathedral]]\n[[File:Lund Dom Chor.JPG|thumb|right|The [[apse]] is the most well-preserved part of the original exterior]]\nThe earliest written mention of a church in Lund dedicated to [[Saint Lawrence]] \u2014 the patron saint of Lund Cathedral during the Middle Ages \u2014 dates from 1085.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=37}} Slightly later sources mention both a new and an old church dedicated to Saint Lawrence.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=38}} During the 1940s, archaeological excavations in the cathedral uncovered the foundations of another church inside the present building. The exact age, shape and function of this predecessor to the cathedral has been a matter of some debate.{{sfn|Cinthio|1957|p=1\u201342}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=62\u201364}} Most scholars believe that construction of a church on the site of Lund Cathedral was begun sometime during the second half of the 11th century.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} Some time thereafter a new church was begun in almost the same place, but to a larger design in the form of the present cathedral. Parts of the earlier church may have been incorporated in the walls of the cathedral.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}} The decision to abandon Dalby as a [[bishopric]] and make Lund the sole archbishopric in Scandinavia may have prompted the change of plans.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=40}}\n\nApart from the obscurity which thus surrounds the very beginning of the history of the cathedral, the construction of Lund Cathedral is probably among the most well documented among any [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque churches]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} Two contemporary accounts of the building of the cathedral, in the form of the [[illuminated manuscripts]] ''{{ill|Necrologium Lundense|sv}}'' and ''{{ill|Liber daticus vetustior|sv}}'', are still preserved in the library of [[Lund University]]. Both books contain notes, written in [[Latin language|Latin]], with dates of the progression of the construction. The oldest part of the cathedral is the large [[crypt]]. Its main [[altar]] was inaugurated on 30 June 1123, followed by the north (1126) and south (1131) side altars of the crypt. Only then did the cathedral begin to be used.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=28}} One of the main functions of the crypt appears to have been as a place where [[baptism]]s were conducted.{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=4}} The main altar of the cathedral was dedicated to [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Saint Mary]] and Saint Lawrence in 1145, by the second archbishop of Lund, [[Eskil of Lund|Eskil]], in a ceremony attended by bishops from present-day Germany, Denmark and Sweden.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=29\u201330}} By then, the construction of the cathedral to more or less its present dimensions was complete.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2004|p=186\u2013187}}\n\nUnusually for that time, the architect of the cathedral is known by his name, Donatus.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=11}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=164}} The name appears in both the ''Necrologium Lundense'' (as \"Donatus architectus\") and the ''Liber daticus vetustior''. Donatus may have been responsible for the layout of the crypt and the cathedral above ground as far west as the current north and south portals of the cathedral, although it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions about his precise role.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=30}}{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}} The same is true for his successor, possibly a builder named Ragnar.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=32}} The building erected during the time of Donatus and his successor show clear influences from Romanesque architecture in [[Lombardy]], conveyed via the [[Rhine Valley]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} Donatus himself appears to have been from, or at least educated in, Lombardy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=58}} [[Speyer Cathedral]] in western Germany is stylistically closely related to Lund Cathedral (especially the crypt), and it has been proposed that Donatus came to Lund from Speyer, where construction more or less ceased in 1106 following the death of [[Henry IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Henry IV]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=59}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1923|p=148}} Similarities have also frequently been pointed out between Lund Cathedral and [[Mainz Cathedral]], and the design of the apse is similar to that of the [[Basilica of Saint Servatius]] in [[Maastricht]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} On a more general level, the origins of the style of Lund Cathedral can be found in [[Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio]] ([[Milan]]), [[Modena Cathedral]] and several churches in [[Pavia]], all in northern Italy.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Similar stylistic influences can be seen in other cathedrals in Denmark from the same time, for example in [[Ribe Cathedral]].{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=64}}\n\nThe building of Lund Cathedral must have involved a large number of people and was a collective undertaking.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} Comparable but somewhat later workshops at [[Cologne Cathedral]] and [[Uppsala Cathedral]] employed a workforce of about 100 and 60 people, respectively.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68}} The project was instrumental in establishing a workshop where local craftsmen could be educated, and thus disseminating artistic influences from continental Europe to Scandinavia. The stone sculptors {{ill|Carl stenm\u00e4stare|sv}}, {{ill|M\u00e5rten stenm\u00e4stare|sv}} and [[Majestatis]] were probably all Scandinavians who were educated at the construction site.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=62}} Many early Romanesque stone churches in the countryside, particularly in Scania but also in the rest of Sweden, show direct influences from Lund Cathedral, notably {{ill|V\u00e4 Church|sv|V\u00e4 kyrka}} (Scania).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=79\u201381}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=265\u2013281}} Other examples are e.g. {{ill|Lannaskede Old Church|sv|Lannaskede gamla kyrka}} ([[Sm\u00e5land]]), {{ill|Hogstad Church|sv|Hogstads kyrka}} ([[\u00d6sterg\u00f6tland]]) and [[Havdhem Church]] ([[Gotland]]).{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=90\u201392}}\n\n===Fire and repairs===\nThe plan and layout of the building consecrated in 1145 was similar to the one seen today. A noticeable difference was that the entire choir was separated from the nave by a wall and reserved for the clergy. The towers were also not built until a few decades later.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=52}} The intention was probably to provide the cathedral with [[vault (architecture)|vaults]], but instead a flat wooden ceiling was installed.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=68\u201369}} The cathedral was adorned with [[Church murals in Sweden|wall paintings]] and almost certainly by [[Medieval stained glass in Sweden|stained glass windows]], but none of these remain.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=66}} In 1234, the cathedral was heavily damaged by a large fire.{{sfn|Lindgren|1995|p=78}} Large donations were made to the church in the following years, to allow for repairs.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=74}} Even so, the need for  repairs was continuous for the entire 13th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80}} Following the fire, the burnt-out ceiling was replaced by [[brick]] vaults.{{sfn|Wahl\u00f6\u00f6|2014|p=187}} Changes were also made to the layout of the westernmost part of the building.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76}} A conflict erupted between King [[Christopher I of Denmark]] and Archbishop [[Jakob Erlandsen]] in 1257 partially because the choir had been enlarged and the seats of the royal family moved, itself a testimony of the growing power of the Church.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=76\u201378}} Two [[chapel]]s were added to the cathedral during the 14th and 15th centuries; one located adjacent to the two westernmost [[Bay (architecture)|bays]] of the south aisle of the nave, and the other as a southern extension of the east transept.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=80\u201381}} [[Buttress]]es were also added piecemeal to the building during the 13th and 14th centuries, to stabilise the building which was under strain from the new, heavier vaults, the added chapels and the constant ringing of the 8.5 [[tonne]] [[church bell]].{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=86\u201387}}\n\n===Changes by Adam van D\u00fcren and later===\n[[File:Lunds domkyrka - KMB - 16001000533737.jpg|thumb|right|A drawing of the cathedral as it appeared in 1750]]\nThe German sculptor and builder [[Adam van D\u00fcren]] apparently worked intermittently at restoring and altering the cathedral between {{circa}} 1506 or 1507 and 1524.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=90\u201391}} Despite, and to some extent because of, the work that had been done during the preceding centuries since the great fire of 1234, the cathedral was in need of a thorough restoration.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=87}} Adam van D\u00fcren and his workshop made several changes and contributions. A new drainage system was installed in the crypt, and as part of that work a [[well]], which probably replaced an earlier well in the same location, was decorated with [[satire|satirical]] [[allegory|allegories]].{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=88\u201395}} The workshop of van D\u00fcren also created two new windows in the choir, built a large buttress to support the southern transept (before 1513), and rebuilt the [[gable]] of the northern transept (1524) as well as its vaults. New and considerably larger windows with [[Pointed arch (architecture)|pointed arches]] were installed in both the northern wall of the north transept and in the southern wall of the south transept.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=100}} The towers and western facade were also repaired in 1512\u201318 and again in 1527.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=91}} It has been argued that the cathedral may have collapsed, were it not for the work done by van D\u00fcren.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=104}}\n\nFollowing the Reformation in the 16th century, the diocese lost much of its revenues.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=126}} The building was still subjected to much stress, not least by the use of the large church bell, and suffered during the recurrent [[List of wars involving Denmark|wars between Denmark and Sweden]]; in 1658 Lund permanently became part of Sweden. Despite van D\u00fcren's repairs, the church was described as being \"very dilapidated\" in 1682.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=128}} During the 18th century, the chapels of the church were used for funerals, but also as an improvised [[morgue]] where corpses were occasionally left for several years.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=130}} Attempts at repairs were made; among them the entire apse was dismantled and then re-erected.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=12}} Many of the repairs were however either temporary or outright detrimental to condition of the building. King [[Gustav III of Sweden]] visited the cathedral crypt in 1785 and expressed his displeasure at its state.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13}}{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=132}} In 1812, the aforementioned chapels from the 14th and 15th centuries were demolished.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}}\n\n===Changes by Carl Georg Brunius and Helgo Zettervall===\n[[File:Demolition of the tower of Lund Cathedral.jpg|thumb|right|Demolition of the south tower of the cathedral during the time of [[Helgo Zettervall]]]]\nWhen the congregation wanted to build a new [[church organ]] in the early 19th century, architect {{ill|Axel Nystr\u00f6m|sv|Axel Nystr\u00f6m (1793\u20131868)}} was invited to examine the structure in 1832. Nystr\u00f6m recommended a complete renovation of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=134}} The chairman of the council in charge of administering the cathedral buildings, [[Carl Georg Brunius]], was called to execute the plans of Nystr\u00f6m, and he did so while at the same time making changes according to his own convictions. He also wrote the first systematic art history of the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} Brunius had the organ moved, the crypt repaired, installed a set of steps connecting the choir with the nave and improved the drainage system.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}} He also removed modern furnishings, re-built some of the buttresses and changed the stone of a large part of the facade.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121}} Brunius retired due to old age in 1859, but as there was still a substantial need for repairs, the young architect [[Helgo Zettervall]] was appointed to carry out the rest of the work in 1860.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013122}} A conflict between Brunius and Zettervall developed almost immediately, but Zettervall would keep working on restoring the cathedral until 1893 and ultimately managed to implement most of his ideas for the cathedral.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=121\u2013181}} A compromise in 1862 proposed that the Danish architect [[Ferdinand Meldahl]] would assume the main responsibility, and Zettervall would merely assist Meldahl. However, it soon became apparent that Zettervall would not accept a subordinate role and Meldahl himself showed little interest in the project.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=141}} In 1862, Zettervall traveled extensively through Germany and Italy to study stylistically related architecture, and also to visit the latest examples of building restoration so that he could draw upon that experience in his work at Lund.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=134\u2013141}} In 1863, he presented a first proposal for a complete restoration of the cathedral. Zettervall himself considered it a \"reasonable middle ground between reparation and reconstruction\".{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142}} The proposal would mean the removal of all buttresses, a new roof, completely rebuilt towers, and the removal of the large Gothic windows in the transepts. Zettervall also proposed to add an octagonal dome over the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]]. Far-reaching changes would also affect the interior. In the proposal Zettervall strove to reduce and refine the building volumes of the cathedral and create a unified composition of block-like elements.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=142\u2212152}}\n\nThe proposal by Zettervall was criticised, not least by Meldahl. Zettervall re-worked the proposal and put forward a revised, less far-reaching proposal in 1864, notably without the central dome.{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=152}} This proposal was also rejected and the plan for a complete overhaul abandoned; however it was at the same time decided that Zettervall would continue working on repairing the cathedral and every year make what changes that were deemed necessary. In this way, Zettervall could piecemeal over the next decades to rebuild the cathedral largely in line with his design from 1864.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=135}}{{sfn|Bodin|2017|p=158\u2013159}}\n\nBetween 1832 and 1893, the cathedral was radically transformed by the work of Brunius and Zettervall. All windows were replaced, several vaults and pillars were repaired or rebuilt, and both architects effected extensive changes to the transept. Just as he had suggested, Zettervall had all the buttresses removed and demolished the entire western part of the church, including the towers, and rebuilt them according to his own [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Neo-Romanesque]] designs.{{sfn|Sundn\u00e9r|1997|p=13\u201314}}<ref name=byggnaden>{{cite web |url= https://lundsdomkyrka.se/rundtur/byggnaden/|title= En kyrka i st\u00e4ndig f\u00f6r\u00e4ndring|trans-title= A constantly changing church|author=<!--Not stated--> |date= |website= Lund Cathedral (official site)|publisher= Church of Sweden|access-date= 19 April 2020|quote=}}</ref>\n\nIn the 20th century, archaeological excavations were carried out in and around the cathedral.

In 1837, it was dismantled. It was restored at the initiative of architect {{ill|Theodor W\u00e5hlin|sv}} and the Danish clock-maker Julius Bertram Larsen and re-inaugurated in 1923. The upper part, which is original, is the clock, while the lower part, a reconstruction, is a calendar. Twice every day the two knights on the top clash their swords. The clock then plays the tune ''[[In dulci jubilo]]'' and a procession of figures parades across the face of the clock.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=125\u2013126}} Three astronomical clocks of similar design are preserved in Europe.

Two of the bronze columns are crowned by angels, and the third one by a statuette of Saint Lawrence, holding a gridiron, the symbol of his martyrdom. It probably dates from the middle of the 14th century, while the two angel-bearing columns may be somewhat later. Saint Lawrence's column is approximately {{convert|3|m|ft}} tall (and the saint {{convert|70|cm|inch}}), while the columns with angels are slightly smaller.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=114}} The three columns were probably made in [[L\u00fcbeck]] or [[Hamburg]].

The artist was [[Johannes Ganssog]] from [[Frankfurt an der Oder]] in present-day Germany. It is attached with unusual technical skill to one of the pillars of the nave, and it is entered through a stair cut inside the pillar.

It dates from the middle of the 12th century.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=48}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=46}} The crypt also contains the much larger grave monument of the last archbishop, {{ill|Birger Gunnersen|sv}}, which is centrally placed in the crypt. It is of a kind which is not unusual in continental Europe but very unusual in the Nordic countries: a large stone sarcophagus decorated on all sides with sculptures in high relief and with a full-scale depiction of the bishop in full dress on the lid. It was made by Adam van D\u00fcren in 1512.{{sfn|Rydbeck|1946|p=94}}{{sfn|Wrangel|1915|p=48\u201349}} The cathedral's largest grave monument is that of bishop [[Hans Brostorp]], who died in 1497 and who during his lifetime inaugurated the [[University of Copenhagen]].

During the Han Dynasty, a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged would a marriage proceed; and the bride would be taken to live in the ancestral home of the new husband. Here, a wife was not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs. Many families followed the Confucian teachings regarding honoring their elders. These rituals were passed down from father to son, official family lists were compiled, containing the names of all the sons and marital wives. So brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. When a husband died, the bride was seen as the property of her spouse's family. Ransoms were set by some brides' families to get their daughters back, though never with her children, who remained in the property of her husband's family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in history: global perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass|isbn=9781405189958|pages=29\u201330|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nJohn Engel, a professor of Family Resources at the [[University of Hawaii]], argues that the [[People's Republic of China]] established the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] to redistribute wealth and achieve a classless society.

There is a derogatory term for women who are not married by the time they are in their late twenties, [[sheng nu]]. With these pressures to be married, some women who have very few prospects willingly enter into a second marriage. Sometimes, these second wives are promised a good life and home by these men. Oftentimes, these women are poor and uneducated so when they split, they have very little left. Sometimes these women were completely unaware that the man was already married.

According to Amnesty International, the law protects individual rights and bans the usage of coercion or detainment.<ref name=Amnesty/>\n\n==Property ownership==\n{{See also|Chinese property law}}\nIn current-day China, women enjoy legal [[gender equality|equal rights]] to [[property]], but in practice, these rights are often difficult to realize. However, Chinese women have historically held little rights to private property, both by societal customs and by law. In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household. This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.<ref name=\"birge\">Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\nAncestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male. Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.<ref name=\"mccreery\">McCreery, John L. \"Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia.\" Ethnology (1976): 163-174.</ref> Upon the death of the head of the household, property was passed to the eldest son. In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.<ref name=\"bernhardt\">Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property. In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers\u2019 property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.<ref name=bernhardt /> A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews. With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted. At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.<ref name=mccreery />\n\nIn most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.<ref name=bernhardt /> In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.<ref name=\"ocko\">Ocko, Jonathan K. \"Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China.\" Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.</ref> Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of the family property.<ref name=ocko />\n\nThe [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=ocko /> The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.<ref name=bernhardt />\n\nInheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents. Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.<ref name=bernhardt /> Despite the law's equitable wording on the property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=\"davis\">Davis, Deborah. \"Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China.\" Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality. The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang. With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land. In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.<ref name=\"Hare\">Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. \"Land management in rural China and its gender implications.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.</ref>\n\nThe land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head or the eldest male. So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household. Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.<ref name=\"chen\">Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. \"Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.</ref>\n\nFor property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for the distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regard to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property. The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1980]] defined different types of divorce that would split the conjugal property differently, such as instances of adultery or domestic violence.<ref name=davis />\n\nSince most divorce disputes are settled at a local level, the law allows courts to review specific situations and make decisions in the best interest of the child. Typically, such a decision would simultaneously favor the mother, especially in disputes over a house where the child would live. In some divorce disputes \"ownership\" and \"use\" over property would be distinguished, giving a mother and child \"use\" of the family house without awarding the mother full ownership of the house.<ref name=davis />\n\n==Employment==\nIf female labor force participation is used as the indicator to measure gender equality, China would be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world: female labor force participation in China increased dramatically after the founding of the People's Republic and almost reached the universal level.<ref name=\"bridgew.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |title=Women's Movement and Change of Women's Status in China |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515152129/http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}</ref> According to a study by Bauer et al., of women who married between 1950 and 1965, 70 percent had jobs, and women who married between 1966 and 1976, 92 percent had jobs.<ref name=\"Bauer\"/>\n\nEven though women in China are actively contributing to the paid labor force to an extent that exceeds numerous other countries, parity in the workforce has not been reached.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J|author2=L.

Due to China's history of favoring sons over daughters in the family, there has been a disproportionately larger number of marriageable aged men unable to find available women, so some turn to prostitutes instead.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Feminism|China}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Women in Taiwan|Women in the Republic of China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Globalization and women in China]]\n*[[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n*[[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n*[[Women in ancient China]]\n*[[Missing women of China]]\n*[[Female infanticide in China]]\n*[[Abortion in China]]\n*[[Chinese patriarchy]]\n*[[Chinese ideals of female beauty]]\n*[[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n*[[Concubinage]]\n*[[New Marriage Law]]\n*[[Prostitution in China]]\n*[[Women in agriculture in China]]\n*[[Chinese rural left behind women]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*{{cite journal\n| title=At the beginning: the status of women in Neolithic and Shang China\n| last1=Keightley | first1=David N. | author-link=David Keightley\n| journal=NAN N\u00dc\n| volume=1 | issue=1 | date=1999\n| pages=1\u201363\n| doi=10.1163/156852699X00054\n| ref = harv\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n| title=\u5468\u4ee3\u7537\u5973\u89d2\u8272\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\n| trans-title=Role orientation of men and women in the Zhou Dynasty and their effects on modern society\n| last1=Wu \u5434 | first1=Xiaohua \u6653\u534e\n| pages=86\u201392\n| language=zh\n| journal=Chang'An Daxue Xuebao (Shehui Kexue Ban)\n| date=2009 | volume=11 | issue=3\n| ref = {{SfnRef|Wu|2009}}\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Country_Briefing_Papers/Women_in_PRC/default.asp Women in the People's Republic of China] (Country Briefing Paper) (pdf doc.) by the [[Asian Development Bank]] (Pub.

During the Han Dynasty, a marriage lacking a dowry or betrothal gift was seen as dishonorable. Only after gifts were exchanged would a marriage proceed; and the bride would be taken to live in the ancestral home of the new husband. Here, a wife was not only expected to live with the entirety of her husband's family, but to follow all of their rules and beliefs. Many families followed the Confucian teachings regarding honoring their elders. These rituals were passed down from father to son, official family lists were compiled, containing the names of all the sons and marital wives. So brides who did not produce a son were written out of family lists and forgotten. When a husband died, the bride was seen as the property of her spouse's family. Ransoms were set by some brides' families to get their daughters back, though never with her children, who remained in the property of her husband's family.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wiesner-Hanks|first1=Merry|title=Gender in history: global perspectives|date=2011|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Malden, Mass|isbn=9781405189958|pages=29\u201330|edition=2nd}}</ref>\n\nJohn Engel, a professor of Family Resources at the [[University of Hawaii]], argues that the [[People's Republic of China]] established the [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1950]] to redistribute wealth and achieve a classless society.

There is a derogatory term for women who are not married by the time they are in their late twenties, [[sheng nu]]. With these pressures to be married, some women who have very few prospects willingly enter into a second marriage. Sometimes, these second wives are promised a good life and home by these men. Oftentimes, these women are poor and uneducated so when they split, they have very little left. Sometimes these women were completely unaware that the man was already married.

However, Chinese women have historically held little rights to private property, both by societal customs and by law. In imperial China (before 1911 C.E.), family households held property collectively, rather than as individual members of the household. This property customarily belonged to the family ancestral clan, with legal control belonging to the family head, or the eldest male.<ref name=\"birge\">Birge, Bettine. Women, Property, and Confucian Reaction in Sung and Yuan China (960-1368). Cambridge University Press, 2002.</ref>\n\nAncestry in imperial China was [[patrilinearity|patrilineal]], or passed through the male. Because women were not a part of this male-based ancestral line, they could never share the family property.<ref name=\"mccreery\">McCreery, John L. \"Women's property rights and dowry in China and South Asia.\" Ethnology (1976): 163-174.</ref> Upon the death of the head of the household, property was passed to the eldest son. In the absence of an eligible son, a family would often adopt a son to continue the family line and property.<ref name=\"bernhardt\">Bernhardt, Kathryn. Women and property in China, 960-1949. Stanford University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nHowever, as Kathryn Bernhardt, a scholar of Chinese history points out, nearly one in three women during the [[Song dynasty]] (960-1279 C.E.) would either have no brothers or no sons, leaving them with some agency over family property. In these cases, unmarried daughters would receive their fathers\u2019 property in the absence of direct male descendants, or an unmarried widow would choose the family heir.<ref name=bernhardt /> A new law enacted during the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368-1644 C.E.) required that in the absence of a direct male descendant, a man's property was to go to his nephews. With this change in law, women's access to private property was restricted. At that point, only if none of a man's sons and none of his brothers' sons were alive to inherit property would a daughter receive the inheritance.<ref name=mccreery />\n\nIn most cases, the most control over family property that a widow would receive was maintenance, or the agency to control the property while an heir came of age.<ref name=bernhardt /> In some cases after some reforms in the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644-1912), some women could retain maintenance over undivided property even after their sons came of age.<ref name=\"ocko\">Ocko, Jonathan K. \"Women, property, and law in the People's Republic of China.\" Marriage and inequality in Chinese society 12 (1991): 313.</ref> Law during the Republican era interpreted this to mean that widows held complete power over sons in control of the family property.<ref name=ocko />\n\nThe [[Chinese Nationalist Party|Kuomintang]], which assumed power over China in 1911, publicly advocated for gender equality, though not very many changes in property rights went into effect until the enactment of the [[Law of the Republic of China|Republican Civil Code]] in 1930, which changed the basic definitions of property and family inheritance.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=ocko /> The Code specified that family property legally belonged to the father, with no connection to the ancestral clan.<ref name=bernhardt />\n\nInheritance of this property was based on direct lineage, regardless of gender, so that sons and daughters would receive an equal share of family property upon the death of their parents. Furthermore, a man's will or appointment of a different heir could not fully bypass the legally mandated inheritance structures, preventing families from holding onto gender-discriminatory customs.<ref name=bernhardt /> Despite the law's equitable wording on the property, some scholars, such as Deborah Davis and Kathryn Bernhardt, point out that the legal definitions regarding property may not have entirely changed the practices of the general public.<ref name=bernhardt /><ref name=\"davis\">Davis, Deborah. \"Who gets the house? Renegotiating property rights in post-socialist urban China.\" Modern China 36, no. 5 (2010): 463-492.</ref>\n\nThe [[People's Republic of China]], which assumed control in 1949 and remains in power today, also promised gender equality. The PRC's approach was different from the Kuomintang. With regards to land, all land was owned by the central Chinese government and allocated for people to use, so technically no one, male or female, owned land. In 1978, the Chinese government set up a household farming system that split agricultural land into small plots for villages to allocate to citizens.<ref name=\"Hare\">Hare, Denise, Li Yang, and Daniel Englander. \"Land management in rural China and its gender implications.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 35-61.</ref>\n\nThe land was distributed to households with legal responsibility in the family head or the eldest male. So, a woman's access to land was contingent on her being part of a household. Land leases were technically supposed to transfer with marriage to a woman's marital family, but the perfect allocation of land leases was not always reached, meaning women could potentially lose land upon marriage. Such village allocations have since ceased, so the leases to the land are now passed through families.<ref name=\"chen\">Chen, Junjie, and Gale Summerfield. \"Gender and rural reforms in China: A case study of population control and land rights policies in northern Liaoning.\" Feminist Economics 13, no. 3-4 (2007): 63-92.</ref>\n\nFor property other than land, new Chinese laws allow for the distinction between personal and communal property. Married couples can simultaneously own some things individually while sharing others with their spouse and family. With regard to divorce, Chinese law generally demands a 50/50 split of property. The [[New Marriage Law|Marriage Law of 1980]] defined different types of divorce that would split the conjugal property differently, such as instances of adultery or domestic violence.<ref name=davis />\n\nSince most divorce disputes are settled at a local level, the law allows courts to review specific situations and make decisions in the best interest of the child. Typically, such a decision would simultaneously favor the mother, especially in disputes over a house where the child would live. In some divorce disputes \"ownership\" and \"use\" over property would be distinguished, giving a mother and child \"use\" of the family house without awarding the mother full ownership of the house.<ref name=davis />\n\n==Employment==\nIf female labor force participation is used as the indicator to measure gender equality, China would be one of the most egalitarian countries in the world: female labor force participation in China increased dramatically after the founding of the People's Republic and almost reached the universal level.<ref name=\"bridgew.edu\">{{cite web |url=http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |title=Women's Movement and Change of Women's Status in China |accessdate=2012-10-31 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515152129/http://www.bridgew.edu/soas/jiws/vol1/li.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2013 }}</ref> According to a study by Bauer et al., of women who married between 1950 and 1965, 70 percent had jobs, and women who married between 1966 and 1976, 92 percent had jobs.<ref name=\"Bauer\"/>\n\nEven though women in China are actively contributing to the paid labor force to an extent that exceeds numerous other countries, parity in the workforce has not been reached.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Knight|first=J|author2=L.

Also, younger rural women are less likely to become pregnant, possess nimble fingers, more able to work longer hours, and are less knowledgeable about their statutory rights.<ref name=\"Female Migrant\"/> For the women who are able to gain employment, they then face the possibility of being forced to sign a contract prohibiting them from getting pregnant or married during their period of employment.<ref>Cooke, Fang. \"Equal opportunity?

This has created jobs that demand feminine attributes, particularly in the service industry. Sales representatives in cosmetics and clothing stores are usually young, attractive women who continually cultivate their feminine appearance, corresponding to images of women that they see in advertisements.<ref>Otis, Eileen.

Courses and workshops in psychotherapy attract women of different ages who feel the burden of sensitively mastering social relations in and outside their households and at the same time as a channel to realize themselves as individuals not reduced to their familial roles as mothers or wives.<ref>Hizi, Gil (2018).

Since the loosening of government controls over society in the early 1980s, prostitution in mainland China not only has become more visible, but also can now be found throughout both [[Urban area|urban]] and [[rural]] areas. In spite of government efforts, prostitution has now developed to the extent that it comprises an [[industry]] involving a large number of people and producing a significant economic [[Output (economics)|output]].\n\nProstitution has also become associated with a number of problems, including [[organized crime]], [[government corruption]] and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. Due to China's history of favoring sons over daughters in the family, there has been a disproportionately larger number of marriageable aged men unable to find available women, so some turn to prostitutes instead.\n\n==See also==\n{{portal|Feminism|China}}\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Women in Taiwan|Women in the Republic of China]]\n*[[Feminism in China]]\n*[[Globalization and women in China]]\n*[[Urban society in the People's Republic of China]] \n*[[Rural society in the People's Republic of China]]\n*[[Women in ancient China]]\n*[[Missing women of China]]\n*[[Female infanticide in China]]\n*[[Abortion in China]]\n*[[Chinese patriarchy]]\n*[[Chinese ideals of female beauty]]\n*[[List of Chinese administrative divisions by gender ratio]]\n*[[Concubinage]]\n*[[New Marriage Law]]\n*[[Prostitution in China]]\n*[[Women in agriculture in China]]\n*[[Chinese rural left behind women]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n===Works cited===\n*{{cite journal\n| title=At the beginning: the status of women in Neolithic and Shang China\n| last1=Keightley | first1=David N. | author-link=David Keightley\n| journal=NAN N\u00dc\n| volume=1 | issue=1 | date=1999\n| pages=1\u201363\n| doi=10.1163/156852699X00054\n| ref = harv\n}}\n*{{cite journal\n| title=\u5468\u4ee3\u7537\u5973\u89d2\u8272\u5b9a\u4f4d\u53ca\u5176\u5bf9\u73b0\u4ee3\u793e\u4f1a\u7684\u5f71\u54cd\n| trans-title=Role orientation of men and women in the Zhou Dynasty and their effects on modern society\n| last1=Wu \u5434 | first1=Xiaohua \u6653\u534e\n| pages=86\u201392\n| language=zh\n| journal=Chang'An Daxue Xuebao (Shehui Kexue Ban)\n| date=2009 | volume=11 | issue=3\n| ref = {{SfnRef|Wu|2009}}\n}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* [http://www.adb.org/Documents/Books/Country_Briefing_Papers/Women_in_PRC/default.asp Women in the People's Republic of China] (Country Briefing Paper) (pdf doc.) by the [[Asian Development Bank]] (Pub.

2009, [[Justin McCarthy (hurler)|Justin McCarthy]] became the first manager to reach the All-Ireland semi-finals with three different teams: [[Cork GAA|Cork]] (1975, 1984), [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] (2002, 2004, 2006, 2007) and [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] (2009). In addition, he was in charge of [[Clare GAA|Clare]] in the 1978 [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]] final, when a win would have qualified them directly for the all-Ireland final.\n* Fourteen individuals have won the All-Ireland as a player then later as a manager:\n** [[Johnny Clifford]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1954 and as a manager in 1986.\n** [[Ollie Walsh]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1957, 1963, 1967 and 1969 and as a manager in 1992, and 1993.\n** [[Michael Keating (hurler)|Michael \"Babs\" Keating]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] won as a player in 1964, 1965 and 1971 and as a manager in 1989 and 1991.\n** [[Eddie Keher]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1963, 1967, 1969, 1972, 1974 and 1975 and as a co-manager in 1979.\n** [[Justin McCarthy (hurler)|Justin McCarthy]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1966 and as a co-manager in 1984.\n** [[Pat Henderson]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1967, 1969, 1972, 1974 and 1975 and as a manager in 1979, 1982 and 1983.\n** [[Brian Cody]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1975, 1982 and 1983 and as a manager in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015\n** [[Jimmy Barry-Murphy]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1984 and 1986 and as a manager in 1999.\n** [[John Allen (hurling manager)|John Allen]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1978 and as a manager in 2005.\n** [[D\u00f3nal O'Grady]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1984 and as a manager in 2004.\n** [[Nicky English]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] won as a player in 1989 and 1991 and as a manager in 2001.\n** [[Davy Fitzgerald]] of [[Clare GAA|Clare]] won as a player in 1995 and 1997 and as a manager in 2013.\n** [[Eamonn Cregan]] of [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] won as a player in 1973 and as a manager with Offaly in 1994.\n** [[Michael Ryan (hurler, born 1970)|Michael Ryan]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] won as a player in 1991 and as a manager in 2016\n\n==Team results table==\nThis section represents in colour-coded tabular format the results of [[GAA county teams]] in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] since [[1997 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|1997]]. \n\nPrior to 1997, counties played in separate [[provincial championships]], with only four provincial champions coming together in the All-Ireland semi-finals, and it is difficult to directly compare results across counties.

In general, the colouring code for champions (red), runners-up (orange) and semi-finalists (yellow) holds true.

Dublin in the [[1961 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|1961 final]], [[\u00c9amonn Scallan]] of [[Wexford GAA|Wexford]] in the [[1996 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|1996 final]] against [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] (sent off in the 34th minute); [[Benny Dunne]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] in the [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2009 final]] and [[Cyril Donnellan]] of [[Galway GAA|Galway]] in the [[2012 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2012 final]] replay and\n[[Richie Hogan]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] in the [[2019 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship Final|2019 final]]\n\n==Managers==\n\n===Records===\n\n* [[Brian Cody]] is the only manager to win the All-Ireland title eleven times, in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015 (all [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]]).\n* Just two managers have reached the All-Ireland final with two different teams: \n** [[Babs Keating|Michael \"Babs\" Keating]] with [[Galway GAA|Galway]] (1979) and [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] (1988, 1989, 1991).\n** [[Davy Fitzgerald]] with [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] (2008) and [[Clare GAA|Clare]] (2013).\n* In 2009, [[Justin McCarthy (hurler)|Justin McCarthy]] became the first manager to reach the All-Ireland semi-finals with three different teams: [[Cork GAA|Cork]] (1975, 1984), [[Waterford GAA|Waterford]] (2002, 2004, 2006, 2007) and [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] (2009). In addition, he was in charge of [[Clare GAA|Clare]] in the 1978 [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship|Munster]] final, when a win would have qualified them directly for the all-Ireland final.\n* Fourteen individuals have won the All-Ireland as a player then later as a manager:\n** [[Johnny Clifford]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1954 and as a manager in 1986.\n** [[Ollie Walsh]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1957, 1963, 1967 and 1969 and as a manager in 1992, and 1993.\n** [[Michael Keating (hurler)|Michael \"Babs\" Keating]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] won as a player in 1964, 1965 and 1971 and as a manager in 1989 and 1991.\n** [[Eddie Keher]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1963, 1967, 1969, 1972, 1974 and 1975 and as a co-manager in 1979.\n** [[Justin McCarthy (hurler)|Justin McCarthy]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1966 and as a co-manager in 1984.\n** [[Pat Henderson]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1967, 1969, 1972, 1974 and 1975 and as a manager in 1979, 1982 and 1983.\n** [[Brian Cody]] of [[Kilkenny GAA|Kilkenny]] won as a player in 1975, 1982 and 1983 and as a manager in 2000, 2002, 2003, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2011, 2012, 2014, 2015\n** [[Jimmy Barry-Murphy]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1976, 1977, 1978, 1984 and 1986 and as a manager in 1999.\n** [[John Allen (hurling manager)|John Allen]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1978 and as a manager in 2005.\n** [[D\u00f3nal O'Grady]] of [[Cork GAA|Cork]] won as a player in 1984 and as a manager in 2004.\n** [[Nicky English]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] won as a player in 1989 and 1991 and as a manager in 2001.\n** [[Davy Fitzgerald]] of [[Clare GAA|Clare]] won as a player in 1995 and 1997 and as a manager in 2013.\n** [[Eamonn Cregan]] of [[Limerick GAA|Limerick]] won as a player in 1973 and as a manager with Offaly in 1994.\n** [[Michael Ryan (hurler, born 1970)|Michael Ryan]] of [[Tipperary GAA|Tipperary]] won as a player in 1991 and as a manager in 2016\n\n==Team results table==\nThis section represents in colour-coded tabular format the results of [[GAA county teams]] in the [[All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship]] since [[1997 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|1997]]. \n\nPrior to 1997, counties played in separate [[provincial championships]], with only four provincial champions coming together in the All-Ireland semi-finals, and it is difficult to directly compare results across counties. Since 1997, several beaten teams from the provincial championships play together in the All-Ireland qualifier series.\n\n===Table===\n; Current\n* {{bg|red|'''Ch'''}} \u2014 Champions\n* {{bg|orange|RU}} \u2014 Runners-up\n* {{bg|yellow|SF}} \u2014 All-Ireland semi-finals (3rd\u20134th place)\n* {{bg|#90EE90|QF}} \u2014 All-Ireland quarter-finals (5th\u20136th place)\n* {{bg|#ADD8E6|PQF}} \u2014 All-Ireland preliminary quarter-finals (7th\u20138th place)\n* {{bg|#E0B0FF|Lrr4}} {{bg|#E0B0FF|Mrr4}} \u2014 Leinster/Munster round robin, 4th place (9th\u201310th place)\n* {{bg|#D3D3D3|Lrr5}} {{bg|#D3D3D3|Mrr5}} \u2014 Leinster/Munster round robin, 5th place  (11th\u201312th place)\n* \u2014 \u2014 did not compete\n* \u2665 \u2014 Munster champions\n* \u2666 \u2014 Leinster champions\n\n===Past===\n\n*The All-Ireland championship has used many different competition structures since 1997, and it is not always obvious how to rank teams. In general, the colouring code for champions (red), runners-up (orange) and semi-finalists (yellow) holds true. After that, teams are shaded green, blue, purple and grey in descending order of performance. \n*The [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] has not had any bearing on the All-Ireland championship since [[2005_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship|2005]] so it is not included from that year onward.\n*Changes of provincial championship:\n**[[Galway GAA|Galway]] competed in the [[Connacht Senior Hurling Championship]] until [[1998_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship|1998]]; they have played in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]] since [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|2009]]\n**[[Kerry GAA|Kerry]] competed in the [[Munster Senior Hurling Championship]] until [[2004_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship|2004]]; they have played in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]] since [[2016 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|2016]]\n**[[Antrim GAA|Antrim]] still compete in the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]], however, it has not been part of the All-Ireland since [[2004_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship|2004]]; they have played in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]] since [[2009 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|2009]]\n**[[London GAA|London]] competed in the [[Ulster Senior Hurling Championship]] until [[2004_All-Ireland_Senior_Hurling_Championship|2004]]; they played in the [[Leinster Senior Hurling Championship]] in [[2013 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|2013]] and [[2014 All-Ireland Senior Hurling Championship|2014]]\n\nAbbreviations used:\n* \u2663 \u2014 Ulster champions\n* \u2660 \u2014 Connacht champions\n*QF \u2014 All-Ireland quarter-finalists\n*QR3 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, round 3\n*QR2 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, round 2\n*QR1 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, round 1\n*Qp3 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, phase 3\n*Qp2 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, phase 2\n*Qp1 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, phase 1\n*Qpr \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, preliminary round\n*Qrr3 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, round robin, 3rd place\n*Qrr4 \u2014 All-Ireland qualifiers, round robin, 4th place\n*Uf \u2014 Ulster finalists\n*Usf \u2014 Ulster semi-finalists\n*Uqf \u2014 Ulster quarter-finalists\n*Lsf \u2014 Leinster semi-finalists\n*Lqf \u2014 Leinster quarter-finalists\n*L1r \u2014 Leinster first round\n*Lpr \u2014 Leinster preliminary round\n*Lpr2 \u2014 Leinster second preliminary round\n*Lpr1 \u2014 Leinster first preliminary round\n*Lpqr \u2014 Leinster preliminary quarter-final\n*Lrr2 \u2014 Leinster round robin, 2nd place\n*Lrr3 \u2014 Leinster round robin, 3rd place\n*Lrr4 \u2014 Leinster round robin, 4th place\n*Lsf \u2014 Munster semi-finalists\n*Lqf \u2014 Munster quarter-finalists\n* Cf \u2014 Connacht finalists\n*Rsf \u2014 won relegation semi-final\n*Rf \u2014 won relegation final\n*Rel \u2014 relegated to [[Christy Ring Cup]]\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:100%;\"\n|-\n!

The most well-known route of the historical [[Silk Road]] ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.\n\nIn recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural gas-producing region.\n\nIt is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Tajiks]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Russians in China|Russians]] and [[Xibe people|Xibe]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |work=BBC News |title=Regions and territories: Xinjiang |date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520054144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |archive-date=20 May 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang.

Since 1949, it has been part of the People's Republic of China following the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1954, [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps|Xinjiang Bingtuan]] was set up to strengthen the border defense against the Soviet Union and also promote the local economy. In 1955, Xinjiang was turned into an [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous region]] from a province. In the last decades, the [[East Turkestan]] independent movement, [[Xinjiang conflict|separatist conflict]] and the influence of radical Islam have both resulted in unrest in the region, with

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u897f\u57df\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|\u70cf\u58d8}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9\u201323). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].\n\nThe Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century. The short-lived kingdoms that ruled northwestern China one after the other, including [[Former Liang]], [[Former Qin]], [[Later Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Later Liang]], and [[Western Liang (Sixteen Kingdoms)|Western Li\u00e1ng]], all attempted to maintain the protectorate, with varying degrees of success. After the final reunification of northern China under the [[Northern Wei]] empire, its protectorate controlled what is now the southeastern region of Xinjiang. Local states such as [[Shule Kingdom|Shule]], [[Yutian County, Xinjiang|Yutian]], [[Guizi]] and [[Qiemo]] controlled the western region, while the central region around [[Turpan]] was controlled by [[Gaochang]], remnants of a state ([[Northern Liang]]) that once ruled part of what is now [[Gansu]] province in northwestern China.\n\n[[File:Westerner on a camel.jpg|thumb|upright=.85|A [[Sogdia]]n man on a [[Bactrian camel]], ''[[sancai]]'' ceramic statuette, [[Tang dynasty]]]]\n\nDuring the [[Tang dynasty]], a [[Tang campaigns against the Western Turks|series of expeditions]] were conducted against the [[Western Turkic Khaganate]], and their vassals, the oasis states of southern Xinjiang.<ref>{{cite book |first=Patricia Buckley |last=Ebrey |title = The Cambridge Illustrated History of China |year=2010 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-12433-1 |page = 111 }}</ref> [[Emperor Taizong's campaign against Xiyu states|Campaigns against the oasis states]] began under [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] with the [[Tang campaign against Karakhoja|annexation of Gaochang]] in 640.<ref name=Wechsler>{{cite book |first2=Howard J. |last2=Wechsler |first=Denis |last=Twitchett |chapter=Kao-tsung (reign 649-83) and the Empress Wu: The Inheritor and the Usurper |editor1 = Denis Twitchett |editor2=John Fairbank |title = The Cambridge History of China, Volume 3: Sui and T'ang China Part I |year=1979 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-21446-9 |page=228 }}</ref> The nearby kingdom of [[Karasahr]] was [[Tang campaigns against Karasahr|captured by the Tang]] in 644 and the kingdom of [[Kucha]] was [[Conquest of Kucha|conquered in 649]].<ref name=\"skaff\">{{cite book |first=Jonathan Karem |last=Skaff |editor=Nicola Di Cosmo |title=Military Culture in Imperial China |year=2009 |publisher=Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-03109-8 |pages=183\u2013185 }}</ref> The Tang Dynasty then established the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the West]] ({{lang|zh-Hant|\u5b89\u897f\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) or Anxi Protectorate in 640 to control the region.\n\nDuring the devastating [[Anshi Rebellion]], which nearly led to the destruction of the Tang dynasty, [[Tibetan Empire|Tibet]] invaded the Tang on a wide front, from Xinjiang to [[Yunnan]].

Although Khitan and Chinese were the primary languages of administration, the empire also administered in Persian and [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]].<ref>''The Empire of the Qara Khitai in Eurasian History: Between China and the Islamic World'', pp. 94</ref>\n\n=== Islamisation of Xinjiang ===\n{{main|Islamization of Xinjiang}}\n{{Islam and China|places}}\n\nThe historical area of what is contemporary Xinjiang consisted of the distinct areas of the [[Tarim Basin]] and [[Dzungaria]], and was originally populated by Indo-European [[Tocharians|Tocharian]] and Iranic [[Saka]] peoples who practiced the [[Buddhist]] religion.

[[Four Oirat]]. 3.[[Moghulistan]] 4.[[Qara Del]]]]\n\nAfter [[Genghis Khan]] unified [[Mongolia]] and began his advance west, the Uyghur state in the Turpan-Urumchi area offered its allegiance to the Mongols in 1209, contributing taxes and troops to the Mongol imperial effort. In return, the Uyghur rulers retained control of their kingdom. By contrast, Genghis Khan's [[Mongol Empire]] conquered the [[Qara Khitai]] in 1218.\n\nXinjiang was a stronghold of [[Ogedai]] and later came under the control of his descendant [[Kaidu]]. This branch of the Mongol family kept the Yuan dynasty at bay until their rule came to an end.\n\nDuring the era of the Mongol Empire, the [[Yuan dynasty]] vied with the [[Chagatai Khanate]] for rule over the area, with the latter taking control of most of this region. After the break-up of the Chagatai Khanate into smaller [[khanates]] in the mid-14th century, the region fractured and was ruled by numerous Persianized Mongol Khans simultaneously, including the ones of [[Moghulistan]] (with the assistance of the local Dughlat Emirs), Uigurstan (later Turpan), and Kashgaria. These leaders engaged in wars with each other and the [[Timurid Empire|Timurid]]s of [[Transoxania]] to the west and the [[Oirats]] to the east, the successor Chagatai regime based in Mongolia and in China. In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.\n[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars]] between the Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]\nThe Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name=\"GibbLewis1998\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\n{{Main|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}\n[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]\n[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|right|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in [[Altishahr]], 1828]]\n\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.\n\nThe [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar\u2013Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate and many Han Chinese and ([[Hui people|Hui]]) moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}\n\n[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|thumb|left|The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] ca. 1820]]\nThe native [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]] suffered heavily from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous [[smallpox]] epidemic.

==\n[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]\n[[File:Turpan-flaming-mountains-camellos-d01.jpg|thumb|[[Flaming Mountains]].]]\n[[File:Fly over Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]\n\nXinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]\u2014it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]]. The inhabitable oasis accounts for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015.<ref name=\"oasis\"/>\n\n=== Mountain systems and basins ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nXinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|\u062a\u06d5\u06ad\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u063a}}, Tengri Tagh, \u0422\u04d9\u04a3\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0493), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].\n\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres below sea level.\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\nThe [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].\n\n=== Geology ===\nXinjiang is young geologically. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Xinjiang is a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].\n\n===Center of the continent===\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the \"center point of Asia\". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\n[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]\n[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is a famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].\n\n[[File:LakeKanas.jpg|thumb|[[Kanas Lake]]]] \nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]]. In the Dzungarian basin, a similar situation occurs with most rivers that historically flowed into [[Lake Manas]]. Some of the salt lakes, having lost much of their fresh water inflow, are now extensively use for the production of mineral salts (used e.g., in the manufacturing of [[potassium]] fertilizers); this includes the Lop Lake and the Manas Lake.\n\n=== Time ===\n{{main|Xinjiang Time|Time in China#Xinjiang}}\nXinjiang has the same time belt as the rest of China, Beijing time, UTC+8.

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]], while in the large cities of Han China, the primary religions practiced are [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] or a combination of them. The other major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han and other ethnicities that are the majority in the eastern regions of China. Hence, there is a noticeable voice of ethnic Uyghurs who would like to separate their region from China. Ironically, the capital of Xinjiang, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, was originally a Han and Hui (Tungan) city with few Uyghur people before recent Uyghur migration to the city.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |pp=77\u201378, 133\u2013134}} In retaliation against separatists, China has engaged in \"strike hard\" campaigns since 1996.<ref>''[http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215105736/http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ |date=15 December 2013 }}''</ref> On 5 June 2014, China sentenced nine persons to death for terrorist attacks.

The rugged [[Karakoram]], [[Kunlun Mountains|Kunlun]] and [[Tian Shan]] mountain ranges occupy much of Xinjiang's borders, as well as its western and southern regions. Xinjiang also borders the [[Tibet Autonomous Region]] and the provinces of [[Gansu]] and [[Qinghai]]. The most well-known route of the historical [[Silk Road]] ran through the territory from the east to its northwestern border.\n\nIn recent decades, abundant oil and mineral reserves have been found in Xinjiang and it is currently China's largest natural gas-producing region.\n\nIt is home to a number of ethnic groups, including the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]], [[Han Chinese|Han]], [[Kazakhs]], [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], [[Hui people|Hui]], [[Tajiks]], [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]], [[Mongols in China|Mongols]], [[Russians in China|Russians]] and [[Xibe people|Xibe]].<ref name=\"news.bbc.co.uk\">{{cite web |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |work=BBC News |title=Regions and territories: Xinjiang |date=7 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520054144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/country_profiles/8152132.stm |archive-date=20 May 2011}}</ref> More than a dozen autonomous prefectures and counties for minorities are in Xinjiang.

The territory came under the rule of the [[Qing dynasty]] in the 18th century, which was later replaced by the [[Republic of China (1912\u20131949)|Republic of China]] government. Since 1949, it has been part of the People's Republic of China following the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1954, [[Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps|Xinjiang Bingtuan]] was set up to strengthen the border defense against the Soviet Union and also promote the local economy. In 1955, Xinjiang was turned into an [[Autonomous administrative divisions of China|autonomous region]] from a province. In the last decades, the [[East Turkestan]] independent movement, [[Xinjiang conflict|separatist conflict]] and the influence of radical Islam have both resulted in unrest in the region, with

In the 2nd century BC, the Han dynasty made preparations for [[Han\u2013Xiongnu War|war against Xiongnu]] when [[Emperor Wu of Han]] dispatched the explorer [[Zhang Qian]] to explore the mysterious kingdoms to the west and to form an alliance with the [[Yuezhi]] people in order to combat the Xiongnu. As a result of these battles, the Chinese controlled the strategic region from the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] and [[Gansu]] [[Hexi Corridor|corridor]] to [[Lop Nor]]. They succeeded in separating the Xiongnu from the [[Qiang people|Qiang]] peoples to the south, and also gained direct access to the Western Regions. Han China sent Zhang Qian as an envoy to the states in the region, beginning several decades of struggle between the Xiongnu and Han China over dominance of the region, eventually ending in Chinese success. In 60 BC Han China established the [[Protectorate of the Western Regions]] ({{lang|zh-hant|\u897f\u57df\u90fd\u8b77\u5e9c}}) at Wulei ({{lang|zh-hant|\u70cf\u58d8}}, near modern [[Bayin'gholin Mongol Autonomous Prefecture|Luntai]]) to oversee the entire region as far west as the [[Pamir Mountains]], which would remain under the influence and [[suzerainty]] of the Han dynasty with some interruptions. For instance, it fell out of their control during the civil war against [[Wang Mang]] (r. AD 9\u201323). It was brought back under Han control in AD 91 due to the efforts of the general [[Ban Chao]].\n\nThe Western [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] succumbed to successive waves of invasions by nomads from the north at the beginning of the 4th century.

In the 17th century, the [[Dzungars]] established an empire over much of the region.\n\nThe Mongolian Dzungar was the collective identity of several [[Oirats|Oirat]] tribes that formed and maintained one of the last [[nomadic empire]]s. The [[Dzungar Khanate]] covered the area called [[Dzungaria]] and stretched from the west end of the [[Great Wall of China]] to present-day eastern Kazakhstan, and from present-day northern [[Kyrgyzstan]] to southern [[Siberia]]. Most of this area was only renamed \"Xinjiang\" by the Chinese after the fall of the Dzungar Empire. It existed from the early 17th century to the mid-18th century.\n[[File:Qing Dzungar wars.jpg|thumb|Map showing [[Dzungar\u2013Qing Wars]] between the Qing Dynasty and [[Dzungar Khanate]]]]\nThe Turkic Muslim sedentary people of the Tarim Basin were originally ruled by the [[Chagatai Khanate]] while the nomadic Buddhist Oirat Mongol in Dzungaria ruled over the [[Dzungar Khanate]]. The Naqshbandi Sufi [[Khoja (Turkestan)|Khoja]]s, descendants of the Islamic prophet, Muhammad, had replaced the Chagatayid Khans as the ruling authority of the Tarim Basin in the early 17th century. There was a struggle between two factions of Khojas, the Afaqi (White Mountain) faction and the Ishaqi (Black Mountain) faction. The Ishaqi defeated the Afaqi, which resulted in the [[Afaq Khoja]] inviting the [[5th Dalai Lama]], the leader of the [[Tibetan people|Tibetans]], to intervene on his behalf in 1677. The 5th Dalai Lama then called upon his Dzungar Buddhist followers in the Dzungar Khanate to act on this invitation. The Dzungar Khanate then conquered the Tarim Basin in 1680, setting up the Afaqi Khoja as their puppet ruler.\n\nAfter converting to Islam, the descendants of the previously [[Kingdom of Qocho|Buddhist Uyghurs in Turfan]] failed to retain memory of their ancestral legacy and falsely believed that the \"infidel Kalmuks\" ([[Dzungar people|Dzungars]]) were the ones who built Buddhist monuments in their area.<ref name=\"GibbLewis1998\">{{cite book|author1=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|author2=Bernard Lewis|author3=Johannes Hendrik Kramers |author4=Charles Pellat |author5=Joseph Schacht|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PJPrAAAAMAAJ|year=1998|publisher=Brill|page=677}}</ref>\n\n=== Qing dynasty ===\n{{Main|Xinjiang under Qing rule}}\n[[File:Battle of Oroi-Jalatu.jpg|thumb|right|The Battle of Oroi-Jalatu in 1756 between the Manchu and Oirat armies]]\n[[File:Battle at Awabat-chuang.jpg|thumb|right|A scene of the Qing campaign against rebels in [[Altishahr]], 1828]]\n\nThe Turkic Muslims of the Turfan and Kumul Oases then submitted to the [[Qing dynasty]] of China, and asked China to free them from the Dzungars. The Qing accepted the rulers of Turfan and Kumul as Qing vassals. The Qing dynasty waged war against the Dzungars for decades until finally defeating them and then Qing Manchu [[Eight Banners|Bannermen]] carried out the [[Dzungar genocide]], nearly wiping them from existence and depopulating Dzungaria. The Qing then freed the Afaqi Khoja leader Burhan-ud-din and his brother Khoja Jihan from their imprisonment by the Dzungars, and appointed them to rule as Qing vassals over the Tarim Basin. The Khoja brothers decided to renege on this deal and declare themselves as independent leaders of the Tarim Basin. The Qing and the Turfan leader Emin Khoja crushed their revolt and China then took full control of both Dzungaria and the Tarim Basin by 1759.\n\nThe [[Manchu people|Manchu]] Qing dynasty of China gained control over eastern Xinjiang as a result of a [[Dzungar\u2013Qing War|long struggle with the Dzungars]] that began in the 17th century. In 1755, with the help of the Oirat noble [[Amursana]], the Qing attacked [[Yining City|Ghulja]] and captured the Dzungar khan. After Amursana's request to be declared Dzungar khan went unanswered, he led a revolt against the Qing. Over the next two years, Qing armies destroyed the remnants of the Dzungar Khanate and many Han Chinese and ([[Hui people|Hui]]) moved into the pacified areas.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |p=98}}\n\n[[File:Qing Empire circa 1820 EN.svg|thumb|left|The [[Qing dynasty|Qing Empire]] ca. 1820]]\nThe native [[Dzungar people|Dzungar Oirat Mongols]] suffered heavily from the brutal campaigns and a simultaneous [[smallpox]] epidemic.

==\n[[File:Karakorum-d04.jpg|thumb|Close to [[Karakoram Highway]] in Xinjiang.]]\n[[File:Turpan-flaming-mountains-camellos-d01.jpg|thumb|[[Flaming Mountains]].]]\n[[File:Fly over Pamir Mountains and Karakoram Highway.jpg|thumb|[[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Muztagh Ata]].]]\n\nXinjiang is the largest [[Administrative divisions of the People's Republic of China|political subdivision of China]]\u2014it accounts for more than one sixth of China's total territory and a quarter of its boundary length. Xinjiang is mostly covered with uninhabitable deserts and dry grasslands, with dotted oases at the foot of [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Mountains]] and [[Altai Mountains]]. The inhabitable oasis accounts for 9.7% of Xinjiang's total area by 2015.<ref name=\"oasis\"/>\n\n=== Mountain systems and basins ===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nXinjiang is split by the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range ({{ug-textonly|\u062a\u06d5\u06ad\u0631\u0649 \u062a\u0627\u063a}}, Tengri Tagh, \u0422\u04d9\u04a3\u0440\u0438 \u0422\u0430\u0493), which divides it into two large basins: the [[Dzungarian Basin]] in the north and the [[Tarim Basin]] in the south. A small V-shaped wedge between these two major basins, limited by the Tian Shan's main range in the south and the [[Borohoro Mountains]] in the north, is the basin of the [[Ili River]], which flows into Kazakhstan's [[Lake Balkhash]]; an even smaller wedge farther north is the [[Emin Valley]].\n\nOther major mountain ranges of Xinjiang include the [[Pamir Mountains]] and [[Karakoram]] in the southwest, the [[Kunlun Mountains]] in the south (along the border with [[Tibet Autonomous Region|Tibet]]) and the [[Altai Mountains]] in the northeast (shared with [[Mongolia]]). The region's highest point is the mountain [[K2]], [[eight-thousander|8611 metres above sea level]], in the Karakoram Mountains on the border with [[Pakistan]].\n\nMuch of the Tarim Basin is dominated by the [[Taklamakan Desert]]. North of it is the [[Turpan Depression]], which contains the lowest point in Xinjiang and in the entire PRC, at 155 metres below sea level.\n\nThe Dzungarian Basin is slightly cooler, and receives somewhat more precipitation, than the Tarim Basin. Nonetheless, it, too, has a large [[Gurbant\u00fcngg\u00fct Desert]] (also known as Dzoosotoyn Elisen) in its center.\n\nThe [[Tian Shan]] mountain range marks the Xinjiang-Kyrgyzstan border at the [[Torugart Pass]] (3752 m). The [[Karakorum highway]] (KKH) links [[Islamabad]], Pakistan with [[Kashgar]] over the [[Khunjerab Pass]].\n\n=== Geology ===\nXinjiang is young geologically. Collision of the Indian and the Eurasian plates formed the [[Tian Shan]], [[Kunlun Shan]], and [[Pamir Mountains|Pamir]] mountain ranges. Xinjiang is a very active earthquake zone. Older geological formations are located in the far north, where the [[Junggar Block]] is geologically part of [[Kazakhstan]], and in the east, where is part of the [[North China Craton]].\n\n===Center of the continent===\nXinjiang has within its borders, in the [[Dzoosotoyn Elisen Desert]], the location in [[Eurasia]] that is furthest from the sea in any direction (a [[continental pole of inaccessibility]]): {{coord|46|16.8|N|86|40.2|E|type:landmark|name=Eurasian pole of inaccessibility}}. It is at least {{convert|1645|mi|km|abbr=on|order=flip}} (straight-line distance) from any coastline.\n\nIn 1992, local geographers determined another point within Xinjiang{{spaced ndash}}{{coord|43|40|52|N|87|19|52|E}} in the southwestern suburbs of [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi County]]{{spaced ndash}}to be the \"center point of Asia\". A [[Geographical Center of Asian Continent|monument to this effect]] was then erected there and the site has become a local tourist attraction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|title=DCP: Geographic Center of Asia (visit #1)|website=www.confluence.org|access-date=13 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160602180943/http://www.confluence.org/confluence.php?visitid=12710|archive-date=2 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Rivers and lakes ===\n[[File:Tianchi Lake.jpg|thumb|left|[[Tianchi Lake (Tianshan)|Tianchi Lake]]]]\n[[File:ColourfulBeach.jpg|thumb|Black [[Irtysh]] river in [[Burqin County]] is a famous spot for [[sightseeing]].]]\nHaving hot summer and low precipitation, most of Xinjiang is [[endorheic]]. Its rivers either disappear in the desert, or terminate in salt lakes (within Xinjiang itself, or in neighboring Kazakhstan), instead of running towards an ocean. The northernmost part of the region, with the [[Irtysh River]] rising in the Altai Mountains, that flows (via Kazakhstan and Russia) toward the [[Arctic Ocean]], is the only exception. But even so, a significant part of the Irtysh's waters were artificially diverted via the [[Irtysh\u2013Karamay\u2013\u00dcr\u00fcmqi Canal]] to the drier regions of southern [[Dzungarian Basin]].\n\n[[File:LakeKanas.jpg|thumb|[[Kanas Lake]]]] \nElsewhere, most of Xinjiang's rivers are comparatively short streams fed by the snows of the several ranges of the Tian Shan. Once they enter the populated areas in the mountains' foothills, their waters are extensively used for irrigation, so that the river often disappears in the desert instead of reaching the lake to whose basin it nominally belongs. This is the case even with the main river of the [[Tarim Basin]], the [[Tarim River|Tarim]], which has been dammed at a number of locations along its course, and whose waters have been completely diverted before they can reach the [[Lop Lake]].

According to the Asia-Pacific Center for Security Studies, the two main sources for [[separatism]] in the Xinjiang Province are religion and ethnicity. Religiously, the Uyghur peoples of Xinjiang follow [[Islam]], while in the large cities of Han China, the primary religions practiced are [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]] or a combination of them. The other major difference and source of friction with eastern China is ethnicity. The Uyghurs are ethnically, linguistically, and culturally Turkic, a clear distinction from the Han and other ethnicities that are the majority in the eastern regions of China. Hence, there is a noticeable voice of ethnic Uyghurs who would like to separate their region from China. Ironically, the capital of Xinjiang, \u00dcr\u00fcmqi, was originally a Han and Hui (Tungan) city with few Uyghur people before recent Uyghur migration to the city.{{sfnp|Millward |2007 |pp=77\u201378, 133\u2013134}} In retaliation against separatists, China has engaged in \"strike hard\" campaigns since 1996.<ref>''[http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ Uyghur Muslim Ethnic Separatism in Xinjiang, China] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131215105736/http://www.apcss.org/college/publications/uyghur-muslim-ethnic-separatism-in-xinjiang-china/ |date=15 December 2013 }}''</ref> On 5 June 2014, China sentenced nine persons to death for terrorist attacks.
