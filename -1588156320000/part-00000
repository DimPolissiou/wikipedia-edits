{"title_page": "Non-English-based programming languages", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikimedia list article}}\n{{cleanup|reason=List inclusion criteria.|date=February 2015}}\n'''Non-English-based programming languages''' are [[programming language]]s that do not use keywords taken from or inspired by [[English language|English]] vocabulary.\n\n== Prevalence of English-based programming languages ==\n{{further|English in computing}}\n\nThe use of the [[English language|English]] language in the inspiration for the choice of elements, in particular for [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s in computer programming languages and code libraries, represents a significant trend in the history of language design. According to the HOPL online database of languages,<ref>In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.</ref> out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]<!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page -->, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].\n\nThus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English.\n\n== International programming languages ==\nThe concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British [[computer scientist]]s [[Christopher Strachey]], [[Peter Landin]], and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages [[ALGOL]] was exemplary.\n\n[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]]. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the \"Final Report\" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The standard was also available in [[Braille]]. ALGOL 68 went on to become the [[GOST|GOST/\u0413\u041e\u0421\u0422]]-27974-88 standard in the [[Soviet Union]].\n* GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 \u2013 \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68<ref>{{cite web |url= http://vak.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/book/gost/pdf/gost-27974-88.pdf |title= GOST 27974-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 - \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68 |language= Russian |year= 1988 |publisher= [[GOST]] |accessdate= November 15, 2008 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20170324231641/http://vak.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/book/gost/pdf/gost-27974-88.pdf |archive-date= March 24, 2017 |url-status= dead }}</ref>\n* GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended \u2013 \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439<ref>\n{{cite web | url=http://vak.ru/lib/exe/fetch.php/book/gost/pdf/gost-27975-88.pdf\n | title=GOST 27975-88 Programming language ALGOL 68 extended - \u042f\u0437\u044b\u043a \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0433\u0440\u0430\u043c\u043c\u0438\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0430\u043d\u0438\u044f \u0410\u041b\u0413\u041e\u041b 68 \u0440\u0430\u0441\u0448\u0438\u0440\u0435\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439\n | language=Russian | year=1988 | publisher=[[GOST]]\n | accessdate=November 15, 2008 }}</ref>\nIn English, Algol68's case statement reads '''case''' ~ '''in''' ~ '''out''' ~ '''esac'''.

According to the HOPL online database of languages,<ref>In HOPL (History of Programming Languages), advanced search finds languages by country.</ref> out of the 8,500+ programming languages recorded, roughly 2,400 of them were developed in the [[United States]]<!-- I searched for all US entries, then counted pages, multiplied by entries per page -->, 600 in the [[United Kingdom]], 160 in [[Canada]], and 75 in [[Australia]].\n\nThus, over a third of all programming languages have been developed in countries where English is the primary language. This does not take into account the usage share of each language, situations where a language was developed in a non-English-speaking country but used English to appeal to an international audience (see the case of [[Python (programming language)|Python]] from the [[Netherlands]], [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] from [[Japan]], and [[Lua (programming language)|Lua]] from [[Brazil]]), and situations where it was based on another language which used English.\n\n== International programming languages ==\nThe concept of international style programming languages was inspired by the work of British [[computer scientist]]s [[Christopher Strachey]], [[Peter Landin]], and others. It represents a class of languages of which the line of the algorithmic languages [[ALGOL]] was exemplary.\n\n[[ALGOL 68]]'s standard document was published in numerous [[natural languages]]. The standard allowed the internationalization of the programming language. On December 20, 1968, the \"Final Report\" (MR 101) was adopted by the Working Group, then subsequently approved by the General Assembly of [[UNESCO]]'s [[IFIP]] for publication. Translations of the standard were made for [[Russian language|Russian]], [[German language|German]], [[French language|French]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]], and then later [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. The standard was also available in [[Braille]].

In 2007, the agreement between TNA and the NWA ended, leading to the creation of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.  The championship was unveiled on May 14, 2007 at the taping of TNA's primary television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', which aired on May 17, 2007.<ref name=\"PWTorchImpact0517\"/> The inaugural champion was [[Kurt Angle]], who also holds the record for the most reigns at six.\n\nWhen TNA changed its name and became Impact Wrestling in March 2017, the title was renamed soon after to reflect the change. After Impact Wrestling rebranded to GFW later that year, the title was [[Championship unification|unified]] with the [[GFW Global Championship (2014\u20132017)|original GFW Global Championship]] at [[Slammiversary XV]] and became the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship. Following [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X]], the title took the GFW Global Championship name and kept the former TNA lineage. On October 23, 2017, the GFW name was dropped and the company name was reverted to Impact Wrestling when the company severed ties with Jeff Jarrett and he took the GFW name with him. However, Impact Wrestling kept the Global Championship name for their championship and the title was then called the Impact Global Championship. As of the February 1, 2018 episode of ''Impact!'', the title has been known as the Impact World Championship. On June 4, 2018, the title was unified with the [[Impact Grand Championship]].\n\n== History ==\nImpact Wrestling was formed as NWA: Total Nonstop Action in May 2002.<ref name=\"Yearone\">{{cite video|people=[[Total Nonstop Action]]|title=TNA Wrestling: Year One|publisher=[[TNA Home Video]]}}</ref> Later that same year, TNA was granted control over the NWA World Heavyweight and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championships]] by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body;

In September 2017, GFW reverted their branding to Impact Wrestling.\n\n== Championship belt design ==\nDuring the championship's history it has had five designs, with the original title belt (which was unveiled in May 2007) having on its center plate an imprint of an eagle with its wings extended. The word \"World\" was placed above the eagle's head on a ribbon. The ribbon was wrapped around the bird's wings and body. Five stars were engraved on the ribbon when it passed over each of the bird's wings and the word \"Champion\" as it passed over the bird's talons. The words \"Heavyweight Wrestling\" were printed across the bird's chest. At the top of the center plate there was TNA logo. Four smaller side plates had an imprint of a globe centered with TNA's logo at the top and bottom of each. At each end of the title belt there was a small plate that covered the championship belt snaps with TNA's logo engraved on each.{{ref|1}}\n\n[[File:NewJeffHardy1.JPG|thumb|right|200px|[[Jeff Hardy]] with the second title belt design, dubbed the \"Immortal Championship\"]]\n\nAt the November 8, 2010 tapings of the November 11 episode of ''Impact!'', TNA introduced a new design for the TNA World Heavyweight Championship belt, which the champion [[Jeff Hardy]] dubbed the \"Immortal Championship\", as part of the [[Immortal (professional wrestling)|Immortal]] storyline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TNA_News_1/article_45151.shtml|title=TNA News: Impact TV taping spoiler - TNA to introduce new title belt on Thursday's Impact (w/pic)|last=Caldwell|first=James|date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2010-11-09|work=Pro Wrestling Torch}}</ref> The new design consisted of a purple strap with a silver center plate depicting a masked head (designed to resemble Hardy's face with face paint), the TNA logo on the forehead and blue lines along the mask.

At [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X 2017]], the GFW Global Championship belt, with an updated color scheme and ''Impact'' logos on the side plates, became the sole belt used. Following departure of Jeff Jarrett from the promotion, the company reverted to the Impact Wrestling name and the title belt was updated with Impact plate to reflect the change.\n\nA new title design was announced and introduced at Impact Wrestling's [[Impact Wrestling Redemption|Redemption]] on April 22, 2018. The gold center plate has the Impact logo with an owl design on top of it and \"World Champion\" inscribed below the logo. On each side of the center plate is a group of four smaller gold plates, with the first two on each side featuring separate corresponding halves of a globe with \"World\" inscribed above the globes and \"Champion\" inscribed below them and the second pair featuring the Impact logo without an owl design. In 2020 a modified version of this belt was introduced, with red shading replacing the previous blue, to reflect the new TV home of Impact, the Anthem owned [[AXS TV]].\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Main|List of Impact World Champions}}\nOverall, there have been 48 reigns shared among 27 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Kurt Angle, who won the championship by defeating Christian Cage and Sting in a three match on May 13, 2007, at TNA's Sacrifice event. Angle's first reign also holds the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at 1 day. Angle also holds the record for the most reigns, at six.<ref name=\"titlehistory2008\"/> At {{age in days|month1=10|day1=26|year1=2011|month2=07|day2=08|year2=2012}} days, [[Bobby Roode]]'s first reign is the longest in the title's history.

In 2007, the agreement between TNA and the NWA ended, leading to the creation of the TNA World Heavyweight Championship.  The championship was unveiled on May 14, 2007 at the taping of TNA's primary television program, ''[[Impact! (TV series)|Impact!]]'', which aired on May 17, 2007.<ref name=\"PWTorchImpact0517\"/> The inaugural champion was [[Kurt Angle]], who also holds the record for the most reigns at six.\n\nWhen TNA changed its name and became Impact Wrestling in March 2017, the title was renamed soon after to reflect the change. After Impact Wrestling rebranded to GFW later that year, the title was [[Championship unification|unified]] with the [[GFW Global Championship (2014\u20132017)|original GFW Global Championship]] at [[Slammiversary XV]] and became the Unified GFW World Heavyweight Championship. Following [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X]], the title took the GFW Global Championship name and kept the former TNA lineage. On October 23, 2017, the GFW name was dropped and the company name was reverted to Impact Wrestling when the company severed ties with Jeff Jarrett and he took the GFW name with him. However, Impact Wrestling kept the Global Championship name for their championship and the title was then called the Impact Global Championship. As of the February 1, 2018 episode of ''Impact!'', the title has been known as the Impact World Championship. On June 4, 2018, the title was unified with the [[Impact Grand Championship]].\n\n== History ==\nImpact Wrestling was formed as NWA: Total Nonstop Action in May 2002.<ref name=\"Yearone\">{{cite video|people=[[Total Nonstop Action]]|title=TNA Wrestling: Year One|publisher=[[TNA Home Video]]}}</ref> Later that same year, TNA was granted control over the NWA World Heavyweight and [[NWA World Tag Team Championship|World Tag Team Championships]] by the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) governing body;

The word \"World\" was placed above the eagle's head on a ribbon. The ribbon was wrapped around the bird's wings and body. Five stars were engraved on the ribbon when it passed over each of the bird's wings and the word \"Champion\" as it passed over the bird's talons. The words \"Heavyweight Wrestling\" were printed across the bird's chest. At the top of the center plate there was TNA logo.

At [[Destination X (2017)|Destination X 2017]], the GFW Global Championship belt, with an updated color scheme and ''Impact'' logos on the side plates, became the sole belt used. Following departure of Jeff Jarrett from the promotion, the company reverted to the Impact Wrestling name and the title belt was updated with Impact plate to reflect the change.\n\nA new title design was announced and introduced at Impact Wrestling's [[Impact Wrestling Redemption|Redemption]] on April 22, 2018. The gold center plate has the Impact logo with an owl design on top of it and \"World Champion\" inscribed below the logo. On each side of the center plate is a group of four smaller gold plates, with the first two on each side featuring separate corresponding halves of a globe with \"World\" inscribed above the globes and \"Champion\" inscribed below them and the second pair featuring the Impact logo without an owl design. In 2020 a modified version of this belt was introduced, with red shading replacing the previous blue, to reflect the new TV home of Impact, the Anthem owned [[AXS TV]].\n\n== Reigns ==\n{{Main|List of Impact World Champions}}\nOverall, there have been 48 reigns shared among 27 wrestlers. The inaugural champion was Kurt Angle, who won the championship by defeating Christian Cage and Sting in a three match on May 13, 2007, at TNA's Sacrifice event. Angle's first reign also holds the record for shortest reign in the title's history, at 1 day.

The title has been vacated five different times.\n\n[[Tessa Blanchard]] is the current champion in her first reign.

pershkon nje fushe te bukur ,te sistemuar me ngastra te rregullta,me kanale te shumte kullues dhe ujites,kryesore dhe dytesore ,te shperndare ne gjithe siperfaqen si enet kapilare te nje organizmi te gjalle.Gjithcka eshte fryti I punes se fermerve ne vite,por edhe I ndimes se shtetit.Ne krye te kesaj fushe,si ne nje sofer gjigande shtrihet Babani.Pozicjoni I pershtacem,rruget e gjera,sheshet dhe hapsirat ndermjet ndertesave te krijojne menjehere pershtypjen se ke te besh me nje lagje qyteti vendosur ne pjesen lindore te Moraves.Nga kjo sofer natyrore mund te kontrollosh me sy cdo skaj te fushes,mund shijosh bukurite e natyres dhe ato qe ka rrijuar njeriu.\nSa I lashte eshte Babani\nSipas gojedhenave,fshati ka qene I vendosur ne pjesen jug-perendimore te vendbanimit te sotem,ne nje largesi rreth 2 km,ne vendin e quajtur Magjer ose sic e quajne sot Perroi I Maqerit.Nje vend I mbrojtur nga era,nje burim dhe nje pyll afer,kushte te pershtacme per te ngritur nje qender banimi.Zhvendosja filloi rreth shekujve XIII-XIV per shkak te rritjes natyrore te popullsise.\nHistoria e emrit Baban\nNje nga gojdhenat thote se prinderit e nje familje kishin nje vajze te vetme.E martuan ne nje fshat afer qe te vinte me dendur kur te kishin nevoje per te.Vizitat e shpeshta te prinderve,u benin pershtypje banorve dhe e pyesnin:\u201dKu vete kaq shpesh moj bije\u201d?\u201dTe babaj\u201d-ishte pergjigja e shkurter.Dhe fraza perpunohej ne gojen e njerezve:Erdhi ajo e babajt,erdhi te babaj,ne babaj\u2026Duke u ngurtesuarne trajten e sotme:Baban.\nPopullsia\nNe vitin 1923 Babani kishte 145 shtepi me 936 banore,te gjithe myslimane.58 shtepi ishin djegur nga greket ne vitet 1912-1918.Me 1927 kishte 1 xhami dhe 1 mesonjetore.Ne vitin 1943 kishte 1367 banore.Fundi I vitit 2009 e gjeti me 476 familje dhe 1796 banore duke zene vendin e trete ne Devoll pas Mirasit dhe Bitinckes dhe duke lene prapa Hocishtin qe eshte qendra e komunes.Sot ka 26 fise qe jetojne ne harmoni te plote.Fiset me te medhenj jane:Agastra,Mancka,Spaho,Keco,Hoxha.Eshte fshat me tradita patriotike,ushqyer me idete e Rilindjes sone Kombetare.Nevruz Babani ne Xheimstoun dha ndime per gazeten \u201cKoha\u201d.Me 30 dhjetor 1917 u mbajt kuvendi I shoqerise FM Shqiptare.Ndikim civilizues luajten mergimtaret.\nShkolla 7 vjecare u hap ne vitin 1948 me 32 nxenes ne klasen e peste.Me 1951 u ndertua njera pjese e godines qe eshte dhe sot dhe ka 16 doma mesimi.Qe atehere e deri sot ketu kane lene gjurme te pashlyera mesuesit bashkefshatare:Nexhdet Mero,Nexhat Mero,Agim Agastra,Xhoni Keco,Neki Mero,Njazi Agastra,Ali Mulla,Fiqiri Serjani,Remzi Keco,Velisha Mytkolli,Seri Mancka,Aferdita Mero,Fejzi Keco,Samidin Agastra,Remzi Colla etj.Nga dyert e kesaj shkolle kane dale per te
