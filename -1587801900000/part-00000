Steever, its history can be conventionally divided into three periods: Old Kannada (''Halegannada'') from 450\u20131200 CE, Middle Kannada (''Nadugannada'') from 1200\u20131700, and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present.<ref name=\"steeve\">Steever, S. B. (1998), p. 129</ref> Kannada is influenced to an appreciable extent by Sanskrit. Influences of other languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Pali]] can also be found in the Kannada language. The scholar [[Iravatham Mahadevan]] indicated that Kannada was already a language of rich oral tradition earlier than the 3rd century BCE, and based on the native Kannada words found in Prakrit inscriptions of that period, Kannada must have been spoken by a widespread and stable population.<ref name=\"ciil\">{{cite web|title=Classical Kannada, Antiquity of Kannada |url=http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425022336/http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 April 2010 |publisher=Central Institute for Indian Languages |work=Centre for classical Kannada |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tamil_epigraphy1\" /> The scholar K.

The use of the vowel ''a'' as an adjective is not prevalent in Tamil but its usage is available in Kannada. Kannada words such as ''gouDi-gavuDi'' transform into Tamil's ''kavuDi'' for lack of the usage of ''Ghosha svana'' in Tamil. Hence the Kannada word 'gavuDi' becomes 'kavuDi' in Tamil. 'Posil' ('hosilu') was introduced into Tamil from Kannada and colloquial Tamil uses this word as 'Vaayil'. In a 1st-century CE Tamil inscription, there is a personal reference to ''ayjayya'', a word of Kannada origin. In a 3rd-century CE Tamil inscription there is usage of ''oppanappa vIran''. Here the honorific ''appa'' to a person's name is an influence from Kannada. Another word of Kannada origin is ''taayviru'' and is found in a 4th-century CE Tamil inscription. S. Settar studied the ''sittanvAsal'' inscription of first century CE as also the inscriptions at ''tirupparamkunram'', ''adakala'' and ''neDanUpatti''. The later inscriptions were studied in detail by Iravatham Mahadevan also. Mahadevan argues that the words ''erumi'', ''kavuDi'', ''poshil'' and ''tAyiyar'' have their origin in Kannada because Tamil cognates are not available. Settar adds the words ''nADu'' and ''iLayar'' to this list. Mahadevan feels that some grammatical categories found in these inscriptions are also unique to Kannada rather than Tamil. Both these scholars attribute these influences to the movements and spread of Jainas in these regions. These inscriptions belong to the period between the first century BCE and fourth century CE. These are some examples that are proof of the early usage of a few Kannada origin words in early [[Tamil language|Tamil]] inscriptions before the common era and in the early centuries of the common era.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DZBkAAAAMAAJ&dq=Early+Tamil+Epigraphy&q=posil|title=Early Tamil Epigraphy|isbn=9780674012271|last1=Mahadevan|first1=Iravatham|year=2003}}</ref>\n\nIn the 150 CE Prakrit book ''Gaathaa Saptashati'', written by Haala Raja, Kannada words like ''tIr or Teer (''meaning ''to be able)'', ''tuppa'', ''peTTu'', ''poTTu, poTTa, piTTu (''meaning ''to strike), Pode (Hode)'' have been used. On the Pallava Prakrit inscription of 250 CE of Hire Hadagali's Shivaskandavarman, the Kannada word ''kOTe'' transforms into ''koTTa''. In the 350 CE Chandravalli Prakrit inscription, words of Kannada origin like ''punaaTa'', ''puNaDa'' have been used.

The works of this period are based on [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] principles. Two of the early writers of this period are [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] and Raghavanka, trailblazers in their own right. Harihara established the ''Ragale'' form of composition while [[Raghavanka]] popularised the ''Shatpadi'' (six-lined stanza) meter.<ref name=\"hari\">Sastri (1955), pp&nbsp;361\u20132</ref> A famous [[Jainism|Jaina]] writer of the same period is [[Janna]], who expressed Jain religious teachings through his works.<ref name=\"jan\">Narasimhacharya (1988), p20</ref>\n\nThe [[Vachana|Vachana Sahitya]] tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature, and the sum of contributions by all sections of society. Vachanas were pithy poems on that period's social, religious and economic conditions. More importantly, they held a mirror to the seed of social revolution, which caused a radical re-examination of the ideas of caste, creed and religion. Some of the important writers of Vachana literature include [[Basavanna]], [[Allama Prabhu]] and [[Akka Mahadevi]].<ref name=\"akka\">Sastri (1955), p361</ref>\n\nEmperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE recognised that the Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was ''Margi'' (formal or written form of language) and ''Desi'' (folk or spoken form of language) style was popular and made his people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada. In 1112 CE, Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda, Dharwad district, in his Champu work ''Dharmamrita'' (\u0ca7\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cae\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc3\u0ca4), a book on morals, warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of clarified butter and oil. He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada. In 1235 CE, Jain poet Andayya, wrote ''Kabbigara Kava''- \u0c95\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cb0 \u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb5 (Poet's Defender), also called ''Sobagina Suggi'' (Harvest of Beauty) or ''Madana-Vijaya and'' ''Kavana-Gella'' (Cupid's Conquest)'','' a ''Champu'' work in pure Kannada using only indigenous (''desya'') Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words \u2013 ''tadbhavas'', without the admixture of Sanskrit words. He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated that it was impossible to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words. Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates. Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature (like Tamil), but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary (like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, etc.) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqGojPpe8DIC|title=Indian Literature|last=Nagendra|first=Dr.|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan, 1988|year=1988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.489059|quote=andayya pure kannada.|title=History of Kannada Literature: Readership Lectures|last=Narasimhacharya|first=Ramanujapuram|publisher=Asian Educational Services, 1988|isbn=9788120603035|year=1988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&dq=andayya|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|publisher=Sahitya Akademi, 1987|isbn=9788126018031|year=1987}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2noBgAAQBAJ|title=Gods, Heroes and their Story Tellers: Intangible cultural heritage of South India|last=Hari Saravanan|first=V.|publisher=Notion Press, 2014|isbn=9789384391492|year=2014}}</ref><ref name=\"kannada literature\">Rice, Edward.

Among them are [[Kundagannada]] (spoken exclusively in Kundapura, Brahmavara, Bynduru and Hebri), Nadavar-Kannada (spoken by [[Nadavaru]]), [[Havigannada]] (spoken mainly by [[Havyaka Brahmin]]s), [[Are Bhashe]] (spoken by Gowda community mainly in [[Madikeri]] and [[Sullia]] region of [[Dakshina Kannada]]), Malenadu Kannada (Sakaleshpur, Coorg, Shimoga, Chikmagalur), [[Sholaga language|Sholaga]], [[Gulbarga Kannada]], Dharawad Kannada etc. All of these dialects are influenced by their regional and cultural background. The one million [[Komarpant]]s in and around Goa speak their own dialect of Kannada, known as Halegannada. They are settled throughout Goa state, throughout Uttara Kannada district and Khanapur taluk of Belagavi district, Karnataka.<ref>{{Cite book|title=A Journey from Madras through the Countries of Mysore, Canara, and Malabar.

The character set is almost identical to that of other [[Languages of India|Indian languages]]. The Kannada script is almost perfectly phonetic, but for the sound of a \"half n\" (which becomes a half m). The number of written symbols, however, is far more than the forty-nine characters in the alphabet, because different characters can be combined to form ''compound'' characters ''(ottakshara)''. Each written symbol in the Kannada script corresponds with one [[syllable]], as opposed to one [[phoneme]] in languages like English. The Kannada script is syllabic.\n\n== Dictionary ==\nKannada\u2013Kannada dictionary has existed in Kannada along with ancient works of Kannada grammar.

Steever, its history can be conventionally divided into three periods: Old Kannada (''Halegannada'') from 450\u20131200 CE, Middle Kannada (''Nadugannada'') from 1200\u20131700, and Modern Kannada from 1700 to the present.<ref name=\"steeve\">Steever, S. B. (1998), p. 129</ref> Kannada is influenced to an appreciable extent by Sanskrit. Influences of other languages such as [[Prakrit]] and [[Pali]] can also be found in the Kannada language. The scholar [[Iravatham Mahadevan]] indicated that Kannada was already a language of rich oral tradition earlier than the 3rd century BCE, and based on the native Kannada words found in Prakrit inscriptions of that period, Kannada must have been spoken by a widespread and stable population.<ref name=\"ciil\">{{cite web|title=Classical Kannada, Antiquity of Kannada |url=http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100425022336/http://www.classicalkannada.org/LanguageEng.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=25 April 2010 |publisher=Central Institute for Indian Languages |work=Centre for classical Kannada |accessdate=28 August 2011 }}</ref><ref name=\"Tamil_epigraphy1\" /> The scholar K.

Narasimhachar in Kamath 2001, p5)</ref>\n\nIn some 3rd\u20131st century BCE Tamil inscriptions, words of Kannada influence such as ''nalliyooraa'', ''kavuDi'' and ''posil'' have been introduced. The use of the vowel ''a'' as an adjective is not prevalent in Tamil but its usage is available in Kannada. Kannada words such as ''gouDi-gavuDi'' transform into Tamil's ''kavuDi'' for lack of the usage of ''Ghosha svana'' in Tamil. Hence the Kannada word 'gavuDi' becomes 'kavuDi' in Tamil. 'Posil' ('hosilu') was introduced into Tamil from Kannada and colloquial Tamil uses this word as 'Vaayil'. In a 1st-century CE Tamil inscription, there is a personal reference to ''ayjayya'', a word of Kannada origin. In a 3rd-century CE Tamil inscription there is usage of ''oppanappa vIran''. Here the honorific ''appa'' to a person's name is an influence from Kannada. Another word of Kannada origin is ''taayviru'' and is found in a 4th-century CE Tamil inscription. S. Settar studied the ''sittanvAsal'' inscription of first century CE as also the inscriptions at ''tirupparamkunram'', ''adakala'' and ''neDanUpatti''. The later inscriptions were studied in detail by Iravatham Mahadevan also. Mahadevan argues that the words ''erumi'', ''kavuDi'', ''poshil'' and ''tAyiyar'' have their origin in Kannada because Tamil cognates are not available. Settar adds the words ''nADu'' and ''iLayar'' to this list. Mahadevan feels that some grammatical categories found in these inscriptions are also unique to Kannada rather than Tamil. Both these scholars attribute these influences to the movements and spread of Jainas in these regions. These inscriptions belong to the period between the first century BCE and fourth century CE.

The works of this period are based on [[Jainism|Jain]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] principles. Two of the early writers of this period are [[Harihara (poet)|Harihara]] and Raghavanka, trailblazers in their own right. Harihara established the ''Ragale'' form of composition while [[Raghavanka]] popularised the ''Shatpadi'' (six-lined stanza) meter.<ref name=\"hari\">Sastri (1955), pp&nbsp;361\u20132</ref> A famous [[Jainism|Jaina]] writer of the same period is [[Janna]], who expressed Jain religious teachings through his works.<ref name=\"jan\">Narasimhacharya (1988), p20</ref>\n\nThe [[Vachana|Vachana Sahitya]] tradition of the 12th century is purely native and unique in world literature, and the sum of contributions by all sections of society.

More importantly, they held a mirror to the seed of social revolution, which caused a radical re-examination of the ideas of caste, creed and religion. Some of the important writers of Vachana literature include [[Basavanna]], [[Allama Prabhu]] and [[Akka Mahadevi]].<ref name=\"akka\">Sastri (1955), p361</ref>\n\nEmperor Nripatunga Amoghavarsha I of 850 CE recognised that the Sanskrit style of Kannada literature was ''Margi'' (formal or written form of language) and ''Desi'' (folk or spoken form of language) style was popular and made his people aware of the strength and beauty of their native language Kannada. In 1112 CE, Jain poet Nayasena of Mulugunda, Dharwad district, in his Champu work ''Dharmamrita'' (\u0ca7\u0cb0\u0ccd\u0cae\u0cbe\u0cae\u0cc3\u0ca4), a book on morals, warns writers from mixing Kannada with Sanskrit by comparing it with mixing of clarified butter and oil. He has written it using very limited Sanskrit words which fit with idiomatic Kannada. In 1235 CE, Jain poet Andayya, wrote ''Kabbigara Kava''- \u0c95\u0cac\u0ccd\u0cac\u0cbf\u0c97\u0cb0 \u0c95\u0cbe\u0cb5 (Poet's Defender), also called ''Sobagina Suggi'' (Harvest of Beauty) or ''Madana-Vijaya and'' ''Kavana-Gella'' (Cupid's Conquest)'','' a ''Champu'' work in pure Kannada using only indigenous (''desya'') Kannada words and the derived form of Sanskrit words \u2013 ''tadbhavas'', without the admixture of Sanskrit words. He succeeded in his challenge and proved wrong those who had advocated that it was impossible to write a work in Kannada without using Sanskrit words. Andayya may be considered as a protector of Kannada poets who were ridiculed by Sanskrit advocates. Thus Kannada is the only Dravidian language which is not only capable of using only native Kannada words and grammar in its literature (like Tamil), but also use Sanskrit grammar and vocabulary (like Telugu, Malayalam, Tulu, etc.) The Champu style of literature of mixing poetry with prose owes its origins to the Kannada language which was later incorporated by poets into Sanskrit and other Indian languages.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqGojPpe8DIC|title=Indian Literature|last=Nagendra|first=Dr.|publisher=Prabhat Prakashan, 1988|year=1988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.489059|quote=andayya pure kannada.|title=History of Kannada Literature: Readership Lectures|last=Narasimhacharya|first=Ramanujapuram|publisher=Asian Educational Services, 1988|isbn=9788120603035|year=1988}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ObFCT5_taSgC&dq=andayya|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature: A-Devo|last=Datta|first=Amaresh|publisher=Sahitya Akademi, 1987|isbn=9788126018031|year=1987}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y2noBgAAQBAJ|title=Gods, Heroes and their Story Tellers: Intangible cultural heritage of South India|last=Hari Saravanan|first=V.|publisher=Notion Press, 2014|isbn=9789384391492|year=2014}}</ref><ref name=\"kannada literature\">Rice, Edward.

Most notable among the modernists was the poet [[Muddana|Nandalike Muddana]] whose writing may be described as the \"Dawn of Modern Kannada\", though generally, linguists treat ''Indira Bai'' or ''Saddharma Vijayavu'' by Gulvadi Venkata Raya as the first literary works in Modern Kannada. The first modern [[movable type]] printing of \"Canarese\" appears to be the ''Canarese Grammar'' of [[William Carey (missionary)|Carey]] printed at [[Serampore]] in 1817, and the \"[[Bible translations into Kannada|Bible in Canarese]]\" of [[John Hands]] in 1820.<ref>Report on the administration of Mysore \u2013 Page 90 Mysore \u2013 1864 \"There is no authentic record of the casting of the first Early Canarese printing.

Contemporary Kannada literature has been highly successful in reaching people of all classes in society.

The Kannada script is almost perfectly phonetic, but for the sound of a \"half n\" (which becomes a half m). The number of written symbols, however, is far more than the forty-nine characters in the alphabet, because different characters can be combined to form ''compound'' characters ''(ottakshara)''.

It is inflected for gender, number and tense, among other things. The most authoritative known book on old Kannada grammar is ''[[Shabdhamanidarpana]]'' by [[Keshiraja]]. The first available Kannada book, a treatise on poetics, rhetoric and basic grammar is the ''[[Kavirajamarga]]'' from 850 C.E.\n\nThe most influential account of Kannada grammar is [[Keshiraja]]'s ''[[Shabdamanidarpana]]'' (c. AD 1260).<ref name=\"GS Gai\">''Studies in Indian History, Epigraphy, and Culture'' \u2013 By Govind Swamirao Gai, pp. 315</ref><ref name=\"F.

In the battle, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Marine Raiders|Raiders]] from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment\u2014supported by two [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] infantry battalions (the 3rd Battalion, [[145th Infantry Regiment (United States)|145th Infantry Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion, [[148th Infantry Regiment (United States)|148th Infantry Regiment]])\u2014under the command of Colonel [[Harry B. Liversedge]],<ref>Miller pp. 127\u2013129</ref> attacked a Japanese garrison guarding the port of [[Bairoko Harbor|Bairoko]] on the Dragons Peninsula on [[New Georgia]]. The battle took place in the wake of the US landing at Rice Anchorage on the northern coast of New Georgia Island on 5 July, and their subsequent [[Battle of Enogai|capture of  Enogai]] on 10\u201311 July.<ref>Miller pp. 99\u2013103</ref> \n\nThe Marine raiders had begun consolidating their position around Enogai from 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops had occupied blocking position to the south along the Munda\u2013Bairoko trail, to prevent reinforcements being sent south towards Munda, where US troops had begun an [[Drive on Munda Point|advance on Munda Point]], where the Japanese had established an airfield. The blocking position was abandoned on order and the US soldiers returned to Triri on 17 July.<ref>Shaw & Kane pp. 131\u2013133</ref> Liversedge's force had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and he subsequently made plans to capture Bairoko village, which lay on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.<ref>Morison p. 202</ref> The plan entailed a [[pincer movement]]: while the US Army detachment attacked the the village from the southeast the Marines were to assault from the northeast.<ref name=ShawKane134-135>Shaw & Kane pp. 134\u2013135</ref> \n\nThe Japanese defensive positions around Bairoko were formidable and the garrison had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage;<ref name=ShawKane134-135/> as a result,  the day-long assault by the Americans was unsuccessful.<ref>Miller pp. 129\u2013131</ref> Neither attacking force made any progress, and as US casualties began to mount Liversedge decided to withdraw. Just before dawn on 22 July, air strikes were requested to cover the withdrawal. Air support from land-based aircraft had been quite poor earlier in the campaign, but the support provided at this time amounted to the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign to that point.<ref>Horton pp. 105\u2013108</ref>\n\nAfter calling-off the assault, the Americans withdrew to nearby Enogai. The American forces remained in the Enogai area until the end of the New Georgia Campaign. The Japanese used Bairoko to resupply and reinforce their troops who were guarding an airfield at Munda Point, southwest of Bairoko on the western coast of New Georgia.{{Cn|date=April 2020}} In early August, Liversedge began another effort to capture Bairoko; reinforcements from the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] also arrived and began to advance on Bairoko from the south, after the U.S. and its allies successfully [[Battle of Munda Point|captured]] the airfield on 4/5 August.

In the battle, [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] [[Marine Raiders|Raiders]] from the 1st Marine Raider Regiment\u2014supported by two [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] infantry battalions (the 3rd Battalion, [[145th Infantry Regiment (United States)|145th Infantry Regiment]] and the 3rd Battalion, [[148th Infantry Regiment (United States)|148th Infantry Regiment]])\u2014under the command of Colonel [[Harry B. Liversedge]],<ref>Miller pp. 127\u2013129</ref> attacked a Japanese garrison guarding the port of [[Bairoko Harbor|Bairoko]] on the Dragons Peninsula on [[New Georgia]]. The battle took place in the wake of the US landing at Rice Anchorage on the northern coast of New Georgia Island on 5 July, and their subsequent [[Battle of Enogai|capture of  Enogai]] on 10\u201311 July.<ref>Miller pp. 99\u2013103</ref> \n\nThe Marine raiders had begun consolidating their position around Enogai from 12 July and began patrolling the local area while US Army troops had occupied blocking position to the south along the Munda\u2013Bairoko trail, to prevent reinforcements being sent south towards Munda, where US troops had begun an [[Drive on Munda Point|advance on Munda Point]], where the Japanese had established an airfield. The blocking position was abandoned on order and the US soldiers returned to Triri on 17 July.<ref>Shaw & Kane pp. 131\u2013133</ref> Liversedge's force had been reinforced by 700 Marines from the 4th Raider Battalion and he subsequently made plans to capture Bairoko village, which lay on the eastern side of Bairoko Harbor, on 20 July.<ref>Morison p. 202</ref> The plan entailed a [[pincer movement]]: while the US Army detachment attacked the the village from the southeast the Marines were to assault from the northeast.<ref name=ShawKane134-135>Shaw & Kane pp. 134\u2013135</ref> \n\nThe Japanese defensive positions around Bairoko were formidable and the garrison had been reinforced since the initial US landing at the Rice Anchorage;<ref name=ShawKane134-135/> as a result,  the day-long assault by the Americans was unsuccessful.<ref>Miller pp. 129\u2013131</ref> Neither attacking force made any progress, and as US casualties began to mount Liversedge decided to withdraw. Just before dawn on 22 July, air strikes were requested to cover the withdrawal. Air support from land-based aircraft had been quite poor earlier in the campaign, but the support provided at this time amounted to the heaviest aerial bombardment of the campaign to that point.<ref>Horton pp. 105\u2013108</ref>\n\nAfter calling-off the assault, the Americans withdrew to nearby Enogai. The American forces remained in the Enogai area until the end of the New Georgia Campaign. The Japanese used Bairoko to resupply and reinforce their troops who were guarding an airfield at Munda Point, southwest of Bairoko on the western coast of New Georgia.{{Cn|date=April 2020}} In early August, Liversedge began another effort to capture Bairoko; reinforcements from the [[25th Infantry Division (United States)|25th Infantry Division]] also arrived and began to advance on Bairoko from the south, after the U.S. and its allies successfully [[Battle of Munda Point|captured]] the airfield on 4/5 August.
