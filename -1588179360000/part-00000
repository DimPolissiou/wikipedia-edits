Chinampas were used primarily in Lakes [[Lake Xochimilco|Xochimilco]] and [[Lake Chalco|Chalco]] near the [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] that lined the south shore of those lakes. The [[Aztec]]s not only conducted military campaigns to obtain control over these regions but, according to some researchers, undertook significant state-led efforts to increase their extent.<ref>Since many of the chinampas regions show a uniformity of size and orientation, researchers such as Townsend assume they were constructed by \"a planned program . . . over a short time\". (p 167)</ref> There is some strong evidence to suggest state-led operations for the \u201cexpansion\u201d of the chinampas. This is sometimes referred to as the hydraulic hypothesis, which is directly related to a [[hydraulic empire|hydraulic]] empire, which is an empire that maintains power and control through the regulation and distribution of water. There is evidence to support the idea of state involvement, primarily the amount of manpower and materials it would take to build, turn, and maintain the chinampas. However, arguments about state control of the chinampas rely upon the assumption that dikes were necessary to control the water levels and to keep the [[saline water]] of [[Lake Texcoco]] away from the freshwater of the chinampa zone. This is plausible, but there is evidence that the chinampas were functional before the construction of a dike that protected them from the saline water. It is suggested that the dike was meant to drastically improve the size of the chinampa operation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Jeffrey L. |title=The State and Wetland Agriculture in Mesoamerica |journal=Culture & Agriculture |date=June 1998 |volume=20 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=78\u201386 |doi=10.1525/cag.1998.20.2-3.78}}</ref>\n\nChinampa farms also ringed [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]], the Aztec capital, which was considerably enlarged over time.

With the destruction of the dams and [[sluice gate]]s during the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]], many chinampas fields were abandoned.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} However, many lakeshore towns retained their chinampas through the end of the colonial era since cultivation was highly labor-intensive and less attractive for Spaniards to acquire.<ref>Charles Gibson, ''The Aztecs Under Spanish Rule''.

Issues arose when the cities' constant expansion eventually caused them to run out of room to build. As the empire grew, more sources of food were required. At times this meant conquering more land; at other times it meant expanding the chinampa system. With this expansion, chinampas' multiple crops per year became a large factor in the production and supply of food. Empirical records suggest that farmers had a relatively light tribute to pay compared to others because the annual tribute may have been only a fraction of the amount necessary for local needs.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morehart |first1=Christopher |title=The Potentiality and the Consequences of Surplus: Agricultural Production and Institutional Transformation in the Northern Basin of Mexico |journal=Economic Anthropology |volume=1 |issue=1 |doi=10.1002/sea2.12010 |doi-broken-date=2020-01-22|url=https://anthrosource.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/sea2.12010|url-access=subscription}}</ref>\n\nThe extent to which Tenochtitlan depended on chinampas for its fresh food supply has been the topic of a number of scholarly studies.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Calnek |first1=Edward E. |title=Settlement Pattern and Chinampa Agriculture at Tenochtitlan |journal=American Antiquity |date=1972 |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=104\u2013115 |doi=10.2307/278892 |jstor=278892}}</ref><ref>Edward E.

Chinampas were used primarily in Lakes [[Lake Xochimilco|Xochimilco]] and [[Lake Chalco|Chalco]] near the [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] that lined the south shore of those lakes. The [[Aztec]]s not only conducted military campaigns to obtain control over these regions but, according to some researchers, undertook significant state-led efforts to increase their extent.<ref>Since many of the chinampas regions show a uniformity of size and orientation, researchers such as Townsend assume they were constructed by \"a planned program . . . over a short time\". (p 167)</ref> There is some strong evidence to suggest state-led operations for the \u201cexpansion\u201d of the chinampas. This is sometimes referred to as the hydraulic hypothesis, which is directly related to a [[hydraulic empire|hydraulic]] empire, which is an empire that maintains power and control through the regulation and distribution of water. There is evidence to support the idea of state involvement, primarily the amount of manpower and materials it would take to build, turn, and maintain the chinampas. However, arguments about state control of the chinampas rely upon the assumption that dikes were necessary to control the water levels and to keep the [[saline water]] of [[Lake Texcoco]] away from the freshwater of the chinampa zone. This is plausible, but there is evidence that the chinampas were functional before the construction of a dike that protected them from the saline water. It is suggested that the dike was meant to drastically improve the size of the chinampa operation.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Jeffrey L. |title=The State and Wetland Agriculture in Mesoamerica |journal=Culture & Agriculture |date=June 1998 |volume=20 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=78\u201386 |doi=10.1525/cag.1998.20.2-3.78}}</ref>\n\nChinampa farms also ringed [[Tenochtitl\u00e1n]], the Aztec capital, which was considerably enlarged over time.

Issues arose when the cities' constant expansion eventually caused them to run out of room to build. As the empire grew, more sources of food were required. At times this meant conquering more land; at other times it meant expanding the chinampa system. With this expansion, chinampas' multiple crops per year became a large factor in the production and supply of food.

His mother was Nasiba bint Uqba ibn Uddi.\n\n===Muhammad's era===\nJabir ibn Abdullah Ansari is said to have accepted Islam when he was about 7. Also, he is recognised as the Sahaba with the most count of hadith relating to Hajj.\n\nHis participation in the [[Battle of Badr]] is questioned by some historians; he is known to have fought in 19 battles (including Badr) under command of Muhammad and was a trusted Sahabi. He was present during the conquest of Mecca.\n\n====Battle of Uhud====\nIn the [[Battle of Uhud]], Jabir ibn Abdullah was not allowed by his father Abdullah to take part in [[Jihad]]. Jabir had seven sisters (some historians say nine) and Abdullah wanted him to take care of his family. So instead of fighting, Jabir served the thirsty soldiers. Jabir's father, Abdullah bin Amru bin Haram al-Ansari was killed in the [[Battle of Uhud]] <ref>[[Sahih Bukhari]] [http://www.sacred-texts.com/isl/bukhari/bh4/bh4_39.htm 4:40]</ref> along with his brother-in-law, Amro bin Jamooh, both having reached nearly 100 years of age.\n\n===Ali ibn Abu Talib era===\nHe fought in all the three major civil wars under Imam Ali: [[Battle of Jamal]], [[battle of Siffin|Battle of Sifeen]] and [[Battle of Nahrawan]].\n\n===Ali ibn Husayn's (ibn Ali) era (Shia doctrine)===\nJabir had a long life and became blind in his old age. According to the Shias, he devoutly waited for the time when he would meet the fifth Imam. Each morning he would come out from his house, sit by the roadside and wait for the sound of the footsteps to recognize the fifth Imam. One such day while he was waiting in the street of [[Medina]], he heard someone walking towards him, the sound of footsteps reminded him of the way Muhammad used to walk. Jabir stood up, stopped the man, and asked his name. He replied, \u201cMuhammad\u201d, Jabir asked, \u201cwhose son\u201d? He replied \u201c[[Ali ibn Husayn|Ali ibn Hussain]]\u201d. Jabir immediately recognized the man he was talking to was the 5th Imam. He kissed his hands and conveyed the message of Muhammad.\n\n===Abd al-Malik's era and Jabir\u2019s death===\nIt was during this era that he retold the [[Hadith of Umar's speech of forbidding Mut'ah]]. Jabir had a long life.
