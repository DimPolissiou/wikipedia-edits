The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]].

A number of [[tribal]] grouping have landed in the soils of Assam in the course of diverse directions as the territory was linked to a number of states and many different countries. [[Austroasiatic languages|Austro-Asiatic]], [[Tibeto-Burman]]s, and [[Indo-Aryans]] had been the most important traditional groups that arrived at the site and lived in the very old Assam. They were well thought-out as the \u2018aborigines\u2019 of Assam and yet at the moment they are essential elements of the \"Assamese Diaspora\".\n\nThe greater [[Bodo-Kachari|Kachari]] group encompasses the 18 major tribes of Assam, both plain and hills, viz., [[Bodo people|Boro]], [[Dimasa people|Dimasa]], [[Chutia people|Chutia]], [[Sonowal Kacharis|Sonowal]], [[Tiwa (Lalung)|Tiwa]], [[Garo people|Garo]], [[Rabha]], [[Sarania Kachari]], [[Hajong people|Hajong]], [[Tripuri people|Tripuri]], [[Deori people|Deori]], [[Thengal Kachari]], Hojai, [[Koch people|Koch]], and others. The ancient land of '[[Kirati people|Kirat]]' is also referred to the land of the Kachari. [[Bodo-Kachari people|Kacharis]] were historically the dominant group of Assam, later the [[Ahom people|Tai Ahoms]] rise as dominant group, the ethnic group who along with the Upper Assam Bodo-Kachari groups like Chutias, Morans and Borahis were associated with the term \"Assamese\". Along with Tai Ahoms, they were other prominent groups that ruled [[Assam valley]] during the medieval period, those belonging to the Chutia, Koch, and Dimasa communities. The first group ruled from 1187 to 1673 in the eastern part of the state, the second group ruled Lower Assam from 1515 to 1949, while the third group ruled southern part of Assam from the 13th century to 1854. [[Bodo people|Bodo tribe]] also known as ''Boro'' are the dominant group in [[BTAD]]. They speak the [[Bodo language]] among themselves along with using [[Assamese language|Assamese]] to communicate with other [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] as the [[lingua-franca]]. \n\nMost of the indigenous Assamese communities today have actually been historically tribal and even the now considered non-tribal population of Assam were actually tribes which have slowly been converted into castes through [[Sanskritisation]]. Assam has always been a historically tribal state.<ref>{{Harvcol|Baruah|Sanskritisation and Detribalisation in early Assam|2008|pp=116}}</ref>\n\nAhoms along with [[Chutia people|Chutia]], Moran, Motok, and Koch are still regarded as semi-tribal groups who have nominally converted to Ekasarana Dharma even though keeping alive their own tribal traditions and customs. Various [[Assamese people|indigenous Assamese communities]] in Assam like Chutiya, [[Rajbongshi people|Koch-Rajbongshi]], Moran, Motok, Ahoms etc (all having tribal origin) have slowly been converted into a caste through [[Sanskritisation]].\n\nAs per latest development indigenous ethnicities like ''Moran'', ''Chutia'', ''Motok'', ''Tai Ahoms'' and ''Koch'' & also non-indigenous<ref>https://www.academia.edu/25822076/Tea_Tribes_of_Assam_Colonial_Exploitation_and_Assertion_of_Adivasi_Rights</ref> ethnic group like the ''Tea tribes'' have realised the above-mentioned points and have applied for ST status .<ref>{{cite news|title=6 Assam tribes may soon get Scheduled Tribes status|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/6-Assam-tribes-may-soon-get-Scheduled-Tribes-status/articleshow/47335391.cms?from=mdr|accessdate=31 August 2017|work=The Times of India}}</ref> This will make Assam a predominantly tribal state having wider geo-political ramifications.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Assamese people]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |display-authors=1 |last1=Arunkumar |first1=Ganesh Prasad |last2=Wei |first2=Lan-Hai |year=2015 |title=A late Neolithic expansion of Y chromosomal haplogroup O2a1\u2010M95 from east to west |url= |journal=Journal of Systematics and Evolution |volume=53 |issue=6 |pages=546-560 |doi=10.1111/jse.12147}}\n*{{cite journal |ref=harv |last1=Boruah |first1=Nirode |title=Sanskritization and Detribalization in Early Assam: Some Geographical Aspects |journal=Proceedings of the Indian History Congress |volume=69 |year=2008 |pages=167-179 |jstor=44147178}}\n* Bhagawati, A C (2002) \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20110930212234/http://ignca.gov.in/nl002003.htm Ethnic Identities in North-East India]\", N K Bose Memorial Lectures.

[[Education City]], a large campus where U.S. and European universities reside, hosted a series of religious prayers and lectures as part of a month-long annual Ramadan program in 2015. The prayers and lectures were held at [[Education City]]'s new lavish mosque in Doha. [[Education City]] also affords campus space to other American universities such as [[Texas A&M University|Texas A&M]] and [[Carnegie Mellon University|Carnegie Mellon]].\n\nAmong those who have attended [[Education City]] lectures is a Saudi preacher who described the ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' massacre in Paris as \"the sequel to the comedy film of 9/11\", and another cleric who wrote, \"Jews and their helpers must be destroyed.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/06/24/qatar-s-foundation-for-hypocrisy.html|title=Qatar's Foundation for Hypocrisy|last=Dettmer|first=Jamie|date=24 June 2015|newspaper=The Daily Beast|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> The mosque in [[Education City]] has hosted extremist Anti-Semitic Wahhabi preachers speaking against \"Zionist aggressors\" in their sermons, and calling upon Allah \"to count them in number and kill them completely, do not spare a [single] one of them.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Qatar has reportedly sent Jewish professors back to America,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510701773-houston-community-college-scales-back-operation-in-qatar|title=Houston Community College scales back operation in Qatar|last=Nakano|first=Hanna|website=gulfnewsjournal.com|access-date=27 April 2016}}</ref> and students attending American universities in Qatar are reportedly required to dress in a manner respectful to Wahhabism.<ref>{{cite news|title=While U.S. universities see dollar signs in Qatari partnerships, some cry foul|url=http://gulfnewsjournal.com/stories/510639673-while-u-s-universities-see-dollar-signs-in-qatari-partnerships-some-cry-foul|accessdate=27 April 2016|work=Gulf News Journal|date=24 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===European expansion===\nThere has been much concern, expressed in both American and European media and scholarship, over the fact that Wahhabi countries like Saudi Arabia and Qatar have been financing mosques and buying up land all over Europe.

In 2016, the citizens of Brussels, Belgium overturned a 2015 decision to build a 600-person mosque next to the Qatari embassy. Fear largely emanates from the fact that Belgian citizens see the mosque as an opportunity for a Wahhabi country to exert control over Muslims in Europe, thus spreading the more extreme sect of Islam.<ref name=\"petrodollar\" />\n \nSeveral articles have been written that list the [[Cork Islamic Cultural Center]] as an example of one of many properties throughout Europe, paid for by the Qatari government, in an effort to spread an extreme and intolerant form of Islam known as Wahhabism.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}\n\nThe [[Assalam Mosque]] is located in Nantes, France was also a source on some controversy. Construction on the mosque began in 2009 and was completed in 2012. It is the largest mosque in its region in France.

These activists expressed fear that the Qatari government aimed to build Mosques all over Europe to spread Wahhabism. But the government quashed the lawsuit.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and traveled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Toyin Falola and Matthew M.

The restoration of democracy and subsequent economic reforms have successfully put Nigeria back on track towards achieving its full economic potential. {{As of|2014}} it is the largest economy in Africa, having overtaken South Africa.\n\nDuring the [[OPEC|oil boom]] of the 1970s, Nigeria accumulated a significant foreign debt to finance major infrastructural investments. With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30&nbsp;billion) owed to the Paris Club.\n\nNigeria is trying to reach the first of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which is to [[Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere|end poverty]] in all its forms by 2030.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Further|Agriculture in Nigeria}}\n[[File:Farm Ploughing, Kwara State, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|Farm ploughing in [[Kwara State]]]]\n{{As of|2010}}, about 30% of Nigerians are employed in agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/download/41 |title=Labour Force Statistics, 2010 |publisher=Nigerian Bureau of Statistics |date=2010 |accessdate=22 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153316/http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/download/41 |archivedate=24 April 2015}}</ref> Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy and Development in Africa |first=Claude |last=Ake |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8157-0220-7 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bs5rTH7GClgC&pg=PA48 |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor crops include [[beans]], [[sesame]], [[cashew nuts]], [[cassava]], [[cocoa beans]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[gum arabic]],  kolanut, [[maize]] (corn), [[melon]], [[millet]], [[palm kernel]]s, [[palm oil]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[rice]], [[rubber]], [[sorghum]], [[soybeans]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]].<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Nigeria-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Agriculture \u2013 Nigeria \u2013 export, growth, area, crops, farming, sector|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] is the leading non-oil foreign exchange earner.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> [[Rubber]] is the second-largest non-oil foreign exchange earner.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/>\n\nPrior to the [[Nigerian civil war]], Nigeria was self-sufficient in food.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, and Nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> The Nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s.<ref name=\"pasquini\">{{cite journal|last=Pasquini|first=MW|last2=Alexander|first2=MJ|date=2005|title=Soil fertility management strategies on the Jos Plateau: the need for integrating 'empirical' and 'scientific' knowledge in agricultural development|journal=Geographical Journal|volume=171|issue=2|pages=112\u2013124|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00154.x}}</ref> In August 2019, Nigeria closed its border with Benin to stop rice smuggling into the country as part of efforts to boost the local production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN1VJ0PH-OZATP|title=Nigeria closes part of border with Benin to check rice smuggling|date=29 August 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=29 August 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n\n=== Plant Ecology ===\nNigeria is greatly endowed with numerous tree species of which the majority of them are native while few are exotic.

The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]].

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] being the most widely professed religions.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]].

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese [[DFH-4]] [[satellite bus]], and carries a variety of [[transponder]]s: 4 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]]; 14 [[Ku-band]]; 8 [[Ka-band]]; and 2 [[L-band]]. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.\n\nOn 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]] being the most widely professed religions.

{"title_page": "Local quantum field theory", "text_new": "The '''Haag\u2013Kastler [[axiomatic framework]]''' for [[quantum field theory]], introduced by {{harvs|txt|last=Haag|authorlink=Rudolf Haag|last2=Kastler|author2-link=Daniel Kastler|year=1964}}, is an application to '''local quantum physics''' of [[C*-algebra]] theory. Because of this it is also known as '''algebraic quantum field theory''' ('''AQFT'''). The axioms are stated in terms of an algebra given for every open set in [[Minkowski space]], and mappings between those.\n\n==Overview<!--'Isotony' redirects here-->==\nLet '''Mink''' be the [[category theory|category]] of [[open subset]]s of Minkowski space M with [[inclusion map]]s as [[morphism]]s. We are given a [[covariant functor]] <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> from '''Mink''' to '''uC*alg''', the category of [[unital algebra|unital]] C* algebras, such that every morphism in '''Mink''' maps to a [[monomorphism]] in '''uC*alg''' ('''isotony'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->).\n\nThe [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] acts [[continuity (topology)|continuously]] on '''Mink'''. There exists a [[pullback]] of this [[Group action (mathematics)|action]], which is continuous in the [[norm topology]] of <math>\\mathcal{A}(M)</math> ([[Poincar\u00e9 covariance]]).\n\nMinkowski space has a [[causal structure]]. If an [[open set]] ''V'' lies in the [[causal complement]] of an open set ''U'', then the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the maps\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{A}(i_{U,U\\cup V})</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{A}(i_{V,U\\cup V})</math>\n\n[[Commutative operation|commute]] (spacelike commutativity). If <math>\\bar{U}</math> is the [[causal completion]] of an open set ''U'', then <math>\\mathcal{A}(i_{U,\\bar{U}})</math> is an [[isomorphism]] (primitive causality).\n\nA [[state (functional analysis)|state]] with respect to a C*-algebra is a [[positive linear functional]] over it with unit [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]. If we have a state over <math>\\mathcal{A}(M)</math>, we can take the \"[[partial trace]]\" to get states associated with <math>\\mathcal{A}(U)</math> for each open set via the [[net (mathematics)|net]] [[monomorphism]]. The states over the open sets form a [[presheaf]] structure.\n\nAccording to the [[GNS construction]], for each state, we can associate a [[Hilbert space]] [[group representation|representation]] of <math>\\mathcal{A}(M).</math> [[Pure state]]s correspond to [[irreducible representation]]s and [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]s correspond to [[reducible representation]]s. Each irreducible representation (up to [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]]) is called a [[superselection sector]]. We assume there is a pure state called the [[vacuum]] such that the Hilbert space associated with it is a [[unitary representation]] of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] compatible with the Poincar\u00e9 covariance of the net such that if we look at the [[Poincar\u00e9 algebra]], the spectrum with respect to [[energy-momentum 4-vector|energy-momentum]] (corresponding to [[Poincare group|spacetime translation]]s) lies on and in the positive [[light cone]].

Because of this it is also known as '''algebraic quantum field theory''' ('''AQFT'''). The axioms are stated in terms of an algebra given for every open set in [[Minkowski space]], and mappings between those.\n\n==Overview<!--'Isotony' redirects here-->==\nLet '''Mink''' be the [[category theory|category]] of [[open subset]]s of Minkowski space M with [[inclusion map]]s as [[morphism]]s. We are given a [[covariant functor]] <math>\\mathcal{A}</math> from '''Mink''' to '''uC*alg''', the category of [[unital algebra|unital]] C* algebras, such that every morphism in '''Mink''' maps to a [[monomorphism]] in '''uC*alg''' ('''isotony'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->).\n\nThe [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] acts [[continuity (topology)|continuously]] on '''Mink'''. There exists a [[pullback]] of this [[Group action (mathematics)|action]], which is continuous in the [[norm topology]] of <math>\\mathcal{A}(M)</math> ([[Poincar\u00e9 covariance]]).\n\nMinkowski space has a [[causal structure]]. If an [[open set]] ''V'' lies in the [[causal complement]] of an open set ''U'', then the [[Image (mathematics)|image]] of the maps\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{A}(i_{U,U\\cup V})</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\mathcal{A}(i_{V,U\\cup V})</math>\n\n[[Commutative operation|commute]] (spacelike commutativity). If <math>\\bar{U}</math> is the [[causal completion]] of an open set ''U'', then <math>\\mathcal{A}(i_{U,\\bar{U}})</math> is an [[isomorphism]] (primitive causality).\n\nA [[state (functional analysis)|state]] with respect to a C*-algebra is a [[positive linear functional]] over it with unit [[norm (mathematics)|norm]]. If we have a state over <math>\\mathcal{A}(M)</math>, we can take the \"[[partial trace]]\" to get states associated with <math>\\mathcal{A}(U)</math> for each open set via the [[net (mathematics)|net]] [[monomorphism]]. The states over the open sets form a [[presheaf]] structure.\n\nAccording to the [[GNS construction]], for each state, we can associate a [[Hilbert space]] [[group representation|representation]] of <math>\\mathcal{A}(M).</math> [[Pure state]]s correspond to [[irreducible representation]]s and [[Mixed state (physics)|mixed state]]s correspond to [[reducible representation]]s. Each irreducible (up to [[Equivalence relation|equivalence]]) is called a [[superselection sector]]. We assume there is a pure state called the [[vacuum]] such that the Hilbert space associated with it is a [[unitary representation]] of the [[Poincar\u00e9 group]] compatible with the Poincar\u00e9 covariance of the net such that if we look at the [[Poincar\u00e9 algebra]], the spectrum with respect to [[energy-momentum 4-vector|energy-momentum]] (corresponding to [[Poincare group|spacetime translation]]s) lies on and in the positive [[light cone]]. This is the vacuum sector.\n\nMore recently, the approach has been further implemented to include an algebraic version of [[quantum field theory in curved spacetime]].

His classmate Seo Min-hee is one of the workers, though she does not know who \"Uncle\" is. One weekend, Ji-soo has a study project to do with Bae Gyu-ri, a girl he has a crush on, and thus tells Mr. Lee to take the day off. Knowing that she won't be protected, Min-hee still accepts the offer of a client unaware that he had previously assaulted one of the sex workers and that she is walking into a trap. She sends the alert and Ji-soo eventually leaves Gyu-ri to save her, calling the police but giving the wrong motel room only to scare the client. The latter takes a picture of Min-hee before leaving and intents to upload it on the high school's website at a [[PC bang]] before he is stopped by Mr. Lee. In a bus, it is revealed that Gyu-ri is the one who stole the expensive phone case that Min-hee had bought for her boyfriend as she receives a message from a potential buyer and tries to resell it at a higher price.

Ji-soo's father wants to take him to [[Ulsan]] where he now lives but his son sees that he is only doing so because he needs money. Afraid of leaving his home because the blackmailer threatened to expose him, Ji-soo is visited by Gyu-ri who finds a way to make him leave the apartment and searches for the money.

{"title_page": "Crossover (fiction)", "text_new": "{{short description|Placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date = March 2008}}\n{{Globalize|article|North America|date=December 2010}}\n{{example farm|date = August 2013}}\n}}\nA '''crossover''' is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete [[fiction]]al [[fictional character|characters]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s, or [[fictional universe|universes]] into the context of a single [[Narrative|story]]. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant [[copyright]] holders, unauthorized efforts by [[fandom|fan]]s or common corporate ownership.\n\n==Official crossovers==\nCrossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the [[intellectual property]] rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.\n\nCrossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the [[public domain]] with those concurrently under [[copyright|copyright protection]].\n\nA crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Empty Nest]]'') or meeting via dimensional rift or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for [[science fiction]] properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]]. Still, others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', where each show is fiction in the other.\n\n===Comics===<!-- This section is linked from [[X-Men (TV series)]] -->\n[[File:SpeedComicsNo32.jpg|thumb|Comic book crossovers may be traced back to the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]], where characters frequently teamed up on the cover (though far more rarely on the inside). ''Speed Comics'' number 32, Artwork by [[Alex Schomburg]].]]\n[[File:MasterComicsNo21.jpg|thumb|An early example of the comics crossover: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman]] join forces to battle [[Captain Nazi]]. ''Master Comics'' number 21, Artwork by [[Mac Rayboy]].]]\nCrossovers of multiple characters, owned by one company or [[publishing|published]] by one [[publisher]], have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of [[comic book publisher]]s, as different characters in various [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics|DC]], or [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] [[comic book]]s frequently interact with one another since they live in a \"[[shared universe]]\". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, [[Spider-Man]] has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], just as in the DC Comics Universe, the [[The Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]] often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these \"guest star\" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a [[team-up]]. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This has led to \"crossover events\", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.\n\nThe earliest such crossover event was [[Gardner Fox]]'s ''Zatanna's Search'', which took place in ''[[Hawkman]]'' #4 (October/November 1964), ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #336 (February 1965), ''[[The Atom]]'' #19 (June/July 1965), ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #42 (January 1966), ''Detective Comics'' #355 (September 1966), and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with [[Zatanna]] attempting to reconnect with her father, [[Zatara]], and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], the Atom, Green Lantern, and [[Elongated Man]] along the way.\n\nThe first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]]. As a way to further toy sales he devised the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' crossover, which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. ''Secret Wars'' was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of [[Spider-Man]]'s black suit which would later become the villain [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]). [[Jim Shooter]] later perfected his crossover technique at [[Valiant Comics]] with the ''[[Unity (comics)|Unity]]'' event. ''Unity'' brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat [[Mothergod]], but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like ''Secret Wars'', the ''Unity'' crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of [[Turok]], the birth of [[Magnus, Robot Fighter]] and the death of a major Valiant hero.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]]'s ''Aliens Versus Predator'' comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an ''Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator'' comic.\n\nThe comic crossovers from [[Raj Comics]] are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between [[Nagraj]] and [[Super Commando Dhruva]]. In ''Kohram'', all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish ''Haru'', an extremely powerful enemy.\n\n[[Webcomics]] creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between [[Christopher Baldwin]]'s ''[[Bruno (webcomic)|Bruno]]'' and Peter Zale's ''[[Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comic Strips Crossover On The Net|last=Menefee|first=Craig|date=March 19, 1998|work=[[New Straits Times]]|quote=lasted two weeks|page=38}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of [[Capcom]] character [[Mega Man]] and [[Sega]] character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] called \"[[Worlds Collide (Archie Comics)|Worlds Collide]]\". Taking place in issues of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Sonic Universe]],'' and ''[[Mega Man (Archie Comics)|Mega Man]]'' comic series from Archie, the crossover involved [[Dr. Eggman]] and [[Dr. Wily]] forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the ''Mega Man'' games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled \"Worlds Unite\", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man, but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the ''[[Mega Man X]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by ''Mega Man X'' villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. \"Worlds Unite\" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the ''Sonic Boom'' comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers.\n\nThere are also [[intercompany crossover]]s, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.\n\n===Animation===\nCartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them \u2013 like comics or live-action TV shows \u2013 will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door''. It features five crossovers \u2013 ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', a reference to ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and a quote from ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]'' and ''[[Generator Rex]]'' team up in ''[[Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United]]''. Similarly, characters from ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'' and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' appeared in a crossover episode \"Say Uncle\". The same occurred with ''[[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' in an episode called \"[[TTG v PPG]]\". ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'' did a crossover episode called \"Crossover Nexus\" to celebrate 25 years of Cartoon Network where the lead character joined forces with Ben 10, Garnet from Steven Universe and Raven from Teen Titans. Most of the last episodes of the ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' (a spinoff of the film ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'') had crossovers with various other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons, including ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', and ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]''. The ''[[Jimmy Timmy Power Hour]]'' trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules]]'', based on the [[Hercules (1997 film)|1997 film of the same name]], had an episode titled \"[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]\" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' in which the [[Rugrats]] are stranded on an island where [[The Wild Thornberrys]] were at the time. In ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' \"Dial M for Monkey\" \"Huntor\" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; \"Huntor\" later makes a cameo crossover in [[Samurai Jack]]'s \"Jack vs Mad Jack.\" \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the [[Hanna-Barbera]] properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', which featured appearances by characters from ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'', ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Batman|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''. Later, the ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'' set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]''. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977\u201379 series ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]],'' which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.\n\nCrossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and [[Warner Bros.]] [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Donald Duck]] made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie).{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The film also includes cameos of characters from [[Metro\u2013Goldwyn\u2013Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]]. The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by [[Porky Pig]] stuttering his famous \"That's All, Folks!\" line as [[Tinker Bell#Disney|Tinker Bell]] ends the scene with a magical fade-out.\n\nOn February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' and ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', had their crossover with the episode \"Shell Shocked\".\n\nOn October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, ''Superman: The Animated Series'' and ''The New Batman Adventures'', had their first crossover with the TV movie ''World's Finest'', which was also released on DVD.\n\nAnother cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''. This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]] aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] (from Disney's ''[[DuckTales]]''), [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tigger]], Slimer (from ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''Extreme Ghostbusters''), Michelangelo (from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], [[The Smurfs]], ALF (from [[ALF: The Animated Series|his short-lived cartoon spinoff]]), [[Garfield]], and the trio of [[Kermit the Frog|Baby Kermit]], [[Miss Piggy|Baby Piggy]], and [[Gonzo the Great|Baby Gonzo]] (from Jim Henson's ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]''). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]], and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.\n\n[[Manga]] artist [[Leiji Matsumoto]] has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the ''[[Maetel Legend]]'', Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from ''Queen Millennia''. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.\n\nThe adult parody-oriented series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]] from ''[[Family Guy]]'', others involve a personality twist, such as the [[murder|homicidal]] version of [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] from [[Bambi|the eponymous film]] or the [[homosexuality|gay]] version of [[Elmer Fudd]] from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' franchise.\n\nThe  Disney/Marvel crossover ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'' features the Marvel heroes [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the Marvel villains [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], [[MODOK]], [[Red Skull]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], and characters from ''Phineas and Ferb'', where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz.\n\nDuring its 26th season, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' has crossovers with ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]''. In the hour-long ''[[Family Guy]]'' season 13 premiere \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", the Griffins meet the Simpson family,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode|title=TV|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref> who meet the Planet Express crew in the ''Simpsons'' episode \"[[Simpsorama]]\".<ref name=ewcc>{{cite web|title='The Simpsons' to join forces with 'Futurama' for crossover episode|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/20/the-simpsons-futurama-crossover-epsidoe/|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Disney]] series ''[[House of Mouse]]'', [[Mickey Mouse]] and friends host a nightclub featuring cameos by other Disney characters.\n\nWebtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from [[TomSka]]'s ''Crash Zoom'' series makes an appearance in ''[[Eddsworld]]'' as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, \"Trick or Threat\". In addition to this a couple of characters from ''Eddsworld'' make appearances in some ''Crash Zoom'' episodes such as \"Orcs and Dorks\". Another example is ''[[Death Battle]]'' which is a show where two hosts (Wiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises. Shows like ''One Minute Melee'', ''Cartoon Fight Club'', and ''Death Battle Exhibitions'' (the spinoff series) have a similar format to ''Death Battle''. \n\nBy Disney, [[Hasbro]] and [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], the crossover served as the films ''[[Dr. Jack|The Nature Vacations of Pok\u00e9mon, Animals, Friendship Ponies and Dinosaurs]]'' and ''[[Manslaughter (1922 film)|The Nature Vacations of Fantastic World of the Adventure]]'', which were called ''The Nature Vacations Movie'', includes [[Griffith (surname)|Jacob Griffith]] the protagonist among with characters of [[My Little Pony]], such as [[Twilight Sparkle]], [[Apple Bloom]], [[Sweetie Belle]], especially all of those several characters around the world.  \n\nThe [[Netflix]] original series ''[[Harvey Girls Forever]]'' is a crossover of the comics [[Little Audrey]], [[Little Dot Dotland]] and [[Little Lotta]], although later episodes in the third and fourth season are crossovers of [[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]] and [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]].\n\n=== Anime and Manga ===\nAnime has also participated in many crossover events featuring characters or shows from the same company or network. One of the biggest projects down would be [[Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!|''Dream 9 Toriko x One Piece x Dragon Ball Z Super Special Collaboration'']] as if includes three [[Shonen Jump (magazine)|''Shonen Jump'']] franchises, being [[Dragon Ball Z]], [[One Piece]], and [[Toriko]], crossed over into an hour long special Like most crossovers, this special is filler, a fan-service episode that follows the common plot line in most crossovers. In the first half of the special, characters from the three franchises meet-up and fight. In the second half, they team up to battle a stronger foe. What makes this crossover unique is when the characters from all three shows split into groups, where the members all share the same cliched character archetypes, such the main characters Goku, Luffy, and Toriko falling into the dumb, good natured, strong character archetype.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-piece-and-dragon-ball-z-collide-in-this-tv-special-471121234|title=One Piece and Dragon Ball Z Collide in this TV Special|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n''[[Carnival Phantasm]]'' is also an OVA comedy series based off of a ''[[Type-Moon]]'' gag manga called Take-Moon. Created to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary, the anime consists of several funny and unusual scenarios involving various characters from the Type-Moon franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.typemoon.com/products/cp/index.html|title=Carnival Phantasm -\u30ab\u30fc\u30cb\u30d0\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ba\u30e0-|website=www.typemoon.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> Some examples include characters from ''[[Fate/stay night]]'' and ''[[Tsukihime]]''.\n\nThe ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise is one of the most popular manga and anime in the world, and has its fair share of crossovers as well. The creator of the franchise, [[Akira Toriyama]], has used another character from a different manga series he created, Jaco from ''Jaco the Galactic Policeman'' as a reoccurring character in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''. He comes to Earth to warn the characters about the return of Frieza and is later seen in the disputes involving Beerus and Champa. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/dragon-ball-z-crossovers/|title=15 Times Dragon Ball Z Crossed Over With Other Series|date=2017-03-08|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Cyborg 009 VS Devilman]] is a three part anime OVA that crosses over the ''[[Cyborg 009]]'' and [[Devilman]] series.

The fourth installments, [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Super Smash Bros. for Wii U'']], feature characters from the third-party franchises of Capcom's ''[[Mega Man]]'' ([[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]]) and ''[[Street Fighter]]'' ([[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]), Sega's ''[[Bayonetta]]'' ([[Bayonetta (character)|Bayonetta]]), Bandai Namco's ''[[PAC-MAN|Pac-Man]]'' ([[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]), and Square Enix's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' ([[Cloud Strife]]), in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes.

Ultimate]]'' also introduced [[Simon Belmont|Simon]] and [[Richter Belmont]] from Konami's ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, [[Ken Masters]] from Capcom's ''Street Fighter'' series, [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] from ''[[Persona 5]]'', the Hero from the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, Banjo-Kazooie from the ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' series and [[Terry Bogard]] from the ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' series in addition to bringing back all of the playable characters from the previous entries in the series.\n* The [[Namco]]-developed ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series features characters from a variety of other franchises including [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, [[Heihachi Mishima]] from ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]'', [[Todd McFarlane]]'s [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], [[Darth Vader]], [[Yoda]], and [[Starkiller]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Lloyd Irving]] from ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]'', [[Ubisoft Montreal]]'s Ezio Auditore from the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, [[Geralt of Rivia]] from [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s ''[[The Witcher]]'', and YoRHa No. 2 Type B from [[PlatinumGames]]' ''[[Nier: Automata]]''.\n* ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', released in Japan two months before ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', was the first time that [[Mario]] and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.\n* The ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of role-playing games developed by [[Square Enix]] features a number of characters from [[Disney]] films, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', and ''[[The World Ends With You]]''.\n* Starting with ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', video game developer [[NetherRealm Studios]] has guest characters ranging from ''Mortal Kombat'' veterans [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] and [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] to [[Freddy Krueger]] from ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', [[Jason Voorhees]] from ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', [[Xenomorph (Alien franchise)|The Xenomorph]] from ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', [[Predator (fictional species)|The Predator]] from ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'', the [[T-800]] from ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'', [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'', [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] from ''[[Batman]]'', all four [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], [[Todd McFarlane]]'s [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]] and [[Mike Mignola]]'s [[Hellboy (comics)|Hellboy]].\n* ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese [[mecha]] series from many generations, such as ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', and ''[[GaoGaiGar]]''.\n* More recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco, which results in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'' and the upcoming ''[[Tekken X Street Fighter]]''.\n* ''[[Warriors Orochi]]'' is the game that crossover that features the casts of both the ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' and ''[[Samurai Warriors]]'' series. The [[Warriors Orochi 3|third installment]] of this series included a number of playable characters from other [[Koei Tecmo]] properties, such as ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Zill O'll]]'', and [[Sophitia|Sophitia Alexandra]] from Bandai Namco's ''Soul'' series. ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]'' similarly crossed-over a number of characters from Koei Tecmo series.\n* ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' is a [[multiplayer online battle arena]] video game developed and published by [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. The game brings various [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] characters together as playable heroes, as well as different battlegrounds based on ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', ''[[StarCraft]]'', and ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' universes.\n* Perhaps one of the most notable video game crossovers is ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', which makes use of over 30 different franchises, including DC Comics, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', and more.\n* The Disney film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' and [[Ralph Breaks the Internet|its sequel]] features many video game character [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\n===Film===\nThe first film crossover in a series of [[Universal Studios]] monster films was ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', in 1943. In 2003, ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' was released by [[New Line Cinema]]. In 2004, [[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' along with the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007. One year later, both [[Dollman vs. Demonic Toys]] and ''[[Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys]]'' were released by [[20th Century Fox]] and Terry Kelley Studios. In 2015, [[Sony]] released ''[[Lake Placid vs. Anaconda]]''.\n\nAfter the comics publishing house [[Marvel Comics]] ventured into [[Marvel Studios#Production|movie production]], they set off to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012). The same process was repeated for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Inspired by Marvel's success, [[Warner Bros.]], who hold movie rights for [[DC Comics]]' heroes, announced the production of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic [[DC Extended Universe]], while [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Hasbro Studios|Allspark Pictures]] announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the [[Transformers]] film series.\n[[File:KK v G trailer (1962).png|thumb|Battle sequence in ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' showing the title characters fighting each other.]]\nThere have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of [[kaiju]] films saw a lot of crossovers produced at [[Toho Studios]], with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. [[Godzilla]], [[Mothra]] and [[Rodan]] (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' and a few months later of all three in ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]''. In 1962 [[Toho Studios|Toho]] released ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''. The long running [[Zatoichi]] series sees [[Shintaro Katsu]]'s blind master swordsman face off with [[Toshiro Mifune]] in his iconic role in ''[[Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo]]'' (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project ''[[Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1971). This coproduction sees [[Jimmy Wang (actor)|Jimmy Wang]] reprise his famous part of the ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'' while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.\n\n===Literature===\nIn [[literature]], some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. [[Kim Newman]] frequently uses this device, as does [[Stephen King]]. The works of [[James Branch Cabell]], [[J.D. Salinger]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Margaret Laurence]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Isaac Asimov]] also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author [[Rick Riordan]] publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 [[Mark Twain]] novel, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', which had an important guest appearance by [[Tom Sawyer]]. Similarly, Lady Glencora Palliser from the Pallisers series of Anthony Trollope appears towards the end of Miss Mackenzie, a novel published between the first and second Palliser novels in 1865, a character first introduced in the novel, ''[[Can You Forgive Her?]]'' (1864). \n\nScience Fiction writer [[Poul Anderson]] allowed fellow writer [[A. Bertram Chandler]] to \"borrow\" Anderson's space-faring character [[Dominic Flandry]] and let Flandry meet with Chandler's [[A. Bertram Chandler#Writings| John Grimes]] in a common adventure (the two fail to like each other). [[Alex Scarrow]] featured the characters Cato and Macro from his brother [[Simon Scarrow|Simon]]'s ''[[Eagles of the Empire]]'' series in one book of the ''[[TimeRiders]]'' series: ''Gates of Rome'' (2012), serving as supporting characters when the three protagonists [[Time travel in fiction|travel back in time]] to [[Ancient Rome]].\n\nBrazilian writer [[Monteiro Lobato]] also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the [[Cuca (folklore)|Cuca]] and [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], from [[Greek mythology]], from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', from fairy tales such as Grimm's \"[[Snow White]]\", Western literature such as [[Peter Pan]], cartoons such as ''[[Popeye]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'', and Western films.\n\n===Public domain===\nIt is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family]] sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Tarzan]]). [[Roger Zelazny]]'s novel ''[[A Night in the Lonesome October]]'' combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such (\"The Count\", \"The Good Doctor\", \"Jack\", etc.).\n\nOccasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]'', wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. [[Fu Manchu]] appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator [[Sax Rohmer]], he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', wherein a character named \"[[List of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters#Jimmy Bond|Jimmy]]\" is clearly intended to be [[Ian Fleming]]'s character [[James Bond]], though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody [[Sean Connery]]'s appearance in the 2003 [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]]. Another example in ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil [[Harry Potter]].\n\nThe TV show ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' is set in a world in which all [[fairy tales]] coexist, including [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], and even [[Alice in Wonderland]]. (As a production of [[The Walt Disney Company]], copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in ''Once Upon a Time''.) The [[Shrek (film series)|''Shrek'']] film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like [[Peter Pan]] (often in the form of [[satire]]).\n\n===Television series===\n\n====Between established shows====\nCrossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The ''Law and Order'' series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. ''Law & Order: SVU'' has crossed over several times with ''Chicago P.D.'' and ''Chicago Fire'', as well as sharing a common character with ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. ''NCIS'' has crossed over with ''NCIS: Los Angeles'', ''NCIS: New Orleans'' and ''JAG'', while ''NCIS: Los Angeles'' has crossed over with both ''Scorpion'' and ''Hawaii Five-0''. Following the cancellation of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', remaining in the same timeline as their former show.\n\nThe ''CSI'' franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with ''CSI: Miami'', ''CSI: Cyber'', ''CSI: NY'' and ''Without a Trace''. ''CSI: NY'' crossed over with fellow CBS series ''Cold Case'', and [[Ted Danson]] appeared as a regular on both ''CSI'' and ''Cyber''. Similarly, ''[[Family Guy]]'' has crossed over with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while ''The Simpsons'' has crossed over with ''[[Futurama]]''. ''[[The X-Files]]'' has in turn crossed over with ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen]]'' and ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''. A proposed crossover with ''[[The West Wing]]'' was planned, but was never produced.\n\n''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Green Acres]]'', and  ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' shared a common universe, so crossovers were not uncommon. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' both take place in the same universe, and have had multiple crossovers, including Torchwood characters appearing in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\". Torchwood's [[Torchwood (series 1)|first series]] [[End of Days (Torchwood)|finale]] ends with the materialisation sound of the [[TARDIS]], which is seen in Doctor Who's [[Doctor Who (series 3)|series 3]] episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\".  \n\n====Between related shows====\nThough most common on shows of the same [[production company]] (see, for example, \"[[Hurricane Saturday]]\"), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or [[television network]]. A notable example of this kind of link is that between ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' These shows were made by different companies, but owned by [[Universal Studios]] and broadcast on [[CBS]]. Another case is that of ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', which share the character of [[List of Friends characters#Ursula Buffay|Ursula Buffay]]. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), a setting ([[New York City]]) and a schedule (''Friends'' initially followed ''Mad About You'' on [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV|Thursday night schedule]]).\n\n''Mad About You'' and ''Friends'' share another type of \"network crossover\". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover \"event\". In one case, a New York City [[Power outage|blackout]] caused by [[Paul Reiser]]'s character on ''Mad About You'' was experienced by the characters on ''Friends'' and ''[[Madman of the People]]''.<ref>[http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml epguides.com listing for ''Pandora's Box'', the episode which kicked off \"Blackout Thursday\" on NBC.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012135515/http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml |date=2007-10-12 }}</ref> Such \"event nights\" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] attempted this kind of \"event night\" crossover with its [[TGIF (ABC)|Friday night programming]] during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' should chase her cat, [[Salem Saberhagen|Salem]], through ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[You Wish (TV series)|You Wish]]'' and ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'' because it had run away with a \"time ball\" that was displacing each show through time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poobala.com/timeball.html|title=Crossover Event: \"The Time Ball\"|work=poobala.com}}</ref>\n\nABC also attempted a \"crossover\" when four of its sitcoms (''[[Grace Under Fire]]'', ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'') all went to [[Las Vegas]] during the 1996\u20131997 season.\n\n[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] used his show ''[[Zoey 101]]'' to promote his new show ''[[iCarly]]'' by making characters from ''Zoey 101'' go to ''ICarly.com'' or use the song the ''iCarly'' theme song  as a ringtone. A ''[[Henry Danger]]'' comic book and Gibby's wax head is seen in the ''[[Game Shakers]]'' episode \"Lost Jacket, Falling Pigeons\", the subway station's lost and found.\n\n[[The CW]]'s superhero franchise [[Arrowverse]] has held annual [[Arrowverse#Official crossover events|crossover events]] since 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/arrowverse-crisis-infinite-earths-crossover-length/amp/|title=Crisis On Infinite Earths Crossover Event Will Air Over 5 Hours|last=Marshall|first=Andrew|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=2019-05-16|accessdate=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n=====Narrative rationales=====\nOn other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective [[John Munch]] (from NBC's ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'') on Fox's ''The X-Files'' happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on ''The X-Files'' to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series ''[[Law & Order]]'' on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. Later, when ''Homicide'' went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' until October 2013.\n\nA two-part crossover episode between ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' with ''[[Without a Trace]]'' aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on ''CSI'' and the second hour was on ''Without a Trace''.<ref name=\"crossover-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.csifanatic.com/2007/07/31/a-csi-without-a-trace-crossover|title=A CSI Without a Trace Crossover|work=CSIfanatic.com|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Without a Trace'' was shown on [[Channel 4]] and ''CSI'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes.<ref name=\"crossover-2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/13/tvratings.television|title=CSI Vegas gamble pays off for Five|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-02-12|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|date=February 13, 2008}}</ref> Another ''CSI'' crossover occurred in 2009 when [[Raymond Langston]] from ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' appeared both in ''[[CSI: Miami]]''<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Bone Voyage| episodelink = Bone Voyage| series = CSI: Miami| serieslink = CSI: Miami| airdate = November 9, 2009| season = 8| number = 7}}</ref> and ''[[CSI: NY]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Hammer Down| episodelink = Hammer Down| series = CSI: NY| serieslink = CSI: NY| airdate = November 11, 2009| season = 6| number = 7}}</ref> traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' had a crossover with ''[[Third Watch]]'' which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22810|title=4 Memorable TV Crossovers|work=Mental Floss|access-date=2009-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221061407/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22810|archive-date=2009-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Canadian crime drama series ''[[Republic of Doyle]]'' and ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'' produced a crossover,<ref name=doylemurdoch>{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/|title=Celebrating the Can-combo of Republic of Doyle and Murdoch Mysteries|work=[[National Post]]|date=November 25, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131212035932/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/|archivedate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; ''Murdoch Mysteries'' is a historical series set in the 1890s, while ''Republic of Doyle'' is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as ''relatives'' of their primary characters; [[Allan Hawco]] appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of ''Murdoch Mysteries'' as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while [[Yannick Bisson]] appeared on a January 2014 episode of ''Republic of Doyle'' as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.<ref name=doylemurdoch />\n\n=====In children's television=====\nDisney Channel's ''Suite Life'' franchise has featured three crossovers: In 2006, ''[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]'' featured characters from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[That's So Raven]]'' taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''); [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]]/[[Miley Stewart]] ([[Miley Cyrus]]) also eats cake off Zack; this recurs when she eats cake off of Cody during the 2009 crossover ''[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]'', in which characters from ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'' and ''Hannah Montana'' come on aboard the S.S. Tipton (though the characters from ''Wizards of Waverly Place'' and ''Hannah Montana'' do not interact). The New Year's special ''[[Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year]]'', which aired in 2013, features characters from ''[[Austin & Ally]]'' and ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]''. In 2015 a crossover between two Disney XD shows ''[[Lab Rats: Bionic Island]]'' and ''[[Mighty Med]]'' crossed over in the special \"[[Lab Rats vs. Mighty Med]]\".\n\nAnother type of crossover involves characters from an off-the-air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the [[Nickelodeon]] sitcom ''[[iCarly]]''; the episode \"iStart a Fan War\" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and ''[[Zoey 101]]'' character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between ''[[Victorious]]'' and ''Drake & Josh'' also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] making an appearance. An episode titled \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\" was a crossover between ''iCarly'' and ''Victorious''. This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in ''Who Did It to Trina'', Tori referred to ''Drake and Josh'' as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from ''iCarly'' and ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' (a crossover/spin-off of ''iCarly'' and ''Victorious'') one can see ''Drake and Josh'' and ''Zoey 101'' in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the ''iCarly'' episode ''iGet Pranky'' and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in ''iToe Fat Cakes'' and you can see the character Megan from ''Drake and Josh'' (also portrayed by [[Miranda Cosgrove]]) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in ''#FavoriteShow'' an episode from ''Sam & Cat'', making the universe between each of the shows confusing. However, these were probably all non-canonical references.\n\nIn 2014, ''[[The Thundermans]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Hathaways]]'' did a crossover, called \"The Haunted Thundermans\". In 2016, ''[[Henry Danger]]'' and ''The Thundermans'' did a crossover, called \"Danger & Thunder\". In 2017, ''Henry Danger'' and ''Game Shakers'' did a crossover, called \"Danger Games\", which was then followed by a crossover episode, called \"Babe Loves Danger\", that aired in 2018. In 2017, ''Game Shakers'' did a crossover with ''iCarly'', called \"Game Shippers\".\n\nThe main characters of ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' make a crossover appearance in the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, \"[[Ghost Story (Rugrats)|Ghost Story]]\". This is because both shows were created/produced by [[Klasky Csupo]] and distributed also by Nickelodeon{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.\n\nIn [[Chile]], children's programs and characters from [[El Mundo del Profesor Rossa]] ([[Spanish Language|Spanish]] for ''The World of Professor Rossa'') and [[Cachureos]] ([[Spanish Language|Chilean Spanish]] for ''odds and ends'') conducted a crossover between them for a few minutes in their emissions of Saturday 18 (Mundo del Profesor Rossa) and Sunday 19 (Cachureos) of April 1998 due the debut of the latter program on [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]], after several years of broadcast on [[Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile|TVN]] and even have competed with each other for the child audience.\n\n====Special usages====\n\n=====Promotional cameos=====\nCrossovers can take the form of a promotional [[cameo appearance]], used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[A Star Is Burns]]'', in which the character of Jay Sherman (from ''[[The Critic]]'') appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before ''The Critic'' began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of ''The Simpsons'' as existing to promote ''The Critic'', an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.<ref>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html Various reactions, including Matt Groening's, to ''A Star Is Burns''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810215843/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html |date=2007-08-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series ''[[Vega$]]'' appeared in an episode of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (\"Angels in Vegas\") one week prior to the debut of ''Vega$''. However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna  was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an ''ABC TV Movie of the Week'' on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of ''Vega$'' as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' appeared in the fourth season premier of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (\"Love Boat Angels\").\n\nIn 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of ''[[Coronation Street]]'', characters in fellow established TV soap ''[[EastEnders]]'' made reference to watching the special anniversary episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1388625_review_coronation_street_live_drama_was_so_gripping_even_dot_cotton_tuned_in |title=Review: Coronation Street live drama was so gripping, even Dot Cotton tuned in - Manchester Evening News |publisher=Menmedia.co.uk |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year.\n\nThe two [[CBS Daytime]] game shows (''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'') are used for promotional cameos from other CBS properties. Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common. ''Price'' has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the ''NCIS'' franchise, the three reality shows, and [[NFL on CBS|CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL]].\n\n====Spin-offs====\n{{See also|List of television spin-offs}}\nIn its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when [[Cliff Huxtable]] of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' visited his daughter, [[Denise Huxtable|Denise]], on ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''. Another example of this is ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', which was a spin-off from ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. [[Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]] was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a [[Parachuting|skydiving]] accident, but her life was saved by [[Oscar Goldman]] ([[Richard Anderson]]) and Dr. Rudy Wells ([[Martin E. Brooks]]) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]]. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' characters to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' in [[Los Angeles]] from [[Sunnydale]]; in a striking example, \"[[Fool for Love (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Fool for Love]]\" and \"[[Darla (Angel episode)|Darla]]\", shown on the same night, contain overlapping flashbacks as remembered by [[Spike (vampire)|Spike]] and [[Darla (vampire)|Darla]] respectively. There is also ''[[Frasier]]'', which features characters from the first show, ''[[Cheers]]''. Similarly, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' characters [[J. R. Ewing]], [[Bobby Ewing]], [[Lucy Ewing]] and [[Kristin Shepard]] all appeared in its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]'' while ''Knots Landing'' characters [[Gary Ewing]] and [[Valene Ewing]] each made several appearances on ''Dallas'' after ''Knots Landing'' premiered.\n\nMore complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the [[Star Trek crossovers|''Star Trek'' universe]], where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the [[Klingon]]s [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] (from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode \"[[Errand of Mercy]]\"), [[Koloth]] (from \"[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]\") and [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]] (from \"[[Day of the Dove]]\"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] appeared together in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode, \"[[Blood Oath (DS9 episode)|Blood Oath]]\" \u2013 as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, [[Arne Darvin]], appeared as a secondary character in \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", but was the principal villain of DS9's \"[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]\". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the ''[[USS Defiant|Defiant]]'', Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with [[James T. Kirk]], [[Spock]] and the rest of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' crew.\n\nThe distinction between \"spin-off\" and \"crossover\" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'' is a spin-off of ''[[Happy Days]]'', or whether the star of ''Out of the Blue'' merely crossed over into ''Happy Days''.\n\n''[[Mako: Island of Secrets|Mako Mermaids]]'', a spinoff of ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'', featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected.\n\n=====Parodic crossovers=====\nOften, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by [[situation comedies]] that wish to crossover with [[television drama|dramatic television]] programs. The satirical crossover\u2014ranging in length from a cameo to a full [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] or episode\u2014is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious [[parody]] or [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a [[narrative]] point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program.\n\nSuch [[tongue-in-cheek]] crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.\n* Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', which was largely accepted as being outside standard ''X-Files'' continuity.\n* One episode of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'' shows that after Mandy smiles, she, along with Billy and Grim, are transformed into [[The Powerpuff Girls]] with a cameo by Professor Utonium.\n* They can occur by virtue of a [[dream sequence]], in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of ''[[Newhart]]'' had been the dream of [[Bob Newhart]]'s character on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' appeared in a dream of a character on ''[[The King of Queens]]''.\n* Parodic crossovers can take the form of \"[[joke|gag]]\" cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Characters from ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'' have appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to comment on a peewee football game. Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show, but not necessarily the character that the actor played. For instance, on the ABC/CBS show ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' during the closing credits of the episode \"Scenes From a Mall\" (Season 5, Episode 12), a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring [[Reginald VelJohnson]] is re-played, but this time with one of the child actors stating that he \"looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince,\" referring to [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]] who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC's ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson, Avery walked onto the set with an angry look, being in on the staged joke himself. Ended the episode (but with the cameras filming still), VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smilingly greeted the public.\n* Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programs, such as when [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] found and ate [[Bart Simpson]]'s shorts on ''[[Futurama]]'', or [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] had a talking Bender doll on ''The Simpsons''. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories.\n* Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside ''either'' series. This occurs most commonly on a [[sketch comedy]] show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors\u2014for example, a sketch on ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' saw Yasir and Sarah from ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'' buying the gas station from ''[[Corner Gas]]'', with many of the characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows' real actors\u2014although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show's own stable of actors. Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience\u2014and in no way considered a part of either show's continuity\u2014due to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programs quickly and inexpensively. When [[Patrick Stewart]] appeared in a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/''[[The Love Boat]]'' crossover on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', for instance, few ''Star Trek'' fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event \"counted\" as an episode of the show. However, there are some cases of this type of parody having some [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] resonance with viewers. For instance, the British charity appeal [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the typical sketch show. Many of these ''Relief'' sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programs being parodied, and hence appear to be \"normal\" episodes. A good example of this is the sketch, \"BallyKissDibley\", an 11-minute piece in which the leads of ''[[Ballykissangel]]'' appeared on the sets of  ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', alongside most of ''Dibley''{{'}}s cast. Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character, the extent to which these parodies \"count\" as part of either show's canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers.\n* Parodic crossovers can be used to lend [[verisimilitude]] to the fictional world of a program. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as [[game show]]s or [[reality show]]s. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' once appeared on ''[[Family Feud]]'' and the townsfolk of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' have had their [[heirloom]]s valuated on ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', for instance. In such cases, it is generally the non-fictional show which ends up being the most satirized, due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements. However, these crossovers can happen on dramatic television, such as when ''[[Blue Peter]]'' provided [[Exposition (literary technique)|narrative exposition]] on ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''. Rarely, brief crossovers between two fictional programs can be used for this same purpose. In the episode, \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\", [[Peggy Mitchell]] was seen in a fictionalized scene from ''[[EastEnders]]'' in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of ''[[Doctor Who]]''{{'}}s [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Here, too, time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme (''EastEnders'') and not the host program (''Doctor Who'').\n\n=====Retroactive crossovers=====\nSometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of [[autism|autistic]] character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous ''other'' crossovers, linkages can be found from ''Elsewhere'' to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called \"the [[Tommy Westphall Universe]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==== Tokusatsu for Japan ====\n* ''[[Kamen Rider]]''\n* ''[[Super Sentai]]''\n* ''[[Ultra Series]]''\n* ''[[Metal Hero Series]]''\n* ''[[Chouseishin Series]]''\n\n==== German crossover ====\nOne of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Unter Br\u00fcdern (1990 film)|de|3=Unter Br\u00fcdern (1990)|lt=Unter Br\u00fcdern}}'' (1990), which was produced by [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk|DFF]] as a crossover between the [[West Germany|West German]] crime series ''[[Tatort]]'' and the [[East Germany|East German]] crime series ''[[Polizeiruf 110]]''. Their respective popular heroes [[Horst Schimanski]] and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the [[Berlin Wall#The fall|fall of the Berlin Wall]]. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]].\n\n==Unofficial crossovers==\nIn contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of [[Fanfiction|fan-written fiction]] and [[fan art]], but it is increasingly prevalent in [[fan film|amateur films]] and [[radio drama|audio]]. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to [[injunction|enjoin]] the distribution of such material.\n\nA good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film ''[[Batman: Dead End]]'', which brings together the properties of ''Batman'', ''[[Alien (film series)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' in one setting.\n\nUnofficial crossovers can also occur in a \"what-if\" scenario. [[Roger (American Dad)|Roger]] makes frequent cameo appearances in ''Family Guy'', while [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] makes cameos on ''American Dad!''. Roger, [[Rallo Tubbs]], and [[Klaus Heissler]] were seen in the final ''Family Guy'' ''Star Wars'' spoof, \"[[It's A Trap!]]\", as an Imperial Officer, [[Nien Nunb]], and [[Admiral Ackbar]], respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\".\nAn appearance by [[Elmo]], from [[Sesame Street]], was made, in a hallucination of [[Connie Ray]]'s, on TV sitcom [[The Torkelsons]].\nFan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as ''Star Wars'' vs. ''Star Trek'' or ''Babylon 5'' vs. ''Stargate''. ''[[M.U.G.E.N.]]'' is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Amalgam Comics]]\n* [[Canon (fiction)]]\n* [[Callback (comedy)]]\n* [[Continuity (fiction)]]\n* [[Fanfiction]]\n* [[Fictional character]]\n* [[Fictional universe]]\n* [[Intercompany crossover]]\n* [[Shared universe]]\n** [[List of television spin-offs]]\n* [[Tommy Westphall]]\n* [[Wold Newton family]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.katspace.org/fiction/essays/crossovers/ Thoughts On Crossovers In General (Kathryn Andersen)] An essay musing on the numerous elements necessary to a successful crossover (primarily aimed at fan-written fiction).\n* [http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron.htm World Newton Universe Crossover Chronology] Crossovers which build upon and take place in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's World Newton continuity.\n* [http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/008910.html \"On Crossovers\"], [[Jess Nevins]]' history of the fictional crossover\n\n{{Fan fiction}}\n{{Superhero fiction}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fictional Crossover}}\n[[Category:Crossover fiction| ]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Placement of two or more otherwise discrete fictional characters, settings, or universes into the context of a single story}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{more citations needed|date = March 2008}}\n{{Globalize|article|North America|date=December 2010}}\n{{example farm|date = August 2013}}\n}}\nA '''crossover''' is the placement of two or more otherwise discrete [[fiction]]al [[fictional character|characters]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]]s, or [[fictional universe|universes]] into the context of a single [[Narrative|story]]. They can arise from legal agreements between the relevant [[copyright]] holders, unauthorized efforts by [[fandom|fan]]s or common corporate ownership.\n\n==Official crossovers==\nCrossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the [[intellectual property]] rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.\n\nCrossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the [[public domain]] with those concurrently under [[copyright|copyright protection]].\n\nA crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from ''[[Golden Girls]]'' and ''[[Empty Nest (TV series)|Empty Nest]]'') or meeting via dimensional rift or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for [[science fiction]] properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective [[Continuity (fiction)|continuities]]. Still, others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]'', where each show is fiction in the other.\n\n===Comics===<!-- This section is linked from [[X-Men (TV series)]] -->\n[[File:SpeedComicsNo32.jpg|thumb|Comic book crossovers may be traced back to the [[Golden Age of Comics|Golden Age]], where characters frequently teamed up on the cover (though far more rarely on the inside). ''Speed Comics'' number 32, Artwork by [[Alex Schomburg]].]]\n[[File:MasterComicsNo21.jpg|thumb|An early example of the comics crossover: [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[Bulletman]] join forces to battle [[Captain Nazi]]. ''Master Comics'' number 21, Artwork by [[Mac Rayboy]].]]\nCrossovers of multiple characters, owned by one company or [[publishing|published]] by one [[publisher]], have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of [[comic book publisher]]s, as different characters in various [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]], [[DC Comics|DC]], or [[Valiant Comics|Valiant]] [[comic book]]s frequently interact with one another since they live in a \"[[shared universe]]\". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, [[Spider-Man]] has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], just as in the DC Comics Universe, the [[The Flash (Barry Allen)|Flash]] and [[Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)|Green Lantern]] often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these \"guest star\" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a [[team-up]]. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}} This has led to \"crossover events\", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.\n\nThe earliest such crossover event was [[Gardner Fox]]'s ''Zatanna's Search'', which took place in ''[[Hawkman]]'' #4 (October/November 1964), ''[[Detective Comics]]'' #336 (February 1965), ''[[The Atom]]'' #19 (June/July 1965), ''[[Green Lantern]]'' #42 (January 1966), ''Detective Comics'' #355 (September 1966), and ''[[Justice League of America]]'' #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with [[Zatanna]] attempting to reconnect with her father, [[Zatara]], and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], the Atom, Green Lantern, and [[Elongated Man]] along the way.\n\nThe first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, [[Jim Shooter]]. As a way to further toy sales he devised the ''[[Secret Wars]]'' crossover, which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. ''Secret Wars'' was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of [[Spider-Man]]'s black suit which would later become the villain [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]). [[Jim Shooter]] later perfected his crossover technique at [[Valiant Comics]] with the ''[[Unity (comics)|Unity]]'' event. ''Unity'' brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat [[Mothergod]], but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like ''Secret Wars'', the ''Unity'' crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of [[Turok]], the birth of [[Magnus, Robot Fighter]] and the death of a major Valiant hero.\n\n[[Dark Horse Comics]]'s ''Aliens Versus Predator'' comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an ''Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator'' comic.\n\nThe comic crossovers from [[Raj Comics]] are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between [[Nagraj]] and [[Super Commando Dhruva]]. In ''Kohram'', all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish ''Haru'', an extremely powerful enemy.\n\n[[Webcomics]] creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between [[Christopher Baldwin]]'s ''[[Bruno (webcomic)|Bruno]]'' and Peter Zale's ''[[Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|title=Comic Strips Crossover On The Net|last=Menefee|first=Craig|date=March 19, 1998|work=[[New Straits Times]]|quote=lasted two weeks|page=38}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of [[Capcom]] character [[Mega Man]] and [[Sega]] character [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] called \"[[Worlds Collide (Archie Comics)|Worlds Collide]]\". Taking place in issues of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], [[Sonic Universe]],'' and ''[[Mega Man (Archie Comics)|Mega Man]]'' comic series from Archie, the crossover involved [[Dr. Eggman]] and [[Dr. Wily]] forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the ''Mega Man'' games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled \"Worlds Unite\", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man, but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the ''[[Mega Man X]]'' and ''[[Sonic Boom (TV series)|Sonic Boom]]'' spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by ''Mega Man X'' villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. \"Worlds Unite\" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the ''Sonic Boom'' comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers.\n\nThere are also [[intercompany crossover]]s, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.\n\n===Animation===\nCartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them \u2013 like comics or live-action TV shows \u2013 will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is [[Cartoon Network]]'s ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door''. It features five crossovers \u2013 ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'', ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy]]'', a reference to ''[[The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and a quote from ''[[Scooby-Doo]]'', which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of ''[[Ben 10: Ultimate Alien]]'' and ''[[Generator Rex]]'' team up in ''[[Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United]]''. Similarly, characters from ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]'' and ''[[Steven Universe]]'' appeared in a crossover episode \"Say Uncle\". The same occurred with ''[[The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)|The Powerpuff Girls]]'' and ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' in an episode called \"[[TTG v PPG]]\". ''[[OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes]]'' did a crossover episode called \"Crossover Nexus\" to celebrate 25 years of Cartoon Network where the lead character joined forces with Ben 10, Garnet from Steven Universe and Raven from Teen Titans. Most of the last episodes of the ''[[Lilo & Stitch: The Series]]'' (a spinoff of the film ''[[Lilo & Stitch]]'') had crossovers with various other [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] cartoons, including ''[[The Proud Family]]'', ''[[Kim Possible]]'', ''[[Recess (TV series)|Recess]]'', and ''[[American Dragon Jake Long]]''. The ''[[Jimmy Timmy Power Hour]]'' trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series ''[[Hercules (1998 TV series)|Hercules]]'', based on the [[Hercules (1997 film)|1997 film of the same name]], had an episode titled \"[[Hercules and the Arabian Night]]\" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film ''[[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]'', in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is ''[[Rugrats Go Wild]]'' in which the [[Rugrats]] are stranded on an island where [[The Wild Thornberrys]] were at the time. In ''[[Dexter's Laboratory]]'' \"Dial M for Monkey\" \"Huntor\" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; \"Huntor\" later makes a cameo crossover in [[Samurai Jack]]'s \"Jack vs Mad Jack.\" \nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the [[Hanna-Barbera]] properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on ''[[The New Scooby-Doo Movies]]'', which featured appearances by characters from ''[[Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)|Harlem Globetrotters]]'', ''[[Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)|Josie and the Pussycats]]'', ''[[Jeannie (TV series)|Jeannie]]'', ''[[Speed Buggy]]'', ''[[The Adventures of Batman|Batman and Robin]]'', and ''[[The Addams Family (1964 TV series)|The Addams Family]]''. Later, the ''[[Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10]]'' set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as ''[[The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones]]''. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977\u201379 series ''[[Laff-A-Lympics]],'' which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.\n\nCrossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie ''[[Who Framed Roger Rabbit]]'' had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and [[Warner Bros.]] [[Daffy Duck]] and [[Donald Duck]] made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, [[Mickey Mouse]] and [[Bugs Bunny]] were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie).{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} The film also includes cameos of characters from [[Metro\u2013Goldwyn\u2013Mayer cartoon studio|MGM]]. The end of the movie features all the cartoons from all of the animation companies joining together in song, to be concluded by [[Porky Pig]] stuttering his famous \"That's All, Folks!\" line as [[Tinker Bell#Disney|Tinker Bell]] ends the scene with a magical fade-out.\n\nOn February 27, 1998, Fox Kids show, ''[[Power Rangers in Space]]'' and ''[[Ninja Turtles: The Next Mutation]]'', had their crossover with the episode \"Shell Shocked\".\n\nOn October 4, 1997, The 2 Kids WB shows, ''Superman: The Animated Series'' and ''The New Batman Adventures'', had their first crossover with the TV movie ''World's Finest'', which was also released on DVD.\n\nAnother cartoon crossover would occur in 1990, ''[[Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue]]''. This cartoon featured popular characters from children's Saturday morning cartoons, banding together to promote an anti-drug message. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], [[CBS]], [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], and [[NBC]] aired this half-hour special one Saturday morning with characters from all their networks, including [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] (from Disney's ''[[DuckTales]]''), [[Winnie the Pooh]], [[Tigger]], Slimer (from ''[[The Real Ghostbusters]]'' and ''Extreme Ghostbusters''), Michelangelo (from ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''), Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, [[Alvin and the Chipmunks]], [[The Smurfs]], ALF (from [[ALF: The Animated Series|his short-lived cartoon spinoff]]), [[Garfield]], and the trio of [[Kermit the Frog|Baby Kermit]], [[Miss Piggy|Baby Piggy]], and [[Gonzo the Great|Baby Gonzo]] (from Jim Henson's ''[[Muppet Babies (1984 TV series)|Muppet Babies]]''). Animation companies granted unlimited, royalty-free use of their cartoon characters for this project, a feat that has been unequalled before or since then. This cartoon was also introduced by then-[[President of the United States|President]] [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[Barbara Bush]], and would be distributed to schools and video stores free of charge nationwide.\n\n[[Manga]] artist [[Leiji Matsumoto]] has been known to cross over the characters of his various stories and characters such as ''[[Captain Harlock]]'', ''[[Galaxy Express 999]]'', and ''[[Queen Millennia]]'', all of which were originally written as separate, self-contained stories. In the ''[[Maetel Legend]]'', Queen Promethium is revealed to be having been Yukino Yaoi, the protagonist from ''Queen Millennia''. Matsumoto has also created various crossovers with ''[[Space Battleship Yamato]]'', an anime on which he served as director, although the rights to Yamato are actually owned by Yoshinobu Nishizaki.\n\nThe adult parody-oriented series ''[[Drawn Together]]'' features many crossovers; while some are regular cameos, such as [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] and [[Lois Griffin]] from ''[[Family Guy]]'', others involve a personality twist, such as the [[murder|homicidal]] version of [[Bambi (character)|Bambi]] from [[Bambi|the eponymous film]] or the [[homosexuality|gay]] version of [[Elmer Fudd]] from the ''[[Looney Tunes]]'' franchise.\n\nThe  Disney/Marvel crossover ''[[Phineas and Ferb: Mission Marvel]]'' features the Marvel heroes [[Spider-Man]], [[Iron Man]], the [[Hulk]], and [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], the Marvel villains [[Whiplash (comics)|Whiplash]], [[MODOK]], [[Red Skull]], and [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], and characters from ''Phineas and Ferb'', where the storyline involves Phineas and Ferb trying to restore power to the Marvel heroes, whose powers were taken away by Doofenshmirtz.\n\nDuring its 26th season, ''[[The Simpsons]]'' has crossovers with ''[[Family Guy]]'' and ''[[Futurama]]''. In the hour-long ''[[Family Guy]]'' season 13 premiere \"[[The Simpsons Guy]]\", the Griffins meet the Simpson family,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/18/simpsons-family-guy-crossover-episode|title=TV|work=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com}}</ref> who meet the Planet Express crew in the ''Simpsons'' episode \"[[Simpsorama]]\".<ref name=ewcc>{{cite web|title='The Simpsons' to join forces with 'Futurama' for crossover episode|url=http://insidetv.ew.com/2013/07/20/the-simpsons-futurama-crossover-epsidoe/|work=Entertainment Weekly}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Disney]] series ''[[House of Mouse]]'', [[Mickey Mouse]] and friends host a nightclub featuring cameos by other Disney characters.\n\nWebtoons (animated shows from the internet) can also have crossovers with different webtoons, franchises, YouTubers and more. Some examples are when Kate from [[TomSka]]'s ''Crash Zoom'' series makes an appearance in ''[[Eddsworld]]'' as a trick or treater who possesses Matt and Edd in the episode, \"Trick or Threat\". In addition to this a couple of characters from ''Eddsworld'' make appearances in some ''Crash Zoom'' episodes such as \"Orcs and Dorks\". Another example is ''[[Death Battle]]'' which is a show where two hosts (Wiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises. Shows like ''One Minute Melee'', ''Cartoon Fight Club'', and ''Death Battle Exhibitions'' (the spinoff series) have a similar format to ''Death Battle''. \n\nBy Disney, [[Hasbro]] and [[Universal Pictures|Universal]], the crossover served as the films ''[[Dr. Jack|The Nature Vacations of Pok\u00e9mon, Animals, Friendship Ponies and Dinosaurs]]'' and ''[[Manslaughter (1922 film)|The Nature Vacations of Fantastic World of the Adventure]]'', which were called ''The Nature Vacations Movie'', includes [[Griffith (surname)|Jacob Griffith]] the protagonist among with characters of [[My Little Pony]], such as [[Twilight Sparkle]], [[Apple Bloom]], [[Sweetie Belle]], especially all of those several characters around the world.  \n\nThe [[Netflix]] original series ''[[Harvey Girls Forever]]'' is a crossover of the comics [[Little Audrey]], [[Little Dot Dotland]] and [[Little Lotta]], although later episodes in the third and fourth season are crossovers of [[Richie Rich (comics)|Richie Rich]] and [[Casper the Friendly Ghost]].\n\n=== Anime and Manga ===\nAnime has also participated in many crossover events featuring characters or shows from the same company or network. One of the biggest projects down would be [[Dream 9 Toriko & One Piece & Dragon Ball Z Super Collaboration Special!!|''Dream 9 Toriko x One Piece x Dragon Ball Z Super Special Collaboration'']] as if includes three [[Shonen Jump (magazine)|''Shonen Jump'']] franchises, being [[Dragon Ball Z]], [[One Piece]], and [[Toriko]], crossed over into an hour long special Like most crossovers, this special is filler, a fan-service episode that follows the common plot line in most crossovers. In the first half of the special, characters from the three franchises meet-up and fight. In the second half, they team up to battle a stronger foe. What makes this crossover unique is when the characters from all three shows split into groups, where the members all share the same cliched character archetypes, such the main characters Goku, Luffy, and Toriko falling into the dumb, good natured, strong character archetype.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/one-piece-and-dragon-ball-z-collide-in-this-tv-special-471121234|title=One Piece and Dragon Ball Z Collide in this TV Special|website=Kotaku|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-18}}</ref>\n\n''[[Carnival Phantasm]]'' is also an OVA comedy series based off of a ''[[Type-Moon]]'' gag manga called Take-Moon. Created to celebrate the company's 10th anniversary, the anime consists of several funny and unusual scenarios involving various characters from the Type-Moon franchises.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.typemoon.com/products/cp/index.html|title=Carnival Phantasm -\u30ab\u30fc\u30cb\u30d0\u30eb\u30fb\u30d5\u30a1\u30f3\u30bf\u30ba\u30e0-|website=www.typemoon.com|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref> Some examples include characters from ''[[Fate/stay night]]'' and ''[[Tsukihime]]''.\n\nThe ''[[Dragon Ball]]'' franchise is one of the most popular manga and anime in the world, and has its fair share of crossovers as well. The creator of the franchise, [[Akira Toriyama]], has used another character from a different manga series he created, Jaco from ''Jaco the Galactic Policeman'' as a reoccurring character in ''[[Dragon Ball Super]]''. He comes to Earth to warn the characters about the return of Frieza and is later seen in the disputes involving Beerus and Champa. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/dragon-ball-z-crossovers/|title=15 Times Dragon Ball Z Crossed Over With Other Series|date=2017-03-08|website=ScreenRant|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-24}}</ref>\n\n[[Cyborg 009 VS Devilman]] is a three part anime OVA that crosses over the ''[[Cyborg 009]]'' and [[Devilman]] series.

''[[The King of Fighters]]'', ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom (series)|Marvel vs. Capcom]]'', and many other franchises from third-party developers such as [[Capcom]] and [[SNK Playmore|SNK]] bring these licenses together.\n* The [[2.5D]] fighting game series ''[[Super Smash Bros. (series)|Super Smash Bros.]]'' brings various [[Nintendo]] characters together and allow players to fight against each other as these characters in arenas. The third game in the series, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Brawl]]'' introduced two third-party characters with the inclusion of [[Solid Snake]] and [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]], of [[Konami]]'s ''[[Metal Gear (series)|Metal Gear]]'' series and [[Sega]]'s ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series respectively. The fourth installments, [[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U|''Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS'' and ''Super Smash Bros. for Wii U'']], feature characters from the third-party franchises of Capcom's ''[[Mega Man]]'' ([[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]]) and ''[[Street Fighter]]'' ([[Ryu (Street Fighter)|Ryu]]), Sega's ''[[Bayonetta]]'' ([[Bayonetta (character)|Bayonetta]]), Bandai Namco's ''[[PAC-MAN|Pac-Man]]'' ([[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]]), and Square Enix's ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' ([[Cloud Strife]]), in addition to other Nintendo characters from the company's different universes. The fifth installment, ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' also introduced [[Simon Belmont|Simon]] and [[Richter Belmont]] from Konami's ''[[Castlevania]]'' series, [[Ken Masters]] from Capcom's ''Street Fighter'' series, [[Joker (Persona)|Joker]] from ''[[Persona 5]]'', the Hero from the ''[[Dragon Quest]]'' series, Banjo-Kazooie from the ''[[Banjo-Kazooie (series)|Banjo-Kazooie]]'' series and [[Terry Bogard]] from the ''[[Fatal Fury]]'' series in addition to bringing back all of the playable characters from the previous entries in the series.\n* The [[Namco]]-developed ''[[Soul (series)|Soul]]'' series features characters from a variety of other franchises including [[Link (The Legend of Zelda)|Link]] from Nintendo's ''[[The Legend of Zelda (series)|The Legend of Zelda]]'' series, [[Heihachi Mishima]] from ''[[Tekken (series)|Tekken]]'', [[Todd McFarlane]]'s [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]], [[Darth Vader]], [[Yoda]], and [[Starkiller]] from ''[[Star Wars]]'', [[Lloyd Irving]] from ''[[Tales of Symphonia]]'', [[Ubisoft Montreal]]'s Ezio Auditore from the ''[[Assassin's Creed]]'' series, [[Geralt of Rivia]] from [[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s ''[[The Witcher]]'', and YoRHa No. 2 Type B from [[PlatinumGames]]' ''[[Nier: Automata]]''.\n* ''[[Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games]]'', released in Japan two months before ''Super Smash Bros. Brawl'', was the first time that [[Mario]] and Sonic (as well as their associated characters) appeared in a game together.\n* The ''[[Kingdom Hearts (series)|Kingdom Hearts]]'' series of role-playing games developed by [[Square Enix]] features a number of characters from [[Disney]] films, ''[[Final Fantasy]]'', and ''[[The World Ends With You]]''.\n* Starting with ''[[Mortal Kombat (2011 video game)|Mortal Kombat]]'', video game developer [[NetherRealm Studios]] has guest characters ranging from ''Mortal Kombat'' veterans [[Scorpion (Mortal Kombat)|Scorpion]], [[Sub-Zero (Mortal Kombat)|Sub-Zero]] and [[Raiden (Mortal Kombat)|Raiden]] to [[Freddy Krueger]] from ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|A Nightmare on Elm Street]]'', [[Jason Voorhees]] from ''[[Friday the 13th (franchise)|Friday the 13th]]'', [[Leatherface]] from ''[[The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (franchise)|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]]'', [[Xenomorph (Alien franchise)|The Xenomorph]] from ''[[Alien (franchise)|Alien]]'', [[Predator (fictional species)|The Predator]] from ''[[Predator (franchise)|Predator]]'', the [[T-800]] from ''[[Terminator (franchise)|Terminator]]'', [[Kratos (God of War)|Kratos]] from ''[[God of War (franchise)|God of War]]'', [[Joker (character)|The Joker]] from ''[[Batman]]'', all four [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]], [[Todd McFarlane]]'s [[Spawn (comics)|Spawn]] and [[Mike Mignola]]'s [[Hellboy (comics)|Hellboy]].\n* ''[[Super Robot Wars]]'' are turn-based strategy games featuring a variety of Japanese [[mecha]] series from many generations, such as ''[[Mazinger Z]]'', ''[[Gundam]]'', ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion franchise|Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', and ''[[GaoGaiGar]]''.\n* More recently, there has been a collaboration between Capcom and Namco, which results in ''[[Street Fighter X Tekken]]'' and the upcoming ''[[Tekken X Street Fighter]]''.\n* ''[[Warriors Orochi]]'' is the game that crossover that features the casts of both the ''[[Dynasty Warriors]]'' and ''[[Samurai Warriors]]'' series. The [[Warriors Orochi 3|third installment]] of this series included a number of playable characters from other [[Koei Tecmo]] properties, such as ''[[Ninja Gaiden]]'', ''[[Dead or Alive (franchise)|Dead or Alive]]'', ''[[Zill O'll]]'', and [[Sophitia|Sophitia Alexandra]] from Bandai Namco's ''Soul'' series. ''[[Warriors All-Stars]]'' similarly crossed-over a number of characters from Koei Tecmo series.\n* ''[[Heroes of the Storm]]'' is a [[multiplayer online battle arena]] video game developed and published by [[Blizzard Entertainment]]. The game brings various [[Blizzard Entertainment|Blizzard]] characters together as playable heroes, as well as different battlegrounds based on ''[[Warcraft]]'', ''[[Diablo (series)|Diablo]]'', ''[[StarCraft]]'', and ''[[Overwatch (video game)|Overwatch]]'' universes.\n* Perhaps one of the most notable video game crossovers is ''[[Lego Dimensions]]'', which makes use of over 30 different franchises, including DC Comics, ''[[Doctor Who]]'', ''[[The Lego Movie]]'', ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'', ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'', and more.\n* The Disney film ''[[Wreck-It Ralph]]'' and [[Ralph Breaks the Internet|its sequel]] features many video game character [[cameo appearance]]s.\n\n===Film===\nThe first film crossover in a series of [[Universal Studios]] monster films was ''[[Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man]]'', in 1943. In 2003, ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' was released by [[New Line Cinema]]. In 2004, [[20th Century Fox]] released ''[[Alien vs. Predator (film)|Alien vs. Predator]]'' along with the sequel ''[[Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem]]'' in 2007. One year later, both [[Dollman vs. Demonic Toys]] and ''[[Puppet Master vs Demonic Toys]]'' were released by [[20th Century Fox]] and Terry Kelley Studios. In 2015, [[Sony]] released ''[[Lake Placid vs. Anaconda]]''.\n\nAfter the comics publishing house [[Marvel Comics]] ventured into [[Marvel Studios#Production|movie production]], they set off to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012). The same process was repeated for ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'' (2015), ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]'' (2018), and ''[[Avengers: Endgame]]'' (2019) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]. Inspired by Marvel's success, [[Warner Bros.]], who hold movie rights for [[DC Comics]]' heroes, announced the production of ''[[Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice]]'' (2016) and further plans to develop the cinematic [[DC Extended Universe]], while [[Paramount Pictures]] and [[Hasbro Studios|Allspark Pictures]] announced plans to create a cinematic universe on the [[Transformers]] film series.\n[[File:KK v G trailer (1962).png|thumb|Battle sequence in ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' showing the title characters fighting each other.]]\nThere have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of [[kaiju]] films saw a lot of crossovers produced at [[Toho Studios]], with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. [[Godzilla]], [[Mothra]] and [[Rodan]] (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' and a few months later of all three in ''[[Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster]]''. In 1962 [[Toho Studios|Toho]] released ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]''. The long running [[Zatoichi]] series sees [[Shintaro Katsu]]'s blind master swordsman face off with [[Toshiro Mifune]] in his iconic role in ''[[Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo]]'' (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project ''[[Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman]]'' (1971). This coproduction sees [[Jimmy Wang (actor)|Jimmy Wang]] reprise his famous part of the ''[[One-Armed Swordsman]]'' while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.\n\n===Literature===\nIn [[literature]], some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. [[Kim Newman]] frequently uses this device, as does [[Stephen King]]. The works of [[James Branch Cabell]], [[J.D. Salinger]], [[William Faulkner]], [[Margaret Laurence]], [[Thomas Pynchon]], [[Kurt Vonnegut]], [[Mordecai Richler]], [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], [[Robert Heinlein]], and [[Isaac Asimov]] also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author [[Rick Riordan]] publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 [[Mark Twain]] novel, ''[[Adventures of Huckleberry Finn|The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn]]'', which had an important guest appearance by [[Tom Sawyer]]. Similarly, Lady Glencora Palliser from the Pallisers series of Anthony Trollope appears towards the end of Miss Mackenzie, a novel published between the first and second Palliser novels in 1865, a character first introduced in the novel, ''[[Can You Forgive Her?]]'' (1864). \n\nScience Fiction writer [[Poul Anderson]] allowed fellow writer [[A. Bertram Chandler]] to \"borrow\" Anderson's space-faring character [[Dominic Flandry]] and let Flandry meet with Chandler's [[A. Bertram Chandler#Writings| John Grimes]] in a common adventure (the two fail to like each other). [[Alex Scarrow]] featured the characters Cato and Macro from his brother [[Simon Scarrow|Simon]]'s ''[[Eagles of the Empire]]'' series in one book of the ''[[TimeRiders]]'' series: ''Gates of Rome'' (2012), serving as supporting characters when the three protagonists [[Time travel in fiction|travel back in time]] to [[Ancient Rome]].\n\nBrazilian writer [[Monteiro Lobato]] also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the [[Cuca (folklore)|Cuca]] and [[Saci (Brazilian folklore)|Saci]], from [[Greek mythology]], from the ''[[Arabian Nights]]'', from fairy tales such as Grimm's \"[[Snow White]]\", Western literature such as [[Peter Pan]], cartoons such as ''[[Popeye]]'' and ''[[Felix the Cat]]'', and Western films.\n\n===Public domain===\nIt is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Kevin O'Neill (comics)|Kevin O'Neill]] is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of [[Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer]]'s [[Wold Newton family]] sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between [[Sherlock Holmes]] and [[Tarzan]]). [[Roger Zelazny]]'s novel ''[[A Night in the Lonesome October]]'' combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such (\"The Count\", \"The Good Doctor\", \"Jack\", etc.).\n\nOccasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One]]'', wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. [[Fu Manchu]] appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator [[Sax Rohmer]], he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in ''[[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier]]'', wherein a character named \"[[List of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters#Jimmy Bond|Jimmy]]\" is clearly intended to be [[Ian Fleming]]'s character [[James Bond]], though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody [[Sean Connery]]'s appearance in the 2003 [[The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)|film adaptation]]. Another example in ''The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen'' is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil [[Harry Potter]].\n\nThe TV show ''[[Once Upon a Time (TV series)|Once Upon a Time]]'' is set in a world in which all [[fairy tales]] coexist, including [[Snow White]], [[Little Red Riding Hood]], and even [[Alice in Wonderland]]. (As a production of [[The Walt Disney Company]], copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in ''Once Upon a Time''.) The [[Shrek (film series)|''Shrek'']] film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like [[Peter Pan]] (often in the form of [[satire]]).\n\n===Television series===\n\n====Between established shows====\nCrossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The ''Law and Order'' series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. ''Law & Order: SVU'' has crossed over several times with ''Chicago P.D.'' and ''Chicago Fire'', as well as sharing a common character with ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. ''NCIS'' has crossed over with ''NCIS: Los Angeles'', ''NCIS: New Orleans'' and ''JAG'', while ''NCIS: Los Angeles'' has crossed over with both ''Scorpion'' and ''Hawaii Five-0''. Following the cancellation of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[One Life to Live]]'' and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera ''[[General Hospital]]'', remaining in the same timeline as their former show.\n\nThe ''CSI'' franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with ''CSI: Miami'', ''CSI: Cyber'', ''CSI: NY'' and ''Without a Trace''. ''CSI: NY'' crossed over with fellow CBS series ''Cold Case'', and [[Ted Danson]] appeared as a regular on both ''CSI'' and ''Cyber''. Similarly, ''[[Family Guy]]'' has crossed over with ''[[The Simpsons]]'', while ''The Simpsons'' has crossed over with ''[[Futurama]]''. ''[[The X-Files]]'' has in turn crossed over with ''[[Millennium (TV series)|Millennium]]'', ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', ''[[The Lone Gunmen]]'' and ''[[Cops (TV series)|Cops]]''. A proposed crossover with ''[[The West Wing]]'' was planned, but was never produced.\n\n''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'', ''[[Green Acres]]'', and  ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'' shared a common universe, so crossovers were not uncommon. ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Torchwood]]'' both take place in the same universe, and have had multiple crossovers, including Torchwood characters appearing in \"[[The Stolen Earth]]\" and \"[[Journey's End (Doctor Who)|Journey's End]]\". Torchwood's [[Torchwood (series 1)|first series]] [[End of Days (Torchwood)|finale]] ends with the materialisation sound of the [[TARDIS]], which is seen in Doctor Who's [[Doctor Who (series 3)|series 3]] episode \"[[Utopia (Doctor Who)|Utopia]]\".  \n\n====Between related shows====\nThough most common on shows of the same [[production company]] (see, for example, \"[[Hurricane Saturday]]\"), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or [[television network]]. A notable example of this kind of link is that between ''[[Murder, She Wrote]]'' and ''[[Magnum, P.I.]]'' These shows were made by different companies, but owned by [[Universal Studios]] and broadcast on [[CBS]]. Another case is that of ''[[Mad About You]]'' and ''[[Friends]]'', which share the character of [[List of Friends characters#Ursula Buffay|Ursula Buffay]]. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress ([[Lisa Kudrow]]), a setting ([[New York City]]) and a schedule (''Friends'' initially followed ''Mad About You'' on [[NBC]]'s [[Must See TV|Thursday night schedule]]).\n\n''Mad About You'' and ''Friends'' share another type of \"network crossover\". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover \"event\". In one case, a New York City [[Power outage|blackout]] caused by [[Paul Reiser]]'s character on ''Mad About You'' was experienced by the characters on ''Friends'' and ''[[Madman of the People]]''.<ref>[http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml epguides.com listing for ''Pandora's Box'', the episode which kicked off \"Blackout Thursday\" on NBC.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012135515/http://epguides.com/MadAboutYou/season3.shtml |date=2007-10-12 }}</ref> Such \"event nights\" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] attempted this kind of \"event night\" crossover with its [[TGIF (ABC)|Friday night programming]] during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of ''[[Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)|Sabrina the Teenage Witch]]'' should chase her cat, [[Salem Saberhagen|Salem]], through ''[[Boy Meets World]]'', ''[[You Wish (TV series)|You Wish]]'' and ''[[Teen Angel (1997 TV series)|Teen Angel]]'' because it had run away with a \"time ball\" that was displacing each show through time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poobala.com/timeball.html|title=Crossover Event: \"The Time Ball\"|work=poobala.com}}</ref>\n\nABC also attempted a \"crossover\" when four of its sitcoms (''[[Grace Under Fire]]'', ''[[Ellen (TV series)|Ellen]]'', ''[[The Drew Carey Show]]'' and ''[[Coach (TV series)|Coach]]'') all went to [[Las Vegas]] during the 1996\u20131997 season.\n\n[[Dan Schneider (TV producer)|Dan Schneider]] used his show ''[[Zoey 101]]'' to promote his new show ''[[iCarly]]'' by making characters from ''Zoey 101'' go to ''ICarly.com'' or use the song the ''iCarly'' theme song  as a ringtone. A ''[[Henry Danger]]'' comic book and Gibby's wax head is seen in the ''[[Game Shakers]]'' episode \"Lost Jacket, Falling Pigeons\", the subway station's lost and found.\n\n[[The CW]]'s superhero franchise [[Arrowverse]] has held annual [[Arrowverse#Official crossover events|crossover events]] since 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/arrowverse-crisis-infinite-earths-crossover-length/amp/|title=Crisis On Infinite Earths Crossover Event Will Air Over 5 Hours|last=Marshall|first=Andrew|website=[[Screen Rant]]|date=2019-05-16|accessdate=2019-05-17}}</ref>\n\n=====Narrative rationales=====\nOn other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective [[John Munch]] (from NBC's ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'') on Fox's ''The X-Files'' happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on ''The X-Files'' to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series ''[[Law & Order]]'' on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on ''Homicide: Life on the Street''. Later, when ''Homicide'' went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' until October 2013.\n\nA two-part crossover episode between ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'' with ''[[Without a Trace]]'' aired on November 8, 2007. The first hour was on ''CSI'' and the second hour was on ''Without a Trace''.<ref name=\"crossover-1\">{{cite web|url=http://www.csifanatic.com/2007/07/31/a-csi-without-a-trace-crossover|title=A CSI Without a Trace Crossover|work=CSIfanatic.com|accessdate=2007-07-31}}</ref> While both series are on the same network in the United States, spreading two parts of a story across two different shows can cause problems in international markets where they have been separately sold to different broadcasters. For example, in the [[United Kingdom]], ''Without a Trace'' was shown on [[Channel 4]] and ''CSI'' on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], meaning the two companies had to come to a special agreement to show both episodes.<ref name=\"crossover-2\">{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/feb/13/tvratings.television|title=CSI Vegas gamble pays off for Five|work=The Guardian|accessdate=2008-02-12|first=Leigh|last=Holmwood|date=February 13, 2008}}</ref> Another ''CSI'' crossover occurred in 2009 when [[Raymond Langston]] from ''CSI: Crime Scene Investigation'' appeared both in ''[[CSI: Miami]]''<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Bone Voyage| episodelink = Bone Voyage| series = CSI: Miami| serieslink = CSI: Miami| airdate = November 9, 2009| season = 8| number = 7}}</ref> and ''[[CSI: NY]]'',<ref>{{Cite episode| title = Hammer Down| episodelink = Hammer Down| series = CSI: NY| serieslink = CSI: NY| airdate = November 11, 2009| season = 6| number = 7}}</ref> traveling to Miami and New York to track a human trafficking and organ harvesting ring. ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' had a crossover with ''[[Third Watch]]'' which corresponded with a peak in viewership for the latter show, with 17.2 million viewers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22810|title=4 Memorable TV Crossovers|work=Mental Floss|access-date=2009-02-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090221061407/http://www.mentalfloss.com/blogs/archives/22810|archive-date=2009-02-21|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, the Canadian crime drama series ''[[Republic of Doyle]]'' and ''[[Murdoch Mysteries]]'' produced a crossover,<ref name=doylemurdoch>{{cite web|url=http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/|title=Celebrating the Can-combo of Republic of Doyle and Murdoch Mysteries|work=[[National Post]]|date=November 25, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131212035932/http://arts.nationalpost.com/2013/11/25/stinson-celebrating-the-can-combo-of-republic-of-doyle-and-murdoch-mysteries/|archivedate=December 12, 2013}}</ref> which was complicated by the shows' incompatible historical settings; ''Murdoch Mysteries'' is a historical series set in the 1890s, while ''Republic of Doyle'' is set in the present day. The problem was solved by having the actors cross over as ''relatives'' of their primary characters; [[Allan Hawco]] appeared on the November 25, 2013 episode of ''Murdoch Mysteries'' as Jacob Doyle, a 19th-century ancestor of his regular character Jake Doyle, while [[Yannick Bisson]] appeared on a January 2014 episode of ''Republic of Doyle'' as Bill Murdoch, a 21st-century descendant of his regular character William Murdoch.<ref name=doylemurdoch />\n\n=====In children's television=====\nDisney Channel's ''Suite Life'' franchise has featured three crossovers: In 2006, ''[[That's So Suite Life of Hannah Montana]]'' featured characters from ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' and ''[[That's So Raven]]'' taking a vacation at the Tipton Hotel (the main setting of ''[[The Suite Life of Zack & Cody]]''); [[Hannah Montana (character)|Hannah Montana]]/[[Miley Stewart]] ([[Miley Cyrus]]) also eats cake off Zack; this recurs when she eats cake off of Cody during the 2009 crossover ''[[Wizards on Deck with Hannah Montana]]'', in which characters from ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'' and ''Hannah Montana'' come on aboard the S.S. Tipton (though the characters from ''Wizards of Waverly Place'' and ''Hannah Montana'' do not interact). The New Year's special ''[[Austin & Jessie & Ally All Star New Year]]'', which aired in 2013, features characters from ''[[Austin & Ally]]'' and ''[[Jessie (2011 TV series)|Jessie]]''. In 2015 a crossover between two Disney XD shows ''[[Lab Rats: Bionic Island]]'' and ''[[Mighty Med]]'' crossed over in the special \"[[Lab Rats vs. Mighty Med]]\".\n\nAnother type of crossover involves characters from an off-the-air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the [[Nickelodeon]] sitcom ''[[iCarly]]''; the episode \"iStart a Fan War\" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: ''[[Drake & Josh]]'' characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and ''[[Zoey 101]]'' character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between ''[[Victorious]]'' and ''Drake & Josh'' also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by [[Yvette Nicole Brown]] making an appearance. An episode titled \"[[iParty with Victorious]]\" was a crossover between ''iCarly'' and ''Victorious''. This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in ''Who Did It to Trina'', Tori referred to ''Drake and Josh'' as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from ''iCarly'' and ''[[Sam & Cat]]'' (a crossover/spin-off of ''iCarly'' and ''Victorious'') one can see ''Drake and Josh'' and ''Zoey 101'' in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the ''iCarly'' episode ''iGet Pranky'' and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in ''iToe Fat Cakes'' and you can see the character Megan from ''Drake and Josh'' (also portrayed by [[Miranda Cosgrove]]) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in ''#FavoriteShow'' an episode from ''Sam & Cat'', making the universe between each of the shows confusing. However, these were probably all non-canonical references.\n\nIn 2014, ''[[The Thundermans]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Hathaways]]'' did a crossover, called \"The Haunted Thundermans\". In 2016, ''[[Henry Danger]]'' and ''The Thundermans'' did a crossover, called \"Danger & Thunder\". In 2017, ''Henry Danger'' and ''Game Shakers'' did a crossover, called \"Danger Games\", which was then followed by a crossover episode, called \"Babe Loves Danger\", that aired in 2018. In 2017, ''Game Shakers'' did a crossover with ''iCarly'', called \"Game Shippers\".\n\nThe main characters of ''[[Aaahh!!! Real Monsters]]'' make a crossover appearance in the ''[[Rugrats]]'' episode, \"[[Ghost Story (Rugrats)|Ghost Story]]\". This is because both shows were created/produced by [[Klasky Csupo]] and distributed also by Nickelodeon{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}.\n\nIn [[Chile]], children's programs and characters from [[El Mundo del Profesor Rossa]] ([[Spanish Language|Spanish]] for ''The World of Professor Rossa'') and [[Cachureos]] ([[Spanish Language|Chilean Spanish]] for ''odds and ends'') conducted a crossover between them for a few minutes in their emissions of Saturday 18 (Mundo del Profesor Rossa) and Sunday 19 (Cachureos) of April 1998 due the debut of the latter program on [[Canal 13 (Chile)|Canal 13]], after several years of broadcast on [[Televisi\u00f3n Nacional de Chile|TVN]] and even have competed with each other for the child audience.\n\n====Special usages====\n\n=====Promotional cameos=====\nCrossovers can take the form of a promotional [[cameo appearance]], used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode ''[[A Star Is Burns]]'', in which the character of Jay Sherman (from ''[[The Critic]]'') appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before ''The Critic'' began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of ''The Simpsons'' as existing to promote ''The Critic'', an animated series considered inferior by comparison. Even ''Simpsons'' creator [[Matt Groening]] objected, preferring to remove his name from the credits of that particular episode in protest.<ref>[http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html Various reactions, including Matt Groening's, to ''A Star Is Burns''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810215843/http://www.snpp.com/episodes/2F31.html |date=2007-08-10 }}</ref>\n\nThe character Dan Tanna (played by Robert Urich) from the detective series ''[[Vega$]]'' appeared in an episode of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (\"Angels in Vegas\") one week prior to the debut of ''Vega$''. However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna  was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an ''ABC TV Movie of the Week'' on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of ''Vega$'' as an ongoing series. Additionally, the cast of ''[[The Love Boat]]'' appeared in the fourth season premier of ''[[Charlie's Angels]]'' (\"Love Boat Angels\").\n\nIn 2010, as a nod to the 50th anniversary of ''[[Coronation Street]]'', characters in fellow established TV soap ''[[EastEnders]]'' made reference to watching the special anniversary episode.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://menmedia.co.uk/manchestereveningnews/tv_and_showbiz/s/1388625_review_coronation_street_live_drama_was_so_gripping_even_dot_cotton_tuned_in |title=Review: Coronation Street live drama was so gripping, even Dot Cotton tuned in - Manchester Evening News |publisher=Menmedia.co.uk |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2014-01-28}}</ref> EastEnders had celebrated its own 25th anniversary earlier in the same year.\n\nThe two [[CBS Daytime]] game shows (''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]'' and ''[[Let's Make a Deal]]'') are used for promotional cameos from other CBS properties. Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common. ''Price'' has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the ''NCIS'' franchise, the three reality shows, and [[NFL on CBS|CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL]].\n\n====Spin-offs====\n{{See also|List of television spin-offs}}\nIn its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when [[Cliff Huxtable]] of ''[[The Cosby Show]]'' visited his daughter, [[Denise Huxtable|Denise]], on ''[[A Different World (TV series)|A Different World]]''. Another example of this is ''[[The Bionic Woman]]'', which was a spin-off from ''[[The Six Million Dollar Man]]''. [[Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)|Jaime Sommers]] was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a [[Parachuting|skydiving]] accident, but her life was saved by [[Oscar Goldman]] ([[Richard Anderson]]) and Dr. Rudy Wells ([[Martin E. Brooks]]) who surgically implanted her with bionic parts similar to those of [[Steve Austin (fictional character)|Steve Austin]]. Steve Austin and Jaimie Sommers often crossovered, while the characters Oscar Goldman and Rudy Wells appeared regularly in both shows. Another example would be the appearances made by ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' characters to ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' in [[Los Angeles]] from [[Sunnydale]]; in a striking example, \"[[Fool for Love (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Fool for Love]]\" and \"[[Darla (Angel episode)|Darla]]\", shown on the same night, contain overlapping flashbacks as remembered by [[Spike (vampire)|Spike]] and [[Darla (vampire)|Darla]] respectively. There is also ''[[Frasier]]'', which features characters from the first show, ''[[Cheers]]''. Similarly, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' characters [[J. R. Ewing]], [[Bobby Ewing]], [[Lucy Ewing]] and [[Kristin Shepard]] all appeared in its spin-off ''[[Knots Landing]]'' while ''Knots Landing'' characters [[Gary Ewing]] and [[Valene Ewing]] each made several appearances on ''Dallas'' after ''Knots Landing'' premiered.\n\nMore complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the [[Star Trek crossovers|''Star Trek'' universe]], where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the [[Klingon]]s [[Kor (Star Trek)|Kor]] (from the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Original Series]]'' episode \"[[Errand of Mercy]]\"), [[Koloth]] (from \"[[The Trouble with Tribbles]]\") and [[Kang (Star Trek)|Kang]] (from \"[[Day of the Dove]]\"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]] appeared together in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode, \"[[Blood Oath (DS9 episode)|Blood Oath]]\" \u2013 as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, [[Arne Darvin]], appeared as a secondary character in \"The Trouble with Tribbles\", but was the principal villain of DS9's \"[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]\". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, \"Trials and Tribble-ations\" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new [[Chroma key|bluescreen]] techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the ''[[USS Defiant|Defiant]]'', Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to [[Benjamin Sisko|Sisko]] and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with [[James T. Kirk]], [[Spock]] and the rest of the ''[[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|Enterprise]]'' crew.\n\nThe distinction between \"spin-off\" and \"crossover\" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether ''[[Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)|Out of the Blue]]'' is a spin-off of ''[[Happy Days]]'', or whether the star of ''Out of the Blue'' merely crossed over into ''Happy Days''.\n\n''[[Mako: Island of Secrets|Mako Mermaids]]'', a spinoff of ''[[H2O: Just Add Water]]'', featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected.\n\n=====Parodic crossovers=====\nOften, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by [[situation comedies]] that wish to crossover with [[television drama|dramatic television]] programs. The satirical crossover\u2014ranging in length from a cameo to a full [[sketch comedy|comedy sketch]] or episode\u2014is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious [[parody]] or [[Homage (arts)|homage]]. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a [[narrative]] point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program.\n\nSuch [[tongue-in-cheek]] crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.\n* Parodic crossovers can be directly established as being outside the continuity of one or all of the properties being crossed over. A good example is the crossover between ''[[The Simpsons]]'' and ''[[The X-Files]]'', which was largely accepted as being outside standard ''X-Files'' continuity.\n* One episode of ''[[The Grim Adventures of Billy & Mandy]]'' shows that after Mandy smiles, she, along with Billy and Grim, are transformed into [[The Powerpuff Girls]] with a cameo by Professor Utonium.\n* They can occur by virtue of a [[dream sequence]], in which the characters of one show will appear as part of a dream had by a character on another show. This method was perhaps used most famously to explain to audiences that the entirety of ''[[Newhart]]'' had been the dream of [[Bob Newhart]]'s character on ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]''. It has more recently been used to demonstrate that cast members of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' appeared in a dream of a character on ''[[The King of Queens]]''.\n* Parodic crossovers can take the form of \"[[joke|gag]]\" cameos by characters of one property appearing on another. Characters from ''[[King of the Hill (TV series)|King of the Hill]]'' have appeared on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' to comment on a peewee football game. Gag cameos may also include the appearance of an actor from another show, but not necessarily the character that the actor played. For instance, on the ABC/CBS show ''[[Family Matters (TV series)|Family Matters]]'' during the closing credits of the episode \"Scenes From a Mall\" (Season 5, Episode 12), a scene which was shown earlier in the episode featuring [[Reginald VelJohnson]] is re-played, but this time with one of the child actors stating that he \"looks like that fat guy from Fresh Prince,\" referring to [[James L. Avery, Sr.|James Avery]] who played Judge Phillip Banks on NBC's ''[[The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air]]''. To the obvious surprise of the studio audience and VelJohnson, Avery walked onto the set with an angry look, being in on the staged joke himself. Ended the episode (but with the cameras filming still), VelJohnson and Avery hugged and smilingly greeted the public.\n* Crossovers of this type can also be completely wordless. This type of crossover is more common on animated programs, such as when [[Bender (Futurama)|Bender]] found and ate [[Bart Simpson]]'s shorts on ''[[Futurama]]'', or [[Milhouse Van Houten|Milhouse]] had a talking Bender doll on ''The Simpsons''. This would seem to be another case when a popular franchise is acknowledged as fiction and not a crossover of the stories.\n* Perhaps the most obvious parodic crossover is found when characters from two series interact outside ''either'' series. This occurs most commonly on a [[sketch comedy]] show or as a humorous interlude on an award telecast. Such crossovers may sometimes involve the real actors\u2014for example, a sketch on ''[[Royal Canadian Air Farce]]'' saw Yasir and Sarah from ''[[Little Mosque on the Prairie]]'' buying the gas station from ''[[Corner Gas]]'', with many of the characters in the sketch being portrayed by the shows' real actors\u2014although they may also feature one genuine star from the show amid a cast comprised otherwise of the sketch show's own stable of actors. Such crossovers are generally immediately apparent as parodies to the audience\u2014and in no way considered a part of either show's continuity\u2014due to the need for the hosting show to approximate the sets and costumes of the satirized programs quickly and inexpensively. When [[Patrick Stewart]] appeared in a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]''/''[[The Love Boat]]'' crossover on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', for instance, few ''Star Trek'' fans would have been fooled by the visual design into believing the event \"counted\" as an episode of the show. However, there are some cases of this type of parody having some [[canon (fiction)|canonical]] resonance with viewers. For instance, the British charity appeal [[Comic Relief (charity)|Comic Relief]] often contains parodic crossovers of a technically higher quality than the typical sketch show. Many of these ''Relief'' sketches are produced by the cast and crew of the actual programs being parodied, and hence appear to be \"normal\" episodes. A good example of this is the sketch, \"BallyKissDibley\", an 11-minute piece in which the leads of ''[[Ballykissangel]]'' appeared on the sets of  ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'', alongside most of ''Dibley''{{'}}s cast. Since the sketch derived its humor from all actors remaining in character, the extent to which these parodies \"count\" as part of either show's canon is more open to interpretation than most sketch crossovers.\n* Parodic crossovers can be used to lend [[verisimilitude]] to the fictional world of a program. Characters from a fictional television series may appear on a stylized version of an established non-fictional television series, such as [[game show]]s or [[reality show]]s. These crossovers between celebrity hosts and fictional characters are quite common on [[situation comedy|situation comedies]]. ''[[Mama's Family]]'' once appeared on ''[[Family Feud]]'' and the townsfolk of ''The Vicar of Dibley'' have had their [[heirloom]]s valuated on ''[[Antiques Roadshow]]'', for instance. In such cases, it is generally the non-fictional show which ends up being the most satirized, due to a need to compress the experience to its most recognizable elements. However, these crossovers can happen on dramatic television, such as when ''[[Blue Peter]]'' provided [[Exposition (literary technique)|narrative exposition]] on ''[[The Sarah Jane Adventures]]''. Rarely, brief crossovers between two fictional programs can be used for this same purpose. In the episode, \"[[Army of Ghosts]]\", [[Peggy Mitchell]] was seen in a fictionalized scene from ''[[EastEnders]]'' in order to demonstrate the degree to which the titular ghosts had permeated the popular culture of ''[[Doctor Who]]''{{'}}s [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. Here, too, time constraints caused the satire of the guest programme (''EastEnders'') and not the host program (''Doctor Who'').\n\n=====Retroactive crossovers=====\nSometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of [[autism|autistic]] character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous ''other'' crossovers, linkages can be found from ''Elsewhere'' to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called \"the [[Tommy Westphall Universe]]\".{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n==== Tokusatsu for Japan ====\n* ''[[Kamen Rider]]''\n* ''[[Super Sentai]]''\n* ''[[Ultra Series]]''\n* ''[[Metal Hero Series]]''\n* ''[[Chouseishin Series]]''\n\n==== German crossover ====\nOne of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode ''{{Interlanguage link multi|Unter Br\u00fcdern (1990 film)|de|3=Unter Br\u00fcdern (1990)|lt=Unter Br\u00fcdern}}'' (1990), which was produced by [[Westdeutscher Rundfunk|WDR]] and [[Deutscher Fernsehfunk|DFF]] as a crossover between the [[West Germany|West German]] crime series ''[[Tatort]]'' and the [[East Germany|East German]] crime series ''[[Polizeiruf 110]]''. Their respective popular heroes [[Horst Schimanski]] and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the [[Berlin Wall#The fall|fall of the Berlin Wall]]. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the [[German reunification|reunification of Germany]].\n\n==Unofficial crossovers==\nIn contrast with legal crossovers, unofficial crossovers are created solely because of the artistic pleasure derived by its producers. Generally, unofficial crossovers take the form of [[Fanfiction|fan-written fiction]] and [[fan art]], but it is increasingly prevalent in [[fan film|amateur films]] and [[radio drama|audio]]. Whereas official crossovers are frequently stymied by such concerns as copyright, royalties payments, quality of writing and ownership of the characters, unofficial crossovers are unfettered by such concerns, so long as property holders do not exercise their right to [[injunction|enjoin]] the distribution of such material.\n\nA good example would be the unauthorised live action fan film ''[[Batman: Dead End]]'', which brings together the properties of ''Batman'', ''[[Alien (film series)|Alien]]'' and ''[[Predator (film)|Predator]]'' in one setting.\n\nUnofficial crossovers can also occur in a \"what-if\" scenario. [[Roger (American Dad)|Roger]] makes frequent cameo appearances in ''Family Guy'', while [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] makes cameos on ''American Dad!''. Roger, [[Rallo Tubbs]], and [[Klaus Heissler]] were seen in the final ''Family Guy'' ''Star Wars'' spoof, \"[[It's A Trap!]]\", as an Imperial Officer, [[Nien Nunb]], and [[Admiral Ackbar]], respectively. Stewie also appears as an interactive hallucination of Booth on ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]'' when the agent has issues over possibly becoming a sperm donor, with David Boreanaz (who plays Booth) repaying the favor in \"[[Road to the North Pole]]\".\nAn appearance by [[Elmo]], from [[Sesame Street]], was made, in a hallucination of [[Connie Ray]]'s, on TV sitcom [[The Torkelsons]].\nFan fiction fusions between different science fiction movies and series are often created, such as ''Star Wars'' vs. ''Star Trek'' or ''Babylon 5'' vs. ''Stargate''. ''[[M.U.G.E.N.]]'' is a fighting game engine that features many fan-created and fictional characters and stages from various television series, movies, as well as other video games.\n\n==See also==\n{{Div col}}\n* [[Amalgam Comics]]\n* [[Canon (fiction)]]\n* [[Callback (comedy)]]\n* [[Continuity (fiction)]]\n* [[Fanfiction]]\n* [[Fictional character]]\n* [[Fictional universe]]\n* [[Intercompany crossover]]\n* [[Shared universe]]\n** [[List of television spin-offs]]\n* [[Tommy Westphall]]\n* [[Wold Newton family]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.katspace.org/fiction/essays/crossovers/ Thoughts On Crossovers In General (Kathryn Andersen)] An essay musing on the numerous elements necessary to a successful crossover (primarily aimed at fan-written fiction).\n* [http://www.pjfarmer.com/woldnewton/Chron.htm World Newton Universe Crossover Chronology] Crossovers which build upon and take place in Philip Jos\u00e9 Farmer's World Newton continuity.\n* [http://www.whiterose.org/howlingcurmudgeons/archives/008910.html \"On Crossovers\"], [[Jess Nevins]]' history of the fictional crossover\n\n{{Fan fiction}}\n{{Superhero fiction}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Fictional Crossover}}\n[[Category:Crossover fiction| ]]\n[[Category:Television terminology]]\n", "name_user": "Moe1810", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eOfficial crossovers", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossover_(fiction)"}
