As Norman and Rita go on a road trip to pursue leads in the urgent veteran's letter, their trip takes them to the next level of their relationship and leads them to the place they're needed the most. Meanwhile Oliver and Joe go backpacking on a father-son bonding trip during which a serious injury puts both their lives at risk. After Oliver doesn't show up at work, Shane spearheads a rescue mission and calls Oliver's police officer friend Dale to help. When all seems lost, what's most important is found.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

Small numbers inhabit eastern [[Poland]] and the south-eastern part of [[Finland]].<ref>Substantial numbers (possibly several millions) of maghrebis of the former Ottoman colonies in North Africa are of Ottoman Turkish descent. [[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins. The Karakalpaks have a somewhat greater bias towards the eastern markers than the Uzbeks.<ref>''The Karakalpak Gene Pool'' (Spencer Wells, 2001); and discussion and conclusions at www.karakalpak.com/genetics.html</ref>\n\n'''Historical population:'''\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Turks mostly herded [[sheep]], [[goat]]s and [[horse]]s. Dairy was a staple of the nomadic diet and there are many Turkic words for various dairy products such as ''s\u00fct'' (milk), ''yagh'' (butter), [[ayran]], ''[[kaymak|qaymaq]]'' (similar to [[clotted cream]]), [[Kumis|qi\u0305mi\u0305z]] (fermented mare's milk) and ''[[qurut]]'' (dried yoghurt).

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.

Some 170 million people have a Turkic language as their native language;<ref name=distribution>[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_family.asp?subid=90010 Turkic Language family tree] entries provide the information on the Turkic-speaking populations and regions.</ref> an additional 20 million people speak a Turkic language as a [[second language]]. The Turkic language with the greatest number of speakers is [[Turkish language|Turkish proper]], or [[Anatolia]]n Turkish, the speakers of which account for about 40% of all Turkic speakers.<ref name=\"LanguagesOfTheWorld\">{{cite book|title=Languages of the World, Third Edition|last=Katzner|first=Kenneth|author-link=Kenneth Katzner|date=March 2002|publisher=Routledge, an imprint of Taylor & Francis Books Ltd.|isbn=978-0-415-25004-7}}</ref> More than one third of these are ethnic [[Turkish people|Turks of Turkey]], dwelling predominantly in Turkey proper and formerly [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-dominated areas of Southern and Eastern Europe and [[West Asia]]; as well as in Western Europe, Australia and the Americas as a result of immigration. The remainder of the Turkic people are concentrated in Central Asia, Russia, the [[Caucasus]], China, and northern Iraq.\n\n===Alphabet===\nThe Turkic alphabets are sets of related alphabets with letters (formerly known as [[runes]]), used for writing mostly [[Turkic languages]]. Inscriptions in Turkic alphabets were found in [[Mongolia]]. Most of the preserved inscriptions were dated to between 8th and 10th centuries CE.\n\nThe earliest positively dated and read Turkic inscriptions date from c. 150, and the alphabets were generally replaced by the [[Old Uyghur alphabet]] in the [[Central Asia]], Arabic script in the Middle and Western Asia, [[Cyrillic]] in Eastern Europe and in the Balkans, and [[Latin alphabet]] in Central Europe. The latest recorded use of [[Turkic alphabets (disambiguation)|Turkic alphabet]] was recorded in Central Europe's Hungary in 1699 CE.\n\nThe Turkic [[Old Turkic alphabet|runiform]] scripts, unlike other typologically close scripts of the world, do not have a uniform [[palaeography]] as, for example, have the [[Gothic language|Gothic]] runes, noted for the exceptional uniformity of its language and paleography.<ref>Vasiliev D.D. Graphical fund of Turkic runiform writing monuments in Asian areal, \u041c., 1983, p. 44</ref> The Turkic alphabets are divided into four groups, the best known of them is the [[Orkhon script|Orkhon]] version of the Enisei group. The Orkhon script is the alphabet used by the [[G\u00f6kt\u00fcrk]]s from the 8th century to record the [[Old Turkic language]]. It was later used by the [[Uyghur Empire]]; a [[Yenisei]] variant is known from 9th-century [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] inscriptions, and it has likely cousins in the [[Talas Valley]] of [[Turkestan]] and the [[Old Hungarian script]] of the 10th century. [[Irk Bitig]] is the only known complete manuscript text written in the Old Turkic script.<ref name=\"tekin-1993-1\">{{harvnb|Tekin|1993|p=1}}</ref>\n\nThe Turkic language family is traditionally considered to be part of the proposed [[Altaic languages|Altaic language family]].<ref>[http://search.eb.com/eb/article-9073847 Turkic peoples], [[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]], Online Academic Edition, 2008</ref>\n\nThe various Turkic languages are usually considered in geographical groupings: the [[Oghuz languages|Oghuz]] (or Southwestern) languages, the [[Kipchaks|Kypchak]] (or Northwestern) languages, the Eastern languages (like [[Uyghur language|Uygur]]), the Northern languages (like [[Altay language|Altay]] and [[Yakut language|Yakut]]), and one existing [[Oghur languages|Oghur]] language: [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]] (the other Oghur languages, like [[Bulgar language|Volga Bulgarian]], are now extinct). The high mobility and intermixing of Turkic peoples in history makes an exact classification extremely difficult.\n\nThe [[Turkish language]] belongs to the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. It is for the most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include [[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]], [[Gagauz language|Gagauz]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]] and [[Urum language|Urum]], and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.\n\n==Geographical distribution==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2010}}\n[[File:Carte peuples turcs.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Descriptive map of Turkic peoples.]]\n[[File:Map-TurkicLanguages.png|thumb|upright=1.15|Countries and autonomous subdivisions where a Turkic language has official status or is spoken by a majority.]]\n\nWhile the Turkic language and people may have originated in Mongolia,<ref name=\"Blench\"/><ref name=\"Yunusbayev2015\"/> today most of the Turkic peoples today have their homelands in [[Central Asia]],{{source?|date=January 2020}} but can be found as far west as present-day Turkey.{{sfn|Robbeets|2017|p=219}} While the term \"Turk\" may refer to a member of any Turkic people, the term ''Turkish'' usually refers specifically to the people and language of the modern country of Turkey.\n\nAt present, there are six independent Turkic countries: [[Azerbaijan]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Turkey]], [[Uzbekistan]].

Each of these subdivisions has its own flag, parliament, laws, and official state language (in addition to [[Russian language|Russian]]).\n\nThe [[Xinjiang|Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region]] in western China and the autonomous region of [[Gagauzia]], located within eastern [[Moldova]] and bordering Ukraine to the north, are two major autonomous Turkic regions. The [[Crimea|Autonomous Republic of Crimea]] within Ukraine is a home of [[Crimean Tatars]]. In addition, there are several communities found in [[Iraq]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Bulgaria]], the [[Republic of North Macedonia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Afghanistan]], and western [[Mongolia]].\n\n[[Turks in India]] are very small in number. There are barely 150 Turkish people from Turkey in India. These are recent immigrants. Descendants of Turkish rulers also exist in Northern India. Mughals who are part Turkic people also live in India in significant numbers. They are descendants of the Mughal rulers of India. [[Karlugh Turks]] are also found in the Haraza region and in smaller number in Azad Kashmir region of Pakistan. Small amount of Uyghurs are also present in India. Turks also exist in Pakistan in similar proportions. One of the tribe in Hazara region of Pakistan is [[Karlugh Turks]] which is direct descendant of Turks of Central Asia. Turkish influence in Pakistan can be seen through the national language, Urdu, which comes from a Turkish word meaning \"horde\" or \"army\".\n\nThe [[Western Yugur]] at Gansu in China, Salar at Qinghai in China, the [[Dolgan]] at Krasnoyarsk Krai in Russia, and the Nogai at Dagestan in Russia are the Turk minorities in the respective regions.\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Timeline of the Turkic peoples (500\u20131300)|l1=Timeline|Turkic migrations|l2=Turkic expansion|Turkic tribal confederations|l3=Confederations|Nomadic empires|l4=Nomadic empires|Genetic history of East Asians|l5=Genetic history}}\n{{History of the Turks pre-14th century}}\n[[File:East-Hem 500bc.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|left|Eastern Hemisphere in 500 BCE]]\n\n===Origins===\nProposals for the homeland of the Turkic peoples and their language are far-ranging, from the [[Trans-Caspia|Transcaspian steppe]] to [[Northeastern Asia]] ([[Manchuria]]).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=The origin and early dispersal history of the Turkic peoples is disputed, with candidates for their ancient homeland ranging from the Transcaspian steppe to Manchuria in Northeast Asia,|via=}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Yunusbayev, genetic evidence points to an origin in the region near [[South Central Siberia|South Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]] as the \"Inner Asian Homeland\" of the Turkic ethnicity.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yunusbayev|first=Bayazit|last2=Metspalu|first2=Mait|last3=Metspalu|first3=Ene|last4=Valeev|first4=Albert|last5=Litvinov|first5=Sergei|last6=Valiev|first6=Ruslan|last7=Akhmetova|first7=Vita|last8=Balanovska|first8=Elena|last9=Balanovsky|first9=Oleg|date=2015-04-21|title=The Genetic Legacy of the Expansion of Turkic-Speaking Nomads across Eurasia|url=|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=11|issue=4|pages=e1005068|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1005068|issn=1553-7390|pmc=4405460|pmid=25898006|quote=\"Thus, our study provides the first genetic evidence supporting one of the previously hypothesized IAHs to be near Mongolia and South Siberia.\"}}</ref>\n\nSimilarly several linguists, including [[Juha Janhunen]], Roger Blench and Matthew Spriggs, suggest that [[Mongolia]] is the homeland of the early Turkic language.<ref name=\"Blench\">{{Cite book | last =Blench | first =Roger | last2 =Spriggs | first2 =Matthew | date =2003-09-02 | title =Archaeology and Language II: Archaeological Data and Linguistic Hypotheses  | publisher =Routledge | isbn =9781134828692 | language =en | url =https://books.google.at/books?id=48iKiprsRMwC&pg=PA203&lpg=PA203&dq=turkic+languages+homeland+manchuria&source=bl&ots=aFLKmi4LLE&sig=ACfU3U2PXZC76d8E-qvp5xd2V0cNlS58sQ&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjgneOVp8LjAhVjkosKHVGYBUgQ6AEwEnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=turkic%20languages%20homeland%20manchuria&f=false}}</ref> According to Robbeets, proto-Turkic descends from the hypothetical proto-[[Altaic languages|Transeurasian community]].

A small number of Turkic people also live in [[Vilnius]], the capital of [[Lithuania]].

[[Finnish Tatars]]</ref> There are also considerable populations of Turkic people (originating mostly from [[Turkey]]) in [[Germany]], [[United States]], and [[Australia]], largely because of migrations during the 20th century.\n\nSometimes ethnographers group Turkic people into six branches: the [[Oghuz Turks]], [[Kipchaks|Kipchak]], [[Karluks|Karluk]], [[Siberia]]n, [[Chuvash people|Chuvash]], and [[Sakha language|Sakha/Yakut]] branches. The Oghuz have been termed Western Turks, while the remaining five, in such a classificatory scheme, are called Eastern Turks.\n\nThe genetic distances between the different populations of Uzbeks scattered across Uzbekistan is no greater than the distance between many of them and the Karakalpaks. This suggests that Karakalpaks and Uzbeks have very similar origins.

They also used a ''saj'', a griddle that was traditionally placed on stones over a fire, and ''[[skewer|shish]]''. In later times, the Persian [[tava]] was borrowed from the Persians for frying, but traditionally nomadic Turks did most of their cooking using the qazan, saj and shish. Meals were served in a bowl, called a ''chanaq'', and eaten with a knife (''b\u00efchaq'') and spoon (''qashi\u0305q''). Both bowl and spoon were historically made from wood. Other traditional utensils used in food preparation included a thin rolling pin called ''oqlaghu'', a [[colander]] called ''s\u00fczgu\u0305\u00e7h'', and a grinding stone called ''t\u0101girm\u0101n''.<ref name=osfc />\n\nMedieval grain dishes included preparations of whole grains, soups, porridges, breads and pastries. Fried or toasted whole grains were called ''qaw\u00efrmach'', while ''k\u00f6ch\u00e4'' was crushed grain that was cooked with dairy products. ''Salma'' were broad [[noodles]] that could be served with boiled or roasted meat; cut noodles were called ''tutmaj'' in the Middle Ages and are called ''[[kesme]]'' today.<ref name=osfc />\n\nThere are many types of bread doughs in Turkic cuisine. ''[[Yufka|Yupqa]]'' is the thinnest type of dough, ''[[Bawirsaq|bawi\u0305rsaq]]'' is a type of fried bread dough, and ''[[Shelpek|ch\u00e4lp\u00e4k]]'' is a deep fried flat bread. ''[[Qatlama]]'' is a fried bread that may be sprinkled with dried fruit or meat, rolled, and sliced like [[pinwheel sandwiches]]. ''[[Toqach]]'' and ''[[ch\u00f6r\u00e4k]]'' are varieties of bread, and [[B\u00f6rek|b\u00f6r\u00e4k]] is a type of filled pie [[pastry]].<ref name=osfc />\n\nHerd animals were usually slaughtered during the winter months and various types of sausages were prepared to preserve the meats, including a type of sausage called ''[[sujuk]]''. Though prohibited by [[halal|Islamic dietary restrictions]], historically Turkic nomads also had a variety of [[blood sausage]]. One type of sausage, called ''[[Qaz\u0131|qazi\u0305]]'', was made from horsemeat and another variety was filled with a mixture of ground meat, [[offal]] and rice. Chopped meat was called ''q\u00efyma'' and spit-roasted meat was ''s\u00f6kl\u00fcnch''\u2014from the root ''s\u00f6k-'' meaning \"to tear off\", the latter dish is known as [[kebab]] in modern times.
