He was also interested in [[decorative art]], [[design]], [[interior decoration]] and book [[illustration]]. In his lifetime, he produced more than 3,000 works of art.\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBednarik was born in [[Or\u015fova|Orschowa (Or\u015fova)]], at the time part of [[Austria-Hungary]], to [[Czechs of Romania|Czech]] parents; he was son of the second marriage of Adalbert Bednarik (originally from [[Moravia]]) and Genoveva Hauschka, followed by two sisters, Genoveva, and Maria.\n\nWhile a pupil at the Traian High School in [[Drobeta Turnu Severin]], he won first prize for his works in drawing at the ''Tinerimea Rom\u00e2n\u0103'' society.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1900, Bednarik studied at the [[Bucharest]] School of Fine Arts under the sculptor and water-colourist, [[Ion Georgescu]]. In 1901, he went to [[Vienna]] where he occasionally attended classes at the [[Academy of Fine Arts Vienna|Academy of Fine Arts]]; Bednarik preferred instead to study masterpieces in the collections of the [[Kunsthistorisches Museum]] and the [[Albertina, Vienna|Albertina]].\n\nIn 1909, he married Elena Alexandrina Baraba\u015f, also a graduate of the Bucharest School of Fine Arts. Together they left for [[Munich]] to study at the [[Academy of Fine Arts, Munich|Royal School of Applied Art]], at a time when the city was a dynamic international cultural centre, brimming with new ideas, in particular the influence of the [[Jugendstil]] aesthetic.\n\n=== Symbolism ===\nThe Bednariks made their debut in 1910, in [[Paris]], at the [[Salon d'Automne]] held in the [[Grand Palais]]. They returned to Bucharest in the same year. Ignat Bednarik exhibited for the first time in Romania in 1913 with ''Associa\u0163ia Artistic\u0103''; he subsequently took part in official salons and opened his first individual exhibition in Bucharest in 1915.<ref>Gemaldeasstellung \u201eBednarik - Sofronie\u201d \u00een Rumanischer Lloyd, XXXII (1915), nr. 8507, decembrie 22, p. 2</ref>\n\nHis works of this period brought the influence of European [[Symbolism (arts)|symbolism]] to Romania at the same time as [[Alexandru Macedonski]] was exploring similar ideas in poetry.<ref>Olimp Grigore Ioan: \u201eLe C\u00e9nacle id\u00e9aliste\u201d/\u201eCenaclul Idealist\u201d/\u201eIdealistic Literary Club\u201d \u00een L\u2019Indep\u00e9ndence Roumaine\u201d, 38 (1915), nr. 12236, nov. 30/ dec. 13, p. 2.\n</ref> The longing for evasion, a favourite concern of symbolists, shows itself in a variety of ways in his work. A symbolic interpretation of reality, seen through the world of myths, is found in works like ''Saved'', while the interdependence of heaven and earth is explored in ''When the Gods Came Down to Earth'' and a demythologising of fiction is attempted in ''End of the Legend'' (all 1915). The need for escape, the longing for the absolute and the desire to recreate reality in an ideal dimension can also be seen in ''Towards glory'' (1915), ''The Spirit Triumphs'' (1916), ''Excelsior'', ''The Paths of Life'' (1922) and ''\u00c6ternum Vale!''.\n\nThe escape into the world of legends and ancient ballads (for example, ''[[Me\u015fterul Manole]]'') demonstrates Bednarik's debt to [[Romanian folklore|Romanian folk-tales]], seen particularly well in his series of illustrations for [[Petre Ispirescu]]'s ''Tales of the Romanians'' (1925\u20131926).\n\nNotes of nostalgia and reverie also permeate his portrait-compositions ''Ioana'' (1920), ''The Letter'' (1921) and ''Portrait of Mrs. M. Tomescu'' (1923), while his treatment of philosophical subjects, such as ''Towards the [[Styx (mythology)|Styx]]'' (1916), ''The Enigma of Life'' (1919), ''[[Chimera (mythology)|Chimera]]'', or ''[[To be, or not to be|To Be or Not To Be]]'' (1922), is imbued with an air of symbolic mystery.\n\nAnother kind of symbolic escape is found in the realm of fine sensations, of correspondences. The theme of music often appears in Bednarik's work, for example ''Young Girl Playing the Violin'' (1915), ''At the Piano'' (1922) and ''Playing the Violin'' (1922). Bednarik often associates music with flowers which decorate the interior where the former is being produced; at times they are so faintly sketched on the canvas as to be almost invisible (another symbolist trait). Flowers are often present in portraits of children (''Mother's Birthday'') and almost always in paintings of female figures (a favourite association of [[Art Nouveau]] artists), for example in ''Portrait of the Artist's Wife'' (1919), ''Portrait of a Young Girl'' (1925), or ''Portrait of Miss J.P.'' (1924). They are also seen in his interiors with nudes painted in 1921. The flower symbolism is enhanced by the choice of the blossom which accompanies the female figure. Mastering the delicate transparency of watercolour, Bednarik surrounds his sitters sometimes with lilies, but more often with roses or peonies. In his next period, from 1919 to 1928, the still life with flowers became one of his favourite subjects.<ref>Temele simboliste, p.10-13, Album Ignat Bednarik, Editura Meridiane, 1987, autor Beatrice Bednarik</ref>\n\nThe novelty of his work lies in its symbolist conception as well as the atmosphere of deep philosophical contemplation, transposed through watercolour, which imbues his painting with such distinctive individuality.\n\n=== Later work ===\nThe violence of [[World War I]] brought an abrupt halt to his heady and coloured symbolist compositions. As a member of the ''War Team of Artists and Sculptors''<ref>Petru Comarnescu, \u201ePictorul Bednarik\u201d/\u201ePainter Bednarik\u201d, Arta Plastic\u0103 IX (1962), nr/no.4, page.44.</ref> set up in [[Ia\u015fi]] by [[Marie of Edinburgh|Queen Marie]], during the time when Bucharest was [[Romanian Campaign (World War I)|occupied by German forces]], Bednarik employed all his graphic skill in vigorous depictions of conflict and hardships.\n\nBetween 1915 and 1927, Bednarik held eight individual watercolour exhibitions in Bucharest and, in 1928, one in [[New York City]].<ref>The Art Center 65-67 East 56th Street, An Exhibition of Paintings and Water Colors by Oscar Schmidt, Ignatz Bednarik and Edward Nagel. Shown under the patronage of the Royal Rumanian Legation. October 16 to November 6, 1928</ref> He also executed a series of works which were designed as an overlook of typical scenes from Romanian daily life. Towards 1947, partially recovering his sight after a period of almost total blindness, he painted a number of canvases depicting characters from old Bucharest, or scenes from [[History of Romania|Romanian history]] (''The Execution of [[Gheorghe Doja]]'', 1954). In 1956, a retrospective of the work of Ignat Bednarik was organised in Bucharest by the Union of Artists.<ref>Catalogul Expozi\u021biei retrospective de acuarel\u0103 \u0219i desen I.

He died two years later.\n\n== Legacy ==\nToday, his works can be seen in collections and museums both in Romania and abroad, such as in the [[National Museum of Art of Romania]], Military Museum, and [[National Museum of Romanian History]], the Bucharest City Museum of History and Art, the library of the [[Romanian Academy]], the [[Brukenthal Museum]] in [[Sibiu]]; also in the [[Albertina (Vienna)|Albertina Collection]] in [[Vienna]] and in private collections in Europe, the Americas and the Middle East.<ref>Beatrice Bednarik, Ignat Bednarik Album, Meridiane Publishing House, Bucharest 1987, p.5</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography ==\n* Beatrice Bednarik, Ignat Bednarik Album, Meridiane Publishing House, Bucharest 1987 \n* Beatrice Bednarik -\u201cIgnat Bednarik, pictor \u0219i ilustrator al reginei Maria\u201d - Revista Academica, Nr. 56-57 (193-194), Anul XVII, Noiembrie-Decembrie 2006\n* Catalogul Expozi\u021biei retrospective de acuarel\u0103 \u0219i desen I.

He also clashed with Bush on his [[2002 United States steel tariff|steel tariffs]] as well as actions against [[Cuba]].<ref name=\"Bloo-20180420\">{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Simon |last1=Murray |first1=Brendan |title=Paul O\u2019Neill, Former Treasury Chief and Alcoa CEO, Dies at 84 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-04-18/paul-o-neill-former-treasury-chief-who-ran-alcoa-dies-at-84 |accessdate=April 18, 2020 |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=April 19, 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nO'Neill also helped [[Turkey]], [[Argentina]] and [[Brazil]] in receiving loans from [[International Monetary Fund]] but opposed more financial assistance. His cavalcade was once attacked with eggs during a visit to Argentina because of him stating the country had \u201cno industry to speak of.\u201d He however also encouraged governments to increase grants by [[World Bank]] and cracking down on monetary support of terrorism. In May 2002, he visited Africa with [[Bono]] to draw attention to the continent's poor. During his tenure, he was known for his outspokeness which would eventually cost him job in December 2002.<ref name=\"Bloo-20180420\"/>\n\n[[Ron Suskind]] interviewed O'Neill extensively about his tenure in the Bush Administration. He was also given access to a large amount of documentation. In 2004 he produced the book ''[[The Price of Loyalty]]'', detailing O'Neill's tenure in the Bush Administration.<ref>''The Price of Loyalty: George W. Bush, the White House, and the Education of Paul O'Neill'' ({{ISBN|0-7432-5545-3}}) 2004</ref> The book describes many of the conflicts that O'Neill had with the Bush administration. The book also details O'Neill's criticisms of some of Bush's economic policies. O'Neill claims that Bush appeared somewhat unquestioning and uncurious, and that the war in [[Iraq]] was planned from the first [[United States National Security Council|National Security Council]] meeting, soon after the administration took office. At the first cabinet meeting of the new Bush administration, O'Neill observed that the debate was not \"should we attack Iraq?\" but rather \"how do we go about attacking Iraq?\" O'Neill viewed this as a violation of earlier guarantees that (then-presidential candidate) Bush would refrain from [[Nation-building|nation building]] endeavors during his time in office.<ref>[https://www.salon.com/2006/06/20/911pdb/ Ron Suskind, George W.
