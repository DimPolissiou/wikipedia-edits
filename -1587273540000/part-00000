Several tornadoes were responsible for prompting [[tornado emergency|tornado emergencies]], including the first one to be issued by the [[National Weather Service]] in Charleston, South Carolina. A large [[squall line]] formed and tracked through the [[Mid-Atlantic (United States)|mid-Atlantic]] on April 13, prompting more [[tornado warning]]s and [[Tornado watch|watches]]. Fifteen total watches were produced during the course of the event, two of which were designated [[Particularly Dangerous Situation]]s.\n\nThroughout the two-day outbreak 132&nbsp;tornadoes touched down across 10&nbsp;states, inflicting widespread and locally catastrophic damage. Fourteen of these tornadoes reached EF3 or EF4 intensity. The strongest of these occurred in southern Mississippi, producing estimated winds of {{convert|190|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and reaching a width of {{convert|2.25|mi|km|abbr=on}}; eight people were killed by this tornado. With a total of 32 tornado related fatalities, this was the deadliest outbreak since the [[tornado outbreak of April 27\u201330, 2014]]. To assist with recovery efforts, governors of five states declared a [[state of emergency]].

One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted. Near Tynes Ainsworth Road, a mobile home was tossed and completely destroyed; both occupants died.

One home was properly constructed while the other lacked proper anchor bolts. Based on this, engineers and forensic surveyors concluded the damage was of EF4 intensity. Continuing northeast, the tornado snapped or uprooted nearly every tree in its path. Around East Sartinville Road, the tornado rolled a strapped-down mobile home and tore the roof off a brick home. Crossing into Lawrence County, it caused extensive tree damage with numerous hardwood and softwood trees snapped or uprooted.
