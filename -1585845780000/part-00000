In 2014, in the wake of increasing competition from e-commerce market, Staples began to close some of its locations. In 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire [[Office Depot]] and [[OfficeMax]]. However, the purchase was blocked under antitrust grounds due to the consolidation that would result.\n\nAfter the failed acquisition, Staples began to refocus its operations to downplay its [[brick-and-mortar]] outlets, and place more prominence on its B2B supply business. In 2017, after its sale to [[Sycamore Partners]], the company was effectively split into three \"independently managed and capitalized\" entities sharing the Staples name, separating its U.S. and [[Staples Canada|Canadian]] retail operations from the B2B business.\n\n==History==\nStaples was founded by [[Leo Kahn (entrepreneur)|Leo Kahn]] and [[Thomas G.

He needed a ribbon for his printer, but was unable to obtain one because his local dealer was closed for the [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] holiday.

While many products can be produced in-store, larger, more complex jobs, or jobs requiring special materials such as PVC signs are routed to production facilities in various locations through the country.\n\nMost locations have a limited service [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] shipping center offering air and ground services, ([[DHL Express|DHL]] in the United Kingdom stores; and [[FedEx]], [[Purolator Courier|Purolator]] in the Canadian stores), which is open during store hours. International shipping is only offered to Canada and Mexico from retail stores in the US. UPS services in US-based stores are not capable of handling AT&T or Dish Network returns with a label or QR codes from Amazon returns.\n\nIn Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate on a 24-hour basis and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy & Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as 'Instant Business Cards' customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Print & Marketing Stores (currently there are four [[New York City]] locations, and one in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]) where Print & Marketing Services is a brand of Staples.\n\n===Tech services===\nSome stores also feature Staples Tech Services (formerly EasyTech) an in-store and on-site service for [[Computer repair technician|PC repair]], PC upgrades, home and office [[computer network|networking]] setup, and PC tutorials.\n\nStarting in November 2005, Staples began a test called \"Heavy Up\" primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as \"Double Up\" was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with [[Best Buy]]'s [[Geek Squad]] and [[Circuit City]]'s Fire dog.\n\nBeginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the \"Easy Resident Tech\" program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours.\n\nOn January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the \"Easy Mobile Tech\" name with plans to install an 11' x 17' kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray \"Easy Tech\" polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores.\n\nBeginning in July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as \"EasyTechs\". Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green \"EasyTech\" emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company's new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main \"EasyTech\" who performs most of the more complex tasks.\n\nBeginning in November 2008, eleven concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known within the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as \"Tech Advisors\" and \"Solutions Advisors\". The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup.\n\nThese concept stores are mainly based in [[New Hampshire]], with stores in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]], [[West Lebanon, New Hampshire|West Lebanon]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. Some stores with this new concept also opened in [[Massachusetts]], including the [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]] store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech's services, including the [[Newington, Connecticut]], and [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] store.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n*[[Stationery]]\n*[[Staples (Canada)]], known as Bureau en Gros in [[Qu\u00e9bec]].\n*[[Winc]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dalkir, S. and F.

In 2014, in the wake of increasing competition from e-commerce market, Staples began to close some of its locations. In 2015, Staples announced its intent to acquire [[Office Depot]] and [[OfficeMax]]. However, the purchase was blocked under antitrust grounds due to the consolidation that would result.\n\nAfter the failed acquisition, Staples began to refocus its operations to downplay its [[brick-and-mortar]] outlets, and place more prominence on its B2B supply business. In 2017, after its sale to [[Sycamore Partners]], the company was effectively split into three \"independently managed and capitalized\" entities sharing the Staples name, separating its U.S. and [[Staples Canada|Canadian]] retail operations from the B2B business.\n\n==History==\nStaples was founded by [[Leo Kahn (entrepreneur)|Leo Kahn]] and [[Thomas G.

While many products can be produced in-store, larger, more complex jobs, or jobs requiring special materials such as PVC signs are routed to production facilities in various locations through the country.\n\nMost locations have a limited service [[United Parcel Service|UPS]] shipping center offering air and ground services, ([[DHL Express|DHL]] in the United Kingdom stores; and [[FedEx]], [[Purolator Courier|Purolator]] in the Canadian stores), which is open during store hours. International shipping is only offered to Canada and Mexico from retail stores in the US. UPS services in US-based stores are not capable of handling AT&T or Dish Network returns with a label or QR codes from Amazon returns.\n\nIn Canada, most web submission jobs and larger orders, including business cards, posters and books are produced in central production facility in each region. The production facilities operate on a 24-hour basis and orders are shipped to most of the stores within its regions within a day. The regions in Canada are BC/Yukon, Alberta/NWT, Saskatchewan, Ontario, Quebec, and Maritime. The Copy & Print Center was also the first Print Center to offer custom business cards printed in store. Known as 'Instant Business Cards' customers are able to have custom business cards in a matter of hours. Staples also operates stand-alone Print & Marketing Stores (currently there are four [[New York City]] locations, and one in [[Salem, Massachusetts]]) where Print & Marketing Services is a brand of Staples.\n\n===Tech services===\nSome stores also feature Staples Tech Services (formerly EasyTech) an in-store and on-site service for [[Computer repair technician|PC repair]], PC upgrades, home and office [[computer network|networking]] setup, and PC tutorials.\n\nStarting in November 2005, Staples began a test called \"Heavy Up\" primarily using stores in New York state to experiment with the expansion of the offerings by the Staples Tech Center. A subsequent test known as \"Double Up\" was planned for an unspecified test market and was scheduled to begin the first half of 2006. The tests ran to promote competition with [[Best Buy]]'s [[Geek Squad]] and [[Circuit City]]'s Fire dog.\n\nBeginning in early 2006, Staples also launched the \"Easy Resident Tech\" program, employing one to two resident computer repair technicians to do in-store repair during normal business hours.\n\nOn January 30, 2007, Staples launched Staples EasyTech. The launch rebranded the \"Easy Mobile Tech\" name with plans to install an 11' x 17' kiosk in every store. The kiosk may vary from store to store depending on its size and volume. Most kiosks take up part of the Customer Service desk. Within the kiosk, Easy Resident Techs offered repair service as well as sold products. These technicians wore gray \"Easy Tech\" polo shirts to distinguish them from regular Staples workers. While there was typically one tech per store, a second tech may have been employed for high-volume stores.\n\nBeginning in July 2008, Staples launched a new program labeling all technology workers as \"EasyTechs\". Under the new guidelines all technology workers are required to have the skills necessary to perform basic services such as memory installation and PC configuration. In addition, all technology workers wear black polo shirts with green \"EasyTech\" emblems to set them apart from other store workers. The change was due to the company's new focus on services, allowing more customers to be assisted in less time. Most stores will still have a main \"EasyTech\" who performs most of the more complex tasks.\n\nBeginning in November 2008, eleven concept stores featuring a broader array of small business technology services were launched, which are known within the company as Best Tech stores. EasyTechs and sales workers were now referred to as \"Tech Advisors\" and \"Solutions Advisors\". The concept stores carry many more technology related products such as digital signage, small business servers, NAS (Network Attached Storage), and business networking. Staples also partnered with an on demand IT service provider, with such services as network monitoring, advanced network configurations, and server setup.\n\nThese concept stores are mainly based in [[New Hampshire]], with stores in [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Seabrook, New Hampshire|Seabrook]], [[West Lebanon, New Hampshire|West Lebanon]], [[Dover, New Hampshire|Dover]] and [[Concord, New Hampshire|Concord]]. Some stores with this new concept also opened in [[Massachusetts]], including the [[Auburn, Massachusetts|Auburn]] store. Other existing stores have been renovated to include Best Tech's services, including the [[Newington, Connecticut]], and [[Natick, Massachusetts|Natick]] store.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n*[[Stationery]]\n*[[Staples (Canada)]], known as Bureau en Gros in [[Qu\u00e9bec]].\n*[[Winc]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Dalkir, S. and F.

The terrestrial juvenile phase is called an '''eft'''. Unlike other members of the family [[Salamandridae]], newts are [[List of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]], alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. More than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts [[metamorphose]] through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic [[larva]], terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have [[lizard]]-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats.\n\nNewts are threatened by [[habitat loss]], [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and [[pollution]]. Several species are endangered, and at least one species, the [[Yunnan lake newt]], has gone [[extinct]] recently.\n\n==Etymology==\n\n[[File:Pleurodeles waltl BUD.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two grey newts, taken from the front, under water, presumably in an aquarium|''[[Pleurodeles]]'', including the [[Iberian ribbed newt]], is the type genus of subfamily Pleurodelinae.]]\n\nThe [[Old English]] name of the animal was ''efte'', ''efeta'' (of unknown origin), resulting in [[Middle English]] ''eft'';\nthis word was transformed irregularly into ''euft'', ''evete'', or ''ewt(e)''.

After courtship rituals of varying complexity, which take place in ponds or slow-moving streams, the male newt transfers a [[spermatophore]], which is taken up by the female. Fertilized eggs are laid singly and are usually attached to aquatic plants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This distinguishes them from the free-floating eggs of [[frog]]s or [[toad]]s, which are laid in clumps or in strings. Plant leaves are usually folded over and attached to the eggs to protect them.

After hatching, they eat algae, small invertebrates, or other amphibian larvae.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDuring the subsequent few months, the larvae undergo [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], during which they develop legs, and the gills are absorbed and replaced by air-breathing lungs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/Al-As/Amphibians.html |title=Amphibians - body, used, water, process, Earth, life, characteristics, form, animals, oxygen, air, plant, change, History, Characteristics, Life cycle, Three major groupings |publisher=Scienceclarified.com |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Some species, such as the North American newts, also become more brightly coloured during this phase.

The terrestrial juvenile phase is called an '''eft'''. Unlike other members of the family [[Salamandridae]], newts are [[List of semiaquatic tetrapods|semiaquatic]], alternating between aquatic and terrestrial habitats. Not all aquatic salamanders are considered newts, however. More than 100 known species of newts are found in North America, Europe, North Africa and Asia. Newts [[metamorphose]] through three distinct developmental life stages: aquatic [[larva]], terrestrial juvenile (eft), and adult. Adult newts have [[lizard]]-like bodies and return to the water every year to breed, otherwise living in humid, cover-rich land habitats. \n\nNewts are threatened by [[habitat loss]], [[habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] and [[pollution]].

After courtship rituals of varying complexity, which take place in ponds or slow-moving streams, the male newt transfers a [[spermatophore]], which is taken up by the female. Fertilized eggs are laid singly and are usually attached to aquatic plants.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} This distinguishes them from the free-floating eggs of [[frog]]s or [[toad]]s, which are laid in clumps or in strings. Plant leaves are usually folded over and attached to the eggs to protect them. The [[larvae]], which resemble fish [[Spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] but are distinguished by their feathery external gills, hatch out in about three weeks. After hatching, they eat algae, small invertebrates, or other amphibian larvae.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\nDuring the subsequent few months, the larvae undergo [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]], during which they develop legs, and the gills are absorbed and replaced by air-breathing lungs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.scienceclarified.com/Al-As/Amphibians.html |title=Amphibians - body, used, water, process, Earth, life, characteristics, form, animals, oxygen, air, plant, change, History, Characteristics, Life cycle, Three major groupings |publisher=Scienceclarified.com |date=2009-10-13 |accessdate=2013-06-06}}</ref> Some species, such as the North American newts, also become more brightly coloured during this phase.

Under the direction of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]] were conducted from 1853 through 1855. These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes. A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the [[American West]], covering at least {{convert|400000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}. It included the region's natural history and illustrations of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_RR_Surveys/ \"Reports of Explorations and Surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, made under the direction of the Secretary of War, in 1853-4.\"] 12 Volumes.

The survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the [[Gila River]] boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert, through the future territories of [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]] and [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]]. This in part motivated the United States to complete the [[Gadsden Purchase]].<ref>Woodward, C. Vann \"Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction\".

(Ed) \"The American Congress: The Building of Democracy\". Kerr, K. Austin, Chapter 17: ''Railroad Policy'' (pp. 286-297). New York: Houghton Mifflin Co. (2004). p. 288</ref> Three routes were considered:\n\n* A northern route roughly along the Missouri River through present-day northern [[Montana]] to [[Oregon Territory]]. This was considered impractical due to the rough terrain and extensive winter snows.<ref group=N>Later, the '''[[Northern Pacific Railway]]''' (NP) found and built a better route across the northern tier of the western United States from Minnesota to the Pacific Coast. It was approved by Congress in 1864 and given nearly 40 million acres (160,000km<sup>2</sup>) of land grants, which it used to raise money in Europe. Construction began in 1870 and the main line opened all the way from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] on September 8, 1883.</ref>\n* A central route following the [[Platte River]] in [[Nebraska]] through to the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in [[Wyoming]], following most of the [[Oregon Trail]]. Snow on this route remained a concern.\n* A southern route across [[Texas]], [[New Mexico Territory]], the [[Sonora desert]], connecting to [[Los Angeles]], California. Surveyors found during an 1848 survey that the best route lay south of the border between the United States and Mexico. This was resolved by the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/gadsden-purchase Gadsden Purchase, 1853\u20131854] U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian.</ref><ref group=N>The southern route was constructed in 1880 when the Southern Pacific Railroad crossed Arizona territory.</ref>\n\nOnce the central route was chosen, it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento.  But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus. Three locations along {{convert|250|mi|km}} of Missouri River were considered:\n\n* [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], accessed via the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]].\n* [[Kansas City, Kansas]] / [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] accessed via the [[Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad]], controlled by [[Thomas Ewing Jr.]] and later by [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]].\n* [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] / [[Omaha, Nebraska]], accessed via an extension of Union Pacific financier [[Thomas C. Durant]]'s proposed [[Mississippi and Missouri Railroad]] and the new [[Union Pacific Railroad]], also controlled by Durant.\n\nCouncil Bluffs had several advantages: It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement. Durant had hired the future president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri. Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus, and he relied on Durant's counsel. Durant advocated for Omaha, and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Key individuals ==\n[[File:Leland Stanford and CPRR Officers 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|Leland Stanford and the officers of the CPRR in 1870]]\n\n=== Asa Whitney ===\nOne of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was [[Asa Whitney]]. He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California, paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route. Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians, printed maps and pamphlets, and submitted several proposals to [[United States Congress|Congress]], all at his own expense. In June 1845, he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility.<ref>Whitney, Asa \"A project for a railroad to the Pacific\". New York: George W. Wood (1849) p. 55</ref>\n\nLegislation to begin construction of the ''Pacific Railroad'' (called the ''Memorial of Asa Whitney'') was first introduced to Congress by Representative [[Zadock Pratt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/e_early.html|title=PBS American Experience \u2013 Transcontinental Railroad \u2013 Whitney Biography|publisher=}}</ref> Congress did not immediately act on Whitney's proposal.\n\n=== Theodore Judah ===\n{{Main|Theodore Judah}}\n\n[[File:CPRR Chief Engineer Theodore D.

Clement, Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track]]\n\n[[Theodore Judah]] was a fervent supporter of the central route railroad. He lobbied vigorously in favor of the project and undertook the survey of the route through the rugged Sierra Nevada, one of the chief obstacles of the project.\n\nIn 1852, Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed [[Sacramento Valley Railroad (1852-1877)|Sacramento Valley Railroad]], the first railroad built west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around [[Placerville, California]] were depleted, Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the [[Great Basin]] and hook up with rail lines coming from the East.<ref>Markham, Edwin \"The Romance of the 'C.P.' \" SUCCESS (magazine). New York: The Success Company, Vol. VI, Number 106, March, 1903. pp. 127-130</ref>\n\nIn 1856, Judah wrote a 13,000-word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries, congressmen and other influential people. In September 1859, Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention, which indeed approved his plan to survey, finance and engineer the road. Judah returned to Washington in December 1859. He had a lobbying office in the [[United States Capitol]], received an audience with President [[James Buchanan]], and represented the Convention before Congress.<ref name=\"judah\">\"A Memorial and Biographical History of Northern California: Illustrated.

In mid-1860, local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road, which he realized would also suit a railroad. He described his discovery in a letter to Judah. Together, they formed an association to solicit subscriptions from local merchants and businessmen to support their proposed railroad.<ref name=\"judah\"/>\n\nFrom January or February 1861 until July, Judah and Strong led a 10-person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and [[Emigrant Gap]], over [[Donner Pass]], and south to [[Truckee, California|Truckee]]. They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad, although it still needed a lot of work.<ref name=\"judah\"/>\n\n=== The Big Four ===\n: ''Main articles: [[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]'' ''and [[Central Pacific Railroad]]''\n\n[[File:Leland Stanford Governor.jpg|thumb|upright|Leland Stanford's official gubernatorial portrait]]\n\nFour northern California businessmen formed the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]: [[Leland Stanford]], (1824&ndash;1893),  President; [[Collis Potter Huntington]], (1821&ndash;1900),  Vice President; [[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]], (1813&ndash;1878), Treasurer; [[Charles Crocker]], (1822&ndash;1888),   Construction Supervisor.

After the southern states seceded from the Union, the House of Representatives approved the bill on May 6, 1862, and the Senate on June 20. Lincoln signed the [[Pacific Railway Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]] into law on July 1. It authorized creation of two companies, the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] in the west and the [[Union Pacific]] in the mid-west, to build the railroad.

This incentive encouraged thousands of settlers to move west.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Railroad self-dealing ===\nThe federal legislation lacked adequate oversight and accountability. The two companies took advantage of these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves. Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government, the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months, possibly years. They determined to make a profit on the construction itself. Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project, and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures. This self-dealing allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies. In the west, the four men heading the Central Pacific chose a simple name for their company, the \"Contract and Finance Company.\" In the east, the Union Pacific selected a foreign name, calling their construction firm \"Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier of America.\"<ref name=\"klein\"/> The latter company was later implicated in a far-reaching scandal, described later.\n\nAlso, the lack of federal oversight provided both companies with incentives to continue building their railroads past one other, since they were each being paid, and receiving land grants, based on how many miles of track they laid, even though only one track would eventually be used. This tacitly-agreed profiteering activity was captured (probably accidentally) by Union Pacific photographer [[Andrew J.

The Central Pacific hired some Canadian and British civil engineers and surveyors with extensive experience building railroads, but it had a difficult time finding semi-skilled labor. Most Caucasians in California preferred to work in the mines or agriculture. \n\nThe railroad experimented by hiring local emigrant Chinese as manual laborers, many of whom were escaping the poverty and terrors of the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. When they proved themselves as workers, the [[Central_Pacific_Railroad|CPRR]] from that point forward preferred to hire Chinese, and even set up recruiting efforts in [[Guangdong|Canton]].<ref name=\"Kraus Chinese 1969\"/> Despite their small stature<ref>Reef, Catherine \"Working in America\", p. 79.

''Harper's Weekly'' December 7, 1867]]\n\n=== Construction begun ===\nThe Central Pacific broke ground on January 8, 1863. Due to the lack of transportation alternatives from the manufacturing centers on the east coast, virtually all of their tools and machinery including rails, [[railroad switch]]es, [[railroad turntable]]s, [[railroad car|freight]] and passenger cars, and [[steam locomotive]]s were transported first by train to east coast ports. They were then loaded on ships which either sailed around South America's [[Cape Horn]], or offloaded the cargo at the [[Isthmus of Panama]], where it was sent across via [[paddle steamer]] and the [[Panama Railroad]]. The Panama Railroad gauge was {{convert|5|ft|mm|0}}, which was incompatible with the {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm|adj=on}} gauge used by the CPRR equipment. The latter route was about twice as expensive per pound.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Once the machinery and tools reached the [[San Francisco Bay]] area, they were put aboard river paddle steamers which transported them up the final {{convert|130|mi|km}} of the [[Sacramento River]] to the new state capital in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. Many of these steam engines, railroad cars, and other machinery were shipped dismantled and had to be reassembled.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Wooden timbers for railroad ties, trestles, bridges, firewood, and telegraph poles were harvested in California and transported to the project site.\n\nThe Union Pacific Railroad did not start construction for another 18 months until July 1865. They were delayed by difficulties obtaining financial backing and the unavailability of workers and materials due to the Civil War. Their start point in the new city of [[Omaha, Nebraska]] was not yet connected via railroad to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. Equipment needed to begin work was initially delivered to Omaha and Council Bluffs by paddle steamers on the [[Missouri River]]. The Union Pacific was so slow in beginning construction during 1865 that they sold two of the four steam locomotives they had purchased.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfter the [[U.S. Civil War]] ended in 1865, the Union Pacific still competed for railroad supplies with companies who were building or repairing railroads in the south, and prices rose.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Rail standards ===\n[[File:First Day Cover Sc922 75th Anniversary First Transcontinental Railroad May 10, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|First Day Cover for the 75th Anniversary of the Driving of the Last Spike (May 10, 1944)]]\nAt that time in the United States, there were two primary standards for track gauge, as defined by the distance between the two rails. In Britain, the [[standard gauge]] was {{Track gauge|ussg}}, and this had been adopted by the majority of northern railways. But much of the south had adopted a {{Track gauge|5ft|lk=on}} gauge. Transferring railway cars across a [[break of gauge]] required changing out the [[Bogie|trucks]]. Alternatively, cargo was offloaded and reloaded, a time-consuming effort that delayed cargo shipments. For the transcontinental railroad, the builders adopted the British standard, what is now called [[standard gauge]].<ref name=\"daspit\">{{cite web|last1=Daspit|first1=Tom|title=The Days They Changed the Gauge|url=http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1966/66-8/gauge.html|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bessemer process]] and [[open hearth furnace]] steel-making were in use by 1865, but the advantages of steel rails which lasted much longer than iron rails had not yet been demonstrated.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The [[Rail profile|rails]] used initially in building the rail way were nearly all made of an [[iron]] flat-bottomed modified [[I-beam]] profile weighing {{convert|56|lb/yd|kg/m|1}} or {{convert|66|lb/yd|kg/m|1}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  The railroad companies were intent on completing the project as rapidly as possible at a minimum cost. Within a few years, nearly all railroads converted to [[Rail profile|steel rails]].\n\n=== Time zones and telegraph usage ===\nTime was not standardized across the United States and Canada until November 18, 1883. In 1865, each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors. To communicate easily up and down the line, the railroads built telegraph lines alongside the railroad. These lines eventually superseded the original [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] which followed much of the [[Mormon Trail]] up the [[North Platte River]] and across the very thinly populated [[Central Nevada Route]] through central Utah and Nevada. The telegraph lines along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain.  Many of the original telegraph lines were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad telegraph lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transcontinental Telegraph Line (U.S.)|url=http://ethw.org/Transcontinental_Telegraph_Line_(U.S.)|website=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Union Pacific route ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Transcontinental railroad route.png|thumb|left|Route of the first American transcontinental railroad from Sacramento, California, to Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Omaha was chosen by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] as the location of its Transfer Depot where up to seven railroads could transfer mail and other goods to Union Pacific trains bound for the west.\n\nTrains were initially transported across the Missouri River by ferry before they could access the western tracks beginning in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska Territory]].

Building bridges to cross creeks and rivers was the main source of delays. Near where the [[Platte River]] splits into the [[North Platte River]] and [[South Platte River]], the railroad bridged the North Platte River over a {{convert|2600|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} bridge (nicknamed \u00bd mile bridge). It was built across the shallow but wide North Platte resting on piles driven by steam [[pile driver]]s.<ref>[http://digital.denverlibrary.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15330coll22/id/70512/rec/1 North Platte Bridge] accessed March 14, 2013.</ref> Here they built the \"railroad\" town of [[North Platte, Nebraska]] in December 1866 after completing about {{convert|240|mi|km|}} of track that year.

Dodge]] was appointed Chief Engineer on the Union Pacific, but hard working General \"Jack\" Casement continued to work as chief construction \"boss\" and his brother Daniel Casement continued as a financial officer.\n\nThe original emigrant route across Wyoming of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails, after progressing up the [[Platte River]] valley, went up the [[North Platte River]] valley through [[Casper, Wyoming]], along the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] and over the [[Continental Divide]] at the {{convert|7412|ft|m|adj=on}} [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]]. The original westward travelers in their ox and mule pulled wagons tried to stick to river valleys to avoid as much road building as possible\u2014gradients and sharp corners were usually of little or no concern to them. The ox and mule pulled wagons were the original off-road vehicles in their day since nearly all of the [[Emigrant Trail]]s went cross country over rough, unimproved trails. The route over South Pass's main advantage for wagons pulled by oxen or mules was a shorter elevation over an \"easy\" pass to cross and its \"easy\" connection to nearby river valleys on both sides of the continental divide for water and grass. The emigrant trails were closed in winter. The North Platte\u2013South Pass route was far less beneficial for a railroad, as it was about {{convert|150|mi|km}} longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow, steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte. The route along the North Platte was also further from [[Denver, Colorado]], and went across difficult terrain, while a railroad connection to that City was already being planned for and surveyed.\n\nEfforts to survey a new, shorter, \"better\" route had been underway since 1864. By 1867, a new route was found and surveyed that went along part of the [[South Platte River]] in western Nebraska and after entering what is now the state of [[Wyoming]], ascended a gradual sloping ridge between [[Lodgepole Creek]] and [[Crow Creek (South Platte River)|Crow Creek]] to the {{convert|8200|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Sherman Summit|Evans pass]] (also called Sherman's Pass) which was discovered by the Union Pacific employed English surveyor and engineer, James Evans, in about 1864.<ref>[http://up150.com/timeline/sherman-summit Discovery of Evans Pass] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414011022/http://up150.com/timeline/sherman-summit |date=April 14, 2012 }} accessed March 8, 2013.</ref> This pass now is marked by the [[Ames Monument]] ({{coord|41.131281|N|105.398045|W|display=inline}}) marking its significance and commemorating two of the main backers of the Union Pacific Railroad.

Evans Pass was located between what would become the new \"railroad\" towns of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] and [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]]. Connecting to this pass, about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of Cheyenne, was the one place across the [[Laramie Mountains]] that had a narrow \"guitar neck\" of land that crossed the mountains without serious erosion at the so-called \"gangplank\" ({{coord|41.099746|N|105.153205|W|display=inline}}) discovered by [[Major General]] [[Grenville Dodge]] in 1865 when he was in the U.S. Army.<ref>[http://www.laramieboomerang.com/articles/2013/02/28/news/doc512ef29f863e8182631906.txt Gankplank discovery] accessed March 5, 2013.</ref> The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over {{convert|150|mi|km}} shorter, had a flatter profile, allowing for cheaper and easier railroad construction, and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch]] and [[Laramie Range]]s.\n\nThe railroad gained about {{convert|3200|ft|m}} in the {{convert|220|mi|km}} climb to Cheyenne from North Platte, Nebraska\u2014about {{convert|15|ft/mi|m/km}}\u2014a very gentle slope of less than one degree average. This \"new\" route had never become an emigrant route because it lacked the water and grass to feed the emigrants' oxen and mules. Steam locomotives did not need grass, and the railroad companies could drill wells for water if necessary.\n\nCoal had been discovered in Wyoming and reported on by [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] in his 1843 expedition across Wyoming, and was already being exploited by Utah residents from towns like [[Coalville, Utah]] and later [[Kemmerer, Wyoming]] by the time the Transcontinental railroad was built. Union Pacific needed coal to fuel its [[steam locomotive]]s on the almost treeless plains across Nebraska and Wyoming.

Beyond Dale Creek, railroad construction paused at what became the town of [[Laramie, Wyoming]] to build a bridge across the [[Laramie River]].\n\nLocated {{convert|35|mi|km}} from Evans pass, Union Pacific connected the new \"railroad\" town of Cheyenne to Denver and its [[Denver Pacific Railway and Telegraph Company]] railroad line in 1870. Elevated {{convert|6070|ft|m}} above sea level, and sitting on the new Union Pacific route with a connection to Denver, Cheyenne was chosen to become a major railroad center and was equipped with extensive railroad yards, maintenance facilities, and a Union Pacific presence. Its location made it a good base for [[Bank engine|helper locomotives]] to couple to trains with [[snowplow]]s to help clear the tracks of snow or help haul heavy freight over Evans pass. The Union Pacific's junction with the Denver Railroad with its connection to [[Kansas City, Kansas]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and the railroads east of the Missouri River again increased Cheyenne's importance as the junction of two major railroads. Cheyenne later became Wyoming's largest city and the capital of the new state of Wyoming.\n\nThe railroad established many townships along the way: [[Fremont, Nebraska|Fremont]], [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]], [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]], [[Ogallala, Nebraska|Ogallala]] and [[Sidney, Nebraska|Sidney]] as the railroad followed the Platte River across Nebraska territory. The railroad even dipped into what would become the new state of [[Colorado]] after crossing the North Platte River as it followed the [[South Platte River]] west into what would become [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]] before turning northwest along Lodgepole Creek into Wyoming. In the [[Dakota Territory]] (Wyoming) the new towns of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], [[Rawlins, Wyoming|Rawlins]] (named for [[Union Army|Union]] General [[John Aaron Rawlins]], who camped in the locality in 1867<ref>Stewart, George R.

The [[Green River (Colorado River)|Green River]] was crossed with a new bridge, and the new \"railroad\" town of Green River constructed there after the tracks reached the Green River on October 1, 1868\u2014the last big river to cross.\n\nOn December 4, 1868, the Union Pacific reached Evanston, having laid almost {{convert|360|mi|km}} of track over the Green River and the [[Laramie Plains]] that year. By 1871, Evanston became a significant maintenance shop town equipped to carry out extensive repairs on the cars and steam locomotives.\n\nIn the [[Utah Territory]], the railroad once again diverted from the main emigrant trails to cross the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch Mountains]] and went down the rugged Echo Canyon (Summit County, Utah) and [[Weber River]] canyon. To speed up construction as much as possible, Union Pacific contracted several thousand Mormon workers to cut, fill, trestle, bridge, blast and tunnel its way down the rugged Weber River Canyon to [[Ogden, Utah]], ahead of the railroad construction. The Mormon and Union Pacific rail work was joined in the area of the present-day border between Utah and Wyoming.<ref name=\"cprr.org\">Mormon workers on Union Pacific transcontinental tracks [http://cprr.org/Museum/Stewart-Iron_Trail.html] accessed August 2, 2013.</ref> The longest of four tunnels built in Weber Canyon was {{convert|757|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Tunnel 2.

Cape Horn, C.P.R.R.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Central Pacific Rail road at Cape Horn circa 1880]]\nThe Central Pacific laid {{convert|690|mi}} of track, starting in Sacramento, California, in 1863 and continuing over the rugged {{convert|7000|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains at [[Donner Pass]] into the new state of Nevada. The elevation change from Sacramento (elev. {{convert|40|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) to [[Donner Summit]] (elev. {{convert|7000|ft|m|abbr=on|disp=or}}) had to be accomplished in about {{convert|90|mi|km}} with an average elevation change of 76&nbsp;feet per&nbsp;mile (14&nbsp;meters per&nbsp;km), and there were only a few places in the Sierra where this type of \"ramp\" existed. The discovery and detailed map survey with profiles and elevations of this route over the Sierra Nevada is credited to [[Theodore Judah]], chief engineer of the Central Pacific Railroad until his death in 1863. This route is up a ridge between the North fork of the [[American River]] on the south and [[Bear River (Feather River)]] and [[South Yuba River]] on the north. As the railroad climbed out of Sacramento up to Donner Summit, there was only one {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} section near \"Cape Horn CPRR\"<ref>Cape Horn CPRR [https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/C.P.R.R._train_at_Cape_Horn,_by_Thomas_Houseworth_%2526_Co..jpg&imgrefurl=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C.P.R.R._train_at_Cape_Horn,_by_Thomas_Houseworth_%2526_Co..jpg&h=1419&w=2737&sz=1669&tbnid=8IfJNhakdb9bqM:&tbnh=62&tbnw=120&zoom=1&usg=__R8lvvJNl_a9FCTGufLMRY_6Iz2I=&docid=nJYpVW4BZ669bM&itg=1&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8RU9UdL0GcruyQH-54GoCQ&ved=0CEwQ9QEwAw&dur=166] accessed March 10, 2013.</ref> where the railroad grade slightly exceeded two percent.\n\n[[File:Dutch Flat Wagon Road 1864.jpg|thumb|left|1864 advertisement for the opening of the [[Dutch Flat Wagon Road]]]]\nIn June 1864, the Central Pacific railroad entrepreneurs opened Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road (DFDLWR).<ref>Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road [http://cprr.org/Museum/DFDLWR_Duncan.html] Accessed July 23, 2009.</ref> Costing about $300,000 and a years worth of work, this toll road wagon route was opened over much of the route the Central Pacific railroad (CPRR) would use over Donner Summit to carry freight and passengers needed by the CPRR and to carry other cargo over their toll road to and from the ever advancing railhead and over the Sierra to the gold and silver mining towns of Nevada. As the railroad advanced, their freight rates with the combined rail and wagon shipments would become much more competitive. The volume of the toll road freight traffic to Nevada was estimated to be about $13,000,000 a year as the [[Comstock Lode]] boomed, and getting even part of this freight traffic would help pay for the railroad construction. When the railroad reached Reno, it had the majority of all Nevada freight shipments, and the price of goods in Nevada dropped significantly as the freight charges to Nevada dropped significantly. The rail route over the Sierras followed the general route of the Truckee branch of the [[California Trail]], going east over Donner Pass and down the rugged [[Truckee River]] valley.\n\nThe route over the Sierra had been plotted out by Judah in preliminary surveys before his death in 1863. Judah's deputy, [[Samuel S. Montague]] was appointed as Central Pacific's new Chief Engineer, with Lewis M. Clement as Assistant Chief Engineer and Charles Cadwalader as second assistant. To build the new railroad, detailed surveys had to be run that showed where the cuts, fills, trestles, bridges and tunnels would have to be built. Work that was identified as taking a long time was started as soon as its projected track location could be ascertained and work crews, supplies and road work equipment found to be sent ahead. Tunnels, trestles and bridges were nearly all built this way. The spread-out nature of the work resulted in the work being split into two divisions, with L.M. Clement taking the upper division from Blue Ca\u00f1on to Truckee and Cadwalader taking the lower division from Truckee to the Nevada border. Other assistant engineers were assigned to specific tasks such as building a bridge, tunnel or trestle which was done by the workers under experienced supervisors.<ref name=\"lmc\"/>\n\n[[File:CPRR Sierra Grade @ Donner Summit (1869; 2003).jpg|right|thumb|The CPRR grade at Donner Summit as it appeared in 1869 and 2003]]\nIn total, the Central Pacific had eleven tunnel projects (Nos. 3 through 13) under construction in the Sierra from 1865\u201368, with seven tunnels located in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch on the east side of Donner Summit. The tunnels were usually built by drilling a series of holes in the tunnel face, filling them with black powder and detonating it to break the rock free. The black powder was provided by the '''California Powder Works''' near [[Santa Cruz, California]]. These works had started production in 1864 after the [[U.S. Civil War]] had cut off shipments of black powder from the East to the mining and railroad industry of California and Nevada. The Central Pacific was a prolific user of black powder, often using up to 500 kegs of {{convert|25|lb|kg}} each per day.<ref>California Powder Works [http://railroad.lindahall.org/essays/black-powder.html] accessed March 19, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe summit tunnel (Number 6), {{convert|1660|ft|m}}, was started in late 1865, well ahead of the railhead. Through solid granite, the summit tunnel progressed at a rate of only about {{convert|0.98|ft|m}} per day per face as it was being worked by three eight-hour shifts of workers, hand drilling holes with a rock drill and hammer, filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose. One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion. The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865\u201366 as there was no way to supply them, nor quarters they could have lived in. The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon.\n\n[[File:CPRR Summit Tunnel Central Shaft.jpg|thumb|left|The vertical central shaft of the CPRR \"Summit Tunnel\" (Tunnel #6) at Donner Summit which allowed drilling and excavation to be carried out on four faces at once]]\nIn 1866 they put in a {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=on}} vertical shaft in the center of the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces, giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress. A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces. By the winter of 1866\u201367, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel face was a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}, {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} oval with an {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=on}} vertical wall.  Progress on the tunnel sped up to over {{convert|1.5|ft|m}} per day per face when they started using the newly invented [[nitroglycerin]]\u2014manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle. Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated, they were left unlined or lined with brick, rock walls or timber and post. Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature. Despite this potential complication, nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within {{convert|2|in|cm}} or so. The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required was nearly all done by the Canadian-born and -trained Lewis Clement, the CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track, and his assistants.<ref name=\"lmc\">Cooper, Bruce C.

The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade\u2014[[cut and fill]] construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment that could be used to make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by [[wheelbarrow]] and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a V shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way though the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill.<ref>The Use of Black Powder and Nitroglycerine on the Transcontinental Railroad [http://railroad.lindahall.org/essays/black-powder.html] accessed March 19, 2013.</ref><ref>California Newspapers, 1865\u201366 [http://cprr.org/Museum/Newspapers/] accessed March 19, 2013.</ref> Initially, many valleys were bridged by \"temporary\" trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier\u2014load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.\n\n[[File:Donner Pass Summit Tunnel West Portal.jpg|thumb|right|The Summit Tunnel at Donner Summit, West Portal ''(Composite image with the tracks removed in 1993 digitally restored)'']]\nThe route down the eastern Sierras was done on the south side of [[Donner Lake]] with a series of switchbacks carved into the mountain. The Truckee River, which drains [[Lake Tahoe]], had already found and scoured out the best route across the [[Carson Range]] of mountains east of the Sierras. The route down the rugged Truckee River Canyon, including required bridges, was done ahead of the main summit tunnel completion. To expedite the building of the railroad through the Truckee River canyon, the Central Pacific hauled two small locomotives, [[railcar]]s, rails and other material on wagons and sleighs to what is now [[Truckee, California]] and worked the winter of 1867\u201368 on their way down Truckee canyon ahead of the tracks being completed to Truckee. In Truckee canyon, five [[Howe truss]] bridges had to be built. This gave them a head start on getting to the \"easy\" miles across Nevada.\n\nIn order to keep the higher portions of the Sierra grade open in the winter, {{convert|37|mi}} of timber [[snow shed]]s were built between Blue Ca\u00f1on and Truckee in addition to utilizing [[snowplow]]s pushed by locomotives, as well as manual shovelling. With the advent of more efficient oil fired steam and later diesel electric power to drive plows, flangers, spreaders, and rotary snow plows, most of the wooden snowsheds have long since been removed as obsolete. Tunnels 1\u20135 and Tunnel 13 of the original 1860s tunnels on Track 1 of the Sierra grade remain in use today, while additional new tunnels were later driven when the grade was double tracked over the first quarter of the twentieth century. In 1993, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (which operated the CPRR-built [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]\u2013[[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] line until its 1996 merger with the [[Union Pacific]]) closed and pulled up the {{convert|6.7|mi|adj=on}} section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1)<ref>Norden at {{coord|39.3176|-120.3584|display=inline}}</ref> and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8)<ref>Shed 47 visible at {{coord|39.3116|-120.269|display=inline}}</ref> about a mile east of the old [[Flying junction|flyover]] at [[Eder, California|Eder]], bypassing and abandoning the tunnel 6\u20138 complex, the concrete snowsheds just beyond them, and tunnels 9\u201312 ending at MP 195.7, all of which had been located on Track 1 within two miles of the summit.<ref>East end of Tunnel 41 at {{coord|39.301|-120.3003|display=inline}} with former track 1 passing above.</ref> Since then all east- and westbound traffic has been run over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) south of Donner Pass through the {{convert|10322|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Tunnel #41 (\"The Big Hole\") running under Mt. Judah between Soda Springs and Eder, which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was double tracked. This routing change was made because the Track 2 and Tunnel 41 Summit crossing is far easier and less expensive to maintain and keep open in the harsh Sierra winters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cooper, Bruce C.|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Sierra_Grade_8-2003/Donner_Pass-Summit_Tunnel/index.html |title=Summit Tunnel & Donner Pass |publisher=CPRR.org |date=August 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn June 18, 1868, the Central Pacific reached [[Reno, Nevada]], after completing {{convert|132|mi|km}} of railroad up and over the Sierras from [[Sacramento, California]]. By then the railroad had already been prebuilt down the Truckee River on the much flatter land from Reno to [[Wadsworth, Nevada]], where they bridged the Truckee for the last time. From there, they struggled across a [[Lahontan Valley|forty mile desert]] to the end of the Humboldt river at the [[Humboldt Sink]]. From the end of the Humboldt, they continued east over the [[Great Basin Desert]] bordering the [[Humboldt River]] to [[Wells, Nevada]]. One of the most troublesome problems found on this route along the Humboldt was at [[Palisade Canyon]] (near [[Carlin, Nevada]]), where for {{convert|12|mi|km}} the line had to be built between the river and basalt cliffs. From [[Wells, Nevada]] to [[Promontory Summit]], the Railroad left the Humboldt and proceeded across the Nevada and Utah desert. Water for the [[steam locomotive]]s was provided by wells, springs, or pipelines to nearby water sources. Water was often pumped into the water tanks with [[windmill]]s. Train fuel and [[water spot]]s on the early trains with steam locomotives may have been as often as every {{convert|10|mi|km}}. On one memorable occasion, not far from Promontory, the Central Pacific crews organized an army of workers and five train loads of construction material, and laid {{convert|10|mi|km}} of track on a prepared rail bed in one day\u2014-a record that still stands today. The Central Pacific and Union Pacific raced to get as much track laid as possible, and the Central Pacific laid about {{convert|560|mi|km}} of track from Reno to Promontory Summit in the one year before the Last Spike was driven on May 10, 1869.\n\nCentral Pacific had 1,694 freight cars available by May 1869, with more under construction in their Sacramento yard. Major repairs and maintenance on the Central Pacific rolling stock was done in their Sacramento maintenance yard. Near the end of 1869, Central Pacific had 162 locomotives, of which 2 had two drivers (drive wheels), 110 had four drivers, and 50 had six drivers. The [[steam locomotive]]s had been purchased in the eastern states and shipped to California by sea. Thirty-six additional locomotives were built and coming west, and twenty-eight more were under construction. There was a shortage of passenger cars and more had to be ordered. The first Central Pacific sleeper, the \"Silver Palace Sleeping Car\", arrived at Sacramento on June 8, 1868.<ref>Constructing the Central Pacific Railroad [http://cprr.org/Museum/Galloway7.html] accessed March 13, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe CPRR route passed through [[Newcastle, California|Newcastle]] and [[Truckee, California|Truckee]] in California, [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]], [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]], [[Battle Mountain, Nevada|Battle Mountain]], [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]] and [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]] in Nevada (with many more fuel and water stops), before connecting with the Union Pacific line at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory. When the eastern end of the CPRR was extended to Ogden by purchasing the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] line from Promontory for about $2.8 million in 1870, it ended the short period of a boom town for [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory]], extended the Central Pacific tracks about {{convert|60|mi|km}} and made Ogden a major terminus on the transcontinental railroad, as passengers and freight switched railroads there.\n\n[[File:Reno to Virginia City NV CPRR-V&TRR Ticket 1878 .jpg|thumb|left|CPRR issued ticket for passage from Reno to Virginia City, NV on the V&TRR, 1878]]\nSubsequent to the railhead's meeting at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory, the San Joaquin River Bridge at Mossdale Crossing (near present-day [[Lathrop, California]]) was completed on September 8, 1869. As a result, the western part of the route was extended from Sacramento to the [[Alameda Terminal]] in [[Alameda, California]], and shortly thereafter, to the [[Oakland Pier|Oakland Long Wharf]] at [[Oakland Point]] in [[Oakland, California]], and on to [[San Jose, California]]. Train ferries transferred some railroad cars to and from the Oakland wharves and tracks to wharves and tracks in [[San Francisco]]. Before the CPRR was completed, developers were building other feeder railroads like the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] to the [[Comstock Lode]] diggings in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], and several different extensions in California and Nevada to reach other cities there. Some of their main cargo was the thousands of [[cord (unit)|cords]] of firewood needed for the many steam engines and pumps, cooking stoves, heating stoves etc. in Comstock Lode towns and the tons of ice needed by the miners as they worked ever deeper into the \"hot\" Comstock Lode ore body. In the mines, temperatures could get above {{convert|120|F}} at the work face and a miner often used over {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of ice per shift. This new railroad connected to the Central Pacific near [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and went through [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], the new capital of Nevada.<ref>{{cite web\n| title =  Central Pacific Railroad Map\n| url = http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Maps/_crofutt_1870_map.html\n| publisher = Central Pacific Railroad Museum\n| accessdate = 2009-02-05}}</ref>\n\nAfter the transcontinental railroads were completed, many other railroads were built to connect up to other population centers in Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oregon, Washington territories, etc. In 1869, the [[Kansas Pacific Railway]] started building the [[Hannibal Bridge]], a [[swing bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]] between [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Kansas City, Kansas]] which connected railroads on both sides of the Missouri while still allowing passage of [[paddle steamer]]s on the river. After completion, this became another major east\u2013west railroad. To speed completion of the [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] to Denver, construction started east from Denver in March 1870 to meet the railroad coming west from Kansas city. The two crews met at a point called Comanche Crossing, Kansas Territory, on August 15, 1870. Denver was now firmly on track to becoming the largest city and the future capital of [[Colorado]]. The [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] linked with the [[Denver Pacific Railway]] via Denver to Cheyenne in 1870.\n\nThe original transcontinental railroad route did not pass through the two biggest cities in the so-called [[Great American Desert]]\u2014[[Denver, Colorado]], and [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Feeder railroad lines were soon built to service these two and other cities and states along the route.\n\nModern-day [[Interstate 80]] roughly follows the path of the railroad from Sacramento across modern day California, Nevada, Wyoming and Nebraska, with a few exceptions. Most significantly, the two routes are different between [[Wells, Nevada]] and [[Echo, Utah]]. In this area the freeway passes along the south shore of the [[Great Salt Lake]] and passes through [[Salt Lake City]], cresting the [[Wasatch Mountains]] at [[Parley's Summit]]. The railroad was originally routed along the north shore, and later with the [[Lucin Cutoff]] directly across the center of the Great Salt Lake,  passing through the city of [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] instead of Salt Lake City. The railroad crosses the Wasatch Mountains via a much gentler grade through [[Weber Canyon]].  Most of the other deviations are in mountainous areas where [[Interstate Highway standards|interstate highways]] allow for grades up to six-percent grades, which allows them to go many places the railroads had to go around, since their goal was to hold their grades to less than two percent.\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:First Transcontinental Rail.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Jupiter'', which carried [[Leland Stanford]] (one of the \"Big Four\" owners of the Central Pacific) and other railway officials to the Last Spike Ceremony]]\nMost of the capital investment needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as it did not have to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were [[Union Army]] veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.\n\nSurvey teams were put out to produce detailed contour maps of the options on the different routes. The engineering team looked at the available surveys and chose what was the \"best\" route. Survey teams under the direction of the engineers closely led the work crews and marked where and by how much hills would have to be cut and depressions filled or bridged. Coordinators made sure that construction and other supplies were provided when and where needed, and additional supplies were ordered as the railroad construction consumed the supplies. Specialized bridging, explosive and tunneling teams were assigned to their specialized jobs. Some jobs like explosive work, tunneling, bridging, heavy cuts or fills were known to take longer than others, so the specialized teams were sent out ahead by wagon trains with the supplies and men to get these jobs done by the time the regular track-laying crews arrived. Finance officers made sure the supplies were paid for and men paid for their work. An army of men had to be coordinated and a seemingly never-ending chain of supplies had to be provided. The Central Pacific road crew set a track-laying record by laying {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} of track in a single day, commemorating the event with a signpost beside the track for passing trains to see.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tcrr-cprr/|title=PBS \u2013 General Article: Workers of the Central Pacific Railroad|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the track-laying crews, other crews were busy setting up stations with provisions for loading fuel, water and often also mail, passengers and freight. Personnel had to be hired to run these stations. Maintenance depots had to be built to keep all of the equipment repaired and operational. Telegraph operators had to be hired to man each station to keep track of where the trains were so that trains could run in each direction on the available single track without interference or accidents. Sidings had to be built to allow trains to pass. Provision had to be made to store and continually pay for coal or wood needed to run the [[steam locomotive]]s. Water towers had to be built for refilling the water tanks on the engines, and provision made to keep them full.\n\n=== Labor ===\nThe majority of the Union Pacific track across the Nebraska and Wyoming territories was built by veterans of the Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armies, as well as many recent immigrants. [[Brigham Young]], President of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], landed contracts with the Union Pacific that offered jobs for around 2,000 members of the church with the hope that the railroad would support commerce in Utah. Church members built most of the road through Utah.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arrington |first1=Leonard J. |author-link1= Leonard J.

The Chinese were commonly referred to at the time as \"[[Celestial Empire|Celestials]]\" and China as the \"Celestial Kingdom.\" Labor-saving devices in those days consisted primarily of [[wheelbarrow]]s, horse or mule pulled carts, and a few railroad pulled gondolas. The construction work involved an immense amount of manual labor. Initially, Central Pacific had a hard time hiring and keeping unskilled workers on its line, as many would leave for the prospect of far more lucrative gold or silver mining options elsewhere. Despite the concerns expressed by [[Charles Crocker]], one of the \"big four\" and a general contractor, that the Chinese were too small in stature<ref>Ambrose, p. 148.</ref> and lacking previous experience with railroad work, they decided to try them anyway.<ref>Griswold, Wesley ''A Work of Giants''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1962. pg.109-111</ref>  After the first few days of trial with a few workers, with noticeably positive results, Crocker decided to hire as many as he could, looking primarily at the California labor force, where the majority of Chinese worked as independent gold miners or in the service industries (e.g.: laundries and kitchens). Most of these Chinese workers were represented by a Chinese \"boss\" who translated, collected salaries for his crew, kept discipline and relayed orders from an American general supervisor. Most Chinese workers spoke only rudimentary or no English, and the supervisors typically only learned rudimentary Chinese. Many more workers were imported from the [[Guangdong]] Province of China, which at the time, beside great poverty, suffered from the violence of the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Most Chinese workers were planning on returning with their new found \"wealth\" when the work was completed. Most of the men received between one and three dollars per day, the same as unskilled white workers; but the workers imported directly from China sometimes received less. A diligent worker could save over $20 per month after paying for food and lodging\u2014a \"fortune\" by Chinese standards. A snapshot of workers in late 1865 showed about 3,000 Chinese and 1,700 white workers employed on the railroad. Nearly all of the white workers were in supervisory or skilled craft positions and made more money than the Chinese.\n\nMost of the early work on the Central Pacific consisted of constructing the railroad track bed, cutting and/or blasting through or around hills, filling in washes, building bridges or trestles, digging and blasting tunnels and then laying the rails over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains. Once the Central Pacific was out of the Sierras and the Carson Range, progress sped up considerably as the railroad bed could be built over nearly flat ground. In those days, the Central Pacific once did a section of {{convert|10|mi|km}} of track in one day as a \"demonstration\" of what they could do on flat ground like most of the Union Pacific had in Wyoming and Nebraska.\n\nThe track laying was divided up into various parts. In advance of the track layers, surveyors consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the [[fishplate]] bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers\u2014the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866.<ref name=\"nps.gov\">[http://www.nps.gov/archive/gosp/research/track_laying.html Alta California (San Francisco)], November 9, 1868.</ref> Almost all of the roadbed work had to be done manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.\n\n[[File:CPRR Tunnel No. 3 East Portal @ Cisco, CA.jpg|left|thumb|CPRR Tunnel #3 near Cisco, California (MP 180.1) opened in 1866 and remains in daily use today]]\n\nTunnels were blasted through hard rock by drilling holes in the rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled out of the tunnel for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented [[nitroglycerin]] explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.<ref>Kraus, High Road to Promontory, p. 110.; Robert West Howard, The Great Iron Trail: The Story of the First Transcontinental Railroad (New York: G. P. Putnam's Sons, 1962), p. 231.</ref>\n\nSupply trains carried all the necessary material for the construction up to the railhead, with mule or horse-drawn wagons carrying it the rest of the ways if required. Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the [[track ballast]] and levelled to get ready for the rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with [[spike maul]]s. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.\n\nTrack ballast was put between the ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed had already been prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed supplies included \"food, water, ties, rails, spikes, fishplates, nuts and bolts, track ballast, telegraph poles, wire, fire wood (or coal on the Union Pacific) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc.\"<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/> After a flatcar was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another flatcar with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would be brought to the end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.\n\nThe railroad tracks, spikes, telegraph wire, locomotives, railroad cars, supplies etc. were imported from the east on sailing ships that sailed the about {{convert|18000|mi|km}} and about 200 day trip around [[Cape Horn]]. Some freight was put on [[Clipper ship]]s which could do the trip in about 120 days. Some passengers and high priority freight were shipped over the newly (1855) completed [[Panama Railroad]] across the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Using [[paddle steamer]]s to and from Panama, this shortcut could be traveled in as little as 40 days. Supplies were normally offloaded at the [[Sacramento, California]] docks where the railroad started.\n\n=== Central Pacific construction ===\nOn January 8, 1863, Governor [[Leland Stanford]] ceremonially broke ground in Sacramento, California, to begin construction of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. On January 7, 1865, a want ad for 5,000 laborers was placed in the Sacramento Union.<ref name=\"dobie\">{{cite book |last1=Dobie |first1=Charles Caldwell |title=San Francisco's Chinatown; Chapter IV: Railroad Building |date=1936 |publisher=Appleton-Century Co |location=New York |pages=71\u201372}}</ref>  Consequently, after a trial crew of  [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese]] workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborers\u2014mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], seemed to be more willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.\n\n[[File:CPRR Donner Summit Tunnel Hand Drilled Granite 1868.jpg|thumb|left|Example of hand drilled granite from within Tunnel #6, the \"Summit Tunnel\"]]\n\nThe first step of construction was to survey the route and determine the locations where large excavations, tunnels and bridges would be needed. Crews could then start work in advance of the railroad reaching these locations. Supplies and workers were brought up to the work locations by wagon teams and work on several different sections proceeded simultaneously. One advantage of working on tunnels in winter was that tunnel work could often proceed since the work was nearly all \"inside\". Unfortunately, living quarters would have to be built outside and getting new supplies was difficult. Working and living in winter in the presence of snow slides and avalanches caused some deaths.<ref>Ambrose, Nothing Like It in the World, pp. 160, 201.</ref>\n\nTo carve a tunnel, one worker held a rock drill on the granite face while one to two other workers swung eighteen-pound sledgehammers to sequentially hit the drill which slowly advanced into the rock. Once the hole was about {{convert|10|in|cm}} deep, it would be filled with black powder, a fuse set and then ignited from a safe distance. Nitroglycerin, which had been invented less than two decades before the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, was used in relatively large quantities during its construction. This was especially true on the Central Pacific Railroad, which owned its own nitroglycerin plant to ensure it had a steady supply of the volatile explosive.<ref>Howard, Robert ''The Great Iron Trail.'' New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1962. pg. 222</ref> This plant was operated by Chinese laborers as they were willing workers even under the most trying and dangerous of conditions.<ref>Howard, Robert ''The Great Iron Trail.'' New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1962. pg.222</ref>\n\nChinese laborers were also crucial in the construction of 15 tunnels along the railroad's line through the Sierra Nevada mountains.  These were about 32 feet (10 m) high and 16 feet (5 m) wide.<ref name=\"Tzu-Kuei p. 128\">Tzu-Kuei, \"Chinese Workers and the First Transcontinental Railroad of the United States of America\", p. 128.</ref> When tunnels with vertical shafts were dug to increase construction speed, and tunneling began in the middle of the tunnel and at both ends simultaneously.  At first hand-powered [[derrick]]s were used to help remove loose rocks up the vertical shafts. These derricks were later replaced with steam hoists as work progressed. By using vertical shafts, four faces of the tunnel could be worked at the same time, two in the middle and one at each end. The average daily progress in some tunnels was only 0.85 feet (26&nbsp;cm) a day per face, which was very slow,<ref name=\"Tzu-Kuei p. 128\"/> or 1.18 feet (36&nbsp;cm) daily according to historian George Kraus.{{r|\"Kraus Chinese 1969\"|p=49}} J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that \"The Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west end of Tunnel No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen and a \"boss/translator\". A single foreman (often Irish) with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 men worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom, removing blasted material. When a gang was small or the men were needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going.\"{{r|\"Kraus Chinese 1969\"|p=49}} The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers.<ref>John R.

Horace Hamilton Minkler, track foreman for the Central Pacific, laid the last rail and tie before the Last Spike was driven.\n\n[[File:CPRR Snow Gallery at Crested Peak C.E. Watkins No. 252 1868.jpg|thumb|right|CPRR snow gallery under construction in 1868]]In order to keep the CPRR's Sierra grade open during the winter months, beginning in 1867, {{convert|37|mi|km}} of massive wooden [[snow sheds]] and galleries were built between Blue Ca\u00f1on and Truckee, covering cuts and other points where there was danger of avalanches. 2,500 men and six material trains were employed in this work, which was completed in 1869. The sheds were built with two sides and a steep peaked roof, mostly of locally cut hewn timber and round logs. Snow galleries had one side and a roof that sloped upward until it met the mountain side, thus permitting avalanches to slide over the galleries, some of which extended up the mountainside as much as {{convert|200|ft|m}}.

This changed, however, as the work entered Indian-held lands. The Native Americans saw the railroad as a violation of their treaties with the United States. War parties began to raid the moving labor camps that followed the progress of the line. Union Pacific responded by increasing security and hiring marksmen to kill [[American Bison]], which were both a physical threat to trains and the primary food source for many of the Plains Indians. The Native Americans then began killing laborers when they realized that the so-called \"Iron Horse\" threatened their existence. Security measures were further strengthened, and progress on the railroad continued.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n\"Gen.

As soon as the ceremonial \"Last Spike\" had been replaced by an ordinary iron spike, a message was transmitted to both the East Coast and West Coast that simply read, \"DONE.\" Travel from coast to coast was reduced from six months or more to just one week.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Railroad developments ===\n[[File:CPRR & UPRR Display Ads May 1869.jpg|left|thumb|Display ads for the CPRR and UPRR the week the rails were joined on May 10, 1869]] [[File:Great Overland Route Timetable Cover 1881.JPG|thumb|left|UPRR & CPRR \"Great American Over-Land Route\" Timetable cover 1881]]When the last spike was driven, the rail network was not yet connected to the Atlantic or Pacific but merely connected Omaha to Sacramento. To get from Sacramento to the Pacific, the Central Pacific purchased the struggling [[Western Pacific Railroad (1862-1870)|Western Pacific Railroad]] (unrelated to the [[Western Pacific Railroad|railroad of the same name]] that would later parallel its route) and in summer 1869 resumed construction on it, which had halted in 1866 due to funding troubles.  On September 6, 1869, the first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad's original western terminus on the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|east side of San Francisco Bay]] at the [[Alameda Terminal]], where they transferred to the steamer ''Alameda'' for transport across the Bay to San Francisco.  On November 8, 1869, the Central Pacific finally completed the rail connection to its western terminus at [[Oakland, California]], also on the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], where [[Port of San Francisco|freight]] and [[San Francisco Ferry Building|passengers]] completed their transcontinental link to San Francisco by [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferry]].\n\nThe original route from the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] to the [[San Francisco Bay|Bay]] skirted the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta|Delta]] by heading south out of Sacramento through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and crossing the [[San Joaquin River]] at [[Lathrop, California|Mossdale]], then climbed over the [[Altamont Pass]] and reached the  east side of the San Francisco Bay through [[Niles Canyon]]. The Western Pacific was originally chartered to go to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], but the Central Pacific decided to build along the East Bay instead, as going from San Jose up the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to [[San Francisco]] itself would have brought it into conflict with [[San Francisco and San Jose Railroad|competing interests]]. The railroad entered [[Alameda Terminal|Alameda]] and [[Oakland Point, Oakland, California|Oakland]] from the south, roughly paralleling what would later become [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]] and later still Interstates [[Interstate 5 in California|5]], [[Interstate 205 (California)|205]], and [[Interstate 580 (California)|580]]. A [[Capitol Corridor|more direct route]] was obtained with the purchase of the [[California Pacific Railroad]], crossing the [[Sacramento River]] and proceeding southwest through [[Davis, California|Davis]] to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], where it crossed the [[Carquinez Strait]] by means of an enormous [[Solano (ferry)|train ferry]], [[Port Costa, California|then]] followed the shores of the [[San Pablo Bay|San Pablo]] and [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]] bays to [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] and the [[Port of Oakland]] (paralleling [[U.S. Route 40 in California|U.S. Route 40]] which ultimately became [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]). In 1930, a [[Benicia\u2013Martinez Bridge|rail bridge]] across the Carquinez replaced the Benicia ferries.\n\nVery early on, the Central Pacific learned that it would have trouble maintaining an open track in winter across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]]. At first they tried plowing the road with special snowplows mounted on their steam engines. When this was only partially successful, an extensive process of building [[snow shed]]s over some of the track was instituted to protect it from deep snows and avalanches. These eventually succeeded at keeping the tracks clear for all but a few days of the year.<ref>Central Pacific snow sheds [http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Summit_Tunnel_1999/index.html] accessed January 28, 2009.</ref>\n\nBoth railroads soon instituted extensive upgrade projects to build better bridges, viaducts and dugways as well as install heavier duty rails, stronger ties, better road beds etc. The original track had often been laid as fast as possible with only secondary attention to maintenance and durability. The primary incentive had been getting the subsidies, which meant that upgrades of all kinds were routinely required in the following years.\n\n[[File:Crofutt's Trans-Continental Tourist's Guide Frontispiece 1870.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of Crofutt's ''Great Trans-Continental Tourist's Guide'', 1870]]The Union Pacific would not connect Omaha to Council Bluffs until completing the [[Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge]] in 1872.<ref>{{cite news|title=Omaha|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026844/1872-03-26/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer|date=March 26, 1872|location=Wheeling, West Virginia|page=1}}</ref>\n\nSeveral years after the end of the Civil War, the competing railroads coming from Missouri finally realized their initial strategic advantage and a building boom ensued. In July 1869, the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]] finished the [[Hannibal Bridge]] in Kansas City which was the first bridge to cross the Missouri River. This in turn connected to [[Kansas Pacific]] trains going from Kansas City to Denver, which in turn had built the [[Denver Pacific Railway]] connecting to the Union Pacific. In August 1870, the Kansas Pacific drove the last spike connecting to the Denver Pacific line at [[Strasburg, Colorado]] and the first true Atlantic to Pacific United States railroad was completed.\n\nKansas City's head start in connecting to a true transcontinental railroad contributed to it rather than Omaha becoming the dominant rail center west of Chicago.\n\nThe Kansas Pacific became part of the Union Pacific in 1880.\n\nOn June 4, 1876, an express train called the ''[[Transcontinental Express]]'' arrived in San Francisco via the First Transcontinental Railroad only 83 hours and 39 minutes after it had left [[New York City]]. Only ten years before, the same journey would have taken months over land or weeks on ship, possibly all the way around South America.\n\nThe Central Pacific got a direct route to San Francisco when it was merged with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to create the Southern Pacific Company in 1885. The Union Pacific initially took over the Southern Pacific in 1901 but was forced by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to divest it because of monopoly concerns. The two railroads would once again unite in 1996 when the Southern Pacific was sold to the Union Pacific.\n\nHaving been bypassed with the completion of the [[Lucin Cutoff]] in 1904, the Promontory Summit rails were pulled up in 1942 to be recycled for the [[World War II]] effort. This process began with a ceremonial \"undriving\" at the Last Spike location.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/hh/40/hh40r.htm| title=Promontory After May 10, 1869| author=United States National Park Service| date=2002-09-28| accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier ===\n[[File:Oakes Ames - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|Oakes Ames]]\n{{Main|Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal}}\n\nDespite the transcontinental success and millions in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy less than three years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad. The scandal hit epic proportions in the [[1872 United States presidential election]], which saw the re-election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and became the biggest scandal of the [[Gilded Age]]. It would not be resolved until the death of the congressman who was supposed to have reined in its excesses but instead wound up profiting from it.\n\nDurant had initially come up with the scheme to have Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier subcontract to do the actual track work.  Durant gained control of the company after buying out employee Herbert Hoxie for $10,000. Under Durant's guidance, Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier was charging Union Pacific often twice or more the customary cost for track work (thus in effect paying himself to build the railroad).  The process mired down Union Pacific work.\n\nLincoln asked Massachusetts Congressman [[Oakes Ames]], who was on the railroad committee, to clean things up and get the railroad moving. Ames got his brother [[Oliver Ames Jr.]] named president of the Union Pacific, while he himself became president of Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/p_ames.html|title=People & Events: Oakes Ames (1804\u20131873) \u2013 American Experience Transcontinental Railroad|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAmes then in turn gave stock options to other politicians while at the same time continuing the lucrative overcharges. The scandal was to implicate Vice President [[Schuyler Colfax]] (who was cleared) and future President [[James Garfield]] among others.\n\nThe scandal broke in 1872 when the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' published correspondence detailing the scheme between Henry S. McComb and Ames. In the ensuing Congressional investigation, it was recommended that Ames be expelled from Congress, but this was reduced to a censure and Ames died within three months.\n\nDurant later left the Union Pacific and a new rail baron, [[Jay Gould]], became the dominant stockholder. As a result of the [[Panic of 1873]], Gould was able to pick up bargains, among them the control of the Union Pacific Railroad and [[Western Union]].<ref>''Panic on Wall Street: A History of America's Financial Disasters'', p. 193, [[Robert Sobel]], Beard Books, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-893122-46-8}}.</ref>\n\n=== Visible remains ===\nVisible remains of the historic line are still easily located\u2014hundreds of miles are still in service today, especially through the Sierra Nevada Mountains and canyons in Utah and Wyoming. While the original rail has long since been replaced because of age and wear, and the roadbed upgraded and repaired, the lines generally run on top of the original, handmade grade. Vista points on [[Interstate 80]] through California's Truckee Canyon provide a panoramic view of many miles of the original Central Pacific line and of the [[snow shed]]s which made winter train travel safe and practical.\n\nIn areas where the original line has been bypassed and abandoned, primarily due to the [[Lucin Cutoff]] re-route in Utah, the original road grade is still obvious, as are numerous cuts and fills, especially the [[Big Fill]] a few miles east of Promontory. The sweeping curve which connected to the east end of the Big Fill now passes a [[Thiokol]] rocket research and development facility.\n\nIn 1957, Congress authorized the [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]]. Today the site feature replica engines of [[Union Pacific No. 119]] and Central Pacific [[Jupiter (locomotive)|Jupiter]]. The engines are fired up periodically by the National Park Service for the public.<ref>'''Sources''':\n*Pentrex, 1997.\n*{{cite web |author=Golden Spike |title=Everlasting Steam: The Story of  Jupiter  and  No. 119 |url=https://www.nps.gov/gosp/learn/historyculture/upload/jupiter%202.pdf |website=nps.gov |publisher=National Park Service |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405161138/https://www.nps.gov/gosp/learn/historyculture/upload/jupiter%202.pdf |archivedate=April 5, 2015 |location=Brigham City, Utah |format=pdf}}\n*{{cite web |title=Golden Spike Pictures |url=http://users.tns.net/~path/GS119.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930204844/http://users.tns.net/~path/GS119.html |archivedate=September 30, 2011}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Best |first1=Gerald M |title=Promontory's Locomotives |date=1980 |publisher=Golden West Books |isbn=9780870950827 |pages=12\u201343}}\n*{{cite web |title=Central Pacific Jupiter and Union Pacific 119 at Promontory, Utah, June 8, 2009|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yv54hDAvJwk|via=[[YouTube]] }}\n*{{cite book|last=Dowty|first=Robert R.|title=Rebirth of the Jupiter and the 119: Building the Replica Locomotives at Golden Spike|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e66u9nqAu24C|year=1994|publisher=Western National Parks Association|isbn=978-1-877856-43-3|pages=5\u201346}}\n*{{cite web |last1=Goran |first1=David |title=Steam locomotives Jupiter and Union Pacific No. 119: Striking symbols of one of the most important periods in American history |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2016/09/27/steam-locomotives-jupiter-union-pacific-no-119-striking-symbols-one-important-periods-american-history/ |publisher=The Vintage News |date=September 27, 2016 |quote=They were painted and lettered by Disney employees and are incredibly accurate replicas of the originals.

''Around the World in Eighty Days'', [[Oxford Worlds Classics]], 1995, Introduction.</ref>\n\nWhile not exactly accurate, John Ford's 1924 silent movie ''[[The Iron Horse (film)|The Iron Horse]]'' captures the fervent nationalism that drove public support for the project. Among the cooks serving the film's cast and crew between shots were some of the Chinese laborers who worked on the Central Pacific section of the railroad.\n\nThe feat is depicted in various movies, including the 1939 film ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'', starring [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], which depicts the fictional Central Pacific investor Asa Barrows obstructing attempts of the Union Pacific to reach Ogden, Utah.\n\nThe 1939 movie is said to have inspired the ''[[Union Pacific (TV series)|Union Pacific]]'' Western television series starring [[Jeff Morrow]], [[Judson Pratt]] and [[Susan Cummings (actress)|Susan Cummings]] which aired in syndication from 1958 until 1959.\n\nThe 1962 film ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' has a whole segment devoted to the construction; one of the movie's most famous scenes, filmed in [[Cinerama]], is of a buffalo stampede over the railroad.\n\nThe construction of what presumably is \u2013 or is suggested to be \u2013 the Transcontinental Railroad provides the backdrop of the 1968 epic [[spaghetti western]] ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', directed by Italian director [[Sergio Leone]].\n\n[[Graham Masterton]]'s 1981 novel ''A Man of Destiny'' (published in the UK as ''Railroad'') is a fictionalized account of the line's construction.\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''Ten Mile Day'' by Mary Ann Fraser tells the story of the record setting push by the Central Pacific in which they set a record by laying {{convert|10|mi|km}} of track in a single day on April 28, 1869, to settle a $10,000 bet.\n\n[[Kristiana Gregory]]'s 1999 book ''The Great Railroad Race'' (part of the \"Dear America\" series) is written as the fictional diary of Libby West, who chronicles the end of the railroad construction and the excitement which engulfed the country at the time.\n\nIn the 1999 [[Will Smith]] film, ''[[Wild Wild West]]'', the joining ceremony is the setting of an assassination attempt on then U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] by the film's antagonist [[Dr. Loveless#Other versions|Dr. Arliss Loveless]].\n\nThe main character in ''[[The Claim (2000 film)|The Claim]]'' (2000) is a surveyor for the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], and the film is partially about the efforts of a frontier mayor to have the railroad routed through his town.\n\nIn the 2002 [[DreamWorks Animation]] movie, ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]'', the main character, the horse Spirit, is delivered with other horses to pull a steam locomotive at a work site for the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nThe ''[[American Experience]]'' series' [[American Experience (season 15)|2002\u20132003 season]] documents the railway in the episode titled \"Transcontinental Railroad\".\n\nThe building of the railway is covered by the 2004 BBC documentary series ''[[Seven Wonders of the Industrial World]]'' in episode 6, \"The Line\".\n\nThe popular British television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' featured the Transcontinental Railroad in a 2010 BBC audio book entitled ''[[The Runaway Train]]'', read by [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] and written for audio by Oli Smith.\n\nThe construction of the Transcontinental Railroad provides the setting for the AMC television series ''[[Hell on Wheels (TV Series)|Hell on Wheels]]''.

Under the direction of the [[United States Department of War|Department of War]], the [[Pacific Railroad Surveys]] were conducted from 1853 through 1855. These included an extensive series of expeditions of the American West seeking possible routes. A report on the explorations described alternative routes and included an immense amount of information about the [[American West]], covering at least {{convert|400000|sqmi|km2|abbr=on}}. It included the region's natural history and illustrations of reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_RR_Surveys/ \"Reports of Explorations and Surveys, to ascertain the most practicable and economical route for a railroad from the Mississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, made under the direction of the Secretary of War, in 1853-4.\"] 12 Volumes.

The survey was detailed enough to determine that the best southern route lay south of the [[Gila River]] boundary with Mexico in mostly vacant desert, through the future territories of [[Arizona Territory|Arizona]] and [[New Mexico Territory|New Mexico]]. This in part motivated the United States to complete the [[Gadsden Purchase]].<ref>Woodward, C. Vann \"Reunion and Reaction: The Compromise of 1877 and the End of Reconstruction\".

(Ed) \"The American Congress: The Building of Democracy\". Kerr, K. Austin, Chapter 17: ''Railroad Policy'' (pp. 286-297). New York: Houghton Mifflin Co. (2004). p. 288</ref> Three routes were considered:\n\n* A northern route roughly along the Missouri River through present-day northern [[Montana]] to [[Oregon Territory]]. This was considered impractical due to the rough terrain and extensive winter snows.<ref group=N>Later, the '''[[Northern Pacific Railway]]''' (NP) found and built a better route across the northern tier of the western United States from Minnesota to the Pacific Coast. It was approved by Congress in 1864 and given nearly 40 million acres (160,000km<sup>2</sup>) of land grants, which it used to raise money in Europe. Construction began in 1870 and the main line opened all the way from the [[Great Lakes]] to the [[Pacific Ocean]] on September 8, 1883.</ref>\n* A central route following the [[Platte River]] in [[Nebraska]] through to the [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]] in [[Wyoming]], following most of the [[Oregon Trail]]. Snow on this route remained a concern.\n* A southern route across [[Texas]], [[New Mexico Territory]], the [[Sonora desert]], connecting to [[Los Angeles]], California. Surveyors found during an 1848 survey that the best route lay south of the border between the United States and Mexico. This was resolved by the [[Gadsden Purchase]] in 1853.<ref>[https://history.state.gov/milestones/1830-1860/gadsden-purchase Gadsden Purchase, 1853\u20131854] U.S. Department of State, Office of the Historian.</ref><ref group=N>The southern route was constructed in 1880 when the Southern Pacific Railroad crossed Arizona territory.</ref>\n\nOnce the central route was chosen, it was immediately obvious that the western terminus should be Sacramento.  But there was considerable difference of opinion about the eastern terminus. Three locations along {{convert|250|mi|km}} of Missouri River were considered:\n\n* [[St. Joseph, Missouri]], accessed via the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]].\n* [[Kansas City, Kansas]] / [[Leavenworth, Kansas]] accessed via the [[Leavenworth, Pawnee and Western Railroad]], controlled by [[Thomas Ewing Jr.]] and later by [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]].\n* [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]] / [[Omaha, Nebraska]], accessed via an extension of Union Pacific financier [[Thomas C. Durant]]'s proposed [[Mississippi and Missouri Railroad]] and the new [[Union Pacific Railroad]], also controlled by Durant.\n\nCouncil Bluffs had several advantages: It was well north of the Civil War fighting in Missouri; it was the shortest route to South Pass in the Rockies in Wyoming; and it would follow a fertile river that would encourage settlement. Durant had hired the future president [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1857 when he was an attorney to represent him in a business matter about a bridge over the Missouri. Now Lincoln was responsible for choosing the eastern terminus, and he relied on Durant's counsel. Durant advocated for Omaha, and he was so confident of the choice that he began buying up land in Nebraska.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Key individuals ==\n[[File:Leland Stanford and CPRR Officers 1870.jpg|thumb|upright|Leland Stanford and the officers of the CPRR in 1870]]\n\n=== Asa Whitney ===\nOne of the most prominent champions of the central route railroad was [[Asa Whitney]]. He envisioned a route from Chicago and the Great Lakes to northern California, paid for by the sale of land to settlers along the route. Whitney traveled widely to solicit support from businessmen and politicians, printed maps and pamphlets, and submitted several proposals to [[United States Congress|Congress]], all at his own expense. In June 1845, he led a team along part of the proposed route to assess its feasibility.<ref>Whitney, Asa \"A project for a railroad to the Pacific\". New York: George W. Wood (1849) p. 55</ref>\n\nLegislation to begin construction of the ''Pacific Railroad'' (called the ''Memorial of Asa Whitney'') was first introduced to Congress by Representative [[Zadock Pratt]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/e_early.html|title=PBS American Experience \u2013 Transcontinental Railroad \u2013 Whitney Biography|publisher=}}</ref> Congress did not immediately act on Whitney's proposal.\n\n=== Theodore Judah ===\n{{Main|Theodore Judah}}\n\n[[File:CPRR Chief Engineer Theodore D.

Clement, Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track]]\n\n[[Theodore Judah]] was a fervent supporter of the central route railroad. He lobbied vigorously in favor of the project and undertook the survey of the route through the rugged Sierra Nevada, one of the chief obstacles of the project.\n\nIn 1852, Judah was chief engineer for the newly formed [[Sacramento Valley Railroad (1852-1877)|Sacramento Valley Railroad]], the first railroad built west of the [[Mississippi River]]. Although the railroad later went bankrupt once the easy placer gold deposits around [[Placerville, California]] were depleted, Judah was convinced that a properly financed railroad could pass from [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] through the Sierra Nevada mountains to reach the [[Great Basin]] and hook up with rail lines coming from the East.<ref>Markham, Edwin \"The Romance of the 'C.P.' \" SUCCESS (magazine). New York: The Success Company, Vol. VI, Number 106, March, 1903. pp. 127-130</ref>\n\nIn 1856, Judah wrote a 13,000-word proposal in support of a Pacific railroad and distributed it to Cabinet secretaries, congressmen and other influential people. In September 1859, Judah was chosen to be the accredited lobbyist for the Pacific Railroad Convention, which indeed approved his plan to survey, finance and engineer the road. Judah returned to Washington in December 1859. He had a lobbying office in the [[United States Capitol]], received an audience with President [[James Buchanan]], and represented the Convention before Congress.<ref name=\"judah\">\"A Memorial and Biographical History of Northern California: Illustrated. Containing a History of This Important Section of the Pacific Coast from the Earliest Period of Its Occupancyand Biographical Mention of Many of Its Most Eminent Pioneers and Also of Prominent Citizens of Today\". Chicago: Lewis Publishing Company. (1891) pp. 214-221</ref>\n\nJudah returned to California in 1860. He continued to search for a more practical route through the Sierra suitable for a railroad. In mid-1860, local miner Daniel Strong had surveyed a route over the Sierra for a wagon toll road, which he realized would also suit a railroad. He described his discovery in a letter to Judah. Together, they formed an association to solicit subscriptions from local merchants and businessmen to support their proposed railroad.<ref name=\"judah\"/>\n\nFrom January or February 1861 until July, Judah and Strong led a 10-person expedition to survey the route for the railroad over the Sierra Nevada through Clipper Gap and [[Emigrant Gap]], over [[Donner Pass]], and south to [[Truckee, California|Truckee]]. They discovered a way across the Sierras that was gradual enough to be made suitable for a railroad, although it still needed a lot of work.<ref name=\"judah\"/>\n\n=== The Big Four ===\n: ''Main articles: [[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]]'' ''and [[Central Pacific Railroad]]''\n\n[[File:Leland Stanford Governor.jpg|thumb|upright|Leland Stanford's official gubernatorial portrait]]\n\nFour northern California businessmen formed the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]: [[Leland Stanford]], (1824&ndash;1893),  President; [[Collis Potter Huntington]], (1821&ndash;1900),  Vice President; [[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]], (1813&ndash;1878), Treasurer; [[Charles Crocker]], (1822&ndash;1888),   Construction Supervisor.

Durant and its financing arrangements were, unlike those of the CPRR, mired in controversy and scandals.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Authorization and funding ==\n{{Main|Pacific Railroad Acts}}\n\nIn February 1860, Iowa Representative [[Samuel Ryan Curtis|Samuel Curtis]] introduced a bill to fund the railroad. It passed the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] but died when it could not be reconciled with the Senate version due to opposition from southern states who wanted a southern route near the 42nd parallel.<ref name=\"judah\"/> Curtis tried and failed again in 1861. After the southern states seceded from the Union, the House of Representatives approved the bill on May 6, 1862, and the Senate on June 20. Lincoln signed the [[Pacific Railway Acts|Pacific Railroad Act of 1862]] into law on July 1. It authorized creation of two companies, the [[Central Pacific Railroad|Central Pacific]] in the west and the [[Union Pacific]] in the mid-west, to build the railroad. The legislation called for building and operating a new railroad from the Missouri River at [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]],  west to [[Sacramento, California]], and on to [[San Francisco Bay]].<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html \"An Act to aid in the construction of a railroad and telegraph line from the Missouri river to the Pacific ocean, and to secure to the government the use of the same for postal, military, and other purposes] 12 Stat. 489, July 1, 1862.</ref>  Another act to supplement the first was passed in 1864.<ref>[http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Pacific_Railroad_Acts.html#1862-03 Pacific Railroad Acts] accessed March 25, 2013.</ref>  The [[Pacific Railroad Act]] of 1863 established the [[standard gauge]] to be used in these federally financed railways.\n\n=== Federal financing ===\nTo finance the project, the act authorized the federal government to issue 30-year U.S. [[government bond]]s (at 6% interest). The railroad companies were paid $16,000 per mile (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|16000|1861|r=-3}}}} per mile today) for track laid on a level grade, $32,000 per mile (about  ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|32000|1861|r=-3}}}} per mile today) for track laid in foothills, and $48,000 per mile (or about ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|48000|1861|r=-3}}}} per mile today) for track laid in mountains.

(1969).</ref>  Durant enticed other investors by offering to front money for the stock they purchased in their names. This scheme enabled Durant to control about half of the railroad stock. The initial construction of Union Pacific grade traversed land owned by Durant. Durant's railroad was paid by the mile, and to further inflate its profits, the Union Pacific built [[oxbows]] of unneeded track, and by July 4, 1865, it had only reached {{convert|40|mi|km}} from Omaha after 2\u00bd years of construction.{{Citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source|date=February 2020}}\n\nDurant manipulated market prices on his stocks by spreading rumors about which railroads he had an interest in were being considered for connection with the Union Pacific. First he touted rumors that his fledgling M&M Railroad had a deal in the works, while secretly buying stock in the depressed [[Cedar Rapids and Missouri Railroad]]. Then he circulated rumors that the CR&M had plans to connect to the Union Pacific, at which point he began buying back the M&M stock at depressed prices.

He invited Judah to his office to hear his proposal in detail.  Huntington persuaded Judah to accept financing from himself and four others: [[Mark Hopkins (railroad)|Mark Hopkins]], his business partner; James Bailey, a jeweler; [[Leland Stanford]], a grocer; and [[Charles Crocker]], a dry-goods merchant. They initially invested $1,500 each and formed a board of directors. These investors became known as [[The Big Four (Central Pacific Railroad)|The Big Four]], and their railroad was called the [[Central Pacific Railroad]]. Each eventually made millions of dollars from their investments and control of the Central Pacific Railroad.\n\nBefore major construction could begin, Judah traveled back to New York City to raise funds to buy out The Big Four. However, shortly after arriving in New York, Judah died on November 2, 1863, of [[yellow fever]] that he had contracted while traveling over the [[Panama Railroad]]'s transit of the [[Isthmus of Panama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Ephemera/Judah%20Memoriam%20BCC.html|title=''In Memoriam, Theodore D.

If the railroad companies failed to sell the land granted them within three years, they were required to sell it at prevailing government price for homesteads: {{convert|1.25|$/acre|$/ha|2}}. If they failed to repay the bonds, all remaining railroad property, including trains and tracks, would revert to the U.S. government.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} To encourage settlement in the west, [[37th United States Congress|Congress]] (1861\u20131863) passed the [[Homestead Acts]] which granted an applicant {{convert|160|acre|ha}} of land with the requirement that the applicant improve the land. This incentive encouraged thousands of settlers to move west.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Railroad self-dealing ===\nThe federal legislation lacked adequate oversight and accountability. The two companies took advantage of these weaknesses in the legislation to manipulate the project and produce extra profit for themselves. Despite the generous subsidies offered by the federal government, the railroad capitalists knew they would not turn a profit on the railroad business for many months, possibly years. They determined to make a profit on the construction itself. Both groups of financiers formed independent companies to complete the project, and they controlled management of the new companies along with the railroad ventures. This self-dealing allowed them to build in generous profit margins paid out by the railroad companies.

The Central Pacific hired some Canadian and British civil engineers and surveyors with extensive experience building railroads, but it had a difficult time finding semi-skilled labor. Most Caucasians in California preferred to work in the mines or agriculture. \n\nThe railroad experimented by hiring local emigrant Chinese as manual laborers, many of whom were escaping the poverty and terrors of the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. When they proved themselves as workers, the [[Central_Pacific_Railroad|CPRR]] from that point forward preferred to hire Chinese, and even set up recruiting efforts in [[Guangdong|Canton]].<ref name=\"Kraus Chinese 1969\"/> Despite their small stature<ref>Reef, Catherine \"Working in America\", p. 79.

''Harper's Weekly'' December 7, 1867]]\n\n=== Construction begun ===\nThe Central Pacific broke ground on January 8, 1863. Due to the lack of transportation alternatives from the manufacturing centers on the east coast, virtually all of their tools and machinery including rails, [[railroad switch]]es, [[railroad turntable]]s, [[railroad car|freight]] and passenger cars, and [[steam locomotive]]s were transported first by train to east coast ports. They were then loaded on ships which either sailed around South America's [[Cape Horn]], or offloaded the cargo at the [[Isthmus of Panama]], where it was sent across via [[paddle steamer]] and the [[Panama Railroad]]. The Panama Railroad gauge was {{convert|5|ft|mm|0}}, which was incompatible with the {{convert|4|ft|8+1/2|in|mm|adj=on}} gauge used by the CPRR equipment. The latter route was about twice as expensive per pound.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Once the machinery and tools reached the [[San Francisco Bay]] area, they were put aboard river paddle steamers which transported them up the final {{convert|130|mi|km}} of the [[Sacramento River]] to the new state capital in [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]]. Many of these steam engines, railroad cars, and other machinery were shipped dismantled and had to be reassembled.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Wooden timbers for railroad ties, trestles, bridges, firewood, and telegraph poles were harvested in California and transported to the project site.\n\nThe Union Pacific Railroad did not start construction for another 18 months until July 1865. They were delayed by difficulties obtaining financial backing and the unavailability of workers and materials due to the Civil War. Their start point in the new city of [[Omaha, Nebraska]] was not yet connected via railroad to [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]]. Equipment needed to begin work was initially delivered to Omaha and Council Bluffs by paddle steamers on the [[Missouri River]]. The Union Pacific was so slow in beginning construction during 1865 that they sold two of the four steam locomotives they had purchased.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nAfter the [[U.S. Civil War]] ended in 1865, the Union Pacific still competed for railroad supplies with companies who were building or repairing railroads in the south, and prices rose.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n=== Rail standards ===\n[[File:First Day Cover Sc922 75th Anniversary First Transcontinental Railroad May 10, 1944.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|First Day Cover for the 75th Anniversary of the Driving of the Last Spike (May 10, 1944)]]\nAt that time in the United States, there were two primary standards for track gauge, as defined by the distance between the two rails. In Britain, the [[standard gauge]] was {{Track gauge|ussg}}, and this had been adopted by the majority of northern railways. But much of the south had adopted a {{Track gauge|5ft|lk=on}} gauge. Transferring railway cars across a [[break of gauge]] required changing out the [[Bogie|trucks]]. Alternatively, cargo was offloaded and reloaded, a time-consuming effort that delayed cargo shipments. For the transcontinental railroad, the builders adopted the British standard, what is now called [[standard gauge]].<ref name=\"daspit\">{{cite web|last1=Daspit|first1=Tom|title=The Days They Changed the Gauge|url=http://southern.railfan.net/ties/1966/66-8/gauge.html|accessdate=10 October 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Bessemer process]] and [[open hearth furnace]] steel-making were in use by 1865, but the advantages of steel rails which lasted much longer than iron rails had not yet been demonstrated.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The [[Rail profile|rails]] used initially in building the rail way were nearly all made of an [[iron]] flat-bottomed modified [[I-beam]] profile weighing {{convert|56|lb/yd|kg/m|1}} or {{convert|66|lb/yd|kg/m|1}}.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}  The railroad companies were intent on completing the project as rapidly as possible at a minimum cost. Within a few years, nearly all railroads converted to [[Rail profile|steel rails]].\n\n=== Time zones and telegraph usage ===\nTime was not standardized across the United States and Canada until November 18, 1883. In 1865, each railroad set its own time to minimize scheduling errors. To communicate easily up and down the line, the railroads built telegraph lines alongside the railroad. These lines eventually superseded the original [[First Transcontinental Telegraph]] which followed much of the [[Mormon Trail]] up the [[North Platte River]] and across the very thinly populated [[Central Nevada Route]] through central Utah and Nevada. The telegraph lines along the railroad were easier to protect and maintain.  Many of the original telegraph lines were abandoned as the telegraph business was consolidated with the railroad telegraph lines.<ref>{{cite web|title=Transcontinental Telegraph Line (U.S.)|url=http://ethw.org/Transcontinental_Telegraph_Line_(U.S.)|website=Engineering and Technology History Wiki|accessdate=6 March 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Union Pacific route ===\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2016}}\n\n[[File:Transcontinental railroad route.png|thumb|left|Route of the first American transcontinental railroad from Sacramento, California, to Council Bluffs, Iowa.

Omaha was chosen by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]] as the location of its Transfer Depot where up to seven railroads could transfer mail and other goods to Union Pacific trains bound for the west.\n\nTrains were initially transported across the Missouri River by ferry before they could access the western tracks beginning in [[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]], [[Nebraska Territory]].

Durant]], one of the chief financiers of the Union Pacific.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nWith the end of the Civil War and increased government supervision in the offing, Durant hired his former M&M engineer [[Grenville M.

Casement|John \"Jack\" Casement]] was hired as the new Chief Engineer of the Union Pacific. He equipped several railroad cars to serve as portable bunkhouses for the workers and gathered men and supplies to push the railroad rapidly west. Among the bunkhouses, Casement added a galley car to prepare meals, and he even provided for a herd of cows to be moved with the railhead and bunk cars to provide fresh meat. Hunters were hired to provide [[American bison|buffalo]] meat from the large herds of American bison.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe small survey parties who scouted ahead to locate the roadbed were sometimes attacked and killed by raiding Native Americans. In response, the U.S. Army instituted active cavalry patrols that grew larger as the Native Americans grew more aggressive. Temporary, \"[[Hell on Wheels|Hell on wheels]]\" towns, made mostly of canvas tents, accompanied the railroad as construction headed west.<ref>{{cite book |last=Klein |first=Maury |date=2006 |orig-year=1987 |title=Union Pacific: Volume I, 1862\u20131893 |publisher=U of Minnesota press |pages=100\u2013101 |isbn=1452908737}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last=Ambrose |first=Stephen E. |date=2000 |title=Nothing Like It In the World |url=https://archive.org/details/nothinglikeitinw00ambr |url-access=registration |pages=[https://archive.org/details/nothinglikeitinw00ambr/page/217 217\u2013219]}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Platte River]] was too shallow and meandering to provide river transport, but the Platte river valley headed west and sloped up gradually at about {{convert|6|ft/mi|m/km}}, often allowing to lay a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) of track a day or more in 1866 as the Union Pacific finally started moving rapidly west. Building bridges to cross creeks and rivers was the main source of delays. Near where the [[Platte River]] splits into the [[North Platte River]] and [[South Platte River]], the railroad bridged the North Platte River over a {{convert|2600|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} bridge (nicknamed \u00bd mile bridge). It was built across the shallow but wide North Platte resting on piles driven by steam [[pile driver]]s.<ref>[http://digital.denverlibrary.org/cdm/singleitem/collection/p15330coll22/id/70512/rec/1 North Platte Bridge] accessed March 14, 2013.</ref> Here they built the \"railroad\" town of [[North Platte, Nebraska]] in December 1866 after completing about {{convert|240|mi|km|}} of track that year. In late 1866, former [[Major General]] [[Grenville M. Dodge]] was appointed Chief Engineer on the Union Pacific, but hard working General \"Jack\" Casement continued to work as chief construction \"boss\" and his brother Daniel Casement continued as a financial officer.\n\nThe original emigrant route across Wyoming of the Oregon, Mormon and California Trails, after progressing up the [[Platte River]] valley, went up the [[North Platte River]] valley through [[Casper, Wyoming]], along the [[Sweetwater River (Wyoming)|Sweetwater River]] and over the [[Continental Divide]] at the {{convert|7412|ft|m|adj=on}} [[South Pass (Wyoming)|South Pass]]. The original westward travelers in their ox and mule pulled wagons tried to stick to river valleys to avoid as much road building as possible\u2014gradients and sharp corners were usually of little or no concern to them. The ox and mule pulled wagons were the original off-road vehicles in their day since nearly all of the [[Emigrant Trail]]s went cross country over rough, unimproved trails. The route over South Pass's main advantage for wagons pulled by oxen or mules was a shorter elevation over an \"easy\" pass to cross and its \"easy\" connection to nearby river valleys on both sides of the continental divide for water and grass. The emigrant trails were closed in winter. The North Platte\u2013South Pass route was far less beneficial for a railroad, as it was about {{convert|150|mi|km}} longer and much more expensive to construct up the narrow, steep and rocky canyons of the North Platte. The route along the North Platte was also further from [[Denver, Colorado]], and went across difficult terrain, while a railroad connection to that City was already being planned for and surveyed.\n\nEfforts to survey a new, shorter, \"better\" route had been underway since 1864. By 1867, a new route was found and surveyed that went along part of the [[South Platte River]] in western Nebraska and after entering what is now the state of [[Wyoming]], ascended a gradual sloping ridge between [[Lodgepole Creek]] and [[Crow Creek (South Platte River)|Crow Creek]] to the {{convert|8200|ft|m|adj=on}} [[Sherman Summit|Evans pass]] (also called Sherman's Pass) which was discovered by the Union Pacific employed English surveyor and engineer, James Evans, in about 1864.<ref>[http://up150.com/timeline/sherman-summit Discovery of Evans Pass] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120414011022/http://up150.com/timeline/sherman-summit |date=April 14, 2012 }} accessed March 8, 2013.</ref> This pass now is marked by the [[Ames Monument]] ({{coord|41.131281|N|105.398045|W|display=inline}}) marking its significance and commemorating two of the main backers of the Union Pacific Railroad. From North Platte, Nebraska (elevation {{convert|2834|ft|m|disp=or}}), the railroad proceeded westward and upward along a new path across the [[Nebraska Territory]] and [[Wyoming Territory]] (then part of the [[Dakota Territory]]) along the north bank of the [[South Platte River]] and into what would become the state of Wyoming at Lone Pine, Wyoming. Evans Pass was located between what would become the new \"railroad\" towns of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]] and [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]]. Connecting to this pass, about {{convert|15|mi|km}} west of Cheyenne, was the one place across the [[Laramie Mountains]] that had a narrow \"guitar neck\" of land that crossed the mountains without serious erosion at the so-called \"gangplank\" ({{coord|41.099746|N|105.153205|W|display=inline}}) discovered by [[Major General]] [[Grenville Dodge]] in 1865 when he was in the U.S. Army.<ref>[http://www.laramieboomerang.com/articles/2013/02/28/news/doc512ef29f863e8182631906.txt Gankplank discovery] accessed March 5, 2013.</ref> The new route surveyed across Wyoming was over {{convert|150|mi|km}} shorter, had a flatter profile, allowing for cheaper and easier railroad construction, and also went closer by Denver and the known coalfields in the [[Wasatch Range|Wasatch]] and [[Laramie Range]]s.\n\nThe railroad gained about {{convert|3200|ft|m}} in the {{convert|220|mi|km}} climb to Cheyenne from North Platte, Nebraska\u2014about {{convert|15|ft/mi|m/km}}\u2014a very gentle slope of less than one degree average. This \"new\" route had never become an emigrant route because it lacked the water and grass to feed the emigrants' oxen and mules. Steam locomotives did not need grass, and the railroad companies could drill wells for water if necessary.\n\nCoal had been discovered in Wyoming and reported on by [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] in his 1843 expedition across Wyoming, and was already being exploited by Utah residents from towns like [[Coalville, Utah]] and later [[Kemmerer, Wyoming]] by the time the Transcontinental railroad was built. Union Pacific needed coal to fuel its [[steam locomotive]]s on the almost treeless plains across Nebraska and Wyoming. Coal shipments by rail were also looked on as a potentially major source of income\u2014this potential is still being realized.\n\n[[File:Dale Creek Bridge Union Pacific Railroad Company by Andrew J Russell.jpg|thumb|right|Dale Creek Bridge]]\n\nThe Union Pacific reached the new railroad town of Cheyenne in December 1867, having laid about {{convert|270|mi|km}} that year.

Elevated {{convert|6070|ft|m}} above sea level, and sitting on the new Union Pacific route with a connection to Denver, Cheyenne was chosen to become a major railroad center and was equipped with extensive railroad yards, maintenance facilities, and a Union Pacific presence. Its location made it a good base for [[Bank engine|helper locomotives]] to couple to trains with [[snowplow]]s to help clear the tracks of snow or help haul heavy freight over Evans pass. The Union Pacific's junction with the Denver Railroad with its connection to [[Kansas City, Kansas]], [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and the railroads east of the Missouri River again increased Cheyenne's importance as the junction of two major railroads. Cheyenne later became Wyoming's largest city and the capital of the new state of Wyoming.\n\nThe railroad established many townships along the way: [[Fremont, Nebraska|Fremont]], [[Elkhorn, Nebraska|Elkhorn]], [[Grand Island, Nebraska|Grand Island]], [[North Platte, Nebraska|North Platte]], [[Ogallala, Nebraska|Ogallala]] and [[Sidney, Nebraska|Sidney]] as the railroad followed the Platte River across Nebraska territory. The railroad even dipped into what would become the new state of [[Colorado]] after crossing the North Platte River as it followed the [[South Platte River]] west into what would become [[Julesburg, Colorado|Julesburg]] before turning northwest along Lodgepole Creek into Wyoming. In the [[Dakota Territory]] (Wyoming) the new towns of [[Cheyenne, Wyoming|Cheyenne]], [[Laramie, Wyoming|Laramie]], [[Rawlins, Wyoming|Rawlins]] (named for [[Union Army|Union]] General [[John Aaron Rawlins]], who camped in the locality in 1867<ref>Stewart, George R.

To speed up construction as much as possible, Union Pacific contracted several thousand Mormon workers to cut, fill, trestle, bridge, blast and tunnel its way down the rugged Weber River Canyon to [[Ogden, Utah]], ahead of the railroad construction.

As the railroad climbed out of Sacramento up to Donner Summit, there was only one {{convert|3|mi|km|adj=on}} section near \"Cape Horn CPRR\"<ref>Cape Horn CPRR [https://www.google.com/imgres?imgurl=http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/65/C.P.R.R._train_at_Cape_Horn,_by_Thomas_Houseworth_%2526_Co..jpg&imgrefurl=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:C.P.R.R._train_at_Cape_Horn,_by_Thomas_Houseworth_%2526_Co..jpg&h=1419&w=2737&sz=1669&tbnid=8IfJNhakdb9bqM:&tbnh=62&tbnw=120&zoom=1&usg=__R8lvvJNl_a9FCTGufLMRY_6Iz2I=&docid=nJYpVW4BZ669bM&itg=1&hl=en&sa=X&ei=8RU9UdL0GcruyQH-54GoCQ&ved=0CEwQ9QEwAw&dur=166] accessed March 10, 2013.</ref> where the railroad grade slightly exceeded two percent.\n\n[[File:Dutch Flat Wagon Road 1864.jpg|thumb|left|1864 advertisement for the opening of the [[Dutch Flat Wagon Road]]]]\nIn June 1864, the Central Pacific railroad entrepreneurs opened Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road (DFDLWR).<ref>Dutch Flat and Donner Lake Wagon Road [http://cprr.org/Museum/DFDLWR_Duncan.html] Accessed July 23, 2009.</ref> Costing about $300,000 and a years worth of work, this toll road wagon route was opened over much of the route the Central Pacific railroad (CPRR) would use over Donner Summit to carry freight and passengers needed by the CPRR and to carry other cargo over their toll road to and from the ever advancing railhead and over the Sierra to the gold and silver mining towns of Nevada. As the railroad advanced, their freight rates with the combined rail and wagon shipments would become much more competitive. The volume of the toll road freight traffic to Nevada was estimated to be about $13,000,000 a year as the [[Comstock Lode]] boomed, and getting even part of this freight traffic would help pay for the railroad construction. When the railroad reached Reno, it had the majority of all Nevada freight shipments, and the price of goods in Nevada dropped significantly as the freight charges to Nevada dropped significantly. The rail route over the Sierras followed the general route of the Truckee branch of the [[California Trail]], going east over Donner Pass and down the rugged [[Truckee River]] valley.\n\nThe route over the Sierra had been plotted out by Judah in preliminary surveys before his death in 1863. Judah's deputy, [[Samuel S. Montague]] was appointed as Central Pacific's new Chief Engineer, with Lewis M. Clement as Assistant Chief Engineer and Charles Cadwalader as second assistant. To build the new railroad, detailed surveys had to be run that showed where the cuts, fills, trestles, bridges and tunnels would have to be built. Work that was identified as taking a long time was started as soon as its projected track location could be ascertained and work crews, supplies and road work equipment found to be sent ahead. Tunnels, trestles and bridges were nearly all built this way. The spread-out nature of the work resulted in the work being split into two divisions, with L.M. Clement taking the upper division from Blue Ca\u00f1on to Truckee and Cadwalader taking the lower division from Truckee to the Nevada border. Other assistant engineers were assigned to specific tasks such as building a bridge, tunnel or trestle which was done by the workers under experienced supervisors.<ref name=\"lmc\"/>\n\n[[File:CPRR Sierra Grade @ Donner Summit (1869; 2003).jpg|right|thumb|The CPRR grade at Donner Summit as it appeared in 1869 and 2003]]\nIn total, the Central Pacific had eleven tunnel projects (Nos. 3 through 13) under construction in the Sierra from 1865\u201368, with seven tunnels located in a {{convert|2|mi|km|adj=on}} stretch on the east side of Donner Summit. The tunnels were usually built by drilling a series of holes in the tunnel face, filling them with black powder and detonating it to break the rock free. The black powder was provided by the '''California Powder Works''' near [[Santa Cruz, California]]. These works had started production in 1864 after the [[U.S. Civil War]] had cut off shipments of black powder from the East to the mining and railroad industry of California and Nevada. The Central Pacific was a prolific user of black powder, often using up to 500 kegs of {{convert|25|lb|kg}} each per day.<ref>California Powder Works [http://railroad.lindahall.org/essays/black-powder.html] accessed March 19, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe summit tunnel (Number 6), {{convert|1660|ft|m}}, was started in late 1865, well ahead of the railhead. Through solid granite, the summit tunnel progressed at a rate of only about {{convert|0.98|ft|m}} per day per face as it was being worked by three eight-hour shifts of workers, hand drilling holes with a rock drill and hammer, filling them with black powder and trying to blast the granite loose. One crew worked drilling holes on the faces and another crew collected and removed the loosened rock after each explosion. The workers were pulled off the summit tunnel and the track grading east of Donner Pass in the winter of 1865\u201366 as there was no way to supply them, nor quarters they could have lived in. The crews were transferred to work on bridges and track grading on the Truckee River canyon.\n\n[[File:CPRR Summit Tunnel Central Shaft.jpg|thumb|left|The vertical central shaft of the CPRR \"Summit Tunnel\" (Tunnel #6) at Donner Summit which allowed drilling and excavation to be carried out on four faces at once]]\nIn 1866 they put in a {{convert|125|ft|m|adj=on}} vertical shaft in the center of the summit tunnel and started work towards the east and west tunnel faces, giving four working faces on the summit tunnel to speed up progress. A steam engine off an old locomotive was brought up with much effort over the wagon road and used as a winch driver to help remove loosened rock from the vertical shaft and two working faces. By the winter of 1866\u201367, work had progressed sufficiently and a camp had been built for workers on the summit tunnel which allowed work to continue. The cross section of a tunnel face was a {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}, {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=mid|-high}} oval with an {{convert|11|ft|m|adj=on}} vertical wall.  Progress on the tunnel sped up to over {{convert|1.5|ft|m}} per day per face when they started using the newly invented [[nitroglycerin]]\u2014manufactured near the tunnel. They used nitroglycerin to deepen the summit tunnel to the required {{convert|16|ft|m|adj=on}} height after the four tunnel faces met, and made even faster progress. Nearly all other tunnels were worked on both tunnel faces and met in the middle. Depending on the material the tunnels penetrated, they were left unlined or lined with brick, rock walls or timber and post. Some tunnels were designed to bend in the middle to align with the track bed curvature. Despite this potential complication, nearly all the different tunnel center lines met within {{convert|2|in|cm}} or so. The detailed survey work that made these tunnel digs as precise as required was nearly all done by the Canadian-born and -trained Lewis Clement, the CPRR's Chief Assistant Engineer and Superintendent of Track, and his assistants.<ref name=\"lmc\">Cooper, Bruce C.

The type of material determined the slope of the V and how much material would have to be removed. Ideally, these cuts would be matched with valley fills that could use the dug out material to bring the road bed up to grade\u2014[[cut and fill]] construction. In the 1860s there was no heavy equipment that could be used to make these cuts or haul it away to make the fills. The options were to dig it out by pick and shovel, haul the hillside material by [[wheelbarrow]] and/or horse or mule cart or blast it loose. To blast a V shaped cut out, they had to drill several holes up to {{convert|20|ft|m}} deep in the material, fill them with black powder, and blast the material away. Since the Central Pacific was in a hurry, they were profligate users of black powder to blast their way though the hills. The only disadvantage came when a nearby valley needed fill to get across it. The explosive technique often blew most of the potential fill material down the hillside, making it unavailable for fill.<ref>The Use of Black Powder and Nitroglycerine on the Transcontinental Railroad [http://railroad.lindahall.org/essays/black-powder.html] accessed March 19, 2013.</ref><ref>California Newspapers, 1865\u201366 [http://cprr.org/Museum/Newspapers/] accessed March 19, 2013.</ref> Initially, many valleys were bridged by \"temporary\" trestles that could be rapidly built and were later replaced by much lower maintenance and permanent solid fill. The existing railroad made transporting and putting material in valleys much easier\u2014load it on railway dump cars, haul where needed and dump it over the side of the trestle.\n\n[[File:Donner Pass Summit Tunnel West Portal.jpg|thumb|right|The Summit Tunnel at Donner Summit, West Portal ''(Composite image with the tracks removed in 1993 digitally restored)'']]\nThe route down the eastern Sierras was done on the south side of [[Donner Lake]] with a series of switchbacks carved into the mountain. The Truckee River, which drains [[Lake Tahoe]], had already found and scoured out the best route across the [[Carson Range]] of mountains east of the Sierras. The route down the rugged Truckee River Canyon, including required bridges, was done ahead of the main summit tunnel completion. To expedite the building of the railroad through the Truckee River canyon, the Central Pacific hauled two small locomotives, [[railcar]]s, rails and other material on wagons and sleighs to what is now [[Truckee, California]] and worked the winter of 1867\u201368 on their way down Truckee canyon ahead of the tracks being completed to Truckee. In Truckee canyon, five [[Howe truss]] bridges had to be built. This gave them a head start on getting to the \"easy\" miles across Nevada.\n\nIn order to keep the higher portions of the Sierra grade open in the winter, {{convert|37|mi}} of timber [[snow shed]]s were built between Blue Ca\u00f1on and Truckee in addition to utilizing [[snowplow]]s pushed by locomotives, as well as manual shovelling. With the advent of more efficient oil fired steam and later diesel electric power to drive plows, flangers, spreaders, and rotary snow plows, most of the wooden snowsheds have long since been removed as obsolete. Tunnels 1\u20135 and Tunnel 13 of the original 1860s tunnels on Track 1 of the Sierra grade remain in use today, while additional new tunnels were later driven when the grade was double tracked over the first quarter of the twentieth century. In 1993, the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] (which operated the CPRR-built [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]\u2013[[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] line until its 1996 merger with the [[Union Pacific]]) closed and pulled up the {{convert|6.7|mi|adj=on}} section of Track #1 over the summit running between the Norden complex (Shed 26, MP 192.1)<ref>Norden at {{coord|39.3176|-120.3584|display=inline}}</ref> and the covered crossovers in Shed #47 (MP 198.8)<ref>Shed 47 visible at {{coord|39.3116|-120.269|display=inline}}</ref> about a mile east of the old [[Flying junction|flyover]] at [[Eder, California|Eder]], bypassing and abandoning the tunnel 6\u20138 complex, the concrete snowsheds just beyond them, and tunnels 9\u201312 ending at MP 195.7, all of which had been located on Track 1 within two miles of the summit.<ref>East end of Tunnel 41 at {{coord|39.301|-120.3003|display=inline}} with former track 1 passing above.</ref> Since then all east- and westbound traffic has been run over the Track #2 grade crossing the summit about one mile (1.6&nbsp;km) south of Donner Pass through the {{convert|10322|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} Tunnel #41 (\"The Big Hole\") running under Mt. Judah between Soda Springs and Eder, which was opened in 1925 when the summit section of the grade was double tracked. This routing change was made because the Track 2 and Tunnel 41 Summit crossing is far easier and less expensive to maintain and keep open in the harsh Sierra winters.<ref>{{cite web|author=Cooper, Bruce C.|url=http://cprr.org/Museum/Sierra_Grade_8-2003/Donner_Pass-Summit_Tunnel/index.html |title=Summit Tunnel & Donner Pass |publisher=CPRR.org |date=August 2003}}</ref>\n\nOn June 18, 1868, the Central Pacific reached [[Reno, Nevada]], after completing {{convert|132|mi|km}} of railroad up and over the Sierras from [[Sacramento, California]]. By then the railroad had already been prebuilt down the Truckee River on the much flatter land from Reno to [[Wadsworth, Nevada]], where they bridged the Truckee for the last time. From there, they struggled across a [[Lahontan Valley|forty mile desert]] to the end of the Humboldt river at the [[Humboldt Sink]]. From the end of the Humboldt, they continued east over the [[Great Basin Desert]] bordering the [[Humboldt River]] to [[Wells, Nevada]]. One of the most troublesome problems found on this route along the Humboldt was at [[Palisade Canyon]] (near [[Carlin, Nevada]]), where for {{convert|12|mi|km}} the line had to be built between the river and basalt cliffs. From [[Wells, Nevada]] to [[Promontory Summit]], the Railroad left the Humboldt and proceeded across the Nevada and Utah desert. Water for the [[steam locomotive]]s was provided by wells, springs, or pipelines to nearby water sources. Water was often pumped into the water tanks with [[windmill]]s. Train fuel and [[water spot]]s on the early trains with steam locomotives may have been as often as every {{convert|10|mi|km}}. On one memorable occasion, not far from Promontory, the Central Pacific crews organized an army of workers and five train loads of construction material, and laid {{convert|10|mi|km}} of track on a prepared rail bed in one day\u2014-a record that still stands today. The Central Pacific and Union Pacific raced to get as much track laid as possible, and the Central Pacific laid about {{convert|560|mi|km}} of track from Reno to Promontory Summit in the one year before the Last Spike was driven on May 10, 1869.\n\nCentral Pacific had 1,694 freight cars available by May 1869, with more under construction in their Sacramento yard. Major repairs and maintenance on the Central Pacific rolling stock was done in their Sacramento maintenance yard. Near the end of 1869, Central Pacific had 162 locomotives, of which 2 had two drivers (drive wheels), 110 had four drivers, and 50 had six drivers. The [[steam locomotive]]s had been purchased in the eastern states and shipped to California by sea. Thirty-six additional locomotives were built and coming west, and twenty-eight more were under construction. There was a shortage of passenger cars and more had to be ordered. The first Central Pacific sleeper, the \"Silver Palace Sleeping Car\", arrived at Sacramento on June 8, 1868.<ref>Constructing the Central Pacific Railroad [http://cprr.org/Museum/Galloway7.html] accessed March 13, 2013.</ref>\n\nThe CPRR route passed through [[Newcastle, California|Newcastle]] and [[Truckee, California|Truckee]] in California, [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], [[Wadsworth, Nevada|Wadsworth]], [[Winnemucca, Nevada|Winnemucca]], [[Battle Mountain, Nevada|Battle Mountain]], [[Elko, Nevada|Elko]] and [[Wells, Nevada|Wells]] in Nevada (with many more fuel and water stops), before connecting with the Union Pacific line at Promontory Summit in the Utah Territory. When the eastern end of the CPRR was extended to Ogden by purchasing the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] line from Promontory for about $2.8 million in 1870, it ended the short period of a boom town for [[Promontory, Utah|Promontory]], extended the Central Pacific tracks about {{convert|60|mi|km}} and made Ogden a major terminus on the transcontinental railroad, as passengers and freight switched railroads there.\n\n[[File:Reno to Virginia City NV CPRR-V&TRR Ticket 1878 .jpg|thumb|left|CPRR issued ticket for passage from Reno to Virginia City, NV on the V&TRR, 1878]]\nSubsequent to the railhead's meeting at Promontory Summit, Utah Territory, the San Joaquin River Bridge at Mossdale Crossing (near present-day [[Lathrop, California]]) was completed on September 8, 1869. As a result, the western part of the route was extended from Sacramento to the [[Alameda Terminal]] in [[Alameda, California]], and shortly thereafter, to the [[Oakland Pier|Oakland Long Wharf]] at [[Oakland Point]] in [[Oakland, California]], and on to [[San Jose, California]]. Train ferries transferred some railroad cars to and from the Oakland wharves and tracks to wharves and tracks in [[San Francisco]]. Before the CPRR was completed, developers were building other feeder railroads like the [[Virginia and Truckee Railroad]] to the [[Comstock Lode]] diggings in [[Virginia City, Nevada]], and several different extensions in California and Nevada to reach other cities there. Some of their main cargo was the thousands of [[cord (unit)|cords]] of firewood needed for the many steam engines and pumps, cooking stoves, heating stoves etc. in Comstock Lode towns and the tons of ice needed by the miners as they worked ever deeper into the \"hot\" Comstock Lode ore body. In the mines, temperatures could get above {{convert|120|F}} at the work face and a miner often used over {{convert|100|lb|kg}} of ice per shift. This new railroad connected to the Central Pacific near [[Reno, Nevada|Reno]], and went through [[Carson City, Nevada|Carson City]], the new capital of Nevada.<ref>{{cite web\n| title =  Central Pacific Railroad Map\n| url = http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Maps/_crofutt_1870_map.html\n| publisher = Central Pacific Railroad Museum\n| accessdate = 2009-02-05}}</ref>\n\nAfter the transcontinental railroads were completed, many other railroads were built to connect up to other population centers in Utah, Wyoming, Kansas, Colorado, Oregon, Washington territories, etc. In 1869, the [[Kansas Pacific Railway]] started building the [[Hannibal Bridge]], a [[swing bridge]] across the [[Missouri River]] between [[Kansas City, Missouri]] and [[Kansas City, Kansas]] which connected railroads on both sides of the Missouri while still allowing passage of [[paddle steamer]]s on the river. After completion, this became another major east\u2013west railroad. To speed completion of the [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] to Denver, construction started east from Denver in March 1870 to meet the railroad coming west from Kansas city. The two crews met at a point called Comanche Crossing, Kansas Territory, on August 15, 1870. Denver was now firmly on track to becoming the largest city and the future capital of [[Colorado]]. The [[Kansas Pacific Railroad]] linked with the [[Denver Pacific Railway]] via Denver to Cheyenne in 1870.\n\nThe original transcontinental railroad route did not pass through the two biggest cities in the so-called [[Great American Desert]]\u2014[[Denver, Colorado]], and [[Salt Lake City, Utah]]. Feeder railroad lines were soon built to service these two and other cities and states along the route.\n\nModern-day [[Interstate 80]] roughly follows the path of the railroad from Sacramento across modern day California, Nevada, Wyoming and Nebraska, with a few exceptions. Most significantly, the two routes are different between [[Wells, Nevada]] and [[Echo, Utah]]. In this area the freeway passes along the south shore of the [[Great Salt Lake]] and passes through [[Salt Lake City]], cresting the [[Wasatch Mountains]] at [[Parley's Summit]]. The railroad was originally routed along the north shore, and later with the [[Lucin Cutoff]] directly across the center of the Great Salt Lake,  passing through the city of [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]] instead of Salt Lake City. The railroad crosses the Wasatch Mountains via a much gentler grade through [[Weber Canyon]].  Most of the other deviations are in mountainous areas where [[Interstate Highway standards|interstate highways]] allow for grades up to six-percent grades, which allows them to go many places the railroads had to go around, since their goal was to hold their grades to less than two percent.\n\n== Construction ==\n[[File:First Transcontinental Rail.jpg|thumb|left|The ''Jupiter'', which carried [[Leland Stanford]] (one of the \"Big Four\" owners of the Central Pacific) and other railway officials to the Last Spike Ceremony]]\nMost of the capital investment needed to build the railroad was generated by selling government-guaranteed bonds (granted per mile of completed track) to interested investors. The Federal donation of right-of-way saved money and time as it did not have to be purchased from others. The financial incentives and bonds would hopefully cover most of the initial capital investment needed to build the railroad. The bonds would be paid back by the sale of government-granted land, as well as prospective passenger and freight income. Most of the engineers and surveyors who figured out how and where to build the railroad on the Union Pacific were engineering college trained. Many of Union Pacific engineers and surveyors were [[Union Army]] veterans (including two generals) who had learned their railroad trade keeping the trains running and tracks maintained during the U.S. Civil War. After securing the finances and selecting the engineering team, the next step was to hire the key personnel and prospective supervisors. Nearly all key workers and supervisors were hired because they had previous railroad on-the-job training, knew what needed to be done and how to direct workers to get it done. After the key personnel were hired, the semi-skilled jobs could be filled if there was available labor. The engineering team's main job was to tell the workers where to go, what to do, how to do it, and provide the construction material they would need to get it done.\n\nSurvey teams were put out to produce detailed contour maps of the options on the different routes. The engineering team looked at the available surveys and chose what was the \"best\" route. Survey teams under the direction of the engineers closely led the work crews and marked where and by how much hills would have to be cut and depressions filled or bridged. Coordinators made sure that construction and other supplies were provided when and where needed, and additional supplies were ordered as the railroad construction consumed the supplies. Specialized bridging, explosive and tunneling teams were assigned to their specialized jobs. Some jobs like explosive work, tunneling, bridging, heavy cuts or fills were known to take longer than others, so the specialized teams were sent out ahead by wagon trains with the supplies and men to get these jobs done by the time the regular track-laying crews arrived. Finance officers made sure the supplies were paid for and men paid for their work. An army of men had to be coordinated and a seemingly never-ending chain of supplies had to be provided. The Central Pacific road crew set a track-laying record by laying {{convert|10|mi|abbr=on}} of track in a single day, commemorating the event with a signpost beside the track for passing trains to see.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/tcrr-cprr/|title=PBS \u2013 General Article: Workers of the Central Pacific Railroad|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the track-laying crews, other crews were busy setting up stations with provisions for loading fuel, water and often also mail, passengers and freight. Personnel had to be hired to run these stations. Maintenance depots had to be built to keep all of the equipment repaired and operational. Telegraph operators had to be hired to man each station to keep track of where the trains were so that trains could run in each direction on the available single track without interference or accidents. Sidings had to be built to allow trains to pass. Provision had to be made to store and continually pay for coal or wood needed to run the [[steam locomotive]]s. Water towers had to be built for refilling the water tanks on the engines, and provision made to keep them full.\n\n=== Labor ===\nThe majority of the Union Pacific track across the Nebraska and Wyoming territories was built by veterans of the Union and [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] armies, as well as many recent immigrants. [[Brigham Young]], President of [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], landed contracts with the Union Pacific that offered jobs for around 2,000 members of the church with the hope that the railroad would support commerce in Utah. Church members built most of the road through Utah.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Arrington |first1=Leonard J. |author-link1= Leonard J.

The Chinese were commonly referred to at the time as \"[[Celestial Empire|Celestials]]\" and China as the \"Celestial Kingdom.\" Labor-saving devices in those days consisted primarily of [[wheelbarrow]]s, horse or mule pulled carts, and a few railroad pulled gondolas. The construction work involved an immense amount of manual labor. Initially, Central Pacific had a hard time hiring and keeping unskilled workers on its line, as many would leave for the prospect of far more lucrative gold or silver mining options elsewhere. Despite the concerns expressed by [[Charles Crocker]], one of the \"big four\" and a general contractor, that the Chinese were too small in stature<ref>Ambrose, p. 148.</ref> and lacking previous experience with railroad work, they decided to try them anyway.<ref>Griswold, Wesley ''A Work of Giants''. New York: McGraw-Hill, 1962. pg.109-111</ref>  After the first few days of trial with a few workers, with noticeably positive results, Crocker decided to hire as many as he could, looking primarily at the California labor force, where the majority of Chinese worked as independent gold miners or in the service industries (e.g.: laundries and kitchens). Most of these Chinese workers were represented by a Chinese \"boss\" who translated, collected salaries for his crew, kept discipline and relayed orders from an American general supervisor. Most Chinese workers spoke only rudimentary or no English, and the supervisors typically only learned rudimentary Chinese. Many more workers were imported from the [[Guangdong]] Province of China, which at the time, beside great poverty, suffered from the violence of the [[Taiping Rebellion]]. Most Chinese workers were planning on returning with their new found \"wealth\" when the work was completed. Most of the men received between one and three dollars per day, the same as unskilled white workers; but the workers imported directly from China sometimes received less. A diligent worker could save over $20 per month after paying for food and lodging\u2014a \"fortune\" by Chinese standards. A snapshot of workers in late 1865 showed about 3,000 Chinese and 1,700 white workers employed on the railroad. Nearly all of the white workers were in supervisory or skilled craft positions and made more money than the Chinese.\n\nMost of the early work on the Central Pacific consisted of constructing the railroad track bed, cutting and/or blasting through or around hills, filling in washes, building bridges or trestles, digging and blasting tunnels and then laying the rails over the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)]] mountains. Once the Central Pacific was out of the Sierras and the Carson Range, progress sped up considerably as the railroad bed could be built over nearly flat ground. In those days, the Central Pacific once did a section of {{convert|10|mi|km}} of track in one day as a \"demonstration\" of what they could do on flat ground like most of the Union Pacific had in Wyoming and Nebraska.\n\nThe track laying was divided up into various parts. In advance of the track layers, surveyors consulting with engineers determined where the track would go. Workers then built and prepared the roadbed, dug or blasted through hills, filled in washes, built trestles, bridges or culverts across streams or valleys, made tunnels if needed, and laid the ties. The actual track-laying gang would then lay rails on the previously laid ties positioned on the roadbed, drive the spikes, and bolt the [[fishplate]] bars to each rail. At the same time, another gang would distribute telegraph poles and wire along the grade, while the cooks prepared dinner and the clerks busied themselves with accounts, records, using the telegraph line to relay requests for more materials and supplies or communicate with supervisors. Usually the workers lived in camps built near their work site. Supplies were ordered by the engineers and hauled by rail, possibly then to be loaded on wagons if they were needed ahead of the railhead. Camps were moved when the railhead moved a significant distance. Later, as the railroad started moving long distances every few days, some railroad cars had bunkhouses built in them that moved with the workers\u2014the Union Pacific had used this technique since 1866.<ref name=\"nps.gov\">[http://www.nps.gov/archive/gosp/research/track_laying.html Alta California (San Francisco)], November 9, 1868.</ref> Almost all of the roadbed work had to be done manually, using shovels, picks, axes, two-wheeled dump carts, wheelbarrows, ropes, scrapers, etc., with initially only black powder available for blasting. Carts pulled by mules, and horses were about the only labor saving devices available then. Lumber and ties were usually provided by independent contractors who cut, hauled and sawed the timber as required.\n\n[[File:CPRR Tunnel No. 3 East Portal @ Cisco, CA.jpg|left|thumb|CPRR Tunnel #3 near Cisco, California (MP 180.1) opened in 1866 and remains in daily use today]]\n\nTunnels were blasted through hard rock by drilling holes in the rock face by hand and filling them with black powder. Sometimes cracks were found which could be filled with powder and blasted loose. The loosened rock would be collected and hauled out of the tunnel for use in a fill area or as roadbed, or else dumped over the side as waste. A foot or so advance on a tunnel face was a typical day's work. Some tunnels took almost a year to finish and the Summit Tunnel, the longest, took almost two years. In the final days of working in the Sierras, the recently invented [[nitroglycerin]] explosive was introduced and used on the last tunnels including Summit Tunnel.<ref>Kraus, High Road to Promontory, p. 110.; Robert West Howard, The Great Iron Trail: The Story of the First Transcontinental Railroad (New York: G.

Ties were typically unloaded from horse-drawn or mule-drawn wagons and then placed on the [[track ballast]] and levelled to get ready for the rails. Rails, which weighed the most, were often kicked off the flatcars and carried by gangs of men on each side of the rail to where needed. The rails just in front of the rail car would be placed first, measured for the correct gauge with gauge sticks and then nailed down on the ties with [[spike maul]]s. The fishplates connecting the ends of the rails would be bolted on and then the car pushed by hand to the end of the rail and rail installation repeated.\n\nTrack ballast was put between the ties as they progressed. Where a proper railbed had already been prepared, the work progressed rapidly. Constantly needed supplies included \"food, water, ties, rails, spikes, fishplates, nuts and bolts, track ballast, telegraph poles, wire, fire wood (or coal on the Union Pacific) and water for the steam train locomotives, etc.\"<ref name=\"nps.gov\"/> After a flatcar was unloaded, it would usually be hooked to a small locomotive and pulled back to a siding, so another flatcar with rails etc. could be advanced to the railhead. Since juggling railroad cars took time on flat ground, where wagon transport was easier, the rail cars would be brought to the end of the line by steam locomotive, unloaded, and the flat car returned immediately to a siding for another loaded car of either ballast or rails. Temporary sidings were often installed where it could be easily done to expedite getting needed supplies to the railhead.\n\nThe railroad tracks, spikes, telegraph wire, locomotives, railroad cars, supplies etc. were imported from the east on sailing ships that sailed the about {{convert|18000|mi|km}} and about 200 day trip around [[Cape Horn]]. Some freight was put on [[Clipper ship]]s which could do the trip in about 120 days. Some passengers and high priority freight were shipped over the newly (1855) completed [[Panama Railroad]] across the [[Isthmus of Panama]]. Using [[paddle steamer]]s to and from Panama, this shortcut could be traveled in as little as 40 days. Supplies were normally offloaded at the [[Sacramento, California]] docks where the railroad started.\n\n=== Central Pacific construction ===\nOn January 8, 1863, Governor [[Leland Stanford]] ceremonially broke ground in Sacramento, California, to begin construction of the Central Pacific Railroad. After great initial progress along the Sacramento Valley, construction was slowed, first by the foothills of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], then by cutting a railroad bed up the mountains themselves. As they progressed higher in the mountains, winter snowstorms and a shortage of reliable labor compounded the problems. On January 7, 1865, a want ad for 5,000 laborers was placed in the Sacramento Union.<ref name=\"dobie\">{{cite book |last1=Dobie |first1=Charles Caldwell |title=San Francisco's Chinatown; Chapter IV: Railroad Building |date=1936 |publisher=Appleton-Century Co |location=New York |pages=71\u201372}}</ref>  Consequently, after a trial crew of  [[Chinese Railroad Workers|Chinese]] workers was hired and found to work successfully, the Central Pacific expanded its efforts to hire more emigrant laborers\u2014mostly Chinese. Emigrants from poverty stricken regions of China, many of which suffered from the strife of the [[Taiping Rebellion]], seemed to be more willing to tolerate the living and working conditions on the railroad construction, and progress on the railroad continued. The increasing necessity for tunneling as they proceeded up the mountains then began to slow progress of the line yet again.\n\n[[File:CPRR Donner Summit Tunnel Hand Drilled Granite 1868.jpg|thumb|left|Example of hand drilled granite from within Tunnel #6, the \"Summit Tunnel\"]]\n\nThe first step of construction was to survey the route and determine the locations where large excavations, tunnels and bridges would be needed. Crews could then start work in advance of the railroad reaching these locations. Supplies and workers were brought up to the work locations by wagon teams and work on several different sections proceeded simultaneously. One advantage of working on tunnels in winter was that tunnel work could often proceed since the work was nearly all \"inside\". Unfortunately, living quarters would have to be built outside and getting new supplies was difficult. Working and living in winter in the presence of snow slides and avalanches caused some deaths.<ref>Ambrose, Nothing Like It in the World, pp. 160, 201.</ref>\n\nTo carve a tunnel, one worker held a rock drill on the granite face while one to two other workers swung eighteen-pound sledgehammers to sequentially hit the drill which slowly advanced into the rock. Once the hole was about {{convert|10|in|cm}} deep, it would be filled with black powder, a fuse set and then ignited from a safe distance. Nitroglycerin, which had been invented less than two decades before the construction of the first transcontinental railroad, was used in relatively large quantities during its construction. This was especially true on the Central Pacific Railroad, which owned its own nitroglycerin plant to ensure it had a steady supply of the volatile explosive.<ref>Howard, Robert ''The Great Iron Trail.'' New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1962. pg. 222</ref> This plant was operated by Chinese laborers as they were willing workers even under the most trying and dangerous of conditions.<ref>Howard, Robert ''The Great Iron Trail.'' New York: G.P. Putnam's Sons, 1962. pg.222</ref>\n\nChinese laborers were also crucial in the construction of 15 tunnels along the railroad's line through the Sierra Nevada mountains.  These were about 32 feet (10 m) high and 16 feet (5 m) wide.<ref name=\"Tzu-Kuei p. 128\">Tzu-Kuei, \"Chinese Workers and the First Transcontinental Railroad of the United States of America\", p. 128.</ref> When tunnels with vertical shafts were dug to increase construction speed, and tunneling began in the middle of the tunnel and at both ends simultaneously.  At first hand-powered [[derrick]]s were used to help remove loose rocks up the vertical shafts. These derricks were later replaced with steam hoists as work progressed. By using vertical shafts, four faces of the tunnel could be worked at the same time, two in the middle and one at each end. The average daily progress in some tunnels was only 0.85 feet (26&nbsp;cm) a day per face, which was very slow,<ref name=\"Tzu-Kuei p. 128\"/> or 1.18 feet (36&nbsp;cm) daily according to historian George Kraus.{{r|\"Kraus Chinese 1969\"|p=49}} J. O. Wilder, a Central Pacific-Southern Pacific employee, commented that \"The Chinese were as steady, hard-working a set of men as could be found. With the exception of a few whites at the west end of Tunnel No. 6, the laboring force was entirely composed of Chinamen with white foremen and a \"boss/translator\". A single foreman (often Irish) with a gang of 30 to 40 Chinese men generally constituted the force at work at each end of a tunnel; of these, 12 to 15 men worked on the heading, and the rest on the bottom, removing blasted material. When a gang was small or the men were needed elsewhere, the bottoms were worked with fewer men or stopped so as to keep the headings going.\"{{r|\"Kraus Chinese 1969\"|p=49}} The laborers usually worked three shifts of 8 hours each per day, while the foremen worked in two shifts of 12 hours each, managing the laborers.<ref>John R.

Watkins No. 252 1868.jpg|thumb|right|CPRR snow gallery under construction in 1868]]In order to keep the CPRR's Sierra grade open during the winter months, beginning in 1867, {{convert|37|mi|km}} of massive wooden [[snow sheds]] and galleries were built between Blue Ca\u00f1on and Truckee, covering cuts and other points where there was danger of avalanches. 2,500 men and six material trains were employed in this work, which was completed in 1869. The sheds were built with two sides and a steep peaked roof, mostly of locally cut hewn timber and round logs. Snow galleries had one side and a roof that sloped upward until it met the mountain side, thus permitting avalanches to slide over the galleries, some of which extended up the mountainside as much as {{convert|200|ft|m}}.

This changed, however, as the work entered Indian-held lands. The Native Americans saw the railroad as a violation of their treaties with the United States. War parties began to raid the moving labor camps that followed the progress of the line. Union Pacific responded by increasing security and hiring marksmen to kill [[American Bison]], which were both a physical threat to trains and the primary food source for many of the Plains Indians. The Native Americans then began killing laborers when they realized that the so-called \"Iron Horse\" threatened their existence. Security measures were further strengthened, and progress on the railroad continued.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n\"Gen.

As soon as the ceremonial \"Last Spike\" had been replaced by an ordinary iron spike, a message was transmitted to both the East Coast and West Coast that simply read, \"DONE.\" Travel from coast to coast was reduced from six months or more to just one week.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n=== Railroad developments ===\n[[File:CPRR & UPRR Display Ads May 1869.jpg|left|thumb|Display ads for the CPRR and UPRR the week the rails were joined on May 10, 1869]] [[File:Great Overland Route Timetable Cover 1881.JPG|thumb|left|UPRR & CPRR \"Great American Over-Land Route\" Timetable cover 1881]]When the last spike was driven, the rail network was not yet connected to the Atlantic or Pacific but merely connected Omaha to Sacramento. To get from Sacramento to the Pacific, the Central Pacific purchased the struggling [[Western Pacific Railroad (1862-1870)|Western Pacific Railroad]] (unrelated to the [[Western Pacific Railroad|railroad of the same name]] that would later parallel its route) and in summer 1869 resumed construction on it, which had halted in 1866 due to funding troubles.  On September 6, 1869, the first transcontinental rail passengers arrived at the Pacific Railroad's original western terminus on the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|east side of San Francisco Bay]] at the [[Alameda Terminal]], where they transferred to the steamer ''Alameda'' for transport across the Bay to San Francisco.  On November 8, 1869, the Central Pacific finally completed the rail connection to its western terminus at [[Oakland, California]], also on the [[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]], where [[Port of San Francisco|freight]] and [[San Francisco Ferry Building|passengers]] completed their transcontinental link to San Francisco by [[Ferries of San Francisco Bay|ferry]].\n\nThe original route from the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] to the [[San Francisco Bay|Bay]] skirted the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta|Delta]] by heading south out of Sacramento through [[Stockton, California|Stockton]] and crossing the [[San Joaquin River]] at [[Lathrop, California|Mossdale]], then climbed over the [[Altamont Pass]] and reached the  east side of the San Francisco Bay through [[Niles Canyon]]. The Western Pacific was originally chartered to go to [[San Jose, California|San Jose]], but the Central Pacific decided to build along the East Bay instead, as going from San Jose up the [[San Francisco Peninsula|Peninsula]] to [[San Francisco]] itself would have brought it into conflict with [[San Francisco and San Jose Railroad|competing interests]]. The railroad entered [[Alameda Terminal|Alameda]] and [[Oakland Point, Oakland, California|Oakland]] from the south, roughly paralleling what would later become [[U.S. Route 50 in California|U.S. Route 50]] and later still Interstates [[Interstate 5 in California|5]], [[Interstate 205 (California)|205]], and [[Interstate 580 (California)|580]]. A [[Capitol Corridor|more direct route]] was obtained with the purchase of the [[California Pacific Railroad]], crossing the [[Sacramento River]] and proceeding southwest through [[Davis, California|Davis]] to [[Benicia, California|Benicia]], where it crossed the [[Carquinez Strait]] by means of an enormous [[Solano (ferry)|train ferry]], [[Port Costa, California|then]] followed the shores of the [[San Pablo Bay|San Pablo]] and [[San Francisco Bay|San Francisco]] bays to [[Richmond, California|Richmond]] and the [[Port of Oakland]] (paralleling [[U.S. Route 40 in California|U.S. Route 40]] which ultimately became [[Interstate 80 (California)|Interstate 80]]). In 1930, a [[Benicia\u2013Martinez Bridge|rail bridge]] across the Carquinez replaced the Benicia ferries.\n\nVery early on, the Central Pacific learned that it would have trouble maintaining an open track in winter across the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierras]]. At first they tried plowing the road with special snowplows mounted on their steam engines. When this was only partially successful, an extensive process of building [[snow shed]]s over some of the track was instituted to protect it from deep snows and avalanches. These eventually succeeded at keeping the tracks clear for all but a few days of the year.<ref>Central Pacific snow sheds [http://www.cprr.org/Museum/Summit_Tunnel_1999/index.html] accessed January 28, 2009.</ref>\n\nBoth railroads soon instituted extensive upgrade projects to build better bridges, viaducts and dugways as well as install heavier duty rails, stronger ties, better road beds etc. The original track had often been laid as fast as possible with only secondary attention to maintenance and durability. The primary incentive had been getting the subsidies, which meant that upgrades of all kinds were routinely required in the following years.\n\n[[File:Crofutt's Trans-Continental Tourist's Guide Frontispiece 1870.jpg|thumb|right|Frontispiece of Crofutt's ''Great Trans-Continental Tourist's Guide'', 1870]]The Union Pacific would not connect Omaha to Council Bluffs until completing the [[Union Pacific Missouri River Bridge]] in 1872.<ref>{{cite news|title=Omaha|url=http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn84026844/1872-03-26/ed-1/seq-1/|accessdate=5 January 2017|work=The Wheeling Daily Intelligencer|date=March 26, 1872|location=Wheeling, West Virginia|page=1}}</ref>\n\nSeveral years after the end of the Civil War, the competing railroads coming from Missouri finally realized their initial strategic advantage and a building boom ensued. In July 1869, the [[Hannibal and St. Joseph Railroad]] finished the [[Hannibal Bridge]] in Kansas City which was the first bridge to cross the Missouri River. This in turn connected to [[Kansas Pacific]] trains going from Kansas City to Denver, which in turn had built the [[Denver Pacific Railway]] connecting to the Union Pacific. In August 1870, the Kansas Pacific drove the last spike connecting to the Denver Pacific line at [[Strasburg, Colorado]] and the first true Atlantic to Pacific United States railroad was completed.\n\nKansas City's head start in connecting to a true transcontinental railroad contributed to it rather than Omaha becoming the dominant rail center west of Chicago.\n\nThe Kansas Pacific became part of the Union Pacific in 1880.\n\nOn June 4, 1876, an express train called the ''[[Transcontinental Express]]'' arrived in San Francisco via the First Transcontinental Railroad only 83 hours and 39 minutes after it had left [[New York City]]. Only ten years before, the same journey would have taken months over land or weeks on ship, possibly all the way around South America.\n\nThe Central Pacific got a direct route to San Francisco when it was merged with the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] to create the Southern Pacific Company in 1885. The Union Pacific initially took over the Southern Pacific in 1901 but was forced by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] to divest it because of monopoly concerns. The two railroads would once again unite in 1996 when the Southern Pacific was sold to the Union Pacific.\n\nHaving been bypassed with the completion of the [[Lucin Cutoff]] in 1904, the Promontory Summit rails were pulled up in 1942 to be recycled for the [[World War II]] effort. This process began with a ceremonial \"undriving\" at the Last Spike location.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/history/online_books/hh/40/hh40r.htm| title=Promontory After May 10, 1869| author=United States National Park Service| date=2002-09-28| accessdate=2007-05-10}}</ref>\n\n=== Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier ===\n[[File:Oakes Ames - Brady-Handy.jpg|thumb|upright|Oakes Ames]]\n{{Main|Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier scandal}}\n\nDespite the transcontinental success and millions in government subsidies, the Union Pacific faced bankruptcy less than three years after the Last Spike as details surfaced about overcharges that Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier had billed Union Pacific for the formal building of the railroad. The scandal hit epic proportions in the [[1872 United States presidential election]], which saw the re-election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] and became the biggest scandal of the [[Gilded Age]]. It would not be resolved until the death of the congressman who was supposed to have reined in its excesses but instead wound up profiting from it.\n\nDurant had initially come up with the scheme to have Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier subcontract to do the actual track work.  Durant gained control of the company after buying out employee Herbert Hoxie for $10,000. Under Durant's guidance, Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier was charging Union Pacific often twice or more the customary cost for track work (thus in effect paying himself to build the railroad).  The process mired down Union Pacific work.\n\nLincoln asked Massachusetts Congressman [[Oakes Ames]], who was on the railroad committee, to clean things up and get the railroad moving. Ames got his brother [[Oliver Ames Jr.]] named president of the Union Pacific, while he himself became president of Cr\u00e9dit Mobilier.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/tcrr/peopleevents/p_ames.html|title=People & Events: Oakes Ames (1804\u20131873) \u2013 American Experience Transcontinental Railroad|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nAmes then in turn gave stock options to other politicians while at the same time continuing the lucrative overcharges. The scandal was to implicate Vice President [[Schuyler Colfax]] (who was cleared) and future President [[James Garfield]] among others.\n\nThe scandal broke in 1872 when the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' published correspondence detailing the scheme between Henry S. McComb and Ames. In the ensuing Congressional investigation, it was recommended that Ames be expelled from Congress, but this was reduced to a censure and Ames died within three months.\n\nDurant later left the Union Pacific and a new rail baron, [[Jay Gould]], became the dominant stockholder. As a result of the [[Panic of 1873]], Gould was able to pick up bargains, among them the control of the Union Pacific Railroad and [[Western Union]].<ref>''Panic on Wall Street: A History of America's Financial Disasters'', p. 193, [[Robert Sobel]], Beard Books, 1999, {{ISBN|978-1-893122-46-8}}.</ref>\n\n=== Visible remains ===\nVisible remains of the historic line are still easily located\u2014hundreds of miles are still in service today, especially through the Sierra Nevada Mountains and canyons in Utah and Wyoming. While the original rail has long since been replaced because of age and wear, and the roadbed upgraded and repaired, the lines generally run on top of the original, handmade grade. Vista points on [[Interstate 80]] through California's Truckee Canyon provide a panoramic view of many miles of the original Central Pacific line and of the [[snow shed]]s which made winter train travel safe and practical.\n\nIn areas where the original line has been bypassed and abandoned, primarily due to the [[Lucin Cutoff]] re-route in Utah, the original road grade is still obvious, as are numerous cuts and fills, especially the [[Big Fill]] a few miles east of Promontory. The sweeping curve which connected to the east end of the Big Fill now passes a [[Thiokol]] rocket research and development facility.\n\nIn 1957, Congress authorized the [[Golden Spike National Historic Site]].

Among the cooks serving the film's cast and crew between shots were some of the Chinese laborers who worked on the Central Pacific section of the railroad.\n\nThe feat is depicted in various movies, including the 1939 film ''[[Union Pacific (film)|Union Pacific]]'', starring [[Joel McCrea]] and [[Barbara Stanwyck]] and directed by [[Cecil B. DeMille]], which depicts the fictional Central Pacific investor Asa Barrows obstructing attempts of the Union Pacific to reach Ogden, Utah.\n\nThe 1939 movie is said to have inspired the ''[[Union Pacific (TV series)|Union Pacific]]'' Western television series starring [[Jeff Morrow]], [[Judson Pratt]] and [[Susan Cummings (actress)|Susan Cummings]] which aired in syndication from 1958 until 1959.\n\nThe 1962 film ''[[How the West Was Won (film)|How the West Was Won]]'' has a whole segment devoted to the construction; one of the movie's most famous scenes, filmed in [[Cinerama]], is of a buffalo stampede over the railroad.\n\nThe construction of what presumably is \u2013 or is suggested to be \u2013 the Transcontinental Railroad provides the backdrop of the 1968 epic [[spaghetti western]] ''[[Once Upon a Time in the West]]'', directed by Italian director [[Sergio Leone]].\n\n[[Graham Masterton]]'s 1981 novel ''A Man of Destiny'' (published in the UK as ''Railroad'') is a fictionalized account of the line's construction.\n\nThe 1993 children's book ''Ten Mile Day'' by Mary Ann Fraser tells the story of the record setting push by the Central Pacific in which they set a record by laying {{convert|10|mi|km}} of track in a single day on April 28, 1869, to settle a $10,000 bet.\n\n[[Kristiana Gregory]]'s 1999 book ''The Great Railroad Race'' (part of the \"Dear America\" series) is written as the fictional diary of Libby West, who chronicles the end of the railroad construction and the excitement which engulfed the country at the time.\n\nIn the 1999 [[Will Smith]] film, ''[[Wild Wild West]]'', the joining ceremony is the setting of an assassination attempt on then U.S. President [[Ulysses S. Grant]] by the film's antagonist [[Dr. Loveless#Other versions|Dr. Arliss Loveless]].\n\nThe main character in ''[[The Claim (2000 film)|The Claim]]'' (2000) is a surveyor for the [[Central Pacific Railroad]], and the film is partially about the efforts of a frontier mayor to have the railroad routed through his town.\n\nIn the 2002 [[DreamWorks Animation]] movie, ''[[Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron]]'', the main character, the horse Spirit, is delivered with other horses to pull a steam locomotive at a work site for the Transcontinental Railroad.\n\nThe ''[[American Experience]]'' series' [[American Experience (season 15)|2002\u20132003 season]] documents the railway in the episode titled \"Transcontinental Railroad\".\n\nThe building of the railway is covered by the 2004 BBC documentary series ''[[Seven Wonders of the Industrial World]]'' in episode 6, \"The Line\".\n\nThe popular British television show ''[[Doctor Who]]'' featured the Transcontinental Railroad in a 2010 BBC audio book entitled ''[[The Runaway Train]]'', read by [[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]] and written for audio by Oli Smith.\n\nThe construction of the Transcontinental Railroad provides the setting for the AMC television series ''[[Hell on Wheels (TV Series)|Hell on Wheels]]''. Thomas Durant is a regular character in the series and is portrayed by actor [[Colm Meaney]].\n\nIn 2015, a [[Lego]] model depicting the Golden Spike Ceremony, the event that symbolically marked the completion of the First Transcontinental Railroad, was submitted to the [[Lego Ideas]] website.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ideas.lego.com/content/project/link/54e5a948-7371-45e8-a559-a12ad3c6cd2b|title=Golden Spike Ceremony|website=ideas.lego.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://archive.sltrib.com/article.php?id=2244936&itype=CMSID|title=Man wants Utah railroad moment to get the Lego treatment|website=The Salt Lake Tribune}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|History|Trains|United States}}\n* [[California and the railroads|History of rail transportation in California]]\n* [[Chin Lin Sou]]\n* [[Interstate 80]] \u2013 ''present-day New York-to-San Francisco transport link (highway)''\n* [[List of heritage railroads in the United States]]\n* [[Overland Route (Union Pacific Railroad)]]\n* [[Transcontinental railroad]]\n*[https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/21st-century-datacenter-locations-driven-19th-politics-george-moore/ The transcontinental railroad and modern datacenter locations]\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist|40em|group=N}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{external media | width = 210px | align = right | headerimage= | video1 = [https://www.c-span.org/video/?155004-1/empire-express ''Booknotes'' interview with David Haward Bain on ''Empire Express: Building the First Transcontinental Railroad'', March 5, 2000], [[C-SPAN]]}}\n* {{cite book | last=Allen| first=James B. | authorlink=James B.

This version used the same basic premise as the original series with some changes, and ran until 8 March 1995. A series of audio plays using the original concept and characters (and many of the original series' actors) was produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] between 2001 and 2007. In 2013, an [[The Tomorrow People (U.S. TV series)|American remake of the show]] premiered on [[The CW]].\n\n==Premise==\nAll incarnations of the show concerned the emergence of the next stage of [[human evolution]] (''[[Superhuman#Science fiction|Homo novis]]'') known colloquially as ''Tomorrow People''. Born to [[human]] parents, an apparently normal child might at some point between childhood and late adolescence experience a process called 'breaking out' and develop special paranormal abilities. These abilities include [[psionic]] powers such as [[telepathy]], [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], and [[teleportation]]. However, their psychological make-up prevents them from intentionally killing others.\n\n==Original series (1970s)==\n{{anchor|The Tomorrow People (1973 TV series)}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = The Tomorrow People\n| image = TOMOLOGO.jpg\n| genre = [[Superhero]] / [[Fantasy]] / [[Drama]] / [[Sci-Fi]]\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = [[Roger Price (television producer)|Roger Price]]\n| starring = [[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]], [[Elizabeth Adare]], [[Peter Vaughan-Clarke]], Margaret Burton, [[Philip Gilbert]], Stephen Salmon, [[Sammie Winmill]], Dean Lawrence, [[Mike Holoway]], Misako Koba, Nigel Rhodes\n| music = [[Dudley Simpson]]\n| country = United Kingdom\n| network = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]\n| first_aired = 30 April 1973\n| last_aired = 19 February 1979\n| num_episodes = 68 ([[List of The Tomorrow People serials#1970s series|List]])\n|}}\n{{See also|List of The Tomorrow People serials#1970s series}}\n===Season One===\nThe original series was produced by [[Thames Television]] for ITV. The Tomorrow People operate from a secret base, ''The Lab'', built in an [[Closed London Underground stations|abandoned]] [[London Underground]] station. The team constantly watches for new Tomorrow People \"breaking out\" (usually around the age of puberty) to help them through the process as the youngsters endure mental agonies as their minds suddenly change. They sometimes deal with attention from extraterrestrial species as well as facing more earthbound dangers with military forces across the globe keen to recruit or capture them for their own ends. One thing they lack is the capability to intentionally take another life. This pacifistic element of their make up is referred to as the \"prime barrier\" and any Tomorrow Person who causes the loss of a human life would be driven insane by the confusion in their brain. They also have connections with the \"Galactic Federation\" which oversees the welfare of telepathic species throughout the galaxy. In addition to their psychic powers (the so-called 3T's of telepathy, telekinesis and teleportation), they use advanced technology such as the biological (called in the series \"biotronic\") computer [[TIM (Tomorrow People)|TIM]], which is capable of [[Artificial intelligence|original thought]], telepathy, and can augment their psychic powers. TIM also helps the Tomorrow People to teleport long distances, although they must be wearing a device installed into a belt or bracelet for this to work. Teleportation is referred to as ''jaunting'' in the programme. The team used jaunting belts up to the end of Series 5, after which they used much smaller wristbands.\n\nIn the original series, the Tomorrow People are also referred to as both Homo Novis and ''[[Homo superior]]''. The term ''Homo Superior'' was originally coined by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1935 novel ''[[Odd John]]''. This is also the term that comics writer [[Stan Lee]] has his [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] character use to refer to mutants in ''[[X-Men]]'' #1, 1963. The same term later appeared in [[David Bowie]]'s 1971 song \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\": \"Let me make it plain. You gotta make way for the Homo Superior.\" This term came up as part of a conversation between Roger Price and David Bowie at a meeting at Granada Studios in Manchester when Price was directing a programme in which Bowie was appearing. Price had been working on a script for his Tomorrow People project and during a conversation with Bowie, the term ''Homo superior'' came up. Bowie liked the term and soon afterwards wrote it into his song. Price has sometimes been quoted as saying that the lyrics to this song were inspired by the series.<ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.effdee.demon.co.uk/new%20TP%20site/Interviews/Roger.htm |title=\"You must be joking\" In conversation with Roger Damon Price |publisher=Jackie Clark }}</ref>\n\nAlistair McGown of [[Screenonline]] cites the book ''The Mind in Chains'' by [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Dr Christopher Evans]] as a primary source. Evans also became a scientific advisor for the series. He would be credited as such on every single episode but most people working on the show seem to recall that he only had involvement in the first couple of series.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/904684/index.html |website=Screen Online| title= Tomorrow People, The (1973\u201379, 92\u201395)| accessdate= 27 May 2015}}</ref> McGown also suggests a similarity between ''The Tomorrow People'' and the children's fantasy fiction of [[Enid Blyton]].\n\nWhile they reveal their existence to some, the Tomorrow People generally operate in secrecy for fear that normal people (whom they term \"Saps\", an abbreviation of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'') will either fear or victimise them because of their special powers, or try to exploit them for military purposes. In order to defend themselves they must use non-lethal weaponry such as \"stun guns\" or martial arts; this is owing to their genetic unwillingness to kill, referred to as the \"prime barrier\". In early series they would have the aid of \"Sap\" friends such as Ginge, Lefty and Chris who would usually handle the rougher stuff that the pacifist TPs could not deal with. Also in the second and third series they become friendly with a psychic researcher named Professor Cawston who assisted them and vice versa.\n\nRoger Price dreamed up the idea in 1970; he initially offered the format to Granada, where he was working, but was turned down so offered it to [[Southern Television]], who expressed an interest but had concerns over the budgetary requirements. Finally, Lewis Rudd at Thames Television commissioned a 13-episode series, having seen the potential of the format and looking to replace ''[[Ace of Wands (TV series)|Ace of Wands]]'' after its three-year run. At this time, ITV was keen to find its own answer to ''[[Doctor Who]]'', although Price never really envisaged the show as such but more as an outlet for his own personal ideas and beliefs. Very early on, Ruth Boswell was brought in as associate producer and script editor as she had experience of children's fantasy drama (''[[Timeslip]]'' and ''Tightrope'') while TV dramatist [[Brian Finch]] was hired to co-write the scripts in view of the fact that Price had little experience of writing drama. Finch disliked the experience as he was not engaged by the material and found a large part of his time was taken up in trying to rein in Price and his very ambitious ideas. Thames enlisted the services of ''Doctor Who'' director [[Paul Bernard (director)|Paul Bernard]] to help set up and oversee the first series. He would be credited as director for two stories but was unofficially a third producer. Bernard was very heavily involved in the creation of the memorable title sequence which involved a mixture of haunting images and facial shots of the main cast zooming towards the camera in monochrome, with an eerie theme tune from prolific ''Doctor Who'' composer, [[Dudley Simpson]], playing behind. He got inspiration from seeing billboards rushing towards him when driving. The sequence opened with a clenched fist opening out to signify a telepathic mind breaking out. Amongst the next shots were a human foetus, shadowy figures behind scaffolding and even the insides of a [[bell pepper]] (a somewhat exotic fruit in the UK in the 1970s).\n\nOver its six-year run the format would prove flexible enough to encompass various type of stories including traditional alien invasions adventures as well as entering into genres such as espionage thrillers, slapstick comedy, time travel, political satires, space opera and even on occasion more adult concepts than would be normally found in a teatime drama for children. At a time when [[Mary Whitehouse]] was regularly criticising violence in ''Doctor Who'', ''The Tomorrow People'' featured dagger wielding Devil worshippers and a direct implication of prostitution in the 1977 season but managed to escape her censure. As it was aimed at young people, then it would often reflect popular fashions and fads of the time but usually with a suitable sinister twist. For example, \"Hitler's Last Secret\" in 1978 involved the TPs investigating a sudden craze for wearing Nazi uniforms amongst teenagers (reflecting the actions of the then contemporary punk rockers) but is a precursor to Hitler being revived from suspended animation by a group of Nazis. The following season's \"The Living Skins\" saw aliens transforming themselves into fashionable plastic jump suits that would control and eventually kill the millions of people who wear them. The most notable example was in the fondly remembered 1974 adventure \"The Blue and the Green\" which sees the whole of humanity divided by a craze to wear blue or green badges and for a children's show, the whole concept of classroom violence is handled maturely by Price and his production team. In 1977 Mike joins a pop band, \"The Heart of Sogguth\" whose hell-raising music will bring back the Devil when millions of teenagers are watching them on television. The popularity of the book \"Chariots of the Gods\" was also an influence on 1975's \"Worlds Away\" when it is revealed that the evil Kulthan had controlled and assisted the ancient Egyptians.\n\nPrice saw the lead casting as very important as he wanted talented and attractive actors who would appeal to the young audience but also be personable and easy to work with during the long hours envisaged in studio or out on location. [[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]] was cast as the group's leader, John, while [[Peter Vaughan-Clarke|Peter Vaughan Clarke]] was offered the role of Stephen after Price saw him in a Manchester rendition of ''Peter Pan'' with [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]. Ruth Boswell wanted [[Lynne Frederick]] (later the last wife of [[Peter Sellers]]) for Carol, the female lead, but following a meeting with her, Paul Bernard felt she was a bit too upper-class and precious for what he had in mind as he saw the character as being similar to ''Doctor Who'''s [[Jo Grant]]. They finally settled on [[Sammie Winmill]] who was relatively well-known for playing Nurse Crumpton on the popular ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]'' situation comedy (also a Thames production). The role of Kenny, the youngest TP, was given to Stephen Salmon after he had been discovered in a drama workshop while theatre actor Philip Gilbert was selected to provide the paternal tones of biotronic computer TIM. Making up the team were two Sap friends, a couple of bikers called Ginge ([[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]]) and Lefty ([[Derek Crewe]]) who encounter the Tomorrow People when acting as henchmen for the villainous shape-shifter [[Jedikiah (Tomorrow People)|Jedikiah]] in the opening adventure. Stephen would be very much the show's hero and focus for the audience while John was something of an authoritarian figure who took his responsibilities for the species' future and welfare very seriously. Young was the only TP to be in every single episode and the actor was able to have some say in the production of later seasons as he was considered as an unofficial producer. Kenny was given very little to do and was often left behind in the Lab (due to being the youngest) while the others went off to have the actual adventures. Filming commenced in March 1973 with location work in Muswell Hill. Production of this first story, \"The Slaves of Jedikiah\" was much troubled as the crew found they were unfamiliar with the technical demands of a science fiction drama. The first day in studio was disastrous with virtually no usable material getting made and there was some tension between the cast and Paul Bernard who was very authoritarian with them. Also Nicholas Young banged himself hard into a wall while working on the darkened entrance to the Lab which was being filmed inside the real disused tube station at Wood Lane (closed in the 1940s). Fortunately he was not badly injured and able to carry on later that day after a recovery break.\n\nEarly publicity included a photo session of the cast with the ''Doctor Who'' star, [[Jon Pertwee]], to indicate a friendly rivalry between the two shows. ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine would provide a great deal of coverage of the series and by July would have launched its own comic strip version (which ran on and off in its pages for the next five years). ''[[TVTimes]]'' also promoted the new show with an article on its first week.\n\nThe production procedure was very much standard in the seventies with a limited amount of location work (done on film) followed by a day in studio to record each episode on videotape. Even for the time, some of the special effects of the show were considered sub-par, largely attributable to its small budget.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Tomorrow People Introduction| url=http://www.clivebanks.co.uk/TP%20Intro.htm|publisher=clivebanks.co.uk|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> The first season was budgeted at approx \u00a35000 per episode which was roughly half the cost of what the BBC were making Dr Who for. Most directors on the show would rely heavily on [[chroma key]] to get their desired effects, but owing to the rushed time on studio days, the results varied greatly in outcome. To make it even more difficult, studio time was restricted as English law dictated that juvenile actors could only work a certain number of hours in a day.\n\nSeason one's recurring villain, Jedikiah, was originally devised to be a long-running foe (like the Master from Dr Who), but after seeing the poorly-designed robot that was the shape-changer's true form, an unimpressed Price elected not to use the character again until the finale of series three which was planned at that time as the series' finale (the robotic form noticeably fails to appear). Despite these limitations, the series proved popular with its young audience who watched in large numbers, even denting the figures for the popular BBC magazine programme ''[[Blue Peter]]''.\n\n===Season Two ===\n\nThe success of the first series saw another 13 episodes go into production quite soon after, but with a number of changes. Off-screen, both Bernard and Finch departed leaving Price to take more control as writer, director and producer, while on-screen Kenny and Carol disappeared (sent to the Galactic Federation's headquarters The Trig to work as ambassadors for Earth). Salmon was simply not asked back as there was a feeling the character had failed to work and his acting was considered wooden (plus Salmon had never been very keen to appear as he had no interest in acting), while Winmill's departure was voluntary as the actress was concerned about being associated with a long running series. In their place came student school teacher Elizabeth M'Bondo, portrayed by [[Elizabeth Adare]]. Adare initially thought her character was to be a teenage girl and made every effort at her audition to look and act like an adolescent. However, Price and Boswell were suitably impressed to change the Elizabeth character so that she breaks out at an older age due to a latent puberty. Elizabeth is uncovered by Stephen when working at his school where she is doing her teacher training. This was the start of a near-annual event where a new TP would be introduced in the first story of each series, a handy way of maintaining interest for returning viewers and a convenient way for Price to re-establish the basic premise of the show for new audiences every year. Adare would stay until the end in 1979 but grew increasingly unhappy with the quality of later scripts. However she knew how important and ground breaking it was for a black actress to be the female lead in a British TV production so consciously decided to stick around.\n\nFilming of Series 2 began in late 1973 with Michael Standing returning as Ginge, but on the first day he fell off his motorbike and broke his leg, prompting a speedy rewrite whereby Ginge's younger brother, Chris ([[Chris Chittell]]), was now seen as the new Sap regular. Chris was mentioned in the dialogue as already being known to the Tomorrow People, so little in the way of changes had to be made to the script. Ginge's absence was explained on-screen by his having been admitted to hospital following a fall from his motorbike, reflecting Standing's real-life accident. Price later commented that he felt neither Ginge or Lefty had ever felt right for the format.\n\n=== Season Three ===\n\nIn 1975, the third series added Dean Lawrence as gypsy Tyso Boswell, yet another character from a minority as Price was determined that the Tomorrow People could be from any ethnic or society background. Chris disappears after only appearing in one episode (his absence is never explained) while telepathic secret agent Tricia Conway appears in two stories before fully breaking out in the series climax which saw the young heroes menaced by old rival, Jedikiah. Viewers saw on screen why the youngsters have to maintain their secrecy and constant vigilance from the rest of humanity, as the British Secret Intelligence Service ruthlessly hunt them down for their own purposes in the opening adventure. This series also saw the group visit an alien world for the first time when the Galactic Trig dispatches them to help the telepathic population of the planet Peerie. Production on this story ran into trouble when Lawrence hurt his knee during location filming and the injury had to be included in the script.\n\nA comedy script was attempted in the much-derided \"A Man for Emily\" (starring a young [[Peter Davison]]) because Price was keen to get more into humorous writing. The negative backlash to this experiment resulted in a planned sequel story being quietly dropped; however, such actions added to Price's increasing frustration with the show. Philip Gilbert also made the first of several on-screen appearances as Timus Irnok Mosta, an ambassador from the Galactic Federation who had a hand in building TIM thus sounding alike. Timus was a clone and his brother, Tikno also appears. They would make semi-regular appearances until the final story in 1979, and helped fulfil a clause in Gilbert's contract that he had to be seen or heard at least once every episode. As stated, old enemy Jedikiah made a dramatic return to exact revenge in the last story. It ends with an air of finality as the Tomorrow People (including the just broken out Trisha Conway), having only just survived the encounter (at one point John, Elizabeth and Tikno are violently gunned down and left barely alive), decide to leave Earth for the Galactic Trig with only a vague, haunting promise from Elizabeth that they will return...sometime.\n\n=== Season Four ===\n\nBy now, Price had become tired of his creation and attempted to end it by killing off the leads at the conclusion to Series 3, but Ruth Boswell made him rewrite it so that they survived. However Thames Television had a ratings winner (as well as excellent overseas sales) and insisted he continue the programme, albeit in shorter, staggered seasons from now on. Price only ever allowed one attempt by another writer to work on it solo, with John E. Watkins penning the story \"Into the Unknown\" broadcast in early 1976. Price was not satisfied with the final episodes and decided from now on he would be sole writer. Having fewer episodes to write every year, Price would have more time to work on his comedic and light-entertainment productions, which he enjoyed more than the demanding sci-fi drama. At the start of the fourth series he attempted to give a boost to the format with the introduction of teenage idol [[Mike Holoway]] as Mike Bell. Holoway was the drummer with pop band [[Flintlock (musical group)|Flintlock]] who were the regular house band on Price's \"You Must Be Joking\" and Price hoped that his young charge would be Britain's answer to [[Donny Osmond]] or [[David Cassidy]]. Mike's arrival swells the ranks of TPs in the Lab to five (Tricia had remained on the Trig) which made things look a bit overcrowded, this led to the decision to sack Vaughan-Clarke as Stephen, who ignobly disappears off screen after the season finished and is never even mentioned again. Mike was now very much being touted as the show's hero and with this change, it was noticeable that John and Elizabeth took on a more parental role as both actors entered their mid-20s. Tyso also vanished after the fourth year but his character had been mostly redundant for some time due to not having been written into scripts that year. His late inclusion was only addressed a couple of weeks before filming started when Price discovered from Lawrence that he was still available to appear in the programme (he had been led to believe that he had moved abroad). This meant Tyso only had limited screen time and very few lines. Anne Curthoys was asked back to play Tricia but was committed to a daytime soap at Thames.\n\n=== Season Five ===\n\nVic Hughes took over as producer for Series 5, which began transmission in early 1977 and was the only series not to introduce a new Tomorrow person (although the first story does feature a potential TP in doomed Russian teenager, Pavla). All three adventures were two-parters which allowed Price to write them quickly and remove any unwanted excess padding which tended to slow down the action. Mike Holoway was now very much the star of the show as on screen, Mike developed into the resident hero guided by an increasingly parental John and Elizabeth. His band Flintlock even appeared in the closing adventure, \"The Heart of Sogguth\". From this season on, Price would only be credited as the writer but he retained overall control of the series and was very heavily involved in major decisions.\n\n=== Season Six ===\n\n1978 saw changes being made, starting with Elizabeth's absence through most of Series 6 due to Elizabeth Adare's pregnancy (on screen Elizabeth is working on diplomatic missions for the Galactic Federation and appears only briefly on a screen so as to hide the actress's condition). In her place came Hsui Tai, played by Japanese actress Misako Koba, whose poor grasp of English made her hard to understand and Nicholas Young later recalled that he and other actors found this difficult during production. Koba had no previous acting experience and had been suggested for the role by her actor husband. A new Lab set was introduced with a smaller but now mobile TIM and the jaunting belts were replaced by the rather cheap looking jaunting bands (worn on the wrists). These changes were forced on the production team following a fire at the Thames storerooms. The new Lab acted as both base and home for the Tomorrow People as they were now seen to be sleeping in their own cabins there. It was noticeably smaller than the previous set, which freed up more space in the studio for the designers to utilise on other sets. The 6 episodes were produced sporadically through 1977 (a combination of Price writing scripts as and when it fitted with his other production commitments and a number of strikes at ITV over the year) and finally launched in the Spring of 78. Such was Holoway's popularity that he was featured on the cover of TV Times to promote the start of the season.\n\n=== Season Seven ===\n\nSeason 7 in late 1978 introduced another Tomorrow person in the form of young Scottish lad Andrew Forbes ([[Nigel Rhodes]]). Rhodes had previously worked as an extra on \"A Much Needed Holiday\" but became more known to Price when he worked on his 1977 comedy series, \"You Can't Be Serious\". The young actor was delighted to win the role, as he was a great fan of the show. Andrew is introduced after he starts using his psychic powers to conjure up images of ghosts so as to provide a tourism attraction for the hotel owned by his father. Elizabeth also returned from her year on the Trig.\n\n=== Season Eight and cancellation ===\n\nWith inflation out of control in the late-1970s, the budget was stretched to breaking point, a factor which was constantly on the mind of producer Vic Hughes. A dispute over the allocation of studio days ended the show in 1979 when Hughes attempted to gain an extra studio day for the planned ninth series (which fell victim to the ITV strike that summer) following numerous problems during the production of \"War of the Empires\" (the sole four-part adventure that made up series 8) which had been given only four days in studio. This was partially due to a very ambitious script that, with its numerous space battles, was heavily influenced by \"Star Wars\". Also by this point Price had emigrated to America after being headhunted to help set up Nickelodeon children's channel and Thames were reluctant to carry on without him. However some of the lead actors were of the opinion that the series was disliked within Thames due to its great success. Whatever the reason, it finally vanished after a short repeat run in early 1980.\n\n===Cast===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\n* '''TIM''' (voice of [[Philip Gilbert]]) is a biological computer, programmed with an artificially created intelligence, whose tubes are filled with ''bio-fluid''. He was partially built by John, the leader of the Tomorrow People, and was given to them by the ''Galactic Council''. TIM is housed in ''The Lab'', situated in a disused station in the [[London Underground]]. TIM often helps out the Tomorrow People by providing vital information, which the telepaths can use in their current adventure. TIM's voice is identical to that of diplomat Timus Irnok Mosta from the Galactic Federation, because Timus' clone-brother Tykno is the premier AI scientist of the Federation and all Federation AI's have their voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* '''John''' ([[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]]) \u2013 Aged 17, John is the leader of the Tomorrow People.<ref name=\"slaves\">{{cite episode|title=The Slaves of Jedikiah, Part 1|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1973-04-30|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|season=1|number=1}}</ref> He is an inventor and scientist.<ref name=\"slaves2\">{{cite episode|title=The Slaves of Jedikiah, Part 2|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1973-05-07|network=ITV|station=ITV1|season=1|number=2}}</ref> He built ''The Lab'' and the biological computer, [[TIM (Tomorrow People)|TIM]], with some help from the Galactic Council.

He comes from a gypsy background and has a number of younger siblings. The Tomorrow People first encounter him when he is captured by Colonel Masters. He forms a partnership with Stephen in some stories and takes a cheeky attitude towards many of the situations the Tomorrow People find themselves in.\n* '''Patricia Conway''' \u2013 ([[Anne Curthoys]]) Tricia is a telepath working for Colonel Masters at the Experimental Weapons Establishment, who appears in \"Secret Weapon\" and \"Revenge of Jedikiah\". She is initially at odds with the Tomorrow People, seeking to capture them and force them to work for British Intelligence. After Masters' death, she allies with the Tomorrow People against Jedikiah. She hears Stephen's telepathic cry for help, causing her to break out and jaunt to the lab. Afterwards, she goes to work at the Trig.\n* '''Mike Bell''' \u2013 ([[Mike Holoway]]) Mike is a working class Cockney who lives with his mother and sister. He is introduced at the start of season four when a group of London criminals try to force him to use his powers to help them commit crimes. Although loyal to the Tomorrow People, he is less willing than some of the others to blindly follow John's orders and they often clash. In later series, he occasionally takes on a leadership role when John and Elizabeth are absent, notably in \"War of the Empires\".\n* '''Pavla Vlasova''' \u2013 ([[Anulka Dziubinska]]) Pavla is a Russian telepath who appears in \"The Dirtiest Business\". She has been abducted by the KGB and forced to work for them, and escapes from her handlers during a trip to London. The Tomorrow People try to find and help her but she is killed when the KGB detonate a micro-explosive planted in her body, to prevent her giving away their secrets.\n* '''Hsui Tai''' \u2013 ([[Misako Koba]]) Hsui Tai is a girl in her mid teens around the same age as Mike, introduced at the start of the sixth season. She is one of the living child gods worshipped by a sect of Chinese monks, who are sacrificed and supposedly reincarnated when they reach adulthood. After John and Mike put an end to the practice, Hsui Tai joins them in the lab. She adapts reasonably well to western ways but still encounters cultural difficulties on occasion.\n* '''Andrew Forbes''' \u2013 ([[Nigel Rhodes]])  Andrew is a Scottish boy who lives in a hotel run by his father. He gains the ability to project illusions and uses them to convince people the hotel is haunted in order to attract guests. His father initially believes he is possessed by a demon until the Tomorrow People get in touch and explain what Andrew is. Afterwards, he splits his time between the Tomorrow People and helping his father at the hotel.\n* '''Peter''' - (Richard Speight) \u2013 Peter is a Telepath from the 26th century, who refers to the current Tomorrow People as ''Homo novus'' (''New man'').<ref name=\"medusa\">{{cite episode|title=The Medusa Strain, Part 1|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1973-06-11|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|station=ITV1|season=1|number=7}}</ref> Appearing as a teenaged boy, it is later revealed that he is 163 years old.<ref name=\"rift2\">{{cite episode|title=A Rift in Time, Part 1: Vase of Mystery|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1974-03-11|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|station=ITV1|season=1|number=7}}</ref>\n* '''Timus''' \u2013 ([[Philip Gilbert]]) Timus Irnok Mosta is a maverick Galactic Federation diplomat and ally of the Tomorrow People. As revealed in the episode \"Worlds Apart\", Timus has sixty-four cloned brothers, including Tikno, who is also an ally of the Tomorrow People and the mentioned, but unseen Timon, who was the creator of TIM. \n* '''Zenon''' \u2013 ([[Stephen Jack (actor)|Stephen Jack]]) Zenon is the grandfather of Peter who appears in \"A Rift in Time\". Stephen encounters him while looking for Peter and Zenon gives him the ability to travel into the past.\n* '''Ginger 'Ginge' Harding''' \u2013 ([[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]]) Ginge is the leader of a biker gang who are hired by Jedikiah. He initially hunts the Tomorrow People but when he learns Jedikiah's true nature he changes sides. He is a regular fixture at the lab during the first season and often helps the Tomorrow People out with their problems. He is physically strong but occasionally shows a lack of intelligence.\n* '''Lefty''' \u2013 ([[Derek Crewe]]) Lefty is Ginger's sidekick. Like him, he is allied first with Jedikiah and then the Tomorrow People. He is somewhat dimwitted but occasionally seems more sensible than Ginge. He appears in \"The Slaves of Jedikiah\" and \"The Vanishing Earth\".\n* '''Chris Harding''' \u2013 ([[Chris Chittell]]) Chris is Ginger's younger brother, who replaces him as the Tomorrow People's human ally. Although often used for comic relief, he is quite intelligent, providing the solution to a problem on occasion notably in \"Secret Weapon\", and accompanies the Tomorrow People on a trip back in time in \"A Rift in Time\". He disappears after the first story of season three.\n* '''Professor Cawston''' \u2013 ([[Bryan Stanyon]]) Cawston is a parapsychology professor who Stephen shows some of his powers to in order to get access to a vase kept at his university. He later discovers Tyso, who is in the process of breaking out, and unwittingly brings him to the attention of Colonel Masters. The Tomorrow People contact him and explain who they are, and he becomes their ally against Masters and later Jedikiah.\n\n===Merchandise===\nA comic-strip version, based on the original series, was also produced, written by [[Angus P. Allan]] and printed in TV comic ''[[Look-In]]'' that ran somewhat concurrently with the 1970s series. [[Piccolo Books]] also released five tie-in novels during the seventies: ''The Visitor'' (1973), ''Three into Three'' (1974), ''Four into Three'' (1975), ''One Law'' (1976) and ''Lost Gods'' (1977). In 1978, there was also a children's annual. \"The Visitor\" was written before production began on the series and offers a glimpse of some of the original ideas for the show that never made it to screen. Most interesting is that the Tomorrow People contact TIM via wrist communicators, as the computer is non-telepathic while the characters of Ginge and Lefty are portrayed as much younger characters than they were on screen. Also the Lab is accessed from the back of a regular Tube station.\n\n==Revivals==\n\n===1990s series===\n{{anchor|The Tomorrow People (1992 TV series)}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = The Tomorrow People\n| image = TP logo.jpg\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = [[Roger Price (television producer)|Roger Damon Price]]\n| starring = [[Kristian Schmid|Kristian&nbsp;Schmid]], [[Christian Tessier|Christian&nbsp;Tessier]], [[Adam Pearce (UK actor)|Adam Pearce]], [[Kristen Ariza]], [[Naomie Harris]], [[Alexandra Milman]]\n| company = [[Tetra Films]]<br>[[Reeves Entertainment]]<br>[[Thames Television]]\n| country = United Kingdom\n| network = ITV\n| first_aired = 18 November 1992\n| last_aired = 8 March 1995\n| num_episodes = 25 ([[List of The Tomorrow People serials#1990s series|List]])\n|}}\n\n{{See also|List of The Tomorrow People serials#1990s series}}\n\nPrice produced the 1990s revival of ''The Tomorrow People'' for [[Tetra Films]] (an independent production company, mostly comprising the former children's department at Thames Television) in association with the Thames-owned American company [[Alan Landsburg Productions|Reeves Entertainment]] for Thames and Nickelodeon between 1992 and 1995 (broadcast by Central in 1994 and 1995 on ITV as Thames had lost its franchise at the end of 1992). After some pressure from executives, Price decided to start with a blank slate and so the show was almost completely different from its predecessor.<ref name=\"Clark\" /> The original cast, characters, and music were not used. The new series incorporated a multi-national cast to ensure that worldwide syndication sales would be easier to obtain.\n\nThe distinctive belt buckles were omitted, as the new Tomorrow People were able to teleport without them. The non-lethal stun guns and other gadgetry were also done away with. The new Tomorrow People relied more on their wits and powers to get out of trouble.\n\nThere remain some analogies, however. ''The Lab'' was replaced by a [[psychic]] spaceship in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] to which Tomorrow People are drawn when they \"break out\". ''TIM'' is replaced by an ostensibly mute computer that is part of the alien ship. The visual effects were improved considerably by effects artist Clive Davis compared to the original series, along with sets.\n\nThe lead role of Adam Newman was given to Australian actor [[Kristian Schmid]], who at the time was famous in the UK for his regular role in ''[[Neighbours]]''. The other original stars were American [[Kristen Ariza]] as Lisa Davies, British [[Adam Pearce (UK actor)|Adam Pearce]] (who had no previous acting experience) as Kevin Wilson and Canadian [[Christian Tessier]] as Kevin's American friend Marmaduke \"Megabyte\" Damon. The 1992 season consisted of a single five-part story written by Price, which had no on-screen title but was named as \"The Origin Story\" in the DVD release. Adam is newly broken out as the series begins with Lisa and Kevin breaking out simultaneously in the first episode. Megabyte also breaks out in the last episode of the story. This was the longest story since \"The Blue and the Green\" in the second season of the 1970s show and as a result there was more of the comedy setpieces which had been minimised in the later seasons of the earlier show. The plotline borrowed heavily from the 1975 story \"Secret Weapon\", even reusing the name of that story's villain Colonel Masters, and involved the intelligence services pursuing the Tomorrow People in order to use them for their own ends. The story also introduced [[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]] as Megabyte's father General Damon, an American officer stationed in the United Kingdom, who became a regular ally to the Tomorrow People.\n\nThe second season was filmed in 1993 and began transmitting in January 1994, with Price now credited as executive producer and the writing handed over to [[Grant Cathro]] and [[Lee Pressman (writer)|Lee Pressman]], who had previously experience writing [[CITV]]'s other children's fantasy series ''[[T-Bag]]'' and ''[[Mike and Angelo]]''. The seasons were expanded to ten episodes, comprising two five-part stories. Cathro and Pressman plotted the stories together then scripted one each (for the second season they were credited as co-writers, for the third they were only credited on the story they scripted). They chose to power down the Tomorrow People slightly, since the first story had shown Lisa reviving from the dead at one point. The lengthy scenes on the island where the ship was located from the first season were dropped, with the ship exterior only seen in stock establishing shots and the Tomorrow People now teleporting directly into the ship when they broke out rather than the ocean around it.\n\nLisa was dropped without explanation and Kevin's role was severely reduced, with him only appearing in three episodes of the first story and spending most of his time comatose before also being dropped with no explanation. As a result, the series now focused on Adam and Megabyte, two characters who had not interacted in the first season, and their relationship soon mirrored than between John and Stephen in the original series. Breaking out in the opening episode of the season was Ami Jackson, played by [[Naomie Harris]]. Her mother Hasana, played by [[Sally Sagoe]], would have small roles in the remaining stories, initially trying to stop Ami spending time with the Tomorrow People before accepting her need to use her powers to help others. The first story of the second season, \"The Culex Experiment\", guest starred [[Jean Marsh]] as the villainous Doctor Culex.\n\nThe third season debuted the following year: The opening story, \"The Rameses Connection\", guest starred [[Christopher Lee]] as lead villain Sam Rees/[[Rameses]]. It saw the first example of the phrase \"breaking out\" being used and of the Tomorrow People's powers being blocked, when Rameses prevents Adam from teleporting, both key features of the 1970s show. The second story, \"The Living Stones\", only featured Ami in a small role in the first episode, with her absence explained as her being on holiday with her mother. Instead, Jade Weston, a minor character from \"The Culex Experiment\" played by [[Alexandra Milman]], was brought back to accompany Adam and Megabyte and broke out as a Tomorrow Person in the last episode. This story featured the first use of aliens in the 1990s series, as the Tomorrow People battled a group of alien spores which had crashed near a village and possessed most of the villagers. Shortly after this, it was announced that the show would not be returning for a fourth season.\n\n===Audio revival===\n{{See also|List of The Tomorrow People serials#Audio series}}\n\nIn 2001, [[Big Finish Productions]] launched a series of new audio plays based on the original series, produced by [[Nigel Fairs]]. [[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]] and [[Philip Gilbert]] reprised their roles as John and TIM, with Helen Goldwyn and [[James Daniel Wilson]] appearing as Elena and Paul, the new Tomorrow People. Some releases also feature other original cast members, such as [[Peter Vaughan-Clarke]], [[Elizabeth Adare]] and [[Mike Holoway]] (notably ''Trigonometry''). [[Trevor Littledale]] took over the role of TIM in the audio series from ''The Warlock's Dance'' onwards after Philip Gilbert's death in 2004.\n\nFive series were produced of the audio series. It was cancelled in December 2007 because of the discontinuation of a licensing arrangement with Fremantle Media Enterprises. CDs of the series were permanently withdrawn from sale on 7 January 2008. However, the CDs are often still available from online sellers such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[eBay]], and at science fiction conventions.<ref>{{cite press release|url=http://www.bigfinish.com/index.asp?function=WEBPAGE&page=3 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080103135757/http://www.bigfinish.com/index.asp?function=WEBPAGE&page=3| url-status= dead |website= BigFinish.com| archivedate= 3 January 2008|title=News and Features: The Tomorrow People \u2013 Licence Not Renewed|date=2007-12-19 }}</ref>\n\n===2013 American series===\n{{main|The Tomorrow People (U.S. TV series)}}\nIn November 2012, ''[[Deadline Hollywood]]'' announced that [[Julie Plec]] and [[Greg Berlanti]] had obtained the rights to ''The Tomorrow People'' and commissioned a pilot written by [[Phil Klemmer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2012/11/greg-berlanti-julie-plec-to-produce-cw-adaptation-of-uk-show-tomorrow-people/ |title=Greg Berlanti & Julie Plec To Produce CW Adaptation Of UK Show 'Tomorrow People' |website=Deadline Hollywood | first=Nellie |last= Andreeva}}</ref> This occurred after a similar rights option expired to an aborted attempt two years previously.\n\nIt was announced on 28 January 2013 that the revival had received a pilot order from [[The CW Television Network]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/01/28/cw-greenlights-the-originals-and-tomorrow-people-a-sci-fi-series-from-arrow-the-vampire-diaries-creators/ |title=CW Greenlights The Originals and Tomorrow People, Sci-Fi Series from Arrow and The Vampire Diaries Creators |publisher=ign.com | first= Roth |last= Cornet |date= 28 January 2013}}</ref> On 21 February 2013, Australian actor [[Luke Mitchell]] was cast for the pilot as John Young.\n\nThe pilot was picked up as a series on 9 May 2013.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kenneally|first=Tim|title=CW picks up 'Tomorrow People,' '100,' 'Star-Crossed,' 'Reign'|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-us-cw-seriesbre949013-20130509,0,2461543.story|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=13 May 2013|date=9 May 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014195814/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/sns-rt-us-cw-seriesbre949013-20130509,0,2461543.story|archivedate=14 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It aired on Wednesdays in the 9:00 pm Eastern/8:00 pm Central timeslot following ''[[Arrow (TV series)|Arrow]]''.

This version used the same basic premise as the original series with some changes, and ran until 8 March 1995. A series of audio plays using the original concept and characters (and many of the original series' actors) was produced by [[Big Finish Productions]] between 2001 and 2007. In 2013, an [[The Tomorrow People (U.S. TV series)|American remake of the show]] premiered on [[The CW]].\n\n==Premise==\nAll incarnations of the show concerned the emergence of the next stage of [[human evolution]] (''[[Superhuman#Science fiction|Homo novis]]'') known colloquially as ''Tomorrow People''. Born to [[human]] parents, an apparently normal child might at some point between childhood and late adolescence experience a process called 'breaking out' and develop special paranormal abilities. These abilities include [[psionic]] powers such as [[telepathy]], [[psychokinesis|telekinesis]], and [[teleportation]]. However, their psychological make-up prevents them from intentionally killing others.\n\n==Original series (1970s)==\n{{anchor|The Tomorrow People (1973 TV series)}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = The Tomorrow People\n| image = TOMOLOGO.jpg\n| genre = [[Superhero]] / [[Fantasy]] / [[Drama]] / [[Sci-Fi]]\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = [[Roger Price (television producer)|Roger Price]]\n| starring = [[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]], [[Elizabeth Adare]], [[Peter Vaughan-Clarke]], Margaret Burton, [[Philip Gilbert]], Stephen Salmon, [[Sammie Winmill]], Dean Lawrence, [[Mike Holoway]], Misako Koba, Nigel Rhodes\n| music = [[Dudley Simpson]]\n| country = United Kingdom\n| network = [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]\n| first_aired = 30 April 1973\n| last_aired = 19 February 1979\n| num_episodes = 68 ([[List of The Tomorrow People serials#1970s series|List]])\n|}}\n{{See also|List of The Tomorrow People serials#1970s series}}\n===Season One===\nThe original series was produced by [[Thames Television]] for ITV. The Tomorrow People operate from a secret base, ''The Lab'', built in an [[Closed London Underground stations|abandoned]] [[London Underground]] station. The team constantly watches for new Tomorrow People \"breaking out\" (usually around the age of puberty) to help them through the process as the youngsters endure mental agonies as their minds suddenly change. They sometimes deal with attention from extraterrestrial species as well as facing more earthbound dangers with military forces across the globe keen to recruit or capture them for their own ends. One thing they lack is the capability to intentionally take another life. This pacifistic element of their make up is referred to as the \"prime barrier\" and any Tomorrow Person who causes the loss of a human life would be driven insane by the confusion in their brain. They also have connections with the \"Galactic Federation\" which oversees the welfare of telepathic species throughout the galaxy. In addition to their psychic powers (the so-called 3T's of telepathy, telekinesis and teleportation), they use advanced technology such as the biological (called in the series \"biotronic\") computer [[TIM (Tomorrow People)|TIM]], which is capable of [[Artificial intelligence|original thought]], telepathy, and can augment their psychic powers. TIM also helps the Tomorrow People to teleport long distances, although they must be wearing a device installed into a belt or bracelet for this to work. Teleportation is referred to as ''jaunting'' in the programme. The team used jaunting belts up to the end of Series 5, after which they used much smaller wristbands.\n\nIn the original series, the Tomorrow People are also referred to as both Homo Novis and ''[[Homo superior]]''. The term ''Homo Superior'' was originally coined by [[Olaf Stapledon]] in his 1935 novel ''[[Odd John]]''. This is also the term that comics writer [[Stan Lee]] has his [[Magneto (Marvel Comics)|Magneto]] character use to refer to mutants in ''[[X-Men]]'' #1, 1963. The same term later appeared in [[David Bowie]]'s 1971 song \"[[Oh! You Pretty Things]]\": \"Let me make it plain. You gotta make way for the Homo Superior.\" This term came up as part of a conversation between Roger Price and David Bowie at a meeting at Granada Studios in Manchester when Price was directing a programme in which Bowie was appearing. Price had been working on a script for his Tomorrow People project and during a conversation with Bowie, the term ''Homo superior'' came up. Bowie liked the term and soon afterwards wrote it into his song. Price has sometimes been quoted as saying that the lyrics to this song were inspired by the series.<ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite web |url=http://www.effdee.demon.co.uk/new%20TP%20site/Interviews/Roger.htm |title=\"You must be joking\" In conversation with Roger Damon Price |publisher=Jackie Clark }}</ref>\n\nAlistair McGown of [[Screenonline]] cites the book ''The Mind in Chains'' by [[Christopher Evans (computer scientist)|Dr Christopher Evans]] as a primary source. Evans also became a scientific advisor for the series. He would be credited as such on every single episode but most people working on the show seem to recall that he only had involvement in the first couple of series.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/904684/index.html |website=Screen Online| title= Tomorrow People, The (1973\u201379, 92\u201395)| accessdate= 27 May 2015}}</ref> McGown also suggests a similarity between ''The Tomorrow People'' and the children's fantasy fiction of [[Enid Blyton]].\n\nWhile they reveal their existence to some, the Tomorrow People generally operate in secrecy for fear that normal people (whom they term \"Saps\", an abbreviation of ''[[Homo sapiens]]'') will either fear or victimise them because of their special powers, or try to exploit them for military purposes. In order to defend themselves they must use non-lethal weaponry such as \"stun guns\" or martial arts; this is owing to their genetic unwillingness to kill, referred to as the \"prime barrier\". In early series they would have the aid of \"Sap\" friends such as Ginge, Lefty and Chris who would usually handle the rougher stuff that the pacifist TPs could not deal with. Also in the second and third series they become friendly with a psychic researcher named Professor Cawston who assisted them and vice versa.\n\nRoger Price dreamed up the idea in 1970; he initially offered the format to Granada, where he was working, but was turned down so offered it to [[Southern Television]], who expressed an interest but had concerns over the budgetary requirements. Finally, Lewis Rudd at Thames Television commissioned a 13-episode series, having seen the potential of the format and looking to replace ''[[Ace of Wands (TV series)|Ace of Wands]]'' after its three-year run. At this time, ITV was keen to find its own answer to ''[[Doctor Who]]'', although Price never really envisaged the show as such but more as an outlet for his own personal ideas and beliefs. Very early on, Ruth Boswell was brought in as associate producer and script editor as she had experience of children's fantasy drama (''[[Timeslip]]'' and ''Tightrope'') while TV dramatist [[Brian Finch]] was hired to co-write the scripts in view of the fact that Price had little experience of writing drama. Finch disliked the experience as he was not engaged by the material and found a large part of his time was taken up in trying to rein in Price and his very ambitious ideas. Thames enlisted the services of ''Doctor Who'' director [[Paul Bernard (director)|Paul Bernard]] to help set up and oversee the first series. He would be credited as director for two stories but was unofficially a third producer. Bernard was very heavily involved in the creation of the memorable title sequence which involved a mixture of haunting images and facial shots of the main cast zooming towards the camera in monochrome, with an eerie theme tune from prolific ''Doctor Who'' composer, [[Dudley Simpson]], playing behind. He got inspiration from seeing billboards rushing towards him when driving. The sequence opened with a clenched fist opening out to signify a telepathic mind breaking out. Amongst the next shots were a human foetus, shadowy figures behind scaffolding and even the insides of a [[bell pepper]] (a somewhat exotic fruit in the UK in the 1970s).\n\nOver its six-year run the format would prove flexible enough to encompass various type of stories including traditional alien invasions adventures as well as entering into genres such as espionage thrillers, slapstick comedy, time travel, political satires, space opera and even on occasion more adult concepts than would be normally found in a teatime drama for children. At a time when [[Mary Whitehouse]] was regularly criticising violence in ''Doctor Who'', ''The Tomorrow People'' featured dagger wielding Devil worshippers and a direct implication of prostitution in the 1977 season but managed to escape her censure. As it was aimed at young people, then it would often reflect popular fashions and fads of the time but usually with a suitable sinister twist. For example, \"Hitler's Last Secret\" in 1978 involved the TPs investigating a sudden craze for wearing Nazi uniforms amongst teenagers (reflecting the actions of the then contemporary punk rockers) but is a precursor to Hitler being revived from suspended animation by a group of Nazis. The following season's \"The Living Skins\" saw aliens transforming themselves into fashionable plastic jump suits that would control and eventually kill the millions of people who wear them. The most notable example was in the fondly remembered 1974 adventure \"The Blue and the Green\" which sees the whole of humanity divided by a craze to wear blue or green badges and for a children's show, the whole concept of classroom violence is handled maturely by Price and his production team. In 1977 Mike joins a pop band, \"The Heart of Sogguth\" whose hell-raising music will bring back the Devil when millions of teenagers are watching them on television. The popularity of the book \"Chariots of the Gods\" was also an influence on 1975's \"Worlds Away\" when it is revealed that the evil Kulthan had controlled and assisted the ancient Egyptians.\n\nPrice saw the lead casting as very important as he wanted talented and attractive actors who would appeal to the young audience but also be personable and easy to work with during the long hours envisaged in studio or out on location. [[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]] was cast as the group's leader, John, while [[Peter Vaughan-Clarke|Peter Vaughan Clarke]] was offered the role of Stephen after Price saw him in a Manchester rendition of ''Peter Pan'' with [[Lulu (singer)|Lulu]]. Ruth Boswell wanted [[Lynne Frederick]] (later the last wife of [[Peter Sellers]]) for Carol, the female lead, but following a meeting with her, Paul Bernard felt she was a bit too upper-class and precious for what he had in mind as he saw the character as being similar to ''Doctor Who'''s [[Jo Grant]]. They finally settled on [[Sammie Winmill]] who was relatively well-known for playing Nurse Crumpton on the popular ''[[Doctor at Large (TV series)|Doctor at Large]]'' situation comedy (also a Thames production). The role of Kenny, the youngest TP, was given to Stephen Salmon after he had been discovered in a drama workshop while theatre actor Philip Gilbert was selected to provide the paternal tones of biotronic computer TIM. Making up the team were two Sap friends, a couple of bikers called Ginge ([[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]]) and Lefty ([[Derek Crewe]]) who encounter the Tomorrow People when acting as henchmen for the villainous shape-shifter [[Jedikiah (Tomorrow People)|Jedikiah]] in the opening adventure. Stephen would be very much the show's hero and focus for the audience while John was something of an authoritarian figure who took his responsibilities for the species' future and welfare very seriously. Young was the only TP to be in every single episode and the actor was able to have some say in the production of later seasons as he was considered as an unofficial producer. Kenny was given very little to do and was often left behind in the Lab (due to being the youngest) while the others went off to have the actual adventures. Filming commenced in March 1973 with location work in Muswell Hill. Production of this first story, \"The Slaves of Jedikiah\" was much troubled as the crew found they were unfamiliar with the technical demands of a science fiction drama. The first day in studio was disastrous with virtually no usable material getting made and there was some tension between the cast and Paul Bernard who was very authoritarian with them. Also Nicholas Young banged himself hard into a wall while working on the darkened entrance to the Lab which was being filmed inside the real disused tube station at Wood Lane (closed in the 1940s). Fortunately he was not badly injured and able to carry on later that day after a recovery break.\n\nEarly publicity included a photo session of the cast with the ''Doctor Who'' star, [[Jon Pertwee]], to indicate a friendly rivalry between the two shows. ''[[Look-in]]'' magazine would provide a great deal of coverage of the series and by July would have launched its own comic strip version (which ran on and off in its pages for the next five years). ''[[TVTimes]]'' also promoted the new show with an article on its first week.\n\nThe production procedure was very much standard in the seventies with a limited amount of location work (done on film) followed by a day in studio to record each episode on videotape. Even for the time, some of the special effects of the show were considered sub-par, largely attributable to its small budget.<ref>{{cite web|title= The Tomorrow People Introduction| url=http://www.clivebanks.co.uk/TP%20Intro.htm|publisher=clivebanks.co.uk|accessdate=1 May 2014}}</ref> The first season was budgeted at approx \u00a35000 per episode which was roughly half the cost of what the BBC were making Dr Who for. Most directors on the show would rely heavily on [[chroma key]] to get their desired effects, but owing to the rushed time on studio days, the results varied greatly in outcome. To make it even more difficult, studio time was restricted as English law dictated that juvenile actors could only work a certain number of hours in a day.\n\nSeason one's recurring villain, Jedikiah, was originally devised to be a long-running foe (like the Master from Dr Who), but after seeing the poorly-designed robot that was the shape-changer's true form, an unimpressed Price elected not to use the character again until the finale of series three which was planned at that time as the series' finale (the robotic form noticeably fails to appear). Despite these limitations, the series proved popular with its young audience who watched in large numbers, even denting the figures for the popular BBC magazine programme ''[[Blue Peter]]''.\n\n===Season Two ===\n\nThe success of the first series saw another 13 episodes go into production quite soon after, but with a number of changes. Off-screen, both Bernard and Finch departed leaving Price to take more control as writer, director and producer, while on-screen Kenny and Carol disappeared (sent to the Galactic Federation's headquarters The Trig to work as ambassadors for Earth). Salmon was simply not asked back as there was a feeling the character had failed to work and his acting was considered wooden (plus Salmon had never been very keen to appear as he had no interest in acting), while Winmill's departure was voluntary as the actress was concerned about being associated with a long running series. In their place came student school teacher Elizabeth M'Bondo, portrayed by [[Elizabeth Adare]]. Adare initially thought her character was to be a teenage girl and made every effort at her audition to look and act like an adolescent. However, Price and Boswell were suitably impressed to change the Elizabeth character so that she breaks out at an older age due to a latent puberty. Elizabeth is uncovered by Stephen when working at his school where she is doing her teacher training. This was the start of a near-annual event where a new TP would be introduced in the first story of each series, a handy way of maintaining interest for returning viewers and a convenient way for Price to re-establish the basic premise of the show for new audiences every year. Adare would stay until the end in 1979 but grew increasingly unhappy with the quality of later scripts. However she knew how important and ground breaking it was for a black actress to be the female lead in a British TV production so consciously decided to stick around.\n\nFilming of Series 2 began in late 1973 with Michael Standing returning as Ginge, but on the first day he fell off his motorbike and broke his leg, prompting a speedy rewrite whereby Ginge's younger brother, Chris ([[Chris Chittell]]), was now seen as the new Sap regular. Chris was mentioned in the dialogue as already being known to the Tomorrow People, so little in the way of changes had to be made to the script. Ginge's absence was explained on-screen by his having been admitted to hospital following a fall from his motorbike, reflecting Standing's real-life accident. Price later commented that he felt neither Ginge or Lefty had ever felt right for the format.\n\n=== Season Three ===\n\nIn 1975, the third series added Dean Lawrence as gypsy Tyso Boswell, yet another character from a minority as Price was determined that the Tomorrow People could be from any ethnic or society background. Chris disappears after only appearing in one episode (his absence is never explained) while telepathic secret agent Tricia Conway appears in two stories before fully breaking out in the series climax which saw the young heroes menaced by old rival, Jedikiah. Viewers saw on screen why the youngsters have to maintain their secrecy and constant vigilance from the rest of humanity, as the British Secret Intelligence Service ruthlessly hunt them down for their own purposes in the opening adventure. This series also saw the group visit an alien world for the first time when the Galactic Trig dispatches them to help the telepathic population of the planet Peerie. Production on this story ran into trouble when Lawrence hurt his knee during location filming and the injury had to be included in the script.\n\nA comedy script was attempted in the much-derided \"A Man for Emily\" (starring a young [[Peter Davison]]) because Price was keen to get more into humorous writing. The negative backlash to this experiment resulted in a planned sequel story being quietly dropped; however, such actions added to Price's increasing frustration with the show. Philip Gilbert also made the first of several on-screen appearances as Timus Irnok Mosta, an ambassador from the Galactic Federation who had a hand in building TIM thus sounding alike. Timus was a clone and his brother, Tikno also appears. They would make semi-regular appearances until the final story in 1979, and helped fulfil a clause in Gilbert's contract that he had to be seen or heard at least once every episode. As stated, old enemy Jedikiah made a dramatic return to exact revenge in the last story. It ends with an air of finality as the Tomorrow People (including the just broken out Trisha Conway), having only just survived the encounter (at one point John, Elizabeth and Tikno are violently gunned down and left barely alive), decide to leave Earth for the Galactic Trig with only a vague, haunting promise from Elizabeth that they will return...sometime.\n\n=== Season Four ===\n\nBy now, Price had become tired of his creation and attempted to end it by killing off the leads at the conclusion to Series 3, but Ruth Boswell made him rewrite it so that they survived. However Thames Television had a ratings winner (as well as excellent overseas sales) and insisted he continue the programme, albeit in shorter, staggered seasons from now on. Price only ever allowed one attempt by another writer to work on it solo, with John E. Watkins penning the story \"Into the Unknown\" broadcast in early 1976. Price was not satisfied with the final episodes and decided from now on he would be sole writer. Having fewer episodes to write every year, Price would have more time to work on his comedic and light-entertainment productions, which he enjoyed more than the demanding sci-fi drama. At the start of the fourth series he attempted to give a boost to the format with the introduction of teenage idol [[Mike Holoway]] as Mike Bell. Holoway was the drummer with pop band [[Flintlock (musical group)|Flintlock]] who were the regular house band on Price's \"You Must Be Joking\" and Price hoped that his young charge would be Britain's answer to [[Donny Osmond]] or [[David Cassidy]]. Mike's arrival swells the ranks of TPs in the Lab to five (Tricia had remained on the Trig) which made things look a bit overcrowded, this led to the decision to sack Vaughan-Clarke as Stephen, who ignobly disappears off screen after the season finished and is never even mentioned again. Mike was now very much being touted as the show's hero and with this change, it was noticeable that John and Elizabeth took on a more parental role as both actors entered their mid-20s. Tyso also vanished after the fourth year but his character had been mostly redundant for some time due to not having been written into scripts that year. His late inclusion was only addressed a couple of weeks before filming started when Price discovered from Lawrence that he was still available to appear in the programme (he had been led to believe that he had moved abroad). This meant Tyso only had limited screen time and very few lines. Anne Curthoys was asked back to play Tricia but was committed to a daytime soap at Thames.\n\n=== Season Five ===\n\nVic Hughes took over as producer for Series 5, which began transmission in early 1977 and was the only series not to introduce a new Tomorrow person (although the first story does feature a potential TP in doomed Russian teenager, Pavla). All three adventures were two-parters which allowed Price to write them quickly and remove any unwanted excess padding which tended to slow down the action. Mike Holoway was now very much the star of the show as on screen, Mike developed into the resident hero guided by an increasingly parental John and Elizabeth. His band Flintlock even appeared in the closing adventure, \"The Heart of Sogguth\". From this season on, Price would only be credited as the writer but he retained overall control of the series and was very heavily involved in major decisions.\n\n==== Season Six ====\n\n1978 saw changes being made, starting with Elizabeth's absence through most of Series 6 due to Elizabeth Adare's pregnancy (on screen Elizabeth is working on diplomatic missions for the Galactic Federation and appears only briefly on a screen so as to hide the actress's condition). In her place came Hsui Tai, played by Japanese actress Misako Koba, whose poor grasp of English made her hard to understand and Nicholas Young later recalled that he and other actors found this difficult during production. Koba had no previous acting experience and had been suggested for the role by her actor husband. A new Lab set was introduced with a smaller but now mobile TIM and the jaunting belts were replaced by the rather cheap looking jaunting bands (worn on the wrists). These changes were forced on the production team following a fire at the Thames storerooms. The new Lab acted as both base and home for the Tomorrow People as they were now seen to be sleeping in their own cabins there. It was noticeably smaller than the previous set, which freed up more space in the studio for the designers to utilise on other sets. The 6 episodes were produced sporadically through 1977 (a combination of Price writing scripts as and when it fitted with his other production commitments and a number of strikes at ITV over the year) and finally launched in the Spring of 78. Such was Holoway's popularity that he was featured on the cover of TV Times to promote the start of the season.\n\n=== Season Seven ===\n\nSeason 7 in late 1978 introduced another Tomorrow person in the form of young Scottish lad Andrew Forbes ([[Nigel Rhodes]]). Rhodes had previously worked as an extra on \"A Much Needed Holiday\" but became more known to Price when he worked on his 1977 comedy series, \"You Can't Be Serious\". The young actor was delighted to win the role, as he was a great fan of the show. Andrew is introduced after he starts using his psychic powers to conjure up images of ghosts so as to provide a tourism attraction for the hotel owned by his father. Elizabeth also returned from her year on the Trig.\n\n=== Season Eight and cancellation ===\n\nWith inflation out of control in the late-1970s, the budget was stretched to breaking point, a factor which was constantly on the mind of producer Vic Hughes. A dispute over the allocation of studio days ended the show in 1979 when Hughes attempted to gain an extra studio day for the planned ninth series (which fell victim to the ITV strike that summer) following numerous problems during the production of \"War of the Empires\" (the sole four-part adventure that made up series 8) which had been given only four days in studio. This was partially due to a very ambitious script that, with its numerous space battles, was heavily influenced by \"Star Wars\". Also by this point Price had emigrated to America after being headhunted to help set up Nickelodeon children's channel and Thames were reluctant to carry on without him. However some of the lead actors were of the opinion that the series was disliked within Thames due to its great success. Whatever the reason, it finally vanished after a short repeat run in early 1980.\n\n===Cast===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}\n* '''TIM''' (voice of [[Philip Gilbert]]) is a biological computer, programmed with an artificially created intelligence, whose tubes are filled with ''bio-fluid''. He was partially built by John, the leader of the Tomorrow People, and was given to them by the ''Galactic Council''. TIM is housed in ''The Lab'', situated in a disused station in the [[London Underground]]. TIM often helps out the Tomorrow People by providing vital information, which the telepaths can use in their current adventure. TIM's voice is identical to that of diplomat Timus Irnok Mosta from the Galactic Federation, because Timus' clone-brother Tykno is the premier AI scientist of the Federation and all Federation AI's have their voice.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}\n* '''John''' ([[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]]) \u2013 Aged 17, John is the leader of the Tomorrow People.<ref name=\"slaves\">{{cite episode|title=The Slaves of Jedikiah, Part 1|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1973-04-30|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|station=[[ITV1]]|season=1|number=1}}</ref> He is an inventor and scientist.<ref name=\"slaves2\">{{cite episode|title=The Slaves of Jedikiah, Part 2|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1973-05-07|network=ITV|station=ITV1|season=1|number=2}}</ref> He built ''The Lab'' and the biological computer, [[TIM (Tomorrow People)|TIM]], with some help from the Galactic Council.

By the end of the serial, Jedikiah had been damaged and jettisoned into space. By the time he is recovered (in \"The Medusa Strain\"), 500 years had passed, and the damage caused to Jedikiah in the previous story, coupled with this long isolation, had driven the robot insane, possessing a pathological hatred of the Tomorrow People. He has since devoted his existence to their destruction. However, in \"The Revenge of Jedikiah\", in which the character made his final appearance, he was stripped of his shape-shifting powers by Timus and the Galactic Federation and condemned to labor on Earth forever as a homeless derelict.\n* '''Elizabeth M'Bondo''' \u2013 ([[Elizabeth Adare]]) Elizabeth is the first addition to the original line-up, introduced at the beginning of the second season. She is a student teacher at Stephen's school and is said to be the same age as John. She often brings a sense of compassion to the Tomorrow People and is one of the few people capable of standing up to John, notably in \"The Doomsday Men\" when she convinces him to save stranded astronaut Lee, as well as facing down several villains. Towards the end of the series, she becomes more involved in galactic affairs and spends a lot of time at the Galactic Trig, including the whole of season six.\n* '''Tyso Boswell''' \u2013 (Dean Lawrence) Tyso is introduced at the start of the third season. He comes from a gypsy background and has a number of younger siblings. The Tomorrow People first encounter him when he is captured by Colonel Masters. He forms a partnership with Stephen in some stories and takes a cheeky attitude towards many of the situations the Tomorrow People find themselves in.\n* '''Patricia Conway''' \u2013 ([[Anne Curthoys]]) Tricia is a telepath working for Colonel Masters at the Experimental Weapons Establishment, who appears in \"Secret Weapon\" and \"Revenge of Jedikiah\". She is initially at odds with the Tomorrow People, seeking to capture them and force them to work for British Intelligence. After Masters' death, she allies with the Tomorrow People against Jedikiah. She hears Stephen's telepathic cry for help, causing her to break out and jaunt to the lab. Afterwards, she goes to work at the Trig.\n* '''Mike Bell''' \u2013 ([[Mike Holoway]]) Mike is a working class Cockney who lives with his mother and sister. He is introduced at the start of season four when a group of London criminals try to force him to use his powers to help them commit crimes. Although loyal to the Tomorrow People, he is less willing than some of the others to blindly follow John's orders and they often clash. In later series, he occasionally takes on a leadership role when John and Elizabeth are absent, notably in \"War of the Empires\".\n* '''Pavla Vlasova''' \u2013 ([[Anulka Dziubinska]]) Pavla is a Russian telepath who appears in \"The Dirtiest Business\". She has been abducted by the KGB and forced to work for them, and escapes from her handlers during a trip to London. The Tomorrow People try to find and help her but she is killed when the KGB detonate a micro-explosive planted in her body, to prevent her giving away their secrets.\n* '''Hsui Tai''' \u2013 ([[Misako Koba]]) Hsui Tai is a girl in her mid teens around the same age as Mike, introduced at the start of the sixth season. She is one of the living child gods worshipped by a sect of Chinese monks, who are sacrificed and supposedly reincarnated when they reach adulthood. After John and Mike put an end to the practice, Hsui Tai joins them in the lab. She adapts reasonably well to western ways but still encounters cultural difficulties on occasion.\n* '''Andrew Forbes''' \u2013 ([[Nigel Rhodes]])  Andrew is a Scottish boy who lives in a hotel run by his father. He gains the ability to project illusions and uses them to convince people the hotel is haunted in order to attract guests. His father initially believes he is possessed by a demon until the Tomorrow People get in touch and explain what Andrew is. Afterwards, he splits his time between the Tomorrow People and helping his father at the hotel.\n* '''Peter''' - (Richard Speight) \u2013 Peter is a Telepath from the 26th century, who refers to the current Tomorrow People as ''Homo novus'' (''New man'').<ref name=\"medusa\">{{cite episode|title=The Medusa Strain, Part 1|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1973-06-11|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|station=ITV1|season=1|number=7}}</ref> Appearing as a teenaged boy, it is later revealed that he is 163 years old.<ref name=\"rift2\">{{cite episode|title=A Rift in Time, Part 1: Vase of Mystery|series=The Tomorrow People|airdate=1974-03-11|network=[[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]|station=ITV1|season=1|number=7}}</ref>\n* '''Timus''' \u2013 ([[Philip Gilbert]]) Timus Irnok Mosta is a maverick Galactic Federation diplomat and ally of the Tomorrow People. As revealed in the episode \"Worlds Apart\", Timus has sixty-four cloned brothers, including Tikno, who is also an ally of the Tomorrow People and the mentioned, but unseen Timon, who was the creator of TIM. \n* '''Zenon''' \u2013 ([[Stephen Jack (actor)|Stephen Jack]]) Zenon is the grandfather of Peter who appears in \"A Rift in Time\". Stephen encounters him while looking for Peter and Zenon gives him the ability to travel into the past.\n* '''Ginger 'Ginge' Harding''' \u2013 ([[Michael Standing (actor)|Michael Standing]]) Ginge is the leader of a biker gang who are hired by Jedikiah. He initially hunts the Tomorrow People but when he learns Jedikiah's true nature he changes sides. He is a regular fixture at the lab during the first season and often helps the Tomorrow People out with their problems. He is physically strong but occasionally shows a lack of intelligence.\n* '''Lefty''' \u2013 ([[Derek Crewe]]) Lefty is Ginger's sidekick. Like him, he is allied first with Jedikiah and then the Tomorrow People. He is somewhat dimwitted but occasionally seems more sensible than Ginge. He appears in \"The Slaves of Jedikiah\" and \"The Vanishing Earth\".\n* '''Chris Harding''' \u2013 ([[Chris Chittell]]) Chris is Ginger's younger brother, who replaces him as the Tomorrow People's human ally. Although often used for comic relief, he is quite intelligent, providing the solution to a problem on occasion notably in \"Secret Weapon\", and accompanies the Tomorrow People on a trip back in time in \"A Rift in Time\". He disappears after the first story of season three.\n* '''Professor Cawston''' \u2013 ([[Bryan Stanyon]]) Cawston is a parapsychology professor who Stephen shows some of his powers to in order to get access to a vase kept at his university. He later discovers Tyso, who is in the process of breaking out, and unwittingly brings him to the attention of Colonel Masters. The Tomorrow People contact him and explain who they are, and he becomes their ally against Masters and later Jedikiah.\n\n===Merchandise===\nA comic-strip version, based on the original series, was also produced, written by [[Angus P. Allan]] and printed in TV comic ''[[Look-In]]'' that ran somewhat concurrently with the 1970s series. [[Piccolo Books]] also released five tie-in novels during the seventies: ''The Visitor'' (1973), ''Three into Three'' (1974), ''Four into Three'' (1975), ''One Law'' (1976) and ''Lost Gods'' (1977). In 1978, there was also a children's annual. \"The Visitor\" was written before production began on the series and offers a glimpse of some of the original ideas for the show that never made it to screen. Most interesting is that the Tomorrow People contact TIM via wrist communicators, as the computer is non-telepathic while the characters of Ginge and Lefty are portrayed as much younger characters than they were on screen. Also the Lab is accessed from the back of a regular Tube station.\n\n==Revivals==\n\n===1990s series===\n{{anchor|The Tomorrow People (1992 TV series)}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name = The Tomorrow People\n| image = TP logo.jpg\n| runtime = 30 minutes\n| creator = [[Roger Price (television producer)|Roger Damon Price]]\n| starring = [[Kristian Schmid|Kristian&nbsp;Schmid]], [[Christian Tessier|Christian&nbsp;Tessier]], [[Adam Pearce (UK actor)|Adam Pearce]], [[Kristen Ariza]], [[Naomie Harris]], [[Alexandra Milman]]\n| company = [[Tetra Films]]<br>[[Reeves Entertainment]]<br>[[Thames Television]]\n| country = United Kingdom\n| network = ITV\n| first_aired = 18 November 1992\n| last_aired = 8 March 1995\n| num_episodes = 25 ([[List of The Tomorrow People serials#1990s series|List]])\n|}}\n\n{{See also|List of The Tomorrow People serials#1990s series}}\n\nPrice produced the 1990s revival of ''The Tomorrow People'' for [[Tetra Films]] (an independent production company, mostly comprising the former children's department at Thames Television) in association with the Thames-owned American company [[Alan Landsburg Productions|Reeves Entertainment]] for Thames and Nickelodeon between 1992 and 1995 (broadcast by Central in 1994 and 1995 on ITV as Thames had lost its franchise at the end of 1992). After some pressure from executives, Price decided to start with a blank slate and so the show was almost completely different from its predecessor.<ref name=\"Clark\" /> The original cast, characters, and music were not used. The new series incorporated a multi-national cast to ensure that worldwide syndication sales would be easier to obtain.\n\nThe distinctive belt buckles were omitted, as the new Tomorrow People were able to teleport without them. The non-lethal stun guns and other gadgetry were also done away with. The new Tomorrow People relied more on their wits and powers to get out of trouble.\n\nThere remain some analogies, however. ''The Lab'' was replaced by a [[psychic]] spaceship in the [[Oceania|South Pacific]] to which Tomorrow People are drawn when they \"break out\". ''TIM'' is replaced by an ostensibly mute computer that is part of the alien ship. The visual effects were improved considerably by effects artist Clive Davis compared to the original series, along with sets.\n\nThe lead role of Adam Newman was given to Australian actor [[Kristian Schmid]], who at the time was famous in the UK for his regular role in ''[[Neighbours]]''. The other original stars were American [[Kristen Ariza]] as Lisa Davies, British [[Adam Pearce (UK actor)|Adam Pearce]] (who had no previous acting experience) as Kevin Wilson and Canadian [[Christian Tessier]] as Kevin's American friend Marmaduke \"Megabyte\" Damon. The 1992 season consisted of a single five-part story written by Price, which had no on-screen title but was named as \"The Origin Story\" in the DVD release. Adam is newly broken out as the series begins with Lisa and Kevin breaking out simultaneously in the first episode. Megabyte also breaks out in the last episode of the story. This was the longest story since \"The Blue and the Green\" in the second season of the 1970s show and as a result there was more of the comedy setpieces which had been minimised in the later seasons of the earlier show. The plotline borrowed heavily from the 1975 story \"Secret Weapon\", even reusing the name of that story's villain Colonel Masters, and involved the intelligence services pursuing the Tomorrow People in order to use them for their own ends. The story also introduced [[Jeff Harding (actor)|Jeff Harding]] as Megabyte's father General Damon, an American officer stationed in the United Kingdom, who became a regular ally to the Tomorrow People.\n\nThe second season was filmed in 1993 and began transmitting in January 1994, with Price now credited as executive producer and the writing handed over to [[Grant Cathro]] and [[Lee Pressman (writer)|Lee Pressman]], who had previously experience writing [[CITV]]'s other children's fantasy series ''[[T-Bag]]'' and ''[[Mike and Angelo]]''. The seasons were expanded to ten episodes, comprising two five-part stories. Cathro and Pressman plotted the stories together then scripted one each (for the second season they were credited as co-writers, for the third they were only credited on the story they scripted). They chose to power down the Tomorrow People slightly, since the first story had shown Lisa reviving from the dead at one point. The lengthy scenes on the island where the ship was located from the first season were dropped, with the ship exterior only seen in stock establishing shots and the Tomorrow People now teleporting directly into the ship when they broke out rather than the ocean around it.\n\nLisa was dropped without explanation and Kevin's role was severely reduced, with him only appearing in three episodes of the first story and spending most of his time comatose before also being dropped with no explanation. As a result, the series now focused on Adam and Megabyte, two characters who had not interacted in the first season, and their relationship soon mirrored than between John and Stephen in the original series. Breaking out in the opening episode of the season was Ami Jackson, played by [[Naomie Harris]]. Her mother Hasana, played by [[Sally Sagoe]], would have small roles in the remaining stories, initially trying to stop Ami spending time with the Tomorrow People before accepting her need to use her powers to help others. The first story of the second season, \"The Culex Experiment\", guest starred [[Jean Marsh]] as the villainous Doctor Culex.\n\nThe third season debuted the following year: The opening story, \"The Rameses Connection\", guest starred [[Christopher Lee]] as lead villain Sam Rees/[[Rameses]]. It saw the first example of the phrase \"breaking out\" being used and of the Tomorrow People's powers being blocked, when Rameses prevents Adam from teleporting, both key features of the 1970s show. The second story, \"The Living Stones\", only featured Ami in a small role in the first episode, with her absence explained as her being on holiday with her mother. Instead, Jade Weston, a minor character from \"The Culex Experiment\" played by [[Alexandra Milman]], was brought back to accompany Adam and Megabyte and broke out as a Tomorrow Person in the last episode. This story featured the first use of aliens in the 1990s series, as the Tomorrow People battled a group of alien spores which had crashed near a village and possessed most of the villagers. Shortly after this, it was announced that the show would not be returning for a fourth season.\n\n===Audio revival===\n{{See also|List of The Tomorrow People serials#Audio series}}\n\nIn 2001, [[Big Finish Productions]] launched a series of new audio plays based on the original series, produced by [[Nigel Fairs]]. [[Nicholas Young (actor)|Nicholas Young]] and [[Philip Gilbert]] reprised their roles as John and TIM, with Helen Goldwyn and [[James Daniel Wilson]] appearing as Elena and Paul, the new Tomorrow People. Some releases also feature other original cast members, such as [[Peter Vaughan-Clarke]], [[Elizabeth Adare]] and [[Mike Holoway]] (notably ''Trigonometry''). [[Trevor Littledale]] took over the role of TIM in the audio series from ''The Warlock's Dance'' onwards after Philip Gilbert's death in 2004.\n\nFive series were produced of the audio series.
