They are located in [[Clinton, Iowa]], and play their home games at [[NelsonCorp Field]].\n\n==Clinton baseball history==\nAfter beginning play in 1895, [[Clinton, Iowa|Clinton]] had sporadic teams in various leagues over the next few decades, as the Great Depression, World War I and World War II affected many baseball franchises. However, Clinton joined the Midwest League in 1956 and is now the oldest franchise in the league.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/> The team has had several different major league affiliations: the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1937\u201338), [[New York Giants]] (1939\u201341), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1947\u201349),  [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] (1954\u201358 and 1966\u201368), [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] (1959\u201365),  [[Milwaukee Brewers|Pilots/Brewers]] (1969\u201370), [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] (1971\u201375), Tigers/White Sox co-op (1976), [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] (1977\u201379), [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] (1980\u201394), [[San Diego Padres|Padres]] (1995\u201398), [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] (1999\u20132000), [[Montreal Expos|Expos]] (2001\u201302), and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]] (2003\u201308), and [[Seattle Mariners|Mariners]] (2009\u201318). In September 2018, they entered into a two-year player development contract with the [[Miami Marlins]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/09/20/clinton-miami-announce-new-player-development-contract/|title=Clinton, Miami Announce New Player Development Contract|website=Ballpark Digest|date=September 20, 2018|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAside from its time as the C-Sox (1960\u201365) and the Pilots (1966\u201376), the team used the parent major league team's nickname before adopting the LumberKings name for the 1994 season.\n\nThe 2010 LumberKings season is the subject of the 2013 book \"Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere\" by Lucas Mann.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAlpin|first=Heller|title=Farm Team Saga 'Class A' Hits It Out Of The Park|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/09/180279940/farm-team-saga-class-a-hits-it-out-of-the-park|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=NPR|date=May 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, led by first year manager [[Mitch Canham]], the LumberKings won 86 games to set the mark for most in a regular season by any team in Clinton franchise history.  The squad went on to sweep the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the first round of the playoffs before defeating the [[Cedar Rapids Kernels]] in a thrilling three game series.  Game three of the Western Division final ended with a [[Ricky Eusebio]] walk off hit to win 1-0 in extra innings.  The LumberKings would fall, however, in the Midwest League Championship in four games to the [[Great Lakes Loons]].\n\nIn addition to playing host to the franchise record setting LumberKings (86-54), the LumberKings transformed their ballpark overnight following game two of the Midwest League Championship to become a football field.  The LumberKings played host to [[Camanche High School]] Football in the inaugural \"LumberBowl.\"  Camanche hosted [[Williamsburg High School (Iowa)|Williamsburg High School]] in the game on September 16, 2016.  The Raiders of Williamsburg defeated the Indians 55-7.\n\n==Roster==\n{{Clinton LumberKings roster}}\n\n==NelsonCorp Field==\n[[File:DSC 0198 Alliant Energy Field.JPG|thumb|right|Ashford Field.

(baseball)|Class A]] affiliate of the [[Miami Marlins]]. They are located in [[Clinton, Iowa]], and play their home games at [[NelsonCorp Field]].\n\n==Clinton baseball history==\nAfter beginning play in 1895, [[Clinton, Iowa|Clinton]] had sporadic teams in various leagues over the next few decades, as the Great Depression, World War I and World War II affected many baseball franchises. However, Clinton joined the Midwest League in 1956 and is now the oldest franchise in the league.<ref name=\"baseball-reference.com\"/> The team has had several different major league affiliations: the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] (1937\u201338), [[New York Giants]] (1939\u201341), [[Chicago Cubs]] (1947\u201349),  [[Pittsburgh Pirates|Pirates]] (1954\u201358 and 1966\u201368), [[Chicago White Sox|White Sox]] (1959\u201365),  [[Milwaukee Brewers|Pilots/Brewers]] (1969\u201370), [[Detroit Tigers|Tigers]] (1971\u201375), Tigers/White Sox co-op (1976), [[Los Angeles Dodgers|Dodgers]] (1977\u201379), [[San Francisco Giants|Giants]] (1980\u201394), [[San Diego Padres|Padres]] (1995\u201398), [[Cincinnati Reds|Reds]] (1999\u20132000), [[Montreal Expos|Expos]] (2001\u201302), and [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Rangers]] (2003\u201308), and [[Seattle Mariners|Mariners]] (2009\u201318). In September 2018, they entered into a two-year player development contract with the [[Miami Marlins]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ballparkdigest.com/2018/09/20/clinton-miami-announce-new-player-development-contract/|title=Clinton, Miami Announce New Player Development Contract|website=Ballpark Digest|date=September 20, 2018|access-date=September 20, 2018}}</ref>\n\nAside from its time as the C-Sox (1960\u201365) and the Pilots (1966\u201376), the team used the parent major league team's nickname before adopting the LumberKings name for the 1994 season.\n\nThe 2010 LumberKings season is the subject of the 2013 book \"Class A: Baseball in the Middle of Everywhere\" by Lucas Mann.<ref>{{cite news|last=McAlpin|first=Heller|title=Farm Team Saga 'Class A' Hits It Out Of The Park|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/05/09/180279940/farm-team-saga-class-a-hits-it-out-of-the-park|accessdate=29 January 2014|newspaper=NPR|date=May 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn 2016, led by first year manager [[Mitch Canham]], the LumberKings won 86 games to set the mark for most in a regular season by any team in Clinton franchise history.  The squad went on to sweep the [[Peoria Chiefs]] in the first round of the playoffs before defeating the [[Cedar Rapids Kernels]] in a thrilling three game series.  Game three of the Western Division final ended with a [[Ricky Eusebio]] walk off hit to win 1-0 in extra innings.  The LumberKings would fall, however, in the Midwest League Championship in four games to the [[Great Lakes Loons]].\n\nIn addition to playing host to the franchise record setting LumberKings (86-54), the LumberKings transformed their ballpark overnight following game two of the Midwest League Championship to become a football field.  The LumberKings played host to [[Camanche High School]] Football in the inaugural \"LumberBowl.\"  Camanche hosted [[Williamsburg High School (Iowa)|Williamsburg High School]] in the game on September 16, 2016.  The Raiders of Williamsburg defeated the Indians 55-7.\n\n==Roster==\n{{Clinton LumberKings roster}}\n\n==NelsonCorp Field==\n[[File:DSC 0198 Alliant Energy Field.JPG|thumb|right|Ashford Field. Formerly Alliant Energy Field and Riverview Stadium]]\n\nThe home park for the LumberKings is [[NelsonCorp Field]] in Clinton, Iowa. The stadium was built in 1937 as a Works Administration Project (WPA) and named Riverview Stadium, due to its location on the banks of the Mississippi River. It was renamed Alliant Energy Field in 2002 and renovated in 2005\u20132006 to a capacity of 4,000. It was renamed to Ashford University Field in 2011 and NelsonCorp Field in 2019.

Due to ethnic migration, [[Ilocano people]] have settled in some areas of the province.\n\nPangasinan is the name for the province, the people, and the language spoken in the province. Indigenous Pangasinan speakers are estimated to number at least 2 million. The Pangasinan language, which is official in the province, is one of the officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines. In Pangasinan, there were several ethnic groups who enriched the cultural fabric of the province. Almost all of the people are Pangasinans and the rest are descendants of Bolinao and Ilocano, who settled the eastern and western parts of the province.<ref>[https://psa.gov.ph/content/pangasinan-most-populated-province-philippines-results-2000-census-population-and-housing]</ref> Pangasinan is spoken as a second-language by many of the ethnic minorities in Pangasinan. The secondary ethnic groups are the [[Sambal people|Bolinaos]] (who are essentially [[Sambal people]]) and the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]].\n\nThe name ''Pangasinan'' (pronounced \"Pang-ASINan\") means \"place of salt\" or \"place of salt-making\"; it is derived from the prefix ''pang'', meaning \"for\", the root word ''asin'', meaning \"salt\u201d, and suffix ''an'', signifying \"location\". At present it is pronounced \"Pa\u014bgasinan\" based on the Spanish pronunciation. The province is a major producer of salt in the Philippines. Its major products include [[bagoong]] (\"salted-[[krill]]\") and alamang (\"shrimp-paste\").\n\nPangasinan was first founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' by at least 2500 BC. A kingdom called ''Luyag na [[Caboloan]]'', which expanded to incorporate much of northwestern Luzon, existed in Pangasinan before the Spanish conquest that began in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\">{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific|date=10 June 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598846607|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&pg=PT305&lpg=PT305&dq=luyag+na+Kaboloan#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref> The Kingdom of ''Luyag na Kaboloan'' was known as the [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] in Chinese records. The ancient Pangasinan people were skilled navigators and the [[Shipping|maritime]] [[trade]] network that once flourished in ancient [[Luzon]] connected Pangasinan with other peoples of [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and the rest of the [[Pacific]]. The ancient kingdom of Luyag na Caboloan was in fact mentioned in Chinese and Indian records as being an important kingdom on ancient trade routes.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\"/>\n\nPopular tourist attractions in Pangasinan include the [[Hundred Islands National Park]] in [[Alaminos City]] and the white-sand beaches of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]]. [[Dagupan City]] is known for its Bangus Festival (\"Milkfish Festival\"). Pangasinan is also known for its delicious mangoes and ceramic oven-baked [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]] ''puto'' (\"native rice cake\"). Pangasinan occupies a [[strategic]] [[geo-political]] position in the central plain of Luzon. Pangasinan has been described as a gateway to northern Luzon.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Pangasinan people, like most of the people in the [[Malay Archipelago]], are descendants of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] who settled in Southeast Asia since prehistoric times. Comparative genetics, linguistics and archaeological studies locate the origin of the [[Austronesian languages]] in [[Sundaland]], which was populated as early as 50,000 years ago by modern humans.<ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/080523.html New DNA evidence overturns population migration theory in Island Southeast Asia \u2013 University of Oxford<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028020123/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/080523.html |date=2011-10-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/uol-nrf052308.php New research forces U-turn in population migration theory<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Farming and language in Island Southeast Asia: Reframing Austronesian history|author1=Mark Donohue |author2=Tim Denham |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=51 |issue=2 |date=2010|pages=223\u2013256|doi=10.1086/650991}}</ref> The Pangasinan language is one of many languages that belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages]] family.\n\n===Southeast Asian maritime trade network===\nA vast maritime trade network connected the distant [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] settlements in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Pangasinan people were part of this ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] civilization.\n\nThe ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] were expert navigators. Their outrigger canoes and sailboats were capable of crossing the distant seas. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] sailed from the Malay archipelago to [[Madagascar]], an island across the Indian Ocean, and probably reached Africa. As the possible predecessors of the [[Polynesians]], large seagoing canoes called \"bangka\" (\"[[vaka (sailing)|vaka]]\" in several Polynesian dialects and \"[[waka (canoe)|waka]]\" in Maori) were first developed by Austronesians in the Philippine archipelago which were then used to settle and establish long-distance trade networks with distant Pacific islands from the [[Micronesia]]n island nations of [[Guam]] and [[Palau]] as far away as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]] and probably reached the Pacific coastline of the Americas. Proof of these trade exchanges are the prevalence of \"kumara\" or [[sweet potato]] in the Pacific Islands which is endemic to South America, and the abundance of chicken bones in ancient South American archaeological dig sites whose closest genetic relatives are those of chickens from Asia. At least three hundred years before the arrival of Europeans, the [[Makasar]] and the [[Bugis]] from [[Sulawesi]], in what is now [[Indonesia]], as well as the [[Sama-Bajau]]s of the Malay Archipelago, carried out long-distance commerce with their ''prau'' or ''paraw'' (\"sailboat\") and established settlements in north [[Australia]], which they called ''Marege''.<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011346 PLoS ONE: The History of Makassan Trepang Fishing and Trade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nPangasinan was founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' during the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion from Taiwan and Southern China in about 5000\u20132500 BC or the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] dispersal from [[Sundaland]] at least 7,000 years ago after the last Ice Age. ''Anakbanwa'' means \u201cchild of ''banwa.''\u201d ''Banwa'' (also spelled ''banua'' or ''vanua'') is an Austronesian concept that could mean territory, homeland, habitat, society, civilization or cosmos. The Pangasinan people identified or associated ''banwa'' with the sun, which was their symbol for their ''banwa''. The Pangasinan people are closely related to the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]] and other peoples of [[Luzon]]. The ''Anakbanwa'' established their settlements in the banks of the [[Agno River]] and the coasts of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. The coastal area came to be known as ''Pangasinan'', and the interior area came to be known as ''Kaboloan''. Eventually, the whole region, its people and the used language came to be known as Pangasinan. Archaeological evidence and early [[Chinese history|Chinese]] and [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] records show that the inhabitants of Pangasinan traded with [[India]], [[Arabia]], [[China]] and [[Japan]] as early as the 8th century A.D.\n\n===''Wangdom'' of Pangasinan (''Luyag na Caboloan'')===\nThe [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] (as known in Chinese records) and locally known as the ancient kingdom or state called ''Luyag na Caboloan'' (also spelled ''Kaboloan''), with ''Binalatongan'' as its capital, existed in the fertile [[Agno River]] valley. Around the same period, the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] empires arose in [[Indonesia]] that extended their influence to much of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. [[Urduja]]/Udaya, a legendary woman warrior who [[Ibn Battuta]] called a rival of the Mongol Empire, is believed to have ruled in Pangasinan around the 14th century. The ''Luyag na Caboloan'' expanded the territory and influence of Pangasinan to what are now the neighboring provinces of [[Tarlac]], [[La Union]], [[Zambales]], [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Benguet]]. Pangasinan enjoyed full [[independence]] until the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest.\n\n===''Anito'' and ''mana'' beliefs and practices===\nThe ancient Pangasinan people, like other [[Austronesian peoples]], practiced ''[[anito]]'' worship. An ''anito'' was believed to be the spirit or divine power of an ancestor or the god or divine power in nature or natural phenomena. They believed in [[mana]], an Austronesian concept which can be described as the divine power or vital or spiritual essence of every being and everything that exists. To the Pangasinan people, ''mana'' can be transferred, inherited or acquired, like from an ancestor, nature, or natural phenomena. Their belief or practice is similar to [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] or [[animism|animist]] beliefs and rituals. They worshipped a pantheon of ''[[anito]]'' (\"spirit\" or \"deity\"). Their [[dambana|temples or altars]] were dedicated to a chief ''anito'' called Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\">https://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/northern-cultural-communities/the-lowland-cultural-community-of-pangasinan/</ref> (\u201cSupreme Father\u201d), who communicated through mediums or priests called ''[[babaylan|manag-anito]]''. These ''manag-anito'' wore special costumes when serving an ''anito'' and they made offerings of oils, ointments, essences, and perfumes in exquisite vessels. In contrast, the [[Sambal people]] of the west also revered their own pantheon of deities, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\">https://www.aswangproject.com/sambal-mythology-pantheon-of-deities-and-beings/</ref>\n\n===Spanish accounts of pre-Hispanic Pangasinan===\nIn the sixteenth-century Pangasinan was called the \"Port of Japan\" by the Spanish. The locals wore native apparel typical of other maritime Southeast Asian ethnic groups in addition to Japanese and Chinese silks. Even common people were clad in Chinese and Japanese cotton garments. They blackened their teeth and were disgusted by the white teeth of foreigners, which were likened to that of animals. They used porcelain jars typical of Japanese and Chinese households. Japanese-style gunpowder weapons were encountered in naval battles in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=187}}</ref> In exchange for these goods, traders from all over Asia would come to trade primarily for gold and slaves, but also for deerskins, civet and other local products. Other than a notably more extensive trade network with Japan and China, they were culturally similar to other Luzon groups to the south.\n\nPangasinans were also described as a warlike people who were long known for their resistance to Spanish conquest. Bishop Domingo Salazar described them as really the worst people, the fiercest and cruelest in the land. There was evidence of Christian influence even before Spanish colonization; they used vintage wine in small quantities for their sacramental practices. The church bragged that they won the northern part of the Philippines for Spain not Spanish military. They were unusually strict against adulterers, with the punishment being death for both parties. Pangasinans were known to take defeated [[Zambales#History|Zambal]] ([[Aeta]]) and [[Negrito]] warriors to sell as slaves to Chinese traders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=248\u2013249}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nIn 1324, [[Odoric of Pordenone]], a Franciscan missionary from [[Friuli]], Italy, is believed by some to have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], which is generally regarded as the [[first mass in the Philippines]], by some 197 years. However, historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is no reason to think that he celebrated mass.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=William Henry |title=Prehispanic source materials for the study of Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSlwAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=New Day Publishers|isbn=978-971-10-0226-8|pages=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nOn April 27, 1565, the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] arrived in the Philippine islands with about 500 soldiers to establish a Spanish settlement and begin the conquest of the archipelago. On May 24, 1570, the Spanish forces defeated [[Rajah Sulayman]] and other rulers of Manila and later declared [[Manila]] as the new capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]]. After securing Manila, the Spanish forces continued to conquer the rest of the island of Luzon, including Pangasinan.\n\n====Provincia de Pangasinan====\nIn 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began with an expedition by the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Mart\u00edn de Goiti]], who came from the Spanish settlement in [[Manila]] through [[Pampanga]]. About a year later, another Spanish conquistador, [[Juan de Salcedo]], sailed to [[Lingayen Gulf]] and landed at the mouth of the [[Agno River]]. [[Limahong]], a Chinese pirate, fled to Pangasinan after his fleet was driven away from Manila in 1574. Limahong failed to establish a colony in Pangasinan, as an army led by Juan de Salcedo chased him out of Pangasinan after a seven-month siege.\n\nThe province of Pangasinan dates its actual beginnings as an administrative and judicial district, with Lingayen as the capital, to as early as 1580, but its territorial boundaries were first delineated in 1611. Lingayen has remained the capital of the province except for a brief period during the revolutionary Era when San Carlos served as temporary administrative headquarters, and during the slightly longer Japanese Occupation when Dagupan was the capital.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\">{{cite web|title=History of Pangasinan|url=http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905174851/http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|archive-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe province of Pangasinan was formerly classified as an alcaldia mayor de termino, or first class civil province, during the Spanish regime and has, in fact, remained a first class-A province up to the present. Its territorial jurisdiction once included the entire province of Zambales and portions of what are now Tarlac and La Union provinces.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\"/>\n\n====Rebellion against the Spanish rule====\n\n====Malong liberation====\nAndres Malong, a native chief of the town of Binalatongan (now named San Carlos City), liberated the province from Spanish rule in December 1660. The people of Pangasinan proclaimed Andres Malong ''Ari na Pangasinan'' (\"King of Pangasinan\"). Pangasinan armies attempted to liberate the neighboring provinces of Pampanga and Ilocos, but were repelled by a Spanish-led coalition of loyalist tribal warriors and mercenaries. In February 1661, the newly independent Kingdom of Pangasinan fell to the Spanish.\n\n====Palaris liberation====\nOn November 3, 1762, the people of Pangasinan proclaimed independence from Spain after a rebellion led by [[Juan de la Cruz Palaris]] overthrew Spanish rule in Pangasinan. The Pangasinan revolt was sparked by news of the fall of Manila to the British on October 6, 1762. However, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] on March 1, 1763 that closed the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain, France and Spain, the Spanish colonial forces made a counter-attack. On January 16, 1765, Juan de la Cruz Palaris was captured and Pangasinan independence was again lost.\n\n===Philippine revolution against Spain===\n{{Main|Philippine Revolution Against Spain}}\n\nThe [[Katipunan]], a nationalist secret society, was founded on July 7, 1892 with the aim of uniting the peoples of the Philippines and fighting for independence and religious freedom. The [[Philippine Revolution]] began on August 26, 1896 and was led by [[Andres Bonifacio]], the leader of the Katipunan. On November 18, 1897, a Katipunan council was formed in western Pangasinan with Roman Manalang as Presidente Generalisimo and Mauro Ortiz as General. General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. [[Dagupan City]], the major commercial center of Pangasinan, was surrounded by Katipunan forces by July 18, 1898. The Battle of Dagupan lasted from July 18 to July 23 of that year with the surrender of 1,500 soldiers of the Spanish forces under Commander Federico J. Ceballos and Governor Joaquin de Orengochea.\n\n[[File:Andres Urdaneta monumentua, Urdaneta City, Philippines.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Andres Urdaneta monument, in front of the City Hall.]]\n\nThe Battle of Dagupan, fought fiercely by local Katipuneros under the overall command of General Francisco Makabulos, chief of the Central and Directive Committee of Central and Northern Luzon, and the last remnants of the once mighty Spanish Army under General Francisco Ceballos, led to the liberation of Pangasinan from the Spaniards. The five-day battle was joined by three local heroes: Don Daniel Maramba from Santa Barbara, Don Vicente Prado from San Jacinto and Don Juan Quezada from Dagupan. Their armies massed in Dagupan to lay siege on the Spanish forces, making a last stand at the brick-walled Catholic Church.\n\n[[File:Maramba67jf.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Grave of Don Daniel B. Maramba ([[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan|Santa Barbara]])]]\n[[File:Maramba33jf.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Daniel B. Maramba Monument and 1970 NHI Marker]]\n\nMaramba led the liberation of the town of Santa Barbara on March 7, 1898 following a signal for simultaneous attack from Makabulos. Hearing that Santa Barbara fell into rebel hands, the Spanish forces in Dagupan attempted to retake the town, but were repulsed by Maramba's forces. Thus, after the setback, the Spaniards decided to concentrate their forces in Lingayen to protect the provincial capital. This enabled Maramba to expand his operations to Malasiqui, Urdaneta and Mapandan, taking them one after the other. He took one more town, Mangaldan, before proceeding to Dagupan to lay siege on the last Spanish garrison. Also on March 7, 1898, the rebels under the command of Prado and Quesada attacked convents in a number of towns in Zambales province, located west of Lingayen, which now constitute the western parts of Pangasinan.\n\nAttacked and brought under Filipino control were Alaminos, Agno, Anda, Alos, Bani, Balincaguin, Bolinao, Dasol, Eguia and Potot. The revolt then spread to Labrador, Sual, Salasa and many other towns in the west. The towns of Sual, Labrador, Lingayen, Salasa and Bayambang were occupied first by the forces of Prado and Quesada before they proceeded to attack Dagupan.\n\nAt an assembly convened to organize a central governing body for Central and Northern Luzon on April 17, 1898, General Makabulos appointed Prado as politico-military governor of Pangasinan, with Quesada as his second in command. His appointment came a few days before the return of General Emilio Aguinaldo in May 1898 from his exile in Hong Kong following the signing of the Pact of Biac-na-Bato in December 1897. Aguinaldo's return gave fresh impetus to the renewal of the flame of the revolution. Thus, on June 3, 1898, General Makabulos entered Tarlac and from that day on, the fires of revolution spread.\n\nSo successful were the Filipinos in their many pitched battles against the Spaniards that on June 30, 1898, Spanish authorities decided to evacuate all their forces to Dagupan where a last stand against the rebels was to be made. They were ordered to go to Dagupan were all civilian and military personnel, including members of the volunteer locales of towns not yet in rebel hands. Those who heeded this order were the volunteer forces of Mangaldan, San Jacinto, Pozorrubio, Manaoag, and Villasis. Among the items brought to Dagupan was the image of the Most Holy Rosary of the Virgin of Manaoag, which was already the patron saint of Pangasinan.\n\nWhen the forces of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos strengthened the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They just became mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when they rolled trunks of bananas, bundled up in sawali, that enabled them to inch their way to the Church.\n\n===Northern Zambales ceded to Pangasinan===\n\nOn November 30, 1903, several municipalities of northern Zambales, namely, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini, were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government in a bid for [[gerrymandering]]. These municipalities were traditional homelands of the [[Sambal people]], who wanted to remain part of [[Zambales]] province, their ethnic province. This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bautista|first1=Joseph|title=Agno Rustic Pangasinan 0|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/agno-rustic-pangasinan/371628/|website=The Manila Times|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American colonization and the Philippine Commonwealth regime===\nPangasinan and other parts of the [[Spanish East Indies]] were ceded to the Americans after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] that closed the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. During the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Lieutenant Col. [[Jose Torres Bugallon]] from the town of Salasa fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna to defend the [[First Philippine Republic]] against American colonization of Northern Luzon. Bugallon was killed in battle on February 5, 1899. The First Philippine Republic was abolished in 1901. In 1907, the Philippine Assembly was established and for the first time, five residents of Pangasinan were elected as its district representatives. In 1921, Mauro Navarro, representing Pangasinan in the [[Philippine Assembly]], sponsored a law to rename the town of Salasa to Bugallon in order to honor General Bugallon.\n\nDuring the Philippine Commonwealth regime, [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was inaugurated as the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the collaboration from the [[United States of America]] on November 15, 1935.\n\nThe 21st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFFE was found military establishment and built of the general headquarters was active on July 26, 1941 to June 30, 1946 and they stationed in Pangasinan during the pre-World War II era. From the conflict engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial military operations included the fall of Bataan and Corregidor and aiding the USAFFE ground force from January to May 1942 and the Japanese Insurgencies and Allied Liberation in Pangasinan from 1942 to 1945 and some parts in North-Central Luzon and helps local guerrillas and American forces against the Japanese.\n\n===Philippine Republic===\n\n====National====\n\n====1946\u20131986====\nAfter the declaration of Independence in [[Manila]] on July 4, 1946, Eugenio Perez, a [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] congressman representing the [[Legislative districts of Pangasinan#4th District|fourth district]] of Pangasinan, was elected Speaker of the lower [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Legislative House]]. He led the House until 1953, when the [[Nacionalista Party]] became the dominant party.\n\nPangasinan, which is historically and geographically part of the [[Central Luzon Region]], is made politically part of the [[Ilocos Region]] (Region I) in the gerrymandering of the [[Philippines]] by [[Ferdinand Marcos]], despite the fact that Pangasinan has its distinct primary language, which is Pangasinan. The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region has generated confusion among some Filipinos that the residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos only constitute a significant minority in the province. Pangasinan has a distinct primary language, ethnic group and culture, its economy is bigger than the predominantly Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 percent of the population of Region 1.\n\n====1986\u2013present====\nIn February 1986, Vice Chief of Staff General [[Fidel V. Ramos]], head of the Philippine Integrated National Police and a native of Lingayen, Pangasinan, became one of the instrumental figures of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA people power revolution]] that led to the overthrow of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nAfter the downfall of Marcos, all local government unit executives in the Philippines were ordered by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] to vacate their posts. Some local executives were ordered to return to their seats as in the case of Mayor Ludovico Espinosa of [[Dasol]], where he claims he joined the UNIDO, Mrs. Aquino's party during the height of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]]. Fidel Ramos was appointed as AFP Chief of Staff and later as Defense Secretary replacing [[Juan Ponce Enrile]]. [[Oscar Orbos]], a congressman from Bani, Pangasinan, was appointed by Aquino as head of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]] and later as Executive Secretary.\n\nOn May 11, 1992, Fidel V. Ramos [[1992 Philippine general election|ran]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He was elected and became the first Pangasinan President of the Philippines. Through his leadership, the Philippines recovered from a severe economy after the oil and power crisis of 1991. His influence also sparked the economic growth of Pangasinan when it hosted the 1995 ''Palarong Pambansa'' (Philippine National Games).\n\n[[Jose de Venecia]], who represented the same district as Eugenio Perez, was the second Pangasinan to be Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1992. He was reelected for the same position in 1995. De Venecia was selected by the Ramos' administration party Lakas NUCD to be its presidential candidate in 1998. De Venecia [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] but lost to [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Joseph Estrada]]. Oscar Orbos, who served as Pangasinan governor from 1995, [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] for Vice President, but lost to [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], whose mother, former [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Eva Macapagal|Evangelina Macaraeg-Macapagal]], hails from Binalonan, Pangasinan.\n\nArroyo later ascended to the presidency after the second [[EDSA II|EDSA Revolution]] when President [[Joseph Estrada]] was overthrown.\n\nIn May 2004, actor-turned-politician [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]], whose family is from San Carlos City, Pangasinan, ran for President against incumbent [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] during the [[2004 Philippine general election|Philippine general election in 2004]]. The Pangasinan vote was almost evenly split by the two presidential candidates who both have Pangasinan roots. Arroyo was elected President, but her victory was tainted by charges of electoral fraud and vote-buying.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical===\nPangasinan is located on the west central area of the island of [[Luzon]] in the Philippines. It is bordered by [[La Union]] to the north, [[Benguet]] and [[Nueva Vizcaya]] to the northeast, [[Nueva Ecija]] to the southeast, and [[Zambales]] and [[Tarlac]] to the south. To the west of Pangasinan is the [[South China Sea]]. The province also encloses the [[Lingayen Gulf]].\n\nThe province has a land area of {{convert|{{PH wikidata|area}}|km2}}.{{PSGC detail|nscb}} It is {{convert|170|km}} north of [[Manila]], {{convert|50|km}} south of [[Baguio City]], {{convert|115|km}} north of Subic International Airport and Seaport, and {{convert|80|km2}} north of [[Clark International Airport]]. At the coast of [[Alaminos, Pangasinan|Alaminos]], the [[Hundred Islands National Park|Hundred islands]] have become a famous tourist spot.\n\nThe terrain of the province, as part of the Central Luzon plains, is typically flat, with a few parts being hilly and/or mountainous. The northeastern municipalities of [[San Manuel, Pangasinan|San Manuel]], [[San Nicolas, Pangasinan|San Nicolas]], [[Natividad, Pangasinan|Natividad]], [[San Quintin, Pangasinan|San Quintin]] and [[Umingan, Pangasinan|Umingan]] have hilly to mountainous areas, situated at the tip of the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera mountains]]. The [[Zambales mountains]] extend to the province's western towns of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]], [[Bugallon, Pangasinan|Bugallon]], [[Aguilar, Pangasinan|Aguilar]], [[Mangatarem, Pangasinan|Mangatarem]], [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]], and [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] forming the mountainous portions of those towns.\n\nThe [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] (PHIVOLCS) reported several [[Volcano#Popular classification of volcanoes|inactive volcano]]es in the province: [[Mount Amorong|Amorong]], [[Mount Balungao|Balungao]], Cabaluyan, Cahelietan, Candong, and Malabobo. PHIVOLCS reported no active or potentially active volcanoes in Pangasinan. A [[caldera]]-like [[landform]] is located between the towns of [[Malasiqui]] and [[Villasis]] with a center at about 15\u00b0 55\u2032 N and 120\u00b0 30\u2032 E near the Cabaruan Hills.\n\nSeveral rivers traverse the province. The longest is the [[Agno River]], which originates from the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Mountains]] of [[Benguet]], eventually emptying its waters into the [[Lingayen Gulf]]. Other major rivers include the [[Bued River]], Angalacan River, Sinocalan River, Patalan River and the Cayanga River.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Mainlist|Administrative divisions of Pangasinan}}\n\nThe province of Pangasinan is subdivided into 44 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], 4 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and 1,364 ''[[barangay]]'' (which means \"village\" or \"community\").

Pangasinan people were known as traders, businesspeople, farmers and fishers. Pangasinan is the third most-populated province in the Philippines. The estimated population of the indigenous speakers of the Pangasinan language in the province of Pangasinan is almost 2 million and is projected to double in about 30 years. According to the 2000 census, 47 percent of the population are native Pangasinan and 44 percent are [[Ilocano people|Ilocano settlers]]. Indigenous [[Sambal people]] predominate in the westernmost municipalities of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Anda, Pangasinan|Anda]].

It belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] branch of the [[Austronesian language family]] and is the primary language of the province of Pangasinan, as well as northern Tarlac and southwestern La Union. The Pangasinan language is similar to the other [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] of the [[Philippines]], as well as [[Indonesia]] and [[Malaysia]]. It is closely related to the [[Ibaloi]] language spoken in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]], located northwest of Pangasinan. The Pangasinan language along with Ibaloi are classified under the Pangasinic group of languages. The other Pangasinic languages are:\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=15em|style=font-size:95%}}\n* Karao\n* Iwaak\n* Keley-I\n* I-Kallahan\n{{div col end}}\n\nAside from their native language, some educated Pangasinans are highly proficient in [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]], [[English language|English]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. Pangasinan is mostly spoken in the central part of the province in the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] is widely spoken in the westernmost and easternmost parts of Pangasinan in the 1st, 5th and 6th districts, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. Ilocanos and Pangasinans speak Ilocano with a Pangasinan accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation who lived within Pangasinan population learned Pangasinan language. [[Bolinao language|Bolinao]], a [[Sambalic languages|Sambalic language]] is widely spoken in the western tip of the province in the towns of Bolinao and Anda.\n\n===Religion===\nThe religion of the people of Pangasinan is predominantly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] with [[Roman Catholicism]] as the overwhelming majority at 80% affiliation in the population. The second major denomination in the province is the [[Aglipayan Church]] with at least 15% of the population. Other religious denominations are divided with other Christian groups such as Members Church of God International, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Baptist, Methodist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon), Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-day Adventist. Few are strict believers and continue to practice their indigenous [[anito]] beliefs and rituals, like most of the people of the Philippines.\n\n[[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[United States|American]] missionaries introduced Christianity to Pangasinan. Prior to the Spanish conquest in 1571, the predominant religion of the people of Pangasinan was similar to the indigenous religion of the highland [[Igorot]] or the inhabitants of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] on the island of Luzon, who mostly retained their indigenous culture and religion. A translation of the New Testament (excluding Revelation) in the Pangasinan language by Fr. Nicolas Manrique Alonzo Lallave, a Spanish Dominican friar assigned in Urdaneta, was the first ever translation of a complete portion of the Bible in a Philippine language. Pangasinan was also influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] to a lesser extent, before the introduction of Christianity. Some Pangasinense people have reverted to their indigenous religion headed by their supreme deity, Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay,<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\"/> while some [[Sambal people]] of the west have also reverted to their indigenous religion, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:saltfarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Commercial salt industry in [[Dasol]]]]\n\nThe province's '''economy''' is mainly agricultural due to its vast fertile plains.

It has extensive fishponds, mostly for raising ''bangus'' or \"milkfish\", along the coasts of the [[Lingayen Gulf]] and the [[South China Sea]]. Pangasinan's aquaculture includes oyster and sea urchin farms.\n\nSalt is also a major industry. In [[salt evaporation pond]]s seawater is mixed with [[sodium bicarbonate]] until the water evaporates and the salt remains.

Due to ethnic migration, [[Ilocano people]] have settled in some areas of the province.\n\nPangasinan is the name for the province, the people, and the language spoken in the province. Indigenous Pangasinan speakers are estimated to number at least 2 million. The Pangasinan language, which is official in the province, is one of the officially recognized regional languages in the Philippines. In Pangasinan, there were several ethnic groups who enriched the cultural fabric of the province. Almost all of the people are Pangasinans and the rest are descendants of Bolinao and Ilocano, who settled the eastern and western parts of the province.<ref>[https://psa.gov.ph/content/pangasinan-most-populated-province-philippines-results-2000-census-population-and-housing]</ref> Pangasinan is spoken as a second-language by many of the ethnic minorities in Pangasinan. The secondary ethnic groups are the [[Sambal people|Bolinaos]] (who are essentially [[Sambal people]]) and the [[Ilocano people|Ilocanos]].\n\nThe name ''Pangasinan'' (pronounced \"Pang-ASINan\") means \"place of salt\" or \"place of salt-making\"; it is derived from the prefix ''pang'', meaning \"for\", the root word ''asin'', meaning \"salt\u201d, and suffix ''an'', signifying \"location\". At present it is pronounced \"Pa\u014bgasinan\" based on the Spanish pronunciation. The province is a major producer of salt in the Philippines. Its major products include [[bagoong]] (\"salted-[[krill]]\") and alamang (\"shrimp-paste\").\n\nPangasinan was first founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' by at least 2500 BC. A kingdom called ''Luyag na [[Caboloan]]'', which expanded to incorporate much of northwestern Luzon, existed in Pangasinan before the Spanish conquest that began in the 16th century.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\">{{cite book|last1=Minahan|first1=James|title=Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific|date=10 June 2014|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1598846607|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/?id=fOQkpcVcd9AC&pg=PT305&lpg=PT305&dq=luyag+na+Kaboloan#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=10 June 2014}}</ref> The Kingdom of ''Luyag na Kaboloan'' was known as the [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] in Chinese records. The ancient Pangasinan people were skilled navigators and the [[Shipping|maritime]] [[trade]] network that once flourished in ancient [[Luzon]] connected Pangasinan with other peoples of [[Southeast Asia]], [[India]], [[China]], [[Japan]] and the rest of the [[Pacific]]. The ancient kingdom of Luyag na Caboloan was in fact mentioned in Chinese and Indian records as being an important kingdom on ancient trade routes.<ref name=\"Ethnic Groups of South Asia and the Pacific\"/>\n\nPopular tourist attractions in Pangasinan include the [[Hundred Islands National Park]] in [[Alaminos City]] and the white-sand beaches of [[Bolinao, Pangasinan|Bolinao]] and [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]]. [[Dagupan City]] is known for its Bangus Festival (\"Milkfish Festival\"). Pangasinan is also known for its delicious mangoes and ceramic oven-baked [[Calasiao, Pangasinan|Calasiao]] ''puto'' (\"native rice cake\"). Pangasinan occupies a [[strategic]] [[geo-political]] position in the central plain of Luzon. Pangasinan has been described as a gateway to northern Luzon.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient history===\nThe Pangasinan people, like most of the people in the [[Malay Archipelago]], are descendants of the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] who settled in Southeast Asia since prehistoric times. Comparative genetics, linguistics and archaeological studies locate the origin of the [[Austronesian languages]] in [[Sundaland]], which was populated as early as 50,000 years ago by modern humans.<ref>[http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/080523.html New DNA evidence overturns population migration theory in Island Southeast Asia \u2013 University of Oxford<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111028020123/http://www.ox.ac.uk/media/news_releases_for_journalists/080523.html |date=2011-10-28 }}</ref><ref>[http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-05/uol-nrf052308.php New research forces U-turn in population migration theory<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Farming and language in Island Southeast Asia: Reframing Austronesian history|author1=Mark Donohue |author2=Tim Denham |journal=Current Anthropology |volume=51 |issue=2 |date=2010|pages=223\u2013256|doi=10.1086/650991}}</ref> The Pangasinan language is one of many languages that belongs to the [[Malayo-Polynesian languages]] branch of the [[Austronesian languages]] family.\n\n===Southeast Asian maritime trade network===\nA vast maritime trade network connected the distant [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] settlements in [[Southeast Asia]], the [[Pacific]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. The Pangasinan people were part of this ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] civilization.\n\nThe ancient [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian-speakers]] were expert navigators. Their outrigger canoes and sailboats were capable of crossing the distant seas. The [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]] sailed from the Malay archipelago to [[Madagascar]], an island across the Indian Ocean, and probably reached Africa. As the possible predecessors of the [[Polynesians]], large seagoing canoes called \"bangka\" (\"[[vaka (sailing)|vaka]]\" in several Polynesian dialects and \"[[waka (canoe)|waka]]\" in Maori) were first developed by Austronesians in the Philippine archipelago which were then used to settle and establish long-distance trade networks with distant Pacific islands from the [[Micronesia]]n island nations of [[Guam]] and [[Palau]] as far away as [[Hawaii]] and [[Easter Island]] and probably reached the Pacific coastline of the Americas. Proof of these trade exchanges are the prevalence of \"kumara\" or [[sweet potato]] in the Pacific Islands which is endemic to South America, and the abundance of chicken bones in ancient South American archaeological dig sites whose closest genetic relatives are those of chickens from Asia. At least three hundred years before the arrival of Europeans, the [[Makasar]] and the [[Bugis]] from [[Sulawesi]], in what is now [[Indonesia]], as well as the [[Sama-Bajau]]s of the Malay Archipelago, carried out long-distance commerce with their ''prau'' or ''paraw'' (\"sailboat\") and established settlements in north [[Australia]], which they called ''Marege''.<ref>[http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0011346 PLoS ONE: The History of Makassan Trepang Fishing and Trade<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>\n\nPangasinan was founded by [[Austronesian peoples]] who called themselves ''Anakbanwa'' during the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] expansion from Taiwan and Southern China in about 5000\u20132500 BC or the [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] dispersal from [[Sundaland]] at least 7,000 years ago after the last Ice Age. ''Anakbanwa'' means \u201cchild of ''banwa.''\u201d ''Banwa'' (also spelled ''banua'' or ''vanua'') is an Austronesian concept that could mean territory, homeland, habitat, society, civilization or cosmos. The Pangasinan people identified or associated ''banwa'' with the sun, which was their symbol for their ''banwa''. The Pangasinan people are closely related to the [[Ibaloi people|Ibaloi]] in the neighboring province of [[Benguet]] and other peoples of [[Luzon]]. The ''Anakbanwa'' established their settlements in the banks of the [[Agno River]] and the coasts of [[Lingayen Gulf]]. The coastal area came to be known as ''Pangasinan'', and the interior area came to be known as ''Kaboloan''. Eventually, the whole region, its people and the used language came to be known as Pangasinan. Archaeological evidence and early [[Chinese history|Chinese]] and [[Indian subcontinent|Indian]] records show that the inhabitants of Pangasinan traded with [[India]], [[Arabia]], [[China]] and [[Japan]] as early as the 8th century A.D.\n\n===''Wangdom'' of Pangasinan (''Luyag na Caboloan'')===\nThe [[Caboloan|Wangdom of Pangasinan]] (as known in Chinese records) and locally known as the ancient kingdom or state called ''Luyag na Caboloan'' (also spelled ''Kaboloan''), with ''Binalatongan'' as its capital, existed in the fertile [[Agno River]] valley. Around the same period, the [[Srivijaya]] and [[Majapahit]] empires arose in [[Indonesia]] that extended their influence to much of the [[Malay Archipelago]]. [[Urduja]]/Udaya, a legendary woman warrior who [[Ibn Battuta]] called a rival of the Mongol Empire, is believed to have ruled in Pangasinan around the 14th century. The ''Luyag na Caboloan'' expanded the territory and influence of Pangasinan to what are now the neighboring provinces of [[Tarlac]], [[La Union]], [[Zambales]], [[Nueva Ecija]] and [[Benguet]]. Pangasinan enjoyed full [[independence]] until the [[Spain|Spanish]] conquest.\n\n===''Anito'' and ''mana'' beliefs and practices===\nThe ancient Pangasinan people, like other [[Austronesian peoples]], practiced ''[[anito]]'' worship. An ''anito'' was believed to be the spirit or divine power of an ancestor or the god or divine power in nature or natural phenomena. They believed in [[mana]], an Austronesian concept which can be described as the divine power or vital or spiritual essence of every being and everything that exists. To the Pangasinan people, ''mana'' can be transferred, inherited or acquired, like from an ancestor, nature, or natural phenomena. Their belief or practice is similar to [[Shamanism|Shamanist]] or [[animism|animist]] beliefs and rituals. They worshipped a pantheon of ''[[anito]]'' (\"spirit\" or \"deity\"). Their [[dambana|temples or altars]] were dedicated to a chief ''anito'' called Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\">https://ncca.gov.ph/about-ncca-3/subcommissions/subcommission-on-cultural-communities-and-traditional-arts-sccta/northern-cultural-communities/the-lowland-cultural-community-of-pangasinan/</ref> (\u201cSupreme Father\u201d), who communicated through mediums or priests called ''[[babaylan|manag-anito]]''. These ''manag-anito'' wore special costumes when serving an ''anito'' and they made offerings of oils, ointments, essences, and perfumes in exquisite vessels. In contrast, the [[Sambal people]] of the west also revered their own pantheon of deities, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\">https://www.aswangproject.com/sambal-mythology-pantheon-of-deities-and-beings/</ref>\n\n===Spanish accounts of pre-Hispanic Pangasinan===\nIn the sixteenth-century Pangasinan was called the \"Port of Japan\" by the Spanish. The locals wore native apparel typical of other maritime Southeast Asian ethnic groups in addition to Japanese and Chinese silks. Even common people were clad in Chinese and Japanese cotton garments. They blackened their teeth and were disgusted by the white teeth of foreigners, which were likened to that of animals. They used porcelain jars typical of Japanese and Chinese households. Japanese-style gunpowder weapons were encountered in naval battles in the area.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=187}}</ref> In exchange for these goods, traders from all over Asia would come to trade primarily for gold and slaves, but also for deerskins, civet and other local products. Other than a notably more extensive trade network with Japan and China, they were culturally similar to other Luzon groups to the south.\n\nPangasinans were also described as a warlike people who were long known for their resistance to Spanish conquest. Bishop Domingo Salazar described them as really the worst people, the fiercest and cruelest in the land. There was evidence of Christian influence even before Spanish colonization; they used vintage wine in small quantities for their sacramental practices. The church bragged that they won the northern part of the Philippines for Spain not Spanish military. They were unusually strict against adulterers, with the punishment being death for both parties. Pangasinans were known to take defeated [[Zambales#History|Zambal]] ([[Aeta]]) and [[Negrito]] warriors to sell as slaves to Chinese traders.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Scott|first1=William Henry|title=Barangay|date=1994|publisher=Ateneo de Manila University Press|location=Manila Philippines|pages=248\u2013249}}</ref>\n\n===Christianity===\nIn 1324, [[Odoric of Pordenone]], a Franciscan missionary from [[Friuli]], Italy, is believed by some to have celebrated a Catholic Mass and baptized natives at Bolinao, Pangasinan. In July 2007, memorial markers were set up in Bolinao to commemorate Odoric's journey based on a publication by Luigi Malamocco, an Italian priest from Friuli, Italy, who claimed that Odoric of Perdenone held the first Catholic Mass in the Philippines in Bolinao, Pangasinan. That 1324 mass would have predated the mass held in 1521 by [[Ferdinand Magellan]], which is generally regarded as the [[first mass in the Philippines]], by some 197 years. However, historian [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]] concluded after examining Oderic's writings about his travels that he likely never set foot on Philippine soil and, if he did, there is no reason to think that he celebrated mass.<ref>{{cite book|last=Scott|first=William Henry |title=Prehispanic source materials for the study of Philippine history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FSlwAAAAMAAJ|year=1984|publisher=New Day Publishers|isbn=978-971-10-0226-8|pages=81\u201382}}</ref>\n\n===Spanish colonization===\nOn April 27, 1565, the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] arrived in the Philippine islands with about 500 soldiers to establish a Spanish settlement and begin the conquest of the archipelago. On May 24, 1570, the Spanish forces defeated [[Rajah Sulayman]] and other rulers of Manila and later declared [[Manila]] as the new capital of the [[Spanish East Indies]]. After securing Manila, the Spanish forces continued to conquer the rest of the island of Luzon, including Pangasinan.\n\n====Provincia de Pangasinan====\nIn 1571, the Spanish conquest of Pangasinan began with an expedition by the Spanish [[conquistador]] [[Mart\u00edn de Goiti]], who came from the Spanish settlement in [[Manila]] through [[Pampanga]]. About a year later, another Spanish conquistador, [[Juan de Salcedo]], sailed to [[Lingayen Gulf]] and landed at the mouth of the [[Agno River]]. [[Limahong]], a Chinese pirate, fled to Pangasinan after his fleet was driven away from Manila in 1574. Limahong failed to establish a colony in Pangasinan, as an army led by Juan de Salcedo chased him out of Pangasinan after a seven-month siege.\n\nThe province of Pangasinan dates its actual beginnings as an administrative and judicial district, with Lingayen as the capital, to as early as 1580, but its territorial boundaries were first delineated in 1611. Lingayen has remained the capital of the province except for a brief period during the revolutionary Era when San Carlos served as temporary administrative headquarters, and during the slightly longer Japanese Occupation when Dagupan was the capital.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\">{{cite web|title=History of Pangasinan|url=http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|accessdate=24 June 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140905174851/http://www.enriquezurdaneta.com/history-of-pangasinan.html|archive-date=5 September 2014|url-status=dead|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe province of Pangasinan was formerly classified as an alcaldia mayor de termino, or first class civil province, during the Spanish regime and has, in fact, remained a first class-A province up to the present. Its territorial jurisdiction once included the entire province of Zambales and portions of what are now Tarlac and La Union provinces.<ref name=\"History of Pangasinan\"/>\n\n====Rebellion against the Spanish rule====\n\n====Malong liberation====\nAndres Malong, a native chief of the town of Binalatongan (now named San Carlos City), liberated the province from Spanish rule in December 1660. The people of Pangasinan proclaimed Andres Malong ''Ari na Pangasinan'' (\"King of Pangasinan\"). Pangasinan armies attempted to liberate the neighboring provinces of Pampanga and Ilocos, but were repelled by a Spanish-led coalition of loyalist tribal warriors and mercenaries. In February 1661, the newly independent Kingdom of Pangasinan fell to the Spanish.\n\n====Palaris liberation====\nOn November 3, 1762, the people of Pangasinan proclaimed independence from Spain after a rebellion led by [[Juan de la Cruz Palaris]] overthrew Spanish rule in Pangasinan. The Pangasinan revolt was sparked by news of the fall of Manila to the British on October 6, 1762. However, after the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] on March 1, 1763 that closed the [[Seven Years' War]] between Britain, France and Spain, the Spanish colonial forces made a counter-attack. On January 16, 1765, Juan de la Cruz Palaris was captured and Pangasinan independence was again lost.\n\n===Philippine revolution against Spain===\n{{Main|Philippine Revolution Against Spain}}\n\nThe [[Katipunan]], a nationalist secret society, was founded on July 7, 1892 with the aim of uniting the peoples of the Philippines and fighting for independence and religious freedom. The [[Philippine Revolution]] began on August 26, 1896 and was led by [[Andres Bonifacio]], the leader of the Katipunan. On November 18, 1897, a Katipunan council was formed in western Pangasinan with Roman Manalang as Presidente Generalisimo and Mauro Ortiz as General. General Emilio Aguinaldo proclaimed Philippine independence on June 12, 1898. [[Dagupan City]], the major commercial center of Pangasinan, was surrounded by Katipunan forces by July 18, 1898. The Battle of Dagupan lasted from July 18 to July 23 of that year with the surrender of 1,500 soldiers of the Spanish forces under Commander Federico J. Ceballos and Governor Joaquin de Orengochea.\n\n[[File:Andres Urdaneta monumentua, Urdaneta City, Philippines.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Andres Urdaneta monument, in front of the City Hall.]]\n\nThe Battle of Dagupan, fought fiercely by local Katipuneros under the overall command of General Francisco Makabulos, chief of the Central and Directive Committee of Central and Northern Luzon, and the last remnants of the once mighty Spanish Army under General Francisco Ceballos, led to the liberation of Pangasinan from the Spaniards. The five-day battle was joined by three local heroes: Don Daniel Maramba from Santa Barbara, Don Vicente Prado from San Jacinto and Don Juan Quezada from Dagupan. Their armies massed in Dagupan to lay siege on the Spanish forces, making a last stand at the brick-walled Catholic Church.\n\n[[File:Maramba67jf.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|Grave of Don Daniel B. Maramba ([[Santa Barbara, Pangasinan|Santa Barbara]])]]\n[[File:Maramba33jf.JPG|thumb|left|upright=0.7|Daniel B. Maramba Monument and 1970 NHI Marker]]\n\nMaramba led the liberation of the town of Santa Barbara on March 7, 1898 following a signal for simultaneous attack from Makabulos. Hearing that Santa Barbara fell into rebel hands, the Spanish forces in Dagupan attempted to retake the town, but were repulsed by Maramba's forces. Thus, after the setback, the Spaniards decided to concentrate their forces in Lingayen to protect the provincial capital. This enabled Maramba to expand his operations to Malasiqui, Urdaneta and Mapandan, taking them one after the other. He took one more town, Mangaldan, before proceeding to Dagupan to lay siege on the last Spanish garrison. Also on March 7, 1898, the rebels under the command of Prado and Quesada attacked convents in a number of towns in Zambales province, located west of Lingayen, which now constitute the western parts of Pangasinan.\n\nAttacked and brought under Filipino control were Alaminos, Agno, Anda, Alos, Bani, Balincaguin, Bolinao, Dasol, Eguia and Potot. The revolt then spread to Labrador, Sual, Salasa and many other towns in the west. The towns of Sual, Labrador, Lingayen, Salasa and Bayambang were occupied first by the forces of Prado and Quesada before they proceeded to attack Dagupan.\n\nAt an assembly convened to organize a central governing body for Central and Northern Luzon on April 17, 1898, General Makabulos appointed Prado as politico-military governor of Pangasinan, with Quesada as his second in command. His appointment came a few days before the return of General Emilio Aguinaldo in May 1898 from his exile in Hong Kong following the signing of the Pact of Biac-na-Bato in December 1897. Aguinaldo's return gave fresh impetus to the renewal of the flame of the revolution. Thus, on June 3, 1898, General Makabulos entered Tarlac and from that day on, the fires of revolution spread.\n\nSo successful were the Filipinos in their many pitched battles against the Spaniards that on June 30, 1898, Spanish authorities decided to evacuate all their forces to Dagupan where a last stand against the rebels was to be made. They were ordered to go to Dagupan were all civilian and military personnel, including members of the volunteer locales of towns not yet in rebel hands. Those who heeded this order were the volunteer forces of Mangaldan, San Jacinto, Pozorrubio, Manaoag, and Villasis. Among the items brought to Dagupan was the image of the Most Holy Rosary of the Virgin of Manaoag, which was already the patron saint of Pangasinan.\n\nWhen the forces of Maramba from the east and Prado from the west converged in Dagupan on July 18, 1898, the siege began. The arrival of General Makabulos strengthened the rebel forces until the Spaniards, holed up inside the Catholic Church, waved the flag of surrender five days later. Armed poorly, the Filipinos were no match at the very start with Spanish soldiers holed inside the Church. They just became mere sitting ducks to Spanish soldiers shooting with their rifles from a distance. But the tempo of battle changed when the attackers, under Don Vicente Prado, devised a crude means of protection to shield them from Spanish fire while advancing. This happened when they rolled trunks of bananas, bundled up in sawali, that enabled them to inch their way to the Church.\n\n===Northern Zambales ceded to Pangasinan===\n\nOn November 30, 1903, several municipalities of northern Zambales, namely, Alaminos, Anda, Bani, Bolinao, Burgos, Dasol, Infanta and Mabini, were ceded to Pangasinan by the American colonial government in a bid for [[gerrymandering]]. These municipalities were traditional homelands of the [[Sambal people]], who wanted to remain part of [[Zambales]] province, their ethnic province. This 1903 colonial decision has yet to be reverted.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bautista|first1=Joseph|title=Agno Rustic Pangasinan 0|url=http://www.manilatimes.net/agno-rustic-pangasinan/371628/|website=The Manila Times|accessdate=2 May 2018}}</ref>\n\n===American colonization and the Philippine Commonwealth regime===\nPangasinan and other parts of the [[Spanish East Indies]] were ceded to the Americans after the [[Treaty of Paris (1898)|Treaty of Paris]] that closed the [[Spanish\u2013American War]]. During the [[Philippine\u2013American War]], Lieutenant Col. [[Jose Torres Bugallon]] from the town of Salasa fought together with Gen. Antonio Luna to defend the [[First Philippine Republic]] against American colonization of Northern Luzon. Bugallon was killed in battle on February 5, 1899. The First Philippine Republic was abolished in 1901. In 1907, the Philippine Assembly was established and for the first time, five residents of Pangasinan were elected as its district representatives. In 1921, Mauro Navarro, representing Pangasinan in the [[Philippine Assembly]], sponsored a law to rename the town of Salasa to Bugallon in order to honor General Bugallon.\n\nDuring the Philippine Commonwealth regime, [[Manuel L. Quezon]] was inaugurated as the first president of the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines]] under the collaboration from the [[United States of America]] on November 15, 1935.\n\nThe 21st Infantry Division, Philippine Commonwealth Army, USAFFE was found military establishment and built of the general headquarters was active on July 26, 1941 to June 30, 1946 and they stationed in Pangasinan during the pre-World War II era. From the conflict engagements of the Anti-Japanese Imperial military operations included the fall of Bataan and Corregidor and aiding the USAFFE ground force from January to May 1942 and the Japanese Insurgencies and Allied Liberation in Pangasinan from 1942 to 1945 and some parts in North-Central Luzon and helps local guerrillas and American forces against the Japanese.\n\n===Philippine Republic===\n\n====National====\n\n====1946\u20131986====\nAfter the declaration of Independence in [[Manila]] on July 4, 1946, Eugenio Perez, a [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]] congressman representing the [[Legislative districts of Pangasinan#4th District|fourth district]] of Pangasinan, was elected Speaker of the lower [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|Legislative House]]. He led the House until 1953, when the [[Nacionalista Party]] became the dominant party.\n\nPangasinan, which is historically and geographically part of the [[Central Luzon Region]], is made politically part of the [[Ilocos Region]] (Region I) in the gerrymandering of the [[Philippines]] by [[Ferdinand Marcos]], despite the fact that Pangasinan has its distinct primary language, which is Pangasinan. The political classification of Pangasinan as part of the Ilocos Region has generated confusion among some Filipinos that the residents of Pangasinan are Ilocanos, even though Ilocanos only constitute a significant minority in the province. Pangasinan has a distinct primary language, ethnic group and culture, its economy is bigger than the predominantly Ilocano provinces of Ilocos Norte, Ilocos Sur and La Union and its population is more than 50 percent of the population of Region 1.\n\n====1986\u2013present====\nIn February 1986, Vice Chief of Staff General [[Fidel V. Ramos]], head of the Philippine Integrated National Police and a native of Lingayen, Pangasinan, became one of the instrumental figures of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA people power revolution]] that led to the overthrow of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].\n\nAfter the downfall of Marcos, all local government unit executives in the Philippines were ordered by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Corazon Aquino]] to vacate their posts. Some local executives were ordered to return to their seats as in the case of Mayor Ludovico Espinosa of [[Dasol]], where he claims he joined the UNIDO, Mrs. Aquino's party during the height of the [[People Power Revolution|EDSA Revolution]]. Fidel Ramos was appointed as AFP Chief of Staff and later as Defense Secretary replacing [[Juan Ponce Enrile]]. [[Oscar Orbos]], a congressman from Bani, Pangasinan, was appointed by Aquino as head of the [[Department of Transportation and Communications]] and later as Executive Secretary.\n\nOn May 11, 1992, Fidel V. Ramos [[1992 Philippine general election|ran]] for the position of [[President of the Philippines|President]]. He was elected and became the first Pangasinan President of the Philippines. Through his leadership, the Philippines recovered from a severe economy after the oil and power crisis of 1991. His influence also sparked the economic growth of Pangasinan when it hosted the 1995 ''Palarong Pambansa'' (Philippine National Games).\n\n[[Jose de Venecia]], who represented the same district as Eugenio Perez, was the second Pangasinan to be Speaker of the House of Representatives in 1992. He was reelected for the same position in 1995. De Venecia was selected by the Ramos' administration party Lakas NUCD to be its presidential candidate in 1998. De Venecia [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] but lost to [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Joseph Estrada]]. Oscar Orbos, who served as Pangasinan governor from 1995, [[1998 Philippine general election|ran]] for Vice President, but lost to [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]], whose mother, former [[First Ladies and Gentlemen of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Eva Macapagal|Evangelina Macaraeg-Macapagal]], hails from Binalonan, Pangasinan.\n\nArroyo later ascended to the presidency after the second [[EDSA II|EDSA Revolution]] when President [[Joseph Estrada]] was overthrown.\n\nIn May 2004, actor-turned-politician [[Fernando Poe, Jr.]], whose family is from San Carlos City, Pangasinan, ran for President against incumbent [[Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo]] during the [[2004 Philippine general election|Philippine general election in 2004]]. The Pangasinan vote was almost evenly split by the two presidential candidates who both have Pangasinan roots. Arroyo was elected President, but her victory was tainted by charges of electoral fraud and vote-buying.\n\n==Geography==\n\n===Physical===\nPangasinan is located on the west central area of the island of [[Luzon]] in the Philippines. It is bordered by [[La Union]] to the north, [[Benguet]] and [[Nueva Vizcaya]] to the northeast, [[Nueva Ecija]] to the southeast, and [[Zambales]] and [[Tarlac]] to the south. To the west of Pangasinan is the [[South China Sea]].

The [[Zambales mountains]] extend to the province's western towns of [[Labrador, Pangasinan|Labrador]], [[Mabini, Pangasinan|Mabini]], [[Bugallon, Pangasinan|Bugallon]], [[Aguilar, Pangasinan|Aguilar]], [[Mangatarem, Pangasinan|Mangatarem]], [[Dasol, Pangasinan|Dasol]], and [[Infanta, Pangasinan|Infanta]] forming the mountainous portions of those towns.\n\nThe [[Philippine Institute of Volcanology and Seismology]] (PHIVOLCS) reported several [[Volcano#Popular classification of volcanoes|inactive volcano]]es in the province: [[Mount Amorong|Amorong]], [[Mount Balungao|Balungao]], Cabaluyan, Cahelietan, Candong, and Malabobo. PHIVOLCS reported no active or potentially active volcanoes in Pangasinan. A [[caldera]]-like [[landform]] is located between the towns of [[Malasiqui]] and [[Villasis]] with a center at about 15\u00b0 55\u2032 N and 120\u00b0 30\u2032 E near the Cabaruan Hills.\n\nSeveral rivers traverse the province. The longest is the [[Agno River]], which originates from the [[Cordillera Central (Luzon)|Cordillera Mountains]] of [[Benguet]], eventually emptying its waters into the [[Lingayen Gulf]]. Other major rivers include the [[Bued River]], Angalacan River, Sinocalan River, Patalan River and the Cayanga River.\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{Mainlist|Administrative divisions of Pangasinan}}\n\nThe province of Pangasinan is subdivided into 44 [[Philippine municipality|municipalities]], 4 [[Cities of the Philippines|cities]], and 1,364 ''[[barangay]]'' (which means \"village\" or \"community\").

[[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] is widely spoken in the westernmost and easternmost parts of Pangasinan in the 1st, 5th and 6th districts, and is the second language in other parts of Pangasinan. Ilocanos and Pangasinans speak Ilocano with a Pangasinan accent, as descendants of Ilocanos from first generation who lived within Pangasinan population learned Pangasinan language. [[Bolinao language|Bolinao]], a [[Sambalic languages|Sambalic language]] is widely spoken in the western tip of the province in the towns of Bolinao and Anda.\n\n===Religion===\nThe religion of the people of Pangasinan is predominantly [[Christianity in the Philippines|Christianity]] with [[Roman Catholicism]] as the overwhelming majority at 80% affiliation in the population. The second major denomination in the province is the [[Aglipayan Church]] with at least 15% of the population. Other religious denominations are divided with other Christian groups such as Members Church of God International, Iglesia Ni Cristo, Baptist, Methodist, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (Mormon), Jehovah's Witnesses and Seventh-day Adventist. Few are strict believers and continue to practice their indigenous [[anito]] beliefs and rituals, like most of the people of the Philippines.\n\n[[Spanish people|Spanish]] and [[United States|American]] missionaries introduced Christianity to Pangasinan. Prior to the Spanish conquest in 1571, the predominant religion of the people of Pangasinan was similar to the indigenous religion of the highland [[Igorot]] or the inhabitants of the [[Cordillera Administrative Region]] on the island of Luzon, who mostly retained their indigenous culture and religion. A translation of the New Testament (excluding Revelation) in the Pangasinan language by Fr. Nicolas Manrique Alonzo Lallave, a Spanish Dominican friar assigned in Urdaneta, was the first ever translation of a complete portion of the Bible in a Philippine language. Pangasinan was also influenced by [[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]] and [[Islam]] to a lesser extent, before the introduction of Christianity. Some Pangasinense people have reverted to their indigenous religion headed by their supreme deity, Ama Kaoley or Ama-Gaolay,<ref name=\"ncca.gov.ph\"/> while some [[Sambal people]] of the west have also reverted to their indigenous religion, headed by the supreme god, Malayari.<ref name=\"aswangproject.com\"/>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:saltfarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|Commercial salt industry in [[Dasol]]]]\n\nThe province's '''economy''' is mainly agricultural due to its vast fertile plains. More than 44 percent of its agricultural area is devoted to crop production. Aside from being one of the Philippine's rice granaries, '''Pangasinan''' is also a major producer of coconut, mango and eggplant, Pangasinan is the richest province in Ilocos Region of the Philippines.<ref>http://www.coa.gov.ph/index.php/local-government-units-lgus/category/6072-2015?download=28070:annual-financial-report-for-local-government-volume-i</ref>\n\n===Energy===\nThe [[Sual Power Station|1200 megawatt Sual coal-fired power plant]], and [[San Roque Dam (Philippines)|345 megawatt San Roque multi-purpose dam]], in the municipalities of Sual and San Manuel respectively, are the primary sources of energy of the province.\n\n===Marine===\nPangasinan is a major fish supplier in Luzon, and a major producer of salt in the Philippines. It has extensive fishponds, mostly for raising ''bangus'' or \"milkfish\", along the coasts of the [[Lingayen Gulf]] and the [[South China Sea]]. Pangasinan's aquaculture includes oyster and sea urchin farms.\n\nSalt is also a major industry. In [[salt evaporation pond]]s seawater is mixed with [[sodium bicarbonate]] until the water evaporates and the salt remains. This is their ancient tradition inspired from Egypt.\n\n===Agriculture===\nThe major crops in Pangasinan are [[rice]], [[mangoes]], [[Maize|corn]], and [[sugar cane]].

Today, Pangasinan is very much westernized, yet retains a strong, native Austronesian background.\n\nThe main centers of Pangasinan culture are [[Dagupan City]], [[Lingayen, Pangasinan|Lingayen]], [[Manaoag, Pangasinan|Manaoag]], [[Calasiao]], and [[San Carlos City, Pangasinan|San Carlos City]].\n\n==Government==\n[[File:Celestejf.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Siblings Margaret F.

[[Congenital disorder]]s of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG [[syndrome]]s. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different [[organ system]]s (especially the [[nervous system]], [[muscle]]s, and [[intestine]]s) in affected infants. The most common sub-type is [[PMM2 deficiency|PMM2-CDG]] (formally known as [[PMM2 deficiency|CDG-Ia]]) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2 ([[PMM2]]), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of [[mannose-6-phosphate]] into [[mannose-1-phosphate]].\n\n==Presentation==\nThe specific problems produced differ according to the particular abnormal synthesis involved. Common manifestations include [[ataxia]]; [[seizure]]s; [[retinopathy]]; [[liver disease]]; [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]]; [[failure to thrive|failure to thrive (FTT)]]; [[dysmorphic feature]]s (''e.g.,'' [[inverted nipple]]s and [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[fat pad]]s), [[pericardial effusion]], and [[hypotonia]] .  If an MRI is obtained; [[cerebellar hypoplasia]] is a common finding.\n\nOcular abnormalities of CDG-Ia include: [[myopia]], [[infantile esotropia]], [[delayed visual maturation]], [[Peripheral neuropathy|peripheral neuropathy (PN)]], [[strabismus]]''',''' [[nystagmus]]''',''' [[optic disc pallor]], and reduced [[rod cell|rod]] function on [[electroretinography]].<ref name=\"pmid12789572\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen H, Kjaergaard S, Klie F, Moller HU | title = Ophthalmic manifestations of congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1a | journal = Ophthalmic Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 81\u20138 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12789572 | doi = 10.1076/opge.24.2.81.13994 }}</ref>\n\nThree subtypes PMM2-CDG, PMI-CDG, ALG6-CDG can cause [[congenital hyperinsulinism]] with [[hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia]] in infancy.<ref name=\"pmid15840742\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun L, Eklund EA, Chung WK, Wang C, Cohen J, Freeze HH | title = Congenital disorder of glycosylation id presenting with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and islet cell hyperplasia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 90 | issue = 7 | pages = 4371\u20135 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15840742 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-0250 }}</ref>\n\n==''N''-Glycosylation and known defects==\nA biologically very important group of [[carbohydrates]] is the [[asparagine]] ([[Asparagine|Asn]])-linked, or [[N-linked glycosylation|N-linked]], [[oligosaccharide]]s. Their [[biosynthetic pathway]] is very complex and involves a hundred or more [[glycosyltransferase]]s, [[glycosidase]]s, [[Membrane transport protein|transporters]] and [[synthase]]s. This plethora allows for the formation of a multitude of different final oligosaccharide structures, involved in [[protein folding]], [[intracellular]] transport/localization, protein activity, and degradation/half-life. A vast amount of carbohydrate binding molecules ([[lectins]]) depend on correct glycosylation for appropriate binding; the [[selectins]], involved in [[leukocyte]] [[extravasation]], is a prime example. Their binding depends on a correct fucosylation of cell surface [[glycoprotein]]s. Lack thereof leads to leukocytosis and increase sensitivity to infections as seen in SLC35C1-CDG(CDG-IIc);  caused by a GDP-fucose (Fuc) transporter deficiency.\n\nAll N-linked oligosaccharides originate from a common lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor, synthesized in the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] on a dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) anchor. The mature LLO is transferred co-translationally to consensus sequence [[Asparagine|Asn]] residues in the nascent protein, and is further modified by trimming and re-building in the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]].\n\nDeficiencies in the [[genes]] involved in [[N-linked glycosylation]] constitute the molecular background to most of the CDGs.\n* Type I defects involve the synthesis and transfer of the LLO\n* Type II defects impair the modification process of protein-bound oligosaccharides.\n\n===Type I===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The OST is composed by several subunits, including DDOST, TUSC3, MAGT1, KRTCAP2 and STT3a and -3b. \n| Three of these genes have hithero been shown to be mutated in CDG patients, DDOST (DDOST-CDG (CDG-Ir)), TUSC3 (TUSC3-CDG) and MAGT1 (MAGT1-CDG). \n|}\n\n===Type II===\nThe mature LLO chain is next transferred to the growing protein chain, a process catalysed by the [[oligosaccharyl transferase]] (OST) complex.\n* Once transferred to the protein chain, the oligosaccharide is trimmed by specific glycosidases. This process is vital since the [[lectin]] [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]]s [[calnexin]] and [[calreticulin]], involved in protein quality, bind to the Glc1Man9GlcNAc-structure and assure proper folding. Lack of the first glycosidase ([[GCS1]]) causes CDG-IIb.\n* Removal of the Glc residues and the first Man residue occurs in the ER.\n* The glycoprotein then travels to the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], where a multitude of different structures with different biological activities are formed.\n* [[Mannosidase]] I creates a Man5GlcNAc2-structure on the protein, but note that this has a different structure than the one made on LLO.\n* Next, a GlcNAc residue forms GlcNAc1Man5GlcNAc2, the substrate for a-mannosidase II (aManII).\n* aManII then removes two Man residues, creating the substrate for GlcNAc transferase II, which adds a GlcNAc to the second Man branch. This structure serves as substrate for additional [[galactosylation]], [[fucosylation]] and [[sialylation]] reactions. Additionally, substitution with more GlcNAc residues can yield tri- and tetra-antennary molecules.\n\nNot all structures are fully modified, some remain as high-mannose structures, others as hybrids (one unmodified Man branch and one modified), but the majority become fully modified complex type oligosaccharides.\n\nIn addition to glycosidase I, mutations have been found:\n* in [[MGAT2]], in GlcNAc transferase II (CDG-IIa)\n* in [[SLC35C1]], the GDP-Fuc transporter (CDG-IIc)\n* in [[B4GALT1]], a [[galactosyltransferase]] (CDG-IId)\n* in [[COG7]], the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex-7 (CDG-IIe)\n* in [[SLC35A1]], the CMP-sialic acid (NeuAc) transporter (CDG-IIf)\n\nHowever, the use of >100 genes in this process, presumably means that many more defects are to be found.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Classification===\nHistorically, CDGs are classified as Types I and II (CDG-I and CDG-II), depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the [[metabolic pathway]] relative to the action of [[oligosaccharyltransferase]]. The most commonly used screening method for CDG, analysis of transferrin glycosylation status by [[isoelectric focusing]], [[ESI-MS]], or other techniques, distinguish between these subtypes in so called Type I and Type II patterns.\n\nCurrently, twenty-two CDG Type-I and fourteen Type-II subtypes of CDG have been described.<ref name=\"pmid22516080\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Freeze HH, Eklund EA, Ng BG, Patterson MC | title = Neurology of inherited glycosylation disorders | journal = The Lancet.

[[Congenital disorder]]s of glycosylation are sometimes known as CDG [[syndrome]]s. They often cause serious, sometimes fatal, malfunction of several different [[organ system]]s (especially the [[nervous system]], [[muscle]]s, and [[intestine]]s) in affected infants. The most common sub-type is [[PMM2 deficiency|PMM2-CDG]] (formally known as [[PMM2 deficiency|CDG-Ia]]) where the genetic defect leads to the loss of phosphomannomutase 2 ([[PMM2]]), the enzyme responsible for the conversion of [[mannose-6-phosphate]] into [[mannose-1-phosphate]].\n\n==Presentation==\nThe specific problems produced differ according to the particular abnormal synthesis involved. Common manifestations include [[ataxia]]; [[seizure]]s; [[retinopathy]]; [[liver disease]]; [[coagulopathy|coagulopathies]]; [[failure to thrive|failure to thrive (FTT)]]; [[dysmorphic feature]]s (''e.g.,'' [[inverted nipple]]s and [[Subcutaneous tissue|subcutaneous]] [[fat pad]]s), [[pericardial effusion]], and [[hypotonia]] .  If an MRI is obtained; [[cerebellar hypoplasia]] is a common finding.\n\nOcular abnormalities of CDG-Ia include: [[myopia]], [[infantile esotropia]], [[delayed visual maturation]], [[Peripheral neuropathy|peripheral neuropathy (PN)]], [[strabismus]]''',''' [[nystagmus]]''',''' [[optic disc pallor]], and reduced [[rod cell|rod]] function on [[electroretinography]].<ref name=\"pmid12789572\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Jensen H, Kjaergaard S, Klie F, Moller HU | title = Ophthalmic manifestations of congenital disorder of glycosylation type 1a | journal = Ophthalmic Genetics | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 81\u20138 | date = June 2003 | pmid = 12789572 | doi = 10.1076/opge.24.2.81.13994 }}</ref>\n\nThree subtypes PMM2-CDG, PMI-CDG, ALG6-CDG can cause [[congenital hyperinsulinism]] with [[hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia]] in infancy.<ref name=\"pmid15840742\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Sun L, Eklund EA, Chung WK, Wang C, Cohen J, Freeze HH | title = Congenital disorder of glycosylation id presenting with hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia and islet cell hyperplasia | journal = The Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism | volume = 90 | issue = 7 | pages = 4371\u20135 | date = July 2005 | pmid = 15840742 | doi = 10.1210/jc.2005-0250 }}</ref>\n\n==''N''-Glycosylation and known defects==\nA biologically very important group of [[carbohydrates]] is the [[asparagine]] ([[Asparagine|Asn]])-linked, or [[N-linked glycosylation|N-linked]], [[oligosaccharide]]s. Their [[biosynthetic pathway]] is very complex and involves a hundred or more [[glycosyltransferase]]s, [[glycosidase]]s, [[Membrane transport protein|transporters]] and [[synthase]]s. This plethora allows for the formation of a multitude of different final oligosaccharide structures, involved in [[protein folding]], [[intracellular]] transport/localization, protein activity, and degradation/half-life. A vast amount of carbohydrate binding molecules ([[lectins]]) depend on correct glycosylation for appropriate binding; the [[selectins]], involved in [[leukocyte]] [[extravasation]], is a prime example. Their binding depends on a correct fucosylation of cell surface [[glycoprotein]]s. Lack thereof leads to leukocytosis and increase sensitivity to infections as seen in SLC35C1-CDG(CDG-IIc);  caused by a GDP-fucose (Fuc) transporter deficiency.\n\nAll N-linked oligosaccharides originate from a common lipid-linked oligosaccharide (LLO) precursor, synthesized in the [[Endoplasmic reticulum|ER]] on a dolichol-phosphate (Dol-P) anchor. The mature LLO is transferred co-translationally to consensus sequence [[Asparagine|Asn]] residues in the nascent protein, and is further modified by trimming and re-building in the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]].\n\nDeficiencies in the [[genes]] involved in [[N-linked glycosylation]] constitute the molecular background to most of the CDGs.\n* Type I defects involve the synthesis and transfer of the LLO\n* Type II defects impair the modification process of protein-bound oligosaccharides.\n\n===Type I===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The OST is composed by several subunits, including DDOST, TUSC3, MAGT1, KRTCAP2 and STT3a and -3b. \n| Three of these genes have hithero been shown to be mutated in CDG patients, DDOST (DDOST-CDG (CDG-Ir)), TUSC3 (TUSC3-CDG) and MAGT1 (MAGT1-CDG). \n|}\n\n===Type II===\nThe mature LLO chain is next transferred to the growing protein chain, a process catalysed by the [[oligosaccharyl transferase]] (OST) complex.\n* Once transferred to the protein chain, the oligosaccharide is trimmed by specific glycosidases. This process is vital since the [[lectin]] [[chaperone (protein)|chaperone]]s [[calnexin]] and [[calreticulin]], involved in protein quality, bind to the Glc1Man9GlcNAc-structure and assure proper folding. Lack of the first glycosidase ([[GCS1]]) causes CDG-IIb.\n* Removal of the Glc residues and the first Man residue occurs in the ER.\n* The glycoprotein then travels to the [[Golgi apparatus|Golgi]], where a multitude of different structures with different biological activities are formed.\n* [[Mannosidase]] I creates a Man5GlcNAc2-structure on the protein, but note that this has a different structure than the one made on LLO.\n* Next, a GlcNAc residue forms GlcNAc1Man5GlcNAc2, the substrate for a-mannosidase II (aManII).\n* aManII then removes two Man residues, creating the substrate for GlcNAc transferase II, which adds a GlcNAc to the second Man branch. This structure serves as substrate for additional [[galactosylation]], [[fucosylation]] and [[sialylation]] reactions. Additionally, substitution with more GlcNAc residues can yield tri- and tetra-antennary molecules.\n\nNot all structures are fully modified, some remain as high-mannose structures, others as hybrids (one unmodified Man branch and one modified), but the majority become fully modified complex type oligosaccharides.\n\nIn addition to glycosidase I, mutations have been found:\n* in [[MGAT2]], in GlcNAc transferase II (CDG-IIa)\n* in [[SLC35C1]], the GDP-Fuc transporter (CDG-IIc)\n* in [[B4GALT1]], a [[galactosyltransferase]] (CDG-IId)\n* in [[COG7]], the conserved oligomeric Golgi complex-7 (CDG-IIe)\n* in [[SLC35A1]], the CMP-sialic acid (NeuAc) transporter (CDG-IIf)\n\nHowever, the use of >100 genes in this process, presumably means that many more defects are to be found.\n\n==Diagnosis==\n\n===Classification===\nHistorically, CDGs are classified as Types I and II (CDG-I and CDG-II), depending on the nature and location of the biochemical defect in the [[metabolic pathway]] relative to the action of [[oligosaccharyltransferase]]. The most commonly used screening method for CDG, analysis of transferrin glycosylation status by [[isoelectric focusing]], [[ESI-MS]], or other techniques, distinguish between these subtypes in so called Type I and Type II patterns.\n\nCurrently, twenty-two CDG Type-I and fourteen Type-II subtypes of CDG have been described.<ref name=\"pmid22516080\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Freeze HH, Eklund EA, Ng BG, Patterson MC | title = Neurology of inherited glycosylation disorders | journal = The Lancet.

Gulliver has the top 3 highest winning 3 dart averages in the Women's World Championship, all of which are higher than 90.<ref>{{cite web|title=High Averages|url=http://www.dartsdatabase.co.uk/TournamentPlayerStats.aspx?tournKey=245|publisher=Darts Database|accessdate=14 November 2014}}</ref> During the 2008 tournament Trina stated on many occasions that she was not happy with the prize money and the game length compared to the men's competition. In 2008 the women's champion only received \u00a36,000, whereas the men's champion wins \u00a395,000 and the male competition is first to 7 sets whereas the women's is first to 2. Despite this she didn't enter the inaugural (and thus so far only) PDC Women's World Championship in 2010, that offered higher prize money than the BDO version.\n\nTrina Gulliver was beaten in the 2009 World Championship Final by close friend Hoenselaar.  In 2010 Gulliver defeated Hoenselaar, [[Deta Hedman]] and [[Rhian Edwards]] all 2-0 to become World Champion for the first time since 2007.  In 2011 Gulliver defeated Wendy Weinstadtler, Irene Armstrong and Rhian Edwards all 2-0 to successfully defend the Women's World Championship.\n\nGulliver has been sponsored by the leading Global Darts Brand [[Winmau]] for over 10 Years, and in 2003 was named as the [[BBC West Midlands|BBC Midlands]] ''[[BBC Sports Personality of the Year|Sports Personality of the Year]].''<ref name =BBC2003/>\n\nShe was appointed [[Member of the Order of the British Empire]] (MBE) in the 2013 Birthday Honours for services to darts and to charitable fundraising.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=60534 |supp=y|page=18|date=15 June 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nTrina married Paul Gulliver in 1994, after nine years together, and they lived in [[Southam]], but divorced in 2005 after eleven years of marriage.\n\nShe then lived in [[Cheddar, Somerset|Cheddar]], [[Somerset]] until 2017 with her England ladies' darts colleague Sue Gulliver. They married in a civil partnership in July 2010.\n\nTrina's mother Muriel died on 5 January 2012, two days before the start of the BDO World Darts Championship.  Trina still took part in the competition, at the request of her mother before she died.\n\nTrina has recently joined the Sky Sports Darts team for the 2019 PDC World Championships.\n\n==Autobiography==\n2008 saw the publication of her autobiography, ''Golden Girl: The Autobiography of the Greatest Ever Ladies' Darts Player'', which chronicles her ongoing rivalry with ladies' darts superstar and former Olympian [[Crissy Manley]], wife of PDC player [[Peter Manley]].\n\n==World Championship results==\n\n===BDO===\n** 2001: '''Winner''' (beat Mandy Solomons 2\u20131)\n** 2002: '''Winner''' (beat [[Francis Hoenselaar]] 2\u20131)\n** 2003: '''Winner''' (beat [[Anne Kirk]] 2\u20130)\n** 2004: '''Winner''' (beat [[Francis Hoenselaar]] 2\u20130)\n** 2005: '''Winner''' (beat [[Francis Hoenselaar]] 2\u20130)\n** 2006: '''Winner''' (beat [[Francis Hoenselaar]] 2\u20130)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/darts/4608706.stm |title = Gulliver homes in on sixth title |publisher = [[BBC]] |date = 13 January 2006}}</ref>\n** 2007: '''Winner''' (beat [[Francis Hoenselaar]] 2\u20131)<ref>{{cite web |url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/other_sports/darts/6258031.stm |title = Gulliver clinches seventh title |publisher = [[BBC]] |date = 12 January 2007}}</ref>\n** 2008: Runner-up (lost to [[Anastasia Dobromyslova]] 0-2)\n** 2009: Runner-up (lost to [[Francis Hoenselaar]] 1\u20132)\n** 2010: '''Winner''' (beat [[Rhian Edwards]] 2\u20130)\n** 2011: '''Winner''' (beat [[Rhian Edwards]] 2\u20130)\n** 2012: Semi Final: (lost to [[Anastasia Dobromyslova]] 0\u20132)\n** 2013: Semi Final: (lost to [[Anastasia Dobromyslova]] 1\u20132)\n** 2014: First Round: (lost to [[Tamara Schuur]] 0\u20132)\n** 2015: Quarter Final: (lost to [[Lisa Ashton]] 0-2)\n** 2016: '''Winner''' (beat [[Deta Hedman]] 3-2)\n** 2017: Quarter Final (lost to [[Aileen de Graaf]] 0-2)\n** 2018: Semi Final (lost to [[Anastasia Dobromyslova]] 0-2)\n** 2019: Quarter Final (lost to [[Lorraine Winstanley]] 0-2)\n** 2020: Withdrew\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Books===\n* {{cite book | last = Gulliver | first = Trina | title = Golden Girl: The Autobiography of the Greatest Ever Ladies' Darts Player | publisher = John Blake Publishing Ltd |date=January 2008  |isbn = 1-84454-500-8 }}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.trina-gulliver.com/ Official Website]\n* [http://www.DartsDatabase.co.uk/PlayerDetails.aspx?playerKey=2123 Profile and stats on Darts Database]\n\n{{World Darts Championship (BDO)}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gulliver, Trina}}\n[[Category:1969 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:English carpenters]]\n[[Category:English darts players]]\n[[Category:Members of the Order of the British Empire]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Royal Leamington Spa]]\n[[Category:LGBT sportspeople from England]]\n[[Category:Women carpenters]]\n[[Category:BDO women's world darts champions]]\n[[Category:Female darts players]]\n[[Category:Bisexual sportspeople]]\n[[Category:LGBT darts players]]\n", "name_user": "Nicole2410", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200ePersonal life:Adding my relationship)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trina_Gulliver"}
