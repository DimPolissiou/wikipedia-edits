It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and [[sugar]] or a [[sugar substitute]]. Modern squashes may also contain [[Food coloring|food colouring]] and additional [[Flavor#Flavorants or flavorings|flavouring]]. Some traditional squashes contain [[herbal extract]]s, most notably [[elderflower]] and [[ginger]].\n\n==Drinks==\nSquash is mixed with a certain amount of water or [[carbonated water]] before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a [[drink mixer]], it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a [[cocktail]].\n\n[[Citrus|Citrus fruits]] (particularly [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[lemon]]) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NrCkt1-UWikC&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=squash+fruit+concentrate |title=Handbook of Nutrition and Diet |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nTraditional squashes are usually flavoured with [[ginger]], [[Aronia|chokeberries]] (often with [[spice]]s added), [[elderflower cordial|elderflower]], and sometimes orange or lemon.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Preparation==\nSquash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water ([[Carbonated water|carbonated]] or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts water to one part concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water.\n\n===Storage===\nMost cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators.\n\n==Ingredients==\nIngredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as [[citric acid]] or in very old-fashioned cordials [[lemon juice]], or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a [[preservative]] especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5\u201310 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as [[Allura Red AC]] and [[Sunset Yellow FCF]] are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.\n\n===Flavourings===\nTraditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry.\n\nModern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon.\n\n==Terminology==\n\"Cordial\", \"diluting juice\", and \"squash\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In [[British English]], \"cordial\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cordial|title=cordial - Definition of cordial in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> ''High juice'' is a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%.\n\nSquash is often colloquially known as \"juice\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \"fruit drink\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., [[Fruit Shoot]]).\n\n==Fruit juice content==\nSquashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as ''high juice'', and squashes are quite often called \"juice\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \"with real fruit juice\" on the label.\n\n==Low-sugar squashes==\nSquashes labelled \"no [[added sugar]]\" are artificially sweetened, usually with [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame K]], [[saccharin]] or [[sucralose]], which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both [[HFCS]] and [[Sucrose|natural sugar]]. They are very low in calories, sometimes having as few as 4 per 100ml diluted, and they are marketed towards families seeking low calorie alternatives. They tend to be very low in fruit juice, as fruit juice contains natural sugars, so they usually also contain natural or artificial flavourings ([[isoamyl acetate]] for pear or banana, or mixed with [[malic acid]] to make an apple-like flavour, [[ethyl methylphenylglycidate]] for strawberry, [[octyl acetate]] for orange, [[allyl hexanoate]] for pineapple etc.) to make up for the lack of fruit juice taste.\n{{Clear left}}\n\n==World markets==\n{{unreferenced|section|date=November 2016}}\n[[File:BottlesOfSquash.jpg|thumb|upright|Assorted bottles of squash at a grocery store in Argentina]]\n\n[[Britvic]] (under the [[Robinsons (drink)|Robinsons]], [[MiWadi]] and [[Teisseire (company)|Teisseire]] brands), [[Hamdard]] (under the [[Rooh Afza]] brand in India, Pakistan and Bangladesh), Nichols (under the [[Vimto]] brand), [[Suntory]] (under the [[Ribena]] brand) and [[Coca-Cola]] (under the [[Kia-Ora]] brand).

It is usually fruit-flavoured, made from fruit juice, water, and [[sugar]] or a [[sugar substitute]]. Modern squashes may also contain [[Food coloring|food colouring]] and additional [[Flavor#Flavorants or flavorings|flavouring]]. Some traditional squashes contain [[herbal extract]]s, most notably [[elderflower]] and [[ginger]].\n\n==Drinks==\nSquash is mixed with a certain amount of water or [[carbonated water]] before drinking. The amount of water added is to taste, with the squash becoming less strong the more it is diluted. As a [[drink mixer]], it may be combined with an alcoholic beverage to prepare a [[cocktail]].\n\n[[Citrus|Citrus fruits]] (particularly [[Orange (fruit)|orange]], [[lime (fruit)|lime]] and [[lemon]]) or a blend of fruits and berries are commonly used as the base of squash.<ref>{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=NrCkt1-UWikC&pg=PA231&lpg=PA231&dq=squash+fruit+concentrate |title=Handbook of Nutrition and Diet |publisher=|date= |accessdate=2009-04-22}}</ref>\n\nTraditional squashes are usually flavoured with [[ginger]], [[Aronia|chokeberries]] (often with [[spice]]s added), [[elderflower cordial|elderflower]], and sometimes orange or lemon.{{cn|date=August 2017}}\n\n==Preparation==\nSquash is prepared by combining one part concentrate with four or five parts water ([[Carbonated water|carbonated]] or still). Double-strength squash and traditional cordials, which are thicker, are made with two parts water to one part concentrate. Some squash concentrates are quite weak, and these are sometimes mixed with one part concentrate and two or three parts water.\n\n===Storage===\nMost cordials and squashes contain preservatives such as potassium sorbate or (in traditional cordials) sulphites, as they are designed to be stored on shelves. They keep well because of the preservatives and their high sugar content. Nonetheless, some choose to store their squash in refrigerators.\n\n==Ingredients==\nIngredients in squashes and cordials have evolved over the years. A traditional cordial contains three ingredients: sugar, juice or plant extract and some water. Usually it can contain an acidifier such as [[citric acid]] or in very old-fashioned cordials [[lemon juice]], or even spices such as cinnamon or cloves. Recreations of these traditional preparations often contain a [[preservative]] especially sulphur dioxide, although sugar alone will keep it fresh for quite a long time. Modern squash drinks are generally more complex and sugar free squash even more so; the ingredients are usually water, sweetener such as aspartame or sodium saccharin, juice in a low quantity (typically 5\u201310 percent), large quantities of flavouring, preservatives and sometimes a colour such as anthocyanin. In the middle are ordinary squashes, which contain sugar, water, a larger amount of juice, preservatives, colouring such as anthocyanin and often a small amount of flavouring. Although colours such as [[Allura Red AC]] and [[Sunset Yellow FCF]] are occasionally used in squash, most modern British companies are gradually aiming to use natural colours such as beta carotene or anthocyanins, and natural flavourings.\n\n===Flavourings===\nTraditional squashes may be flavoured with elderflowers, lemon, pomegranate, apple, strawberry, chokeberry (often with spices such as cinnamon or cloves added), orange, pear, or raspberry.\n\nModern squashes usually have simpler flavours, such as orange, apple, summer fruit (mixed berries), blackcurrant, apple and blackcurrant, peach, pineapple, mango, lime, or lemon.\n\n==Terminology==\n\"Cordial\", \"diluting juice\", and \"squash\" are similar products, although the products known as cordials tend to be thicker and stronger, requiring less syrup and more water to be blended.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} In [[British English]], \"cordial\" refers to a sweet fruit-flavoured drink (as different from a syrup).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cordial|title=cordial - Definition of cordial in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries - English}}</ref> ''High juice'' is a type that contains a larger amount of juice, around 45%.\n\nSquash is often colloquially known as \"juice\". However this term is a misnomer; no squash is pure juice. Squashes are commonly called according to the fruit from which they are made. More rarely, they may be called \"fruit drink\", especially if they are ready-diluted in a plastic bottle or paper carton (e.g., [[Fruit Shoot]]).\n\n==Fruit juice content==\nSquashes are measured by their juice content, the average being 30%. A variety of squash that contains a larger amount of fruit juice, up to half or more of the volume in juice, is sold in markets as ''high juice'', and squashes are quite often called \"juice\" when talking to children, especially these high-juice beverages, although this may be confusing. However, many squashes contain less than 20% juice, and some as little as 5-10%. The latter are typically low in nutritional value, and the high juice versions are reasonably higher in nutrients, although one downside is that it is high in sugar and does not contain fibre or minor nutrients. That goes with almost all squashes. A low juice squash may state \"with real fruit juice\" on the label.\n\n==Low-sugar squashes==\nSquashes labelled \"no [[added sugar]]\" are artificially sweetened, usually with [[aspartame]], [[acesulfame K]], [[saccharin]] or [[sucralose]], which is much cheaper for the manufacturers than both [[HFCS]] and [[Sucrose|natural sugar]].

Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them.

Researchers estimated the prevalence of different fetishes based on the following elements:\n\n* (a) the number of discussion groups devoted to a particular fetish;\n* (b) the number of individuals participating in the groups;\n* (c) the number of messages exchanged.\n\nIt was concluded that the most common fetishes were for body parts or for objects usually associated with body parts (33% and 30% respectively). Among those people preferring body parts, feet and toes were preferred by the greatest number, with 47% of those sampled preferring them. Among those people preferring objects related to body parts, 32% were in groups related to footwear (shoes, boots, etc.).<ref name=\"scorolli\" />\n\nFoot fetishism is the most common form of sexual fetish related to the body.<ref name=ryan>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/rex-ryans-foot-video-not-necessarily-unhealthy/story?id=12467617 |title=Rex Ryan's Apparent Foot Fetish not Necessarily Unhealthy \u2013 ABC News |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |date=23 December 2010 |accessdate=14 March 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn August 2006, [[AOL]] released a database of the search terms submitted by their subscribers.

In one study, conducted by Dr. A James Giannini at [[Ohio State University]], an increased interest in feet as sexual objects was observed during the great [[gonorrhea]] epidemic of twelfth-century Europe, and the [[syphilis]] epidemics of the 16th and 19th centuries in Europe.<ref>AJ Giannini et al., op. cit.</ref> In the same study, the frequency of foot-fetish depictions in [[pornographic literature]] was measured over a 30-year interval.

They are joined in these adventures by Lemon, a twelve-year-old girl, and PQ, a hand-sized blob with a face that is an expert on spiritual topics. The OAV is known as {{nihongo|''VS Knight Lamune and 40 Fresh''|VS\u9a0e\u58eb\u30e9\u30e0\u30cd&40FRESH}} in Japan, and is a sequel to ''[[VS Knight Ramune & 40 Fire]]'', an anime television series; it was released in the U.S. by Software Sculptors and [[Central Park Media]]. It features generous amounts of [[nudity]], [[fanservice]], and [[Human sexuality|sexual]] themes, making this OVA significantly different from the original TV series. Many of the characters are named after various [[drink]]s, especially [[alcohol]]ic ones.\n\n== Characters ==\n* '''Cacao''' - A full-fledged holy virgin, she has strong [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]]al powers.  The dark-skinned girl explains that this magic works best when the body is unconstricted, and is thus naked at various points throughout the show.\n* '''Parfait''' - Unlike Cacao, Parfait is still in training as holy virgin. Beyond the third episode of the OAV, she pilots an experimental [[mecha]] naked, as the cockpit is filled with water as a shock absorber.\n* '''PQ''' (alternately spelled Piqu) - A hand-sized spiritual advisor, PQ often says things that embarrass Parfait, and endures various forms of physical abuse throughout the show, such as being thrown, stretched, and stepped on.\n* '''[[Lemon]]''' - A twelve-year-old girl, Lemon joins Parfait and Cacao after they rescue her and a large group of children. Her name is an obvious pun, as \"[[Lemon (anime)|Lemon]]\" is a slang term for explicit anime and [[manga]].\n* '''[[Ramune]]s III''' - Flashbacks show the adventures of Ramunes III with Cacao and Parfait.\n* '''Ramunes IV''' - Upon being sent by magic to the Giga Genos, a large spaceship, Parfait and Cacao find Ramunes IV, who is cruelly sadistic. He also attempted to rape Cacao. It is later revealed that this character is not the real Ramunes IV, but an [[impostor]] who was put in place until Don Vodka's search for the real Ramunes concluded.\n* '''Electone''' - An [[Android (robot)|android]] copy of Drum, a character from the original television series who is mounted to the wall of Ramunes IV's private quarters. She is torn between her duty to Ramunes and her [[jealousy]] of Cacao.\n* '''Don [[Vodka]]''' - A part-android who has been integrated into the Giga Ginos, he saw his home world destroyed by the power of the Dark Knight, a giant mecha, when it was activated by someone other than the Warrior Ramunes. He has thus striven to find the real Ramunes to control the Dark Knight.\n\n== Storyline ==\nParfait, Cacao, and PQ are sent by their religious order to find the Fourth Warrior Ramunes. They arrive on the Giga Genos, and are immediately surprised to find it in battle with the defensive forces of a [[planet]], which are subsequently destroyed. The Giga Genos then [[Orbital spaceflight|orbital]]ly [[bombardment|bombards]] the major cities of the planet below. Parfait and Cacao find a large group of children who are being held captive. The two holy virgins defeat the guards, release the children using escape pods, and sabotage the ship.\n\nSome more guards find them, and they are pursued until they run into Ramunes IV. He explains that the entire galaxy must be united under his rule to prevent an upcoming disaster. Shocked by his cruel nature, especially in comparison to the Ramunes III they knew, they continue running and fall into an experimental mech during a fight, where they find Lemon and are then thrown into space and fall to the planet below, protected by Cacao's holy magic.\n\nReminded of her duty to serve Ramunes, Cacao meets him at a lake on the planet surface. Ramunes tells her that he is aware of her feeling of [[love|amorousness]] toward the third warrior, and, by extension, himself. Enraged, Electone later attacks Cacao, while Parfait attempts to rescue her from Ramunes, but fails when Electone, acting on Ramunes' orders, retrieves Cacao from the water.\n\nRamune's followers begin [[Earthworks (engineering)|excavation]] of the Dark Knight, allowing PQ, Lemon, and Parfait to sneak aboard the Giga Ginos and make another rescue attempt. While escaping, they find the injured Don Vodka, who explains that the man claiming to be Ramunes is a [[pretender]], chosen as a young boy to act as a leader for the people until the real Ramunes was found, and that he now intends to activate the Dark Knight, which will cause the planet to be destroyed. Electone, shocked that Ramunes has left without her for the Dark Knight, enters, kills Don Vodka for suggesting that Ramunes is an impostor, and begins fighting the Holy Virgins; she is defeated. The Giga Genos falls to the planet below, and Parfait, Cacao, PQ, and Lemon exit in the experimental mech.\n\nElectone emerges from the wreckage and enters the Dark Knight. The fake Ramunes activated it, causing the mech to reject him. Electone finds him and reminisces about how she has helped raise him and lived by his side as his assistant and lover; he notes with surprise that he has lived his whole life as the Warrior Ramunes and wonders how this could not be the truth as he dies from the Dark Knight's attack. Electone reactivates the Dark Knight, causing it to spew out energy over the planet's surface, but is killed when Cacao and Parfait attack and enter it with the help of Ramune's former followers, who have recognized that they have been misled.\n\nParfait and Cacao enter the Dark Knight's control room, but are unable to stop the destruction that it is unleashing. Lemon enters, and the Dark Knight acknowledges her as the true Warrior Ramunes. She orders the giant mech to stand down, thus saving the world.\n\nAfter the credits of the sixth episode, we are treated to a trailer of \"Knights of Lemon\", which supposedly would show Lemon's further adventures, but no such product has been yet released.\n\n==External links==\n* {{ann|anime|164}}\n*[http://www.scifi.com/sfw/issue113/anime.html Scifi.com Review]\n\n{{Ashi Productions}}\n\n[[Category:1997 anime OVAs]]\n[[Category:Action anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Ashi Productions]]\n[[Category:Central Park Media]]\n[[Category:Comedy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Fantasy anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Mecha anime and manga]]\n[[Category:Ecchi anime and manga]]\n", "text_old": "{{Unreferenced|date=June 2012}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Header\n| name            = Knights of Ramune\n| image           = Knights of ramune.jpg\n| image_size      = 230px\n| caption         = DVD cover of ''Knights of Ramune''\n| ja_kanji        = VS\u9a0e\u58eb\u30e9\u30e0\u30cd&40FRESH\n| ja_romaji       = B\u0101sasu Naito Ramune ando F\u014dt\u012b Furesshu\n| genre           = [[Science fiction]], [[Fantasy]]\n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Video\n| type            = ova\n| director        = [[Yoshitaka Fujimoto]]\n| producer        = \n| writer          = \n| music           = \n| studio          = [[Ashi Productions]]\n| licensee        = {{English anime licensee|NA=[[Discotek Media]]}}\n| released        = 1997\n| runtime         = 150 minutes\n| episodes        = 6\n| episode_list    = \n}}\n{{Infobox animanga/Footer}}\n\n{{nihongo|'''''Knights of Ramune'''''|VS\u9a0e\u58eb\u30e9\u30e0\u30cd&40FRESH|B\u0101sasu Naito Ramune ando F\u014dt\u012b Furesshu}} is an [[anime]] [[OVA]] that follows the adventures of Cacao and Parfait, [[holy]] [[virgin]]s, in their [[search and rescue]] mission of the 4th Warrior Ramunes, given to them by the apparent head of their [[religion|religious]] order, Master Follower.

The manga was one of the first to be serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine in 1968 and became the first big success for Go Nagai. ''Harenchi Gakuen'' is widely considered as the first modern erotic manga and credited for being the first [[ecchi]] manga series.\n\nThe series has been adapted into five [[live action]] movies, a live action television series, and [[Heisei Harenchi Gakuen|an]] [[Original video animation|OVA]]. The live action TV series contains an animated opening sequence which is a recurring element of Go Nagai's works where live action and anime are combined. Other examples include ''[[Pro-Wres no Hoshi Aztecaser]]'' featuring completely animated action sequences during scenes in which the hero uses his powers and ''[[Cutie Honey (film)|Cutie Honey]]'' when the titular heroine appears before the cast, the next scene continues with a full animated opening sequence.\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1968, while [[Shueisha]] was getting prepared to launch its first manga publication, ''Sh\u014dnen Jump'', in order to compete with other magazines from rival companies (like ''[[Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from [[Kodansha]] and ''[[Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' from [[Shogakukan]]), Nagai was invited to be one of the first manga artists publishing in the new magazine. He contemplated this, since he had to design a long-running series instead of the autoconclusive short stories that he had been developing until that point.<ref name=\"L'AUTORE / CHI E' GO NAGAI\">{{cite web | title=L'AUTORE / CHI E' GO NAGAI | language=Italian | publisher=[[D/visual]] | url=http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html | accessdate=April 6, 2008 | date=March 3, 2007 |author= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229194605/http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 29, 2007}}</ref> He accepted, and the series became Nagai's first big success<ref name=\"Harenchi Gakuen - rese\u00f1a\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.misiontokyo.com/index.php?ind=reviews&op=entry_view&iden=162\n|title= Harenchi Gakuen\n|accessdate= April 12, 2008\n|author= \n|last= \n|first= \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= \n|format= \n|work= \n|publisher= Mision Tokyo\n|pages= \n|language= Spanish\n|doi= \n|archiveurl= \n|archivedate= \n|quote= \n}}\n</ref> when ''Sh\u014dnen Jump'' sold more than one million copies.<ref name=\"D-World - L'autore Go Nagai\">{{cite web | title=L'AUTORE / CHI E' GO NAGAI | language=italian | publisher=[[D/visual]] | url=http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html | accessdate=April 12, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229194605/http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 29, 2007}}</ref> With ''Harenchi Gakuen'', Nagai became the originator of ecchi manga,<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/03/20070330p2g00m0dm024000c.html\n|title= 40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\n|accessdate= April 12, 2008\n|author= Connel, Ryan\n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= March 30, 2007\n|work= \n|publisher= Mainichi Newspapers Co.\n|pages= \n|language= \n|doi= \n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080317060218/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/03/20070330p2g00m0dm024000c.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = March 17, 2008 |quote= \n}}\n</ref> opened the door for a series of taboo-shattering gag comics,<ref name=\"Tezuka Osamu @ World - Manga works: The Song for Apollo\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://en.tezuka.co.jp/manga/sakuhin/m074/m074_01.html\n|title= Tezuka Osamu @ World - Manga works\n|accessdate= April 12, 2008\n|author= \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= March 30, 2007\n|work= The Song for Apollo\n|publisher= Tezuka Productions\n|pages= \n|language= \n|doi= \n|archiveurl= \n|archivedate= \n|quote= \n}}\n</ref> and also became the symbol of an entire generation.<ref name=\"D-World - L'autore Go Nagai\"/> This work has influenced the world of manga, effecting both social mores and what was considered appropriate for manga.<ref name=\"Nagai Go (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan)\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.sfwj.or.jp/member/NAGAI-GO.e.html\n|title= Nagai Go (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan)\n|accessdate= April 15, 2008\n|author= \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= \n|work= \n|publisher= Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan\n|pages= \n|language= \n|doi= \n|archiveurl= \n|archivedate= \n|quote= \n}}\n</ref>\n\n''Harenchi Gakuen'' started with the idea of making a manga around a school. Nagai liked the word \"Harenchi\" (scandal), which was used commonly to advertise adult movies. For him, scandal and school were like oil and water, and he thought that mixing them would be funny.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/> At first, Nagai did not have an idea of what stories to develop, but his assistant at the time was boasting about how he had peeped on the girls during their physical examinations from a hole in the roof of his school; this idea was developed into the plot of the manga.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/> Originally, open erotic references did not appear in ''Harenchi Gakuen''. The first physical examination scenes only showed from the shoulders up, but there were a lot of girls drawn, and their images became popular. The editor asked Nagai to go further, which Nagai was eager to do.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/>\n\nThe inspiration for Harenchi Gakuen came from the [[Western world|West]]. Nagai liked foreign movies and used to read ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. For the depiction of breasts, he took particular inspiration from the [[Venus de Milo]].<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/> According to Nagai, what he in fact drew was not about eroticism per se, but about Japan's culture of shame. He wanted embarrassment to be the eroticism of the stories.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Yasohachi Yamagishi|\u5c71\u5cb8 \u516b\u5341\u516b|Yamagishi Yasohachi}}\n: AKA {{nihongo|Boss|\u89aa\u5206|Oyabun}}.

written and illustrated by [[Go Nagai]]. The manga was one of the first to be serialized in [[Shueisha]]'s ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Jump]]'' magazine in 1968 and became the first big success for Go Nagai. ''Harenchi Gakuen'' is widely considered as the first modern erotic manga and credited for being the first [[ecchi]] manga series.\n\nThe series has been adapted into five [[live action]] movies, a live action television series, and [[Heisei Harenchi Gakuen|an]] [[Original video animation|OVA]]. The live action TV series contains an animated opening sequence which is a recurring element of Go Nagai\u2019s works where live action and anime are combined. Other examples include ''[[Pro-Wres no Hoshi Aztecaser]]'' featuring completely animated action sequences during scenes in which the hero uses his powers and ''[[Cutie Honey (film)|Cutie Honey]]'' when the titular heroine appears before the cast, the next scene continues with a full animated opening sequence.\n\n==Origins==\nIn 1968, while [[Shueisha]] was getting prepared to launch its first manga publication, ''Sh\u014dnen Jump'', in order to compete with other magazines from rival companies (like ''[[Sh\u014dnen Magazine]]'' from [[Kodansha]] and ''[[Sh\u014dnen Sunday]]'' from [[Shogakukan]]), Nagai was invited to be one of the first manga artists publishing in the new magazine. He contemplated this, since he had to design a long-running series instead of the autoconclusive short stories that he had been developing until that point.<ref name=\"L'AUTORE / CHI E' GO NAGAI\">{{cite web | title=L'AUTORE / CHI E' GO NAGAI | language=Italian | publisher=[[D/visual]] | url=http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html | accessdate=April 6, 2008 | date=March 3, 2007 |author= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229194605/http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 29, 2007}}</ref> He accepted, and the series became Nagai's first big success<ref name=\"Harenchi Gakuen - rese\u00f1a\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.misiontokyo.com/index.php?ind=reviews&op=entry_view&iden=162\n|title= Harenchi Gakuen\n|accessdate= April 12, 2008\n|author= \n|last= \n|first= \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= \n|format= \n|work= \n|publisher= Mision Tokyo\n|pages= \n|language= Spanish\n|doi= \n|archiveurl= \n|archivedate= \n|quote= \n}}\n</ref> when ''Sh\u014dnen Jump'' sold more than one million copies.<ref name=\"D-World - L'autore Go Nagai\">{{cite web | title=L'AUTORE / CHI E' GO NAGAI | language=italian | publisher=[[D/visual]] | url=http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html | accessdate=April 12, 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071229194605/http://www.d-world.jp/goldrake/autore.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = December 29, 2007}}</ref> With ''Harenchi Gakuen'', Nagai became the originator of ecchi manga,<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/03/20070330p2g00m0dm024000c.html\n|title= 40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\n|accessdate= April 12, 2008\n|author= Connel, Ryan\n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= March 30, 2007\n|work= \n|publisher= Mainichi Newspapers Co.\n|pages= \n|language= \n|doi= \n|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080317060218/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/culture/waiwai/archive/news/2007/03/20070330p2g00m0dm024000c.html <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = March 17, 2008 |quote= \n}}\n</ref> opened the door for a series of taboo-shattering gag comics,<ref name=\"Tezuka Osamu @ World - Manga works: The Song for Apollo\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://en.tezuka.co.jp/manga/sakuhin/m074/m074_01.html\n|title= Tezuka Osamu @ World - Manga works\n|accessdate= April 12, 2008\n|author= \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= March 30, 2007\n|work= The Song for Apollo\n|publisher= Tezuka Productions\n|pages= \n|language= \n|doi= \n|archiveurl= \n|archivedate= \n|quote= \n}}\n</ref> and also became the symbol of an entire generation.<ref name=\"D-World - L'autore Go Nagai\"/> This work has influenced the world of manga, effecting both social mores and what was considered appropriate for manga.<ref name=\"Nagai Go (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan)\">\n{{cite web\n|url= http://www.sfwj.or.jp/member/NAGAI-GO.e.html\n|title= Nagai Go (Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan)\n|accessdate= April 15, 2008\n|author= \n|authorlink= \n|coauthors= \n|date= \n|work= \n|publisher= Science Fiction and Fantasy Writers of Japan\n|pages= \n|language= \n|doi= \n|archiveurl= \n|archivedate= \n|quote= \n}}\n</ref>\n\n''Harenchi Gakuen'' started with the idea of making a manga around a school. Nagai liked the word \"Harenchi\" (scandal), which was used commonly to advertise adult movies. For him, scandal and school were like oil and water, and he thought that mixing them would be funny.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/> At first, Nagai did not have an idea of what stories to develop, but his assistant at the time was boasting about how he had peeped on the girls during their physical examinations from a hole in the roof of his school; this idea was developed into the plot of the manga.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/> Originally, open erotic references did not appear in ''Harenchi Gakuen''. The first physical examination scenes only showed from the shoulders up, but there were a lot of girls drawn, and their images became popular. The editor asked Nagai to go further, which Nagai was eager to do.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/>\n\nThe inspiration for Harenchi Gakuen came from the [[Western world|West]]. Nagai liked foreign movies and used to read ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine. For the depiction of breasts, he took particular inspiration from the [[Venus de Milo]].<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/> According to Nagai, what he in fact drew was not about eroticism per se, but about Japan's culture of shame. He wanted embarrassment to be the eroticism of the stories.<ref name=\"40-year veteran of ecchi manga Go Nagai says brains more fun than boobs\"/>\n\n==Characters==\n;{{nihongo|Yasohachi Yamagishi|\u5c71\u5cb8 \u516b\u5341\u516b|Yamagishi Yasohachi}}\n: AKA {{nihongo|Boss|\u89aa\u5206|Oyabun}}.

Formerly available from [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer/Geneon]] in the United States, it is now out of print.\n\n==Story==\nKazuya Saotome is a nerdy second-year engineering student at {{nihongo|Ochanomizu Industrial University|\u304a\u8336\u306e\u6c34\u5de5\u696d\u5927\u5b66|Ochanomizu K\u014dgy\u014d Daigaku}}. His lifelong dream is to build a Doraemon (robot), and is  trying to develop an [[artificial intelligence]] robot that happens to look like a toy squid. The story begins when Kazuya's wealthy rival, Kotaro Nanbara, gives him a computer program that supposedly will provide valuable information to help with Kazuya's research and development. Actually, the program is a virus that Nanbara created in order to infect Kazuya's computer and destroy his work. While attempting to fix his infected computer, Kazuya accidentally orders a \"Cyberdoll\" from the Cyberdyne Corporation website. A woman appears at Kazuya's door with a small package containing a cyberdoll named Hand Maid May. May is a palm-sized robotic doll who is very sensitive and sympathetic to Kazuya's feelings, likes, and needs. The early part of the storyline focuses on Nanbara trying to get May taken away from Kazuya due to his inability to pay for her. Nanbara enlists the help of several other cyberdolls to attempt to take May away from Kazuya, but all of them end up falling for Kazuya and failing to retrieve May.\n\nIn the latter part of the anime, May is upgraded to a lifesize version of herself after Kazuya receives a visit from a mysterious visitor who wishes to promote Kazuya's [[artificial intelligence]] research. The situation complicates further when Kazuya's human friend Kasumi begins to get jealous of all the Cyberdolls flirting with Kazuya and they all compete to see who can go on a date with him. The last segment of the story deals with Kazuya and May having to deal with a virus which is shutting down all of the Cyberdolls, and a couple of mysterious visitors who turn out to be related to Kazuya and Nanbara in the future.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Kazuya Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u548c\u4e5f|Saotome Kazuya}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takayuki Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Takayuki Yamaguchi]]|[[Steve Staley|Steve Cannon]]}}\n:Kazuya is a 19-year-old electrical engineering student with a passion for building robots, primarily a robot squid which he calls Ikariya and implementing an AI system into it. He is a bit absent-minded and is clueless when it comes to girls. He has two sisters as shown in the 7th episode. However it is later revealed that in the future, his work with Ikariya will eventually become the basis for the M.a.i.d. Program (short for '''M'''eet '''Ai''' '''D'''eparture, Ai means Love in Japanese). Kazuya lives in apartment 204 of Kasumi House. His life becomes more complicated but yet more satisfying after the arrival of cyberdoll May and the subsequent Cyberdolls.\n\n<span id=\"Cyberdoll May\"></span>\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll May|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4|Saibad\u014dru Mei|G-99(D)-JPS}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Maria Yamamoto]]|[[Lia Sargent]]}}\n:A hand-sized 1/6 scale Cyberdoll from the Cyberdyne Corporation (not to be confused with [[The Terminator]]'s robotic company, [[Cyberdyne Systems]]). Kazuya receives May because of an accidental order which happened as a result of a revenge tactic planted in a DVD-RAM from his rival, Nanbara. She has to be plugged into Kazuya's computer via a homemade cable in order to recharge her batteries because May's official recharging equipment was accidentally broken when Kazuya first received her. May was never paid for by Kazuya, and thus became a target for Sara and Cyberdyne in early episodes.\n\n:As a Cyberdoll, she can control traffic lights and simple electronics, and can connect to personal computers via what may or may not be [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cables. She later becomes a human-sized 17-year-old version (courtesy of Cyber-X) following her repossession. Her personality is innocent, and at times childish and naive, though she also shows surprising insight and is always able to cheer Kazuya up. Unlike the other Cyberdolls, May's Maid Program had evolved (according to Kei during her analysis), making her more human and resistant to the retro-cybervirus that threatened the other Cyberdolls. She shows strong feelings towards Kazuya and is often competing with Kasumi. In the last episode it has also been stated that she can give birth.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kasumi Tani|\u8c37 \u304b\u3059\u307f|Tani Kasumi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Takahashi]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}\n:Kasumi is the 18-year-old daughter of the owners of Kasumi House, a small wooden apartment building. Her window faces Kazuya's window, so she uses a long ladder that runs from his balcony to hers as a bridge to pay him a visit, along with Rena. Because she's a close friend of Kazuya's, she often lets him get away with overdue rent payments. In addition to being a college student, Kasumi is very active, athletic, and likes baseball. She is a coach for the local little league baseball team, and her uniform number is 33. She is shown to have a [[tomboy]]ish side, as she refers to herself as \"boku\" (the Japanese male form of \"I\"), but she has a kind side. She has feelings for Kazuya and will wear more revealing outfits when coming to visit him. She sees the Cyberdolls, primarily May, as a friendly rival for his affections.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kotaro Nanbara|\u5357\u539f \u8015\u592a\u90ce|Nanbara K\u014dtar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bji Ueda]]|[[R. Martin Klein|Bob Marx]]}}\n:The self-proclaimed \"best friend and worst enemy\" of Kazuya Saotome. Nanbara is very rich with an eccentric, egomaniacal personality. He is jealous of being outdone in projects by the Kazuya. His virus caused Kazuya to inadvertently order May. Nanbara gets Sara to do his chores by offering ramen in exchange. Though very antagonistic against May in her smaller form in earlier episodes, he falls in love when she is enlarged to human size. It is later revealed that he and Kazuya will form the Cyberdyne Corporation that produces the Cyberdolls and will be run by their descendants.\n\n===Cyberdolls===\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Sara|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30e9|Saibad\u014dru Sara|Af-77LC-CHN}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ky\u014dko Hikami]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n:Sara is a 23-year-old Cyberdoll from Cyberdyne's Customer Service division, she has tan skin, silver hair, pointed ears and wears a Chinese qipao. She is addicted to [[ramen]] and seems to have an endless stomach for it. Her goal early on is to repossess Cyberdoll May because Kazuya did not pay for her. She later develops a crush on Kazuya.\n\n<span id=\"Cyberdoll Rena\"></span>\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Rena|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30ec\u30ca|Saibad\u014dru Rena|Cf-3357L-JPA}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|[[Rebecca Forstadt|Reba West]]}}\n:Another Cyberdoll in the form of a 9-year-old child sent by Cyberdyne to recover May. She was first discovered by Kazuya and May as a lost child. Rena decides that she likes Kazuya and Ikariya, and therefore does not return May to Cyberdyne; instead she moves in with Kasumi. In the Japanese audio, she is referred to by everyone, including herself, as \"Rena-chan.\" She has the ability to produce supersonic screams.\n\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Kei|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b1\u30a4|Saibad\u014dru Kei|Af-444LC-JPN}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Omi Minami]]|[[Bridget Hoffman|Jane Arden]]}}\n:Kei is a 21-year-old genius Cyberdoll said to have an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 50,000 in human terms. Kei is given the mission of formulating a strategy to get May back, but becomes interested in Kazuya after hearing how he regards Cyberdolls and changes her mind. Kei's memory bank of facts is extensive, but she often takes a while to process information that is more abstract. At times, abstract or philosophical questions can cause her CPU to lock up. She later develops a crush on Kazuya and takes up residence in his closet.\n\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Mami|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30df|Saibad\u014dru Mami|Af-863LD-USNY}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kikuko Inoue]]|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn|Dorothy Melendrez]]}}\n:Mami, age 31, is from Cyberdyne's American branch and is a combination of both Japanese and American cultures (she wears both a kimono and roller blades. She has the habit of saying {{nihongo|\"Oh, my, my\"|\u3042\u3089\u3042\u3089\u301c\u266a|Ara-ara}} when amazed or otherwise. She arrives later to help Kazuya around the house, and is gifted at domestic tasks which causes May to be jealous. Even so, Mami tries to pair Kazuya and May up. She is later revealed to be the caretaker of Kazuya's descendant Takuya Saotome.\n\n===Cyberdyne Corporation===\n;{{nihongo|Takuya Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u5353\u4e5f|Saotome Takuya}} / {{nihongo|Cyber-X|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fcX|Saib\u0101 Ekkusu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shinichiro Miki]]|Sam Strong}}\n:He is Kazuya's descendant. In his initial appearances he wears a red trenchcoat, white pants, and a yellow hat, and wears a type of muscle suit that covers his torso and arms with specifications (which is to hide his obese body). He also wears a specially-designed helmet that has an opening mouthpiece to eat or drink (especially milk which is his favorite). He first appears in the second episode watching over May, and in the same episode guides Kazuya (without his knowledge) to May who was lost in the city. He fully introduces himself in the 5th episode after May is repossessed. He shows interest in Kazuya's research with Artificial Intelligence, and allows Kazuya to choose a Cyberdoll for research. To Kazuya's request he arranges May to be returned to him and in a full-sized body as a bonus. His main ability lies in his incredibly fast typing skills, which even with only one hand was able to keep up with Kotaro's long and fast password. He is not fully unmasked until after the credits in the 10th episode, where he shown with green hair and wearing glasses with orange lens and red trim.\n\n;{{nihongo|Totaro Nanbara|\u5357\u539f \u9a30\u592a\u90ce|Nabara T\u014dtar\u014d}} / {{nihongo|Commando Z|\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9Z|Komando Zetto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobutoshi Canna]]|John Holmes}}\n:The so-called \"Wandering President of Cyberdyne\", Totaro is every bit as egomaniacal as his ancestor Kotaro, although he has a stronger streak of common sense. He normally wears a kind of scarlet bodysuit and cape (A reference to [[Kaiketsu Zubat]]), and makes a big production during his introductions (His introduction dialogue is very similar to Kaiketsu Zubat's). Apparently, he and Kazuya's descendant has formed a partnership in running Cyberdyne, with Takuya in research and development and Totaro handling the financial ends. He comes to Kotaro to warn him and Kazuya about the virus.\n\n===''The Whirlwind of Love'' cast===\n;{{nihongo|Gin Munakata|\u5b97\u65b9 \u541f|Murakata Gin}} / {{nihongo|Kintaro Yamazaki|\u5c71\u5d0e \u91d1\u592a\u90ce|Yamazaki Kintar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobutoshi Canna]]|[[Lex Lang]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Naomi Ryuzaki|\u7adc\u5d0e \u30ca\u30aa\u30df|Ry\u016bzaki Naomi}} / {{nihongo|Mika Rokujoin|\u516d\u689d\u9662 \u7f8e\u9999|Rokuj\u014din Mika}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ema Kogure]]|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Tosshinta Yamada|\u5c71\u7530 \u7a81\u9032\u592a|Yamada Tosshinta}} / {{nihongo|Versailles Juliano|\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30e6\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30ce|Verusaiyu Juri\u0101no}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kisho Taniyama]]|}}\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Ikariya|\u30a4\u30ab\u30ea\u30e4}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Miwa Yasuda]]|[[Brianne Siddall|Ian Hawk]]}}\n:A robotic [[squid]] and Kazuya's Doraemon Research Project.

Formerly available from [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer/Geneon]] in the United States, it is now out of print.\n\n==Story==\nKazuya Saotome is a nerdy second-year engineering student at {{nihongo|Ochanomizu Industrial University|\u304a\u8336\u306e\u6c34\u5de5\u696d\u5927\u5b66|Ochanomizu K\u014dgy\u014d Daigaku}}. His lifelong dream is to build a Doraemon (robot), and is  trying to develop an [[artificial intelligence]] robot that happens to look like a toy squid. The story begins when Kazuya's wealthy rival, Kotaro Nanbara, gives him a computer program that supposedly will provide valuable information to help with Kazuya\u2019s research and development. Actually, the program is a virus that Nanbara created in order to infect Kazuya\u2019s computer and destroy his work. While attempting to fix his infected computer, Kazuya accidentally orders a \"Cyberdoll\" from the Cyberdyne Corporation website. A woman appears at Kazuya's door with a small package containing a cyberdoll named Hand Maid May. May is a palm-sized robotic doll who is very sensitive and sympathetic to Kazuya's feelings, likes, and needs. The early part of the storyline focuses on Nanbara trying to get May taken away from Kazuya due to his inability to pay for her. Nanbara enlists the help of several other cyberdolls to attempt to take May away from Kazuya, but all of them end up falling for Kazuya and failing to retrieve May.\n\nIn the latter part of the anime, May is upgraded to a lifesize version of herself after Kazuya receives a visit from a mysterious visitor who wishes to promote Kazuya's [[artificial intelligence]] research. The situation complicates further when Kazuya's human friend Kasumi begins to get jealous of all the Cyberdolls flirting with Kazuya and they all compete to see who can go on a date with him. The last segment of the story deals with Kazuya and May having to deal with a virus which is shutting down all of the Cyberdolls, and a couple of mysterious visitors who turn out to be related to Kazuya and Nanbara in the future.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Main characters===\n;{{nihongo|Kazuya Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u548c\u4e5f|Saotome Kazuya}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takayuki Yamaguchi (voice actor)|Takayuki Yamaguchi]]|[[Steve Staley|Steve Cannon]]}}\n:Kazuya is a 19-year-old electrical engineering student with a passion for building robots, primarily a robot squid which he calls Ikariya and implementing an AI system into it. He is a bit absent-minded and is clueless when it comes to girls. He has two sisters as shown in the 7th episode. However it is later revealed that in the future, his work with Ikariya will eventually become the basis for the M.a.i.d. Program (short for '''M'''eet '''Ai''' '''D'''eparture, Ai means Love in Japanese). Kazuya lives in apartment 204 of Kasumi House. His life becomes more complicated but yet more satisfying after the arrival of cyberdoll May and the subsequent Cyberdolls.\n\n<span id=\"Cyberdoll May\"></span>\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll May|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30e1\u30a4|Saibad\u014dru Mei|G-99(D)-JPS}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Maria Yamamoto]]|[[Lia Sargent]]}}\n:A hand-sized 1/6 scale Cyberdoll from the Cyberdyne Corporation (not to be confused with [[The Terminator]]'s robotic company, [[Cyberdyne Systems]]). Kazuya receives May because of an accidental order which happened as a result of a revenge tactic planted in a DVD-RAM from his rival, Nanbara. She has to be plugged into Kazuya's computer via a homemade cable in order to recharge her batteries because May's official recharging equipment was accidentally broken when Kazuya first received her. May was never paid for by Kazuya, and thus became a target for Sara and Cyberdyne in early episodes.\n\n:As a Cyberdoll, she can control traffic lights and simple electronics, and can connect to personal computers via what may or may not be [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] cables. She later becomes a human-sized 17-year-old version (courtesy of Cyber-X) following her repossession. Her personality is innocent, and at times childish and naive, though she also shows surprising insight and is always able to cheer Kazuya up. Unlike the other Cyberdolls, May's Maid Program had evolved (according to Kei during her analysis), making her more human and resistant to the retro-cybervirus that threatened the other Cyberdolls. She shows strong feelings towards Kazuya and is often competing with Kasumi. In the last episode it has also been stated that she can give birth.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kasumi Tani|\u8c37 \u304b\u3059\u307f|Tani Kasumi}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Mikako Takahashi]]|[[Michelle Ruff]]}}\n:Kasumi is the 18-year-old daughter of the owners of Kasumi House, a small wooden apartment building. Her window faces Kazuya's window, so she uses a long ladder that runs from his balcony to hers as a bridge to pay him a visit, along with Rena. Because she's a close friend of Kazuya's, she often lets him get away with overdue rent payments. In addition to being a college student, Kasumi is very active, athletic, and likes baseball. She is a coach for the local little league baseball team, and her uniform number is 33. She is shown to have a [[tomboy]]ish side, as she refers to herself as \"boku\" (the Japanese male form of \"I\"), but she has a kind side. She has feelings for Kazuya and will wear more revealing outfits when coming to visit him. She sees the Cyberdolls, primarily May, as a friendly rival for his affections.\n\n;{{nihongo|Kotaro Nanbara|\u5357\u539f \u8015\u592a\u90ce|Nanbara K\u014dtar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Y\u016bji Ueda]]|[[R. Martin Klein|Bob Marx]]}}\n:The self-proclaimed \"best friend and worst enemy\" of Kazuya Saotome. Nanbara is very rich with an eccentric, egomaniacal personality. He is jealous of being outdone in projects by the Kazuya. His virus caused Kazuya to inadvertently order May. Nanbara gets Sara to do his chores by offering ramen in exchange. Though very antagonistic against May in her smaller form in earlier episodes, he falls in love when she is enlarged to human size. It is later revealed that he and Kazuya will form the Cyberdyne Corporation that produces the Cyberdolls and will be run by their descendants.\n\n===Cyberdolls===\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Sara|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b5\u30e9|Saibad\u014dru Sara|Af-77LC-CHN}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ky\u014dko Hikami]]|[[Wendee Lee]]}}\n:Sara is a 23-year-old Cyberdoll from Cyberdyne's Customer Service division, she has tan skin, silver hair, pointed ears and wears a Chinese qipao. She is addicted to [[ramen]] and seems to have an endless stomach for it. Her goal early on is to repossess Cyberdoll May because Kazuya did not pay for her. She later develops a crush on Kazuya.\n\n<span id=\"Cyberdoll Rena\"></span>\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Rena|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30ec\u30ca|Saibad\u014dru Rena|Cf-3357L-JPA}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|[[Rebecca Forstadt|Reba West]]}}\n:Another Cyberdoll in the form of a 9-year-old child sent by Cyberdyne to recover May. She was first discovered by Kazuya and May as a lost child. Rena decides that she likes Kazuya and Ikariya, and therefore does not return May to Cyberdyne; instead she moves in with Kasumi. In the Japanese audio, she is referred to by everyone, including herself, as \"Rena-chan.\" She has the ability to produce supersonic screams.\n\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Kei|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30b1\u30a4|Saibad\u014dru Kei|Af-444LC-JPN}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Omi Minami]]|[[Bridget Hoffman|Jane Arden]]}}\n:Kei is a 21-year-old genius Cyberdoll said to have an [[Intelligence quotient|IQ]] of 50,000 in human terms. Kei is given the mission of formulating a strategy to get May back, but becomes interested in Kazuya after hearing how he regards Cyberdolls and changes her mind. Kei's memory bank of facts is extensive, but she often takes a while to process information that is more abstract. At times, abstract or philosophical questions can cause her CPU to lock up. She later develops a crush on Kazuya and takes up residence in his closet.\n\n;{{nihongo|Cyberdoll Mami|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30c9\u30fc\u30eb\u30fb\u30de\u30df|Saibad\u014dru Mami|Af-863LD-USNY}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kikuko Inoue]]|[[Dorothy Elias-Fahn|Dorothy Melendrez]]}}\n:Mami, age 31, is from Cyberdyne's American branch and is a combination of both Japanese and American cultures (she wears both a kimono and roller blades. She has the habit of saying {{nihongo|\"Oh, my, my\"|\u3042\u3089\u3042\u3089\u301c\u266a|Ara-ara}} when amazed or otherwise. She arrives later to help Kazuya around the house, and is gifted at domestic tasks which causes May to be jealous. Even so, Mami tries to pair Kazuya and May up. She is later revealed to be the caretaker of Kazuya's descendant Takuya Saotome.\n\n===Cyberdyne Corporation===\n;{{nihongo|Takuya Saotome|\u65e9\u4e59\u5973 \u5353\u4e5f|Saotome Takuya}} / {{nihongo|Cyber-X|\u30b5\u30a4\u30d0\u30fcX|Saib\u0101 Ekkusu}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Shinichiro Miki]]|Sam Strong}}\n:He is Kazuya's descendant. In his initial appearances he wears a red trenchcoat, white pants, and a yellow hat, and wears a type of muscle suit that covers his torso and arms with specifications (which is to hide his obese body). He also wears a specially-designed helmet that has an opening mouthpiece to eat or drink (especially milk which is his favorite). He first appears in the second episode watching over May, and in the same episode guides Kazuya (without his knowledge) to May who was lost in the city. He fully introduces himself in the 5th episode after May is repossessed. He shows interest in Kazuya's research with Artificial Intelligence, and allows Kazuya to choose a Cyberdoll for research. To Kazuya's request he arranges May to be returned to him and in a full-sized body as a bonus. His main ability lies in his incredibly fast typing skills, which even with only one hand was able to keep up with Kotaro's long and fast password. He is not fully unmasked until after the credits in the 10th episode, where he shown with green hair and wearing glasses with orange lens and red trim.\n\n;{{nihongo|Totaro Nanbara|\u5357\u539f \u9a30\u592a\u90ce|Nabara T\u014dtar\u014d}} / {{nihongo|Commando Z|\u30b3\u30de\u30f3\u30c9Z|Komando Zetto}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobutoshi Canna]]|John Holmes}}\n:The so-called \"Wandering President of Cyberdyne\", Totaro is every bit as egomaniacal as his ancestor Kotaro, although he has a stronger streak of common sense. He normally wears a kind of scarlet bodysuit and cape (A reference to [[Kaiketsu Zubat]]), and makes a big production during his introductions (His introduction dialogue is very similar to Kaiketsu Zubat's). Apparently, he and Kazuya's descendant has formed a partnership in running Cyberdyne, with Takuya in research and development and Totaro handling the financial ends. He comes to Kotaro to warn him and Kazuya about the virus.\n\n===''The Whirlwind of Love'' cast===\n;{{nihongo|Gin Munakata|\u5b97\u65b9 \u541f|Murakata Gin}} / {{nihongo|Kintaro Yamazaki|\u5c71\u5d0e \u91d1\u592a\u90ce|Yamazaki Kintar\u014d}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nobutoshi Canna]]|[[Lex Lang]]}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Naomi Ryuzaki|\u7adc\u5d0e \u30ca\u30aa\u30df|Ry\u016bzaki Naomi}} / {{nihongo|Mika Rokujoin|\u516d\u689d\u9662 \u7f8e\u9999|Rokuj\u014din Mika}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Ema Kogure]]|}}\n\n;{{nihongo|Tosshinta Yamada|\u5c71\u7530 \u7a81\u9032\u592a|Yamada Tosshinta}} / {{nihongo|Versailles Juliano|\u30f4\u30a7\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30e6\u30fb\u30b8\u30e5\u30ea\u30a2\u30fc\u30ce|Verusaiyu Juri\u0101no}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Kisho Taniyama]]|}}\n\n===Other characters===\n;{{nihongo|Ikariya|\u30a4\u30ab\u30ea\u30e4}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Miwa Yasuda]]|[[Brianne Siddall|Ian Hawk]]}}\n:A robotic [[squid]] and Kazuya's Doraemon Research Project.

The highest peak is the Cima Cadin of San Lucano (2.839 m a.s.l.).\n\nThe term Cadini derives from the [[Cadorino dialect]] <nowiki>''ciad\u00ecn''</nowiki> which translates into valleys, and refers to the labyrinthian structure of the massif.\n\n== Description ==\nThe mountain range is crossed by the [[:it:Alta_via_n._4|Alta Via n. 4 path]] and from the equipped Alberto Bonacossa path, which starts from the southern shore of the lake and reaches the [[Tre Cime di Lavaredo]]. The particular geomorphology that distinguishes and so deeply characterizes the Cadini di Misurina, however, allows to cross the group by various lines so that, going up and down from their forks, it becomes possible to enjoy the dolomitic paradise that surrounds them. The equipped path Giovanni Durissini allows for example to complete the complete tour of the branch of San Lucano. It is a ring route, starting at the Fonda-Savio refuge (2,367 m), which runs in sequence the Torre fork (2,400 m), the Sabbee fork (2,440 m), the Cadin Deserto fork (2,400 m), the Cristina fork, the de la Neve fork (2,471 m) and lastly the Nevaio fork (2,620 m), with a total height difference of about 1,000 m. The first climb dates back to 31 August 1896 by Giovanni Siorpaes, Pietro Siorpaes, Ilona E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, Rolanda E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, Johann Innerkofler, and Lor\u00e1nd E\u00f6tv\u00f6s.\n\nAccommodation facilities include refuge Fonda-Savio (2367 m), refuge Col da Varda (2115 m), and refuge Citt\u00e0 di Carpi (2110 m).\n\n== Main summits ==\n* Cima Cadin di San Lucano, 2839 m\n* Cima E\u00f6tv\u00f6s, 2825 m\n* Cima Cadin Nord Est, 2788 m\n* Cima Cadin della Neve, 2757 m\n* Cima Cadin Nord Ovest, 2726 m\n* Campanile D\u00fclfer, 2706 m\n* Cima Cadin di Misurina, 2674 m\n* Torre del Diavolo, 2598 m\n* Torre Siorpaes, 2553 m\n* Torre Wundt, 2517 m\n* Cima Cadin di Rimbianco, 2404 m\n* Torre Leo, 2550 m\n* Punta Cadin de le Pere, 2550 m\n\n== Main passes ==\n* Forcella del Nevaio, 2620 m\n* Forcella Verzi, 2550 m\n* Forcella de la Neve, 2471 m\n* Forcella Sabbiosa, 2440 m\n* Forcella di Misurina, 2400 m\n* Forcella Cadin Deserto, 2400 m\n* Forcella della Torre, 2400 m\n* Forcella del Diavolo, 2380 m\n* Forcella Maraia, 2100 m\n\n== References ==\n* AA.
