Note purple nailbeds.]]\n[[File:Arterial thrombosis causing cyanosis.jpg|thumb|Acute [[arterial thrombosis]] of the right leg]]\nCyanosis is defined as a bluish discoloration, especially of the skin and mucous membranes, due to excessive concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood caused by deoxygenation.\n\nCyanosis is divided into two main types: central (around the core, lips, and tongue) and peripheral (only the extremities or fingers).\n\n== Forms and causes ==\n\n=== Central cyanosis ===\nCentral cyanosis is often due to a circulatory or ventilatory problem that leads to poor blood [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] in the lungs. It develops when arterial oxygen saturation drops below 85% or 75%.\n\nAcute cyanosis can be as a result of asphyxiation or choking, and is one of the definite signs that respiration is being blocked.\n\nCentral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:\n\n1. [[Central nervous system]] (impairing normal ventilation):\n* [[Intracranial hemorrhage]]\n* [[Drug overdose]] (e.g. [[heroin]])\n* [[Tonic\u2013clonic seizure]] (e.g. grand mal seizure)\n\n2. [[Respiratory system]]:\n* [[Pneumonia]]\n* [[Bronchiolitis]]\n* [[Bronchospasm]] (e.g. [[asthma]])\n* [[Pulmonary Hypertension|Pulmonary hypertension]]\n* [[Pulmonary embolism]]\n* [[Hypoventilation]]\n* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], or COPD ([[emphysema]])\n3. [[Cardiovascular disease]]s: \n* [[Congenital heart disease]] (e.g. [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunts in heart or great vessels]])\n* [[Heart failure]]\n* [[Valvular heart disease]]\n* [[Myocardial infarction]]\n\n4. [[Blood]]:\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]] * Note this causes \"spurious\" cyanosis, in that, since methemoglobin appears blue,<ref>[[Methemoglobin]]</ref> the patient can appear cyanosed even in the presence of a normal arterial oxygen level.\n* [[Polycythaemia]]\n* Congenital cyanosis (HbM Boston) arises from a [[mutation]] in the \u03b1-codon which results in a change of [[primary sequence]], H \u2192 Y. [[Tyrosine]] stabilises the Fe(III) form ([[oxyhaemoglobin]]) creating a permanent T-state of Hb.\n\n5. Others:\n* High [[altitude]], cyanosis may develop in ascents to altitudes >2400 m.\n* [[Hypothermia]]\n* [[Obstructive sleep apnea]]\n\n=== Peripheral cyanosis ===\n\nPeripheral cyanosis is the blue tint in fingers or extremities, due to an inadequate or obstructed circulation. The blood reaching the extremities is not oxygen-rich and when viewed through the skin a combination of factors can lead to the appearance of a [[Blood#Color|blue color]]. All factors contributing to central cyanosis can also cause peripheral symptoms to appear but peripheral cyanosis can be observed in the absence of heart or lung failures. Small blood vessels may be restricted and can be treated by increasing the normal oxygenation level of the blood.\n\nPeripheral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:\n* All common causes of central cyanosis\n* Reduced cardiac output (e.g. [[heart failure]] or [[hypovolaemia]])\n* Cold exposure\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Arterial obstruction (e.g. [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[Raynaud phenomenon]])\n* Venous obstruction (e.g. [[deep vein thrombosis]])\n\n=== Differential cyanosis ===\n\nDifferential cyanosis is the bluish coloration of the lower but not the upper extremity and the head. This is seen in patients with a patent [[ductus arteriosus]]. Patients with a large ductus develop progressive pulmonary vascular disease, and [[pressure overload]] of the right ventricle occurs. As soon as pulmonary pressure exceeds aortic pressure, shunt reversal (right-to-left shunt) occurs. The upper extremity remains pink because the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid trunk and the left subclavian trunk is given off proximal to the PDA.\n\n== Approach to diagnosis ==\n{{howto|date=May 2016}}\n* Inquire about duration (cyanosis since birth suggests congenital heart disease) and exposures (drugs or chemicals that result in abnormal hemoglobins).\n* Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis.\n* Check for [[nail clubbing]]: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital heart disease and occasionally pulmonary disease.\n* If cyanosis is localized to an extremity, evaluate for peripheral vascular obstruction.\n* Evaluate abnormal hemoglobins by hemoglobin electrophoresis, spectroscopy and measurement of methemoglobin level.<ref name=hmim>{{cite book|last=Anthony S.

It is derived from the color [[cyan]], which comes from ''cyan\u00f3s (\u03ba\u03c5\u03b1\u03bd\u03cc\u03c2)'', the Greek word for ''blue''.<ref>{{cite book |title=[[Mosby's Medical, Nursing & Allied Health Dictionary]] |series=Mosby-Year Book |year=1994 |page=425 |edition=4th}}</ref>\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Cyanotic neonate.jpg|thumb|A baby with a heart condition. Note purple nailbeds.]]\n[[File:Arterial thrombosis causing cyanosis.jpg|thumb|Acute [[arterial thrombosis]] of the right leg]]\nCyanosis is defined as a bluish discoloration, especially of the skin and mucous membranes, due to excessive concentration of deoxyhemoglobin in the blood caused by deoxygenation.\n\nCyanosis is divided into two main types: central (around the core, lips, and tongue) and peripheral (only the extremities or fingers).\n\n== Forms and causes ==\n\n=== Central cyanosis ===\nCentral cyanosis is often due to a circulatory or ventilatory problem that leads to poor blood [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygenation]] in the lungs. It develops when arterial oxygen saturation drops below 85% or 75%.\n\nAcute cyanosis can be as a result of asphyxiation or choking, and is one of the definite signs that respiration is being blocked.\n\nCentral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:\n\n1. [[Central nervous system]] (impairing normal ventilation):\n* [[Intracranial hemorrhage]]\n* [[Drug overdose]] (e.g. [[heroin]])\n* [[Tonic\u2013clonic seizure]] (e.g. grand mal seizure)\n\n2. [[Respiratory system]]:\n* [[Pneumonia]]\n* [[Bronchiolitis]]\n* [[Bronchospasm]] (e.g. [[asthma]])\n* [[Pulmonary Hypertension|Pulmonary hypertension]]\n* [[Pulmonary embolism]]\n* [[Hypoventilation]]\n* [[Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]], or COPD ([[emphysema]])\n3. [[Cardiovascular disease]]s: \n* [[Congenital heart disease]] (e.g. [[Tetralogy of Fallot]], [[Right-to-left shunt|right to left shunts in heart or great vessels]])\n* [[Heart failure]]\n* [[Valvular heart disease]]\n* [[Myocardial infarction]]\n\n4. [[Blood]]:\n* [[Methemoglobinemia]] * Note this causes \"spurious\" cyanosis, in that, since methemoglobin appears blue,<ref>[[Methemoglobin]]</ref> the patient can appear cyanosed even in the presence of a normal arterial oxygen level.\n* [[Polycythaemia]]\n* Congenital cyanosis (HbM Boston) arises from a [[mutation]] in the \u03b1-codon which results in a change of [[primary sequence]], H \u2192 Y. [[Tyrosine]] stabilises the Fe(III) form ([[oxyhaemoglobin]]) creating a permanent T-state of Hb.\n\n5. Others:\n* High [[altitude]], cyanosis may develop in ascents to altitudes >2400 m.\n* [[Hypothermia]]\n* [[Obstructive sleep apnea]]\n\n=== Peripheral cyanosis ===\n\nPeripheral cyanosis is the blue tint in fingers or extremities, due to an inadequate or obstructed circulation. The blood reaching the extremities is not oxygen-rich and when viewed through the skin a combination of factors can lead to the appearance of a [[Blood#Color|blue color]]. All factors contributing to central cyanosis can also cause peripheral symptoms to appear but peripheral cyanosis can be observed in the absence of heart or lung failures. Small blood vessels may be restricted and can be treated by increasing the normal oxygenation level of the blood.\n\nPeripheral cyanosis may be due to the following causes:\n* All common causes of central cyanosis\n* Reduced cardiac output (e.g. [[heart failure]] or [[hypovolaemia]])\n* Cold exposure\n* Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)\n* Arterial obstruction (e.g. [[peripheral vascular disease]], [[Raynaud phenomenon]])\n* Venous obstruction (e.g. [[deep vein thrombosis]])\n\n=== Differential cyanosis ===\n\nDifferential cyanosis is the bluish coloration of the lower but not the upper extremity and the head. This is seen in patients with a patent [[ductus arteriosus]]. Patients with a large ductus develop progressive pulmonary vascular disease, and [[pressure overload]] of the right ventricle occurs. As soon as pulmonary pressure exceeds aortic pressure, shunt reversal (right-to-left shunt) occurs. The upper extremity remains pink because the brachiocephalic trunk, left common carotid trunk and the left subclavian trunk is given off proximal to the PDA.\n\n== Approach to diagnosis ==\n{{howto|date=May 2016}}\n* Inquire about duration (cyanosis since birth suggests congenital heart disease) and exposures (drugs or chemicals that result in abnormal hemoglobins).\n* Differentiate central from peripheral cyanosis.\n* Check for [[nail clubbing]]: Combination of clubbing and cyanosis suggests congenital heart disease and occasionally pulmonary disease.\n* If cyanosis is localized to an extremity, evaluate for peripheral vascular obstruction.\n* Evaluate abnormal hemoglobins by hemoglobin electrophoresis, spectroscopy and measurement of methemoglobin level.<ref name=hmim>{{cite book|last=Anthony S.

{"title_page": "Separation of variables", "text_new": "{{Differential equations}}\n[[File:First Order proportional differential equation.png|thumb]]\n[[File:First order linear differential equation.png|thumb]]\nIn [[mathematics]], '''separation of variables''' (also known as the '''Fourier method''') is any of several methods for solving ordinary and [[partial differential equation]]s, in which algebra allows one to rewrite an equation so that each of two variables occurs on a different side of the equation.\n\n== Ordinary differential equations (ODE) ==\n\nSuppose a differential equation can be written in the form\n\n:<math>\\frac{d}{dx} f(x) = g(x)h(f(x))</math>\n\nwhich we can write more simply by letting <math>y = f(x)</math>:\n\n:<math>\\frac{dy}{dx}=g(x)h(y).</math>\n\nAs long as ''h''(''y'') \u2260 0, we can rearrange terms to obtain:\n\n:<math>{dy \\over h(y)} = g(x) \\, dx,</math>\n\nso that the two variables ''x'' and ''y'' have been separated. ''dx'' (and ''dy'') can be viewed, at a simple level, as just a convenient notation, which provides a handy mnemonic aid for assisting with manipulations. A formal definition of ''dx'' as a [[differential (infinitesimal)]] is somewhat advanced.\n\n=== Alternative notation ===\n\nThose who dislike [[Leibniz's notation]] may prefer to write this as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{h(y)} \\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x),</math>\n\nbut that fails to make it quite as obvious why this is called \"separation of variables\". Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to <math>x</math>, we have\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\frac{dy}{dx} \\, dx = \\int g(x) \\, dx, \\qquad\\qquad (1) </math>\n\nor equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\, dy = \\int g(x) \\, dx </math>\n\nbecause of the [[integration by substitution|substitution rule for integrals]].\n\nIf one can evaluate the two integrals, one can find a solution to the differential equation.  Observe that this process effectively allows us to treat the [[derivative]] <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> as a fraction which can be separated.  This allows us to solve separable differential equations more conveniently, as demonstrated in the example below.\n\n(Note that we do not need to use two [[arbitrary constant of integration|constants of integration]], in equation (1) as in\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\, dy + C_1 = \\int g(x) \\, dx + C_2,</math>\n\nbecause a single constant <math>C = C_2 - C_1</math> is equivalent.)\n\n=== Example ===\nPopulation growth is often modeled by the differential equation\n\n: <math>\\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> is the population with respect to time <math>t</math>, <math>k</math> is the rate of growth, and <math>K</math> is the [[carrying capacity]] of the environment.\n\nSeparation of variables may be used to solve this differential equation.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n& \\int\\frac{dP}{P\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right)}=\\int k\\,dt\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTo evaluate the integral on the left side, we simplify the fraction\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{P\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right)}=\\frac{K}{P\\left(K-P\\right)}</math>\n\nand then, we decompose the fraction into partial fractions\n\n: <math>\\frac{K}{P(K-P)}=\\frac{1}{P}+\\frac{1}{K-P}</math>\n\nThus we have\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\int\\left(\\frac{1}{P}+\\frac{1}{K-P}\\right)\\,dP=\\int k\\,dt \\\\[6pt]\n& \\ln\\begin{vmatrix}P\\end{vmatrix}-\\ln\\begin{vmatrix}K-P\\end{vmatrix}=kt+C \\\\[6pt]\n& \\ln\\begin{vmatrix}K-P\\end{vmatrix}-\\ln\\begin{vmatrix}P\\end{vmatrix}=-kt-C \\\\[6pt]\n& \\ln\\begin{vmatrix}\\cfrac{K-P}{P}\\end{vmatrix}=-kt-C \\\\[6pt]\n& \\begin{vmatrix}\\dfrac{K-P}{P}\\end{vmatrix}=e^{-kt-C} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\begin{vmatrix}\\dfrac{K-P}{P}\\end{vmatrix}=e^{-C}e^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K-P}{P}=\\pm e^{-C}e^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n\\text{Let } & A=\\pm e^{-C}. \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K-P}{P}=Ae^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K}{P}-1=Ae^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K}{P}=1+Ae^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{P}{K}=\\frac{1}{1+Ae^{-kt}} \\\\[6pt]\n& P=\\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-kt}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the solution to the logistic equation is\n\n: <math>P(t)=\\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-kt}}</math>\n\nTo find <math>A</math>, let <math>t=0</math> and <math>P\\left(0\\right)=P_0</math>.

''dx'' (and ''dy'') can be viewed, at a simple level, as just a convenient notation, which provides a handy mnemonic aid for assisting with manipulations. A formal definition of ''dx'' as a [[differential (infinitesimal)]] is somewhat advanced.\n\n=== Alternative notation ===\n\nThose who dislike [[Leibniz's notation]] may prefer to write this as\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{h(y)} \\frac{dy}{dx} = g(x),</math>\n\nbut that fails to make it quite as obvious why this is called \"separation of variables\". Integrating both sides of the equation with respect to <math>x</math>, we have\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\frac{dy}{dx} \\, dx = \\int g(x) \\, dx, \\qquad\\qquad (1) </math>\n\nor equivalently,\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\, dy = \\int g(x) \\, dx </math>\n\nbecause of the [[integration by substitution|substitution rule for integrals]].\n\nIf one can evaluate the two integrals, one can find a solution to the differential equation.  Observe that this process effectively allows us to treat the [[derivative]] <math>\\frac{dy}{dx}</math> as a fraction which can be separated.  This allows us to solve separable differential equations more conveniently, as demonstrated in the example below.\n\n(Note that we do not need to use two [[arbitrary constant of integration|constants of integration]], in equation (1) as in\n\n:<math>\\int \\frac{1}{h(y)} \\, dy + C_1 = \\int g(x) \\, dx + C_2,</math>\n\nbecause a single constant <math>C = C_2 - C_1</math> is equivalent.)\n\n=== Example ===\nPopulation growth is often modeled by the differential equation\n\n: <math>\\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right)</math>\n\nwhere <math>P</math> is the population with respect to time <math>t</math>, <math>k</math> is the rate of growth, and <math>K</math> is the [[carrying capacity]] of the environment.\n\nSeparation of variables may be used to solve this differential equation.\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\frac{dP}{dt}=kP\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right) \\\\[5pt]\n& \\int\\frac{dP}{P\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right)}=\\int k\\,dt\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTo evaluate the integral on the left side, we simplify the fraction\n\n: <math>\\frac{1}{P\\left(1-\\frac{P}{K}\\right)}=\\frac{K}{P\\left(K-P\\right)}</math>\n\nand then, we decompose the fraction into partial fractions\n\n: <math>\\frac{K}{P(K-P)}=\\frac{1}{P}+\\frac{1}{K-P}</math>\n\nThus we have\n\n: <math>\n\\begin{align}\n& \\int\\left(\\frac{1}{P}+\\frac{1}{K-P}\\right)\\,dP=\\int k\\,dt \\\\[6pt]\n& \\ln\\begin{vmatrix}P\\end{vmatrix}-\\ln\\begin{vmatrix}K-P\\end{vmatrix}=kt+C \\\\[6pt]\n& \\ln\\begin{vmatrix}K-P\\end{vmatrix}-\\ln\\begin{vmatrix}P\\end{vmatrix}=-kt-C \\\\[6pt]\n& \\ln\\begin{vmatrix}\\cfrac{K-P}{P}\\end{vmatrix}=-kt-C \\\\[6pt]\n& \\begin{vmatrix}\\dfrac{K-P}{P}\\end{vmatrix}=e^{-kt-C} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\begin{vmatrix}\\dfrac{K-P}{P}\\end{vmatrix}=e^{-C}e^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K-P}{P}=\\pm e^{-C}e^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n\\text{Let } & A=\\pm e^{-C}. \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K-P}{P}=Ae^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K}{P}-1=Ae^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{K}{P}=1+Ae^{-kt} \\\\[6pt]\n& \\frac{P}{K}=\\frac{1}{1+Ae^{-kt}} \\\\[6pt]\n& P=\\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-kt}}\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\nTherefore, the solution to the logistic equation is\n\n: <math>P(t)=\\frac{K}{1+Ae^{-kt}}</math>\n\nTo find <math>A</math>, let <math>t=0</math> and <math>P\\left(0\\right)=P_0</math>.

See [[spherical harmonics#Laplace's spherical harmonics|spherical harmonics]] for example.\n\n== Matrices ==\nThe matrix form of the separation of variables is the [[Kronecker sum]].\n\nAs an example we consider the 2D [[Discrete Laplace operator|discrete Laplacian]] on a [[regular grid]]:\n\n:<math>L = \\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\oplus\\mathbf{D_{yy}}=\\mathbf{D_{xx}}\\otimes\\mathbf{I}+\\mathbf{I}\\otimes\\mathbf{D_{yy}}, \\,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\mathbf{D_{xx}} </math> and <math>\\mathbf{D_{yy}} </math> are 1D discrete Laplacians in the ''x''- and ''y''-directions, correspondingly, and <math>\\mathbf{I} </math> are the identities of appropriate sizes. See the main article [[Kronecker sum of discrete Laplacians]] for details.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Inseparable differential equation]]\n\n== References ==\n*{{Cite book\n| first1 = Andrei D.\n| last1 = Polyanin\n| title = Handbook of Linear Partial Differential Equations for Engineers and Scientists\n| publisher = [[CRC Press|Chapman & Hall/CRC]]\n| date = 2001-11-28\n| location = Boca Raton, FL\n| isbn = 1-58488-299-9\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n| first1 = Tyn\n| last1 = Myint-U\n| first2 = Lokenath\n| last2 = Debnath\n|author-link2=Lokenath Debnath\n| isbn = 978-0-8176-4393-5\n| title = Linear Partial Differential Equations for Scientists and Engineers\n| location = Boston, MA\n| year = 2007\n| publisher = [[Birkh\u00e4user|Birkh\u00e4user Boston]]\n| doi = 10.1007/978-0-8176-4560-1\n}}\n* {{Cite book\n| last = Teschl\n| first = Gerald\n| author-link = Gerald Teschl\n| title = Ordinary Differential Equations and Dynamical Systems\n| series = [[Graduate Studies in Mathematics]]\n| volume = 140\n| publisher = [[American Mathematical Society]]\n| location = Providence, RI\n| year = 2012\n| isbn = 978-0-8218-8328-0\n| url = http://www.mat.univie.ac.at/~gerald/ftp/book-ode/\n}}\n\n== External links ==\n* {{springer|title=Fourier method|id=p/f041070}}\n* {{mathworld2 |urlname=SeparationofVariables |title=Separation of variables|urlname2=DifferentialEquation|title2=Differential Equation|author=John Renze, [[Eric W.
