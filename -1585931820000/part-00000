In a ploy for publicity, Newman has pitched Oscar and Peter in a neck-and-neck competition with their archrivals and former colleagues, the hugely successful Decker and Strauss ([[Bob Balaban]] and [[John C. McGinley]]). When Newman meets Oscar and Peter, he assumes that they are lovers, even though Oscar is straight. (Peter is in fact [[gay]], but his relationship with Oscar is strictly platonic.) Under the mistaken impression that Oscar is gay, he asks Oscar to keep an eye on his mistress Amy ([[Neve Campbell|Campbell]]) and make sure that she does not talk to his wife. Oscar falls for Amy virtually on sight, but she also thinks he is gay. He is forced to maintain the charade to avoid getting into trouble with Newman, and losing the commission.\n\nMatters become complicated when a news article about Oscar and Peter's supposed relationship is published in a newspaper, leaving Oscar in the increasingly frustrating position of having to fend off advances from various gay men while convincing his friends and family that he is simply ''pretending'' to be gay. Amy even sets him up on a date with her ex-boyfriend, football player Kevin Cartwright ([[Cylk Cozart]]), but Oscar manages to defuse the situation by saying that he is in love with someone else. Despite the embarrassing misconceptions, Oscar forms a close bond with Amy as they continue to spend time together\u2014to the extent that Amy moves in with him after she is kicked out of her apartment. At the final presentation for the cultural center, Oscar and Peter receive the commission, but Oscar is simultaneously told that he has won the award for Gay Professional Man of the Year, with Newman deciding that he will reveal his decision after the ceremony.\n\nAfter an awkward meeting between Amy and Newman's wife at the party, she and Oscar go to a bar. Amy leaves in frustration after she nearly kisses him, prompting a brief argument between her and Oscar in which Oscar states that her relationship with Newman has no future. After spending the day alone, Oscar attends the award ceremony for Gay Professional Man of the Year. Although he initially continues his charade, while looking out at the people before him, he instead makes a passionate speech about how he admires all the men and women here who were able to tell the truth to their families about how they feel, ending the speech by \"[[coming out|coming out of the closet]]\" as he admits that he is straight and in love with Amy. As he is applauded for having the courage to admit the truth, he runs after Amy, only for her to punch both him and Newman and storming out. Peter then awkwardly accepts the prize that comes with the award: a date with Kevin. However, as Oscar sits in a restaurant where he and Amy ate together on the night they met, Amy comes to see him. She says that she loves him too, and they kiss.\n\nIn a post-credit sequence, Newman's wife Olivia ([[Kelly Rowan]]) convinces him to go with Oscar and Peter's design, revealing that she knew about him and Amy and informing him bluntly that Oscar and Peter did the better job.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Anchor|Cast}}\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as Oscar Novak\n* [[Neve Campbell]] as Amy Post\n* [[Dylan McDermott]] as Charles Newman\n* [[Oliver Platt]] as Peter Steinberg\n* [[Cylk Cozart]] as Kevin Cartwright\n* [[John C.

The invention of the [[magnetic compass]], [[telescope]] and [[sextant]] enabled increasing accuracy. In 1492, [[Martin Behaim]], a German cartographer, made the oldest extant globe of the Earth.<ref>[https://www.loc.gov/rr/geogmap/guide/gmillgtm.html Globes and Terrain Models \u2013 Geography and Maps: An Illustrated Guide], Library of Congress</ref>\n\nIn 1507, [[Martin Waldseem\u00fcller]] produced a globular world map and a large 12-panel world wall map (''[[Universalis Cosmographia]]'') bearing the first use of the name \"America\". [[Portugal|Portuguese]] cartographer [[Diego Ribero]] was the author of the first known planisphere with a graduated Equator (1527). [[Italy|Italian]] cartographer [[Battista Agnese]] produced at least 71 manuscript atlases of sea charts. [[Johannes Werner]] refined and promoted the [[Werner projection]]. This was an equal-area, heart-shaped world map projection (generally called a cordiform projection) which was used in the 16th and 17th centuries. Over time, other iterations of this map type arose; most notable are the [[sinusoidal projection]] and the [[Bonne projection]]. The Werner projection places its standard parallel at the North Pole; a sinusoidal projection places its standard parallel at the equator; and the Bonne projection is intermediate between the two.<ref>Henry Bottomley, \u00ab Between the Sinusoidal projection and the Werner: an alternative to the Bonne \u00bb, ''Cybergeo : European Journal of Geography'' [Online], Cartography, Images, GIS, document 241, Online since 13 June 2003, connection on 27 July 2018.

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died. Still, some additions were made to the Atlas after his death and new editions were published after his death.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/Mercator-projection|title=Mercator Projection|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-01-25|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gerardus-Mercator|title=Gerardus Mercator|last=Britannica|first=Encyclopedia|date=2018-02-26|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Renaissance]], maps were used to impress viewers and establish the owner's reputation as sophisticated, educated, and worldly. Because of this,\u00a0 towards the end of the Renaissance, maps were displayed with equal importance of painting, sculptures, and other pieces of art.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Carlton|first=Genevieve|date=2011|title=Worldly Consumer: The Demand for Maps in Renaissance Italy|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=63|pages=123\u2013126|via=}}</ref> In the sixteenth century, maps were becoming increasingly available to consumers through the introduction of printmaking, with about 10% of Venetian homes having some sort of map by the late 1500s.\n\nThere were three main functions of maps in the Renaissance:<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Cartography and the Renaissance: Continuity and Change|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=3\u201324|via=}}</ref>\n*General descriptions of the world\n*Navigation and wayfinding\n*Land surveying and property management\n\nIn medieval times, written directions of how to get somewhere were more common than the use of maps. With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"<ref name=Harley/>\n\nAlthough cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box'{{Definition needed|date=April 2019}} always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field{{When|date=April 2019}}, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.{{Why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

This will enhance the user's experience and keep their attention.

[[Alan MacEachren]] explains that a well designed map \"is convincing because it implies authenticity\".<ref>{{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}} (p.&nbsp;9)</ref> An interesting map will no doubt engage a reader. Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n!

For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps.

It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci.

This is the concern of map editing. Traits may be physical, such as roads or land masses, or may be abstract, such as [[Toponomy|toponyms]] or political boundaries.\n* Represent the terrain of the mapped object on flat media.

By this construction, courses of constant bearing are conveniently represented as straight lines for navigation. The same property limits its value as a general-purpose world map because regions are shown as increasingly larger than they actually are the further from the equator they are. Mercator is also credited as the first to use the word \"atlas\" to describe a collection of maps. In the later years of his life, Mercator resolved to create his Atlas, a book filled with many maps of different regions of the world, as well as a chronological history of the world from the Earth's creation by God until 1568. He was unable to complete it to his satisfaction before he died.

With the Renaissance, cartography began to be seen as a metaphor for power.<ref name=\":0\" /> Political leaders could lay claim on territories through the use of maps and this was greatly aided by the religious and colonial expansion of Europe. The most commonly mapped places during the Renaissance were the Holy Land and other religious places.\n\nIn the late 1400s to the late 1500s, Rome, Florence, and Venice dominated map making and trade. It started in Florence in the mid to late 1400s. Map trade quickly shifted to Rome and Venice but then was overtaken by atlas makers in the late 16th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=The Italian Map Trade: 1480-1650|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=773\u2013790|via=}}</ref>  Map publishing in Venice was completed with humanities and book publishing in mind, rather than just informational use.\n\n====Printing technology====\nThere were two main printmaking technologies in the Renaissance: [[woodcut]] and [[Intaglio (printmaking)|copper-plate intaglio]], referring to the medium used to transfer the image onto paper.\n\nIn woodcut, the map image is created as a relief chiseled from medium-grain hardwood. The areas intended to be printed are inked and pressed against the sheet. Being raised from the rest of the block, the map lines cause indentations in the paper that can often be felt on the back of the map. There are advantages to using relief to make maps. For one, a printmaker doesn't need a press because the maps could be developed as rubbings. Woodblock is durable enough to be used many times before defects appear. Existing printing presses can be used to create the prints rather than having to create a new one. On the other hand, it is hard to achieve fine detail with the relief technique. Inconsistencies in linework are more apparent in woodcut than in intaglio. To improve quality in the late fifteenth century, a style of relief craftsmanship developed using fine chisels to carve the wood, rather than the more commonly used knife.\n\nIn intaglio, lines are engraved into workable metals, typically copper but sometimes brass. The engraver spreads a thin sheet of wax over the metal plate and uses ink to draw the details. Then, the engraver traces the lines with a stylus to etch them into the plate beneath.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Delano-Smith|first=Catherine|date=2005|title=Stamped Signs on Manuscripts Maps in the Renaissance|url=|journal=Imago Mundi|volume=57|pages=59\u201362|doi=10.1080/0308569042000289842}}</ref> The engraver can also use styli to prick holes along the drawn lines, trace along them with colored chalk, and then engrave the map.\u00a0Lines going in the same direction are carved at the same time, and then the plate is turned to carve lines going in a different direction. To print from the finished plate, ink is spread over the metal surface and scraped off such that it remains only in the etched channels. Then the plate is pressed forcibly against the paper so that the ink in the channels is transferred to the paper. The pressing is so forceful that it leaves a \"plate mark\" around the border of the map at the edge of the plate, within which the paper is depressed compared to the margins.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|last=Woodward|first=David|date=|title=Techniques of Map Engraving, Printing, and Coloring in the European Renaissance|url=|journal=The History of Cartography|volume=3|pages=591\u2013610|via=}}</ref> Copper and other metals were expensive at the time, so the plate was often reused for new maps or melted down for other purposes.<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nWhether woodcut or intaglio, the printed map is hung out to dry. Once dry, it is usually placed in another press of flatten the paper. Any type of paper that was available at the time could be used to print the map on, but thicker paper was more durable.\n\nBoth relief and intaglio were used about equally by the end of the fifteenth century.\n\n====Lettering====\nLettering in mapmaking is important for denoting information. Fine lettering is difficult in woodcut, where it often turned out square and blocky, contrary to the stylized, rounded writing style popular in Italy at the time.<ref name=\":2\" /> To improve quality, mapmakers developed fine chisels to carve the relief. Intaglio lettering did not suffer the troubles of a coarse medium and so was able to express the looping cursive that came to be known as [[Italic script|cancellaresca]].<ref name=\":2\" /> There were custom-made reverse punches that were also used in metal engraving alongside freehand lettering.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n====Color====\nThe first use of color in map making cannot be narrowed down to one reason. There are arguments that color started as a way to indicate information on the map, with aesthetics coming second. There are also arguments that color was first used on maps for aesthetics but then evolved into conveying information.<ref name=\":2\" /> Either way, many maps of the Renaissance left the publisher without being colored, a practice that continued all the way into the 1800s. However, most publishers accepted orders from their patrons to have their maps or atlases colored if they wished. Because all coloring was done by hand, the patron could request simple, cheap color, or more expensive, elaborate color, even going so far as silver or gold gilding. The simplest coloring was merely outlines, such as of borders and along rivers. Wash color meant painting regions with inks or watercolors. Limning meant adding silver and gold leaf to the map to illuminate lettering, heraldic arms, or other decorative elements.\n\n===The Enlightenment===\nMaps of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] period practically universally used copper plate intaglio, having abandoned the fragile, coarse woodcut technology. Use of map projections evolved, with the double hemisphere being very common and Mercator's prestigious navigational projection gradually making more appearances.\n\nDue to the paucity of information and the immense difficulty of surveying during the period, mapmakers frequently plagiarized material without giving credit to the original cartographer. For example, a famous map of North America known as the \"Beaver Map\" was published in 1715 by [[Herman Moll]]. This map is a close reproduction of a 1698 work by [[Nicolas de Fer]]. De Fer, in turn, had copied images that were first printed in books by [[Louis Hennepin]], published in 1697, and [[Fran\u00e7ois Du Creux]], in 1664. By the late 18th century, mapmakers often credited the original publisher with something along the lines of, \"After [the original cartographer]\" in the map's title or [[Cartouche (cartography)|cartouche]].<ref>\"Map Imitation\" in [http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/forgery/002035-3000-e.html Detecting the Truth: Fakes, Forgeries and Trickery], a virtual museum exhibition at Library and Archives Canada</ref>\n\n===Modern period===\n[[File:Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado 1571-1.jpg|thumb|right|A pre-Mercator nautical chart of 1571, from Portuguese cartographer [[Fern\u00e3o Vaz Dourado]] (c. 1520\u2013c. 1580).

Image shows mapping of forest structure (position of trees, dead wood and canopy).]]\n\nIn cartography, technology has continually changed in order to meet the demands of new generations of mapmakers and map users. The first maps were produced manually, with brushes and parchment; so they varied in quality and were limited in distribution. The advent of magnetic devices, such as the [[compass]] and much later, [[magnetic storage]] devices, allowed for the creation of far more accurate maps and the ability to [[digital mapping|store and manipulate them digitally]].\n\nAdvances in mechanical devices such as the [[printing press]], [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] and [[vernier scale|vernier]], allowed the mass production of maps and the creation of accurate reproductions from more accurate data. [[Hartmann Schedel]] was one of the first cartographers to use the printing press to make maps more widely available. Optical technology, such as the [[telescope]], [[sextant]] and other devices that use telescopes, allowed accurate land surveys and allowed mapmakers and navigators to find their [[latitude]] by measuring angles to the [[North Star]] at night or the Sun at noon.\n\nAdvances in photochemical technology, such as the [[lithography|lithographic]] and [[photography|photochemical processes]], make possible maps with fine details, which do not distort in shape and which resist moisture and wear. This also eliminated the need for engraving, which further speeded up map production.\n\nIn the 20th century, [[aerial photography]], [[satellite imagery]], and [[remote sensing]] provided efficient, precise methods for mapping physical features, such as coastlines, roads, buildings, watersheds, and topography. The United States Geological Survey has devised multiple new map projections, notably the Space Oblique Mercator for interpreting satellite [[ground track]]s for mapping the surface. The use of satellites and space telescopes now allows researchers to map other planets and moons in outer space.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/pp1395|title=Map projections: A Working Manual|last=Snyder|first=John|date=1987|website=United States Geological Survey|access-date=}}</ref> Advances in electronic technology ushered in another revolution in cartography: ready availability of [[Computer hardware|computers and peripherals]] such as monitors, plotters, printers, scanners (remote and document) and analytic stereo plotters, along with computer programs for visualization, image processing, spatial analysis, and database management, democratized and greatly expanded the making of maps. The ability to superimpose spatially located variables onto existing maps created new uses for maps and new industries to explore and exploit these potentials. See also [[digital raster graphic]].\n\nThese days most commercial-quality maps are made using [[software]] of three main types: [[computer-aided design|CAD]], [[Geographic information system|GIS]] and specialized illustration [[software]]. Spatial information can be stored in a [[database]], from which it can be extracted on demand. These tools lead to increasingly dynamic, interactive maps that can be manipulated digitally.\n\n[[rugged computer|Field-rugged computers]], [[GPS]], and [[laser rangefinder]]s make it possible to create maps directly from measurements made on site.\n\n==Deconstruction==\n{{Only primary sources|date=January 2019 <!--Monmonier, at least, is secondary-->}}\n{{Confusing section|date=April 2019}}\nThere are technical and cultural aspects to producing maps. In this sense, maps can sometimes be said to be biased. The study of bias, influence, and agenda in making a map is what comprise a map's [[deconstruction]]. A central tenet of deconstructionism is that maps have power. Other assertions are that maps are inherently biased and that we search for metaphor and rhetoric in maps.<ref name=Harley/>\n\nIt is claimed that the Europeans promoted an \"[[epistemology|epistemological]]\" understanding of the map as early as the 17th century.<ref name=Harley>[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/p/passages/4761530.0003.008/--deconstructing-the-map?rgn=main;view=fulltext Harley, J.

Cartographica, Vol. 26, No. 2. pp 1-5]</ref> An example of this understanding is that \"[<nowiki />European reproduction of terrain on maps] reality can be expressed in mathematical terms; that systematic observation and measurement offer the only route to cartographic truth\u2026\".<ref name=Harley/> 17th-century map-makers were careful and precise in their strategic approaches to maps based on a scientific model of knowledge. Popular belief at the time was that this scientific approach to cartography was immune to the social atmosphere.{{Fix|text=gobbledegook}}\n\nA common belief is that science heads in a direction of progress, and thus leads to more accurate representations of maps. In this belief European maps must be superior to others, which necessarily employed different map-making skills. \"There was a 'not cartography' land where lurked an army of inaccurate, heretical, subjective, valuative, and ideologically distorted images. Cartographers developed a 'sense of the other' in relation to nonconforming maps.\"<ref name=Harley/>\n\nAlthough cartography has been a target of much criticism in recent decades, a cartographer's 'black box'{{Definition needed|date=April 2019}} always seemed to be naturally defended to the point where it overcame the criticism. However, to later scholars in the field{{When|date=April 2019}}, it was evident that cultural influences dominate map-making.<ref name=Harley/> For instance, certain abstracts on maps and the map-making society itself describe the social influences on the production of maps.

Through this, maps made European commerce in Africa possible by showing potential commercial routes and made natural resource extraction possible by depicting locations of resources. Such maps also enabled military conquests and made them more efficient, and imperial nations further used them to put their conquests on display. These same maps were then used to cement territorial claims, such as at the [[Berlin Conference]] of 1884\u20131885.<ref name=\"Basset\" />\n\nBefore 1749, maps of the African continent had African kingdoms drawn with assumed or contrived boundaries, with unknown or unexplored areas having drawings of animals, imaginary physical geographic features, and descriptive texts. In 1748, Jean B. B. d'Anville created the first map of the African continent that had blank spaces to represent the unknown territory.<ref name=\"Basset\" /> This was revolutionary in cartography and the representation of power associated with map making.{{Why|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Map types==\n\n===General vs. thematic cartography===\n[[File:Orienteringskort bygholm 2005 detail.jpg|thumb|Small section of an orienteering map.]]\n[[File:Easter Island map-en.svg|thumb|Topographic map of [[Easter Island]].]]\n[[File:Maps-for-free Sierra Nevada.png|thumb|Relief map [[Sierra Nevada (Spain)|Sierra Nevada]]]]\n\nIn understanding basic maps, the field of cartography can be divided into two general categories: general cartography and thematic cartography. General cartography involves those maps that are constructed for a general audience and thus contain a variety of features. General maps exhibit many reference and location systems and often are produced in a series. For example, the 1:24,000 scale topographic maps of the [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) are a standard as compared to the 1:50,000 scale Canadian maps. The government of the UK produces the classic 1:50,000 (replacing the older 1&nbsp;inch to 1 mile) \"[[Ordnance Survey]]\" maps of the entire UK and with a range of correlated larger- and smaller-scale maps of great detail. Many private mapping companies have also produced thematic map series.\n\n[[Thematic map|Thematic cartography]] involves maps of specific geographic themes, oriented toward specific audiences. A couple of examples might be a [[Thematic map#Dot|dot map]] showing corn production in Indiana or a shaded area map of Ohio counties, divided into numerical [[Choropleth map|choropleth]] classes. As the volume of geographic data has exploded over the last century, thematic cartography has become increasingly useful and necessary to interpret spatial, cultural and social data.\n\nA third type of map is known as an \"orienteering,\" or special purpose map. This type of map falls somewhere between thematic and general maps. They combine general map elements with thematic attributes in order to design a map with a specific audience in mind. Oftentimes, the type of audience an orienteering map is made for is in a particular industry or occupation. An example of this kind of map would be a municipal utility map.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog486/node/1848|title=Cartography and Visualization Part I: Types of Maps|last=Dutton|first=John|date=|website=Penn State University E-Education|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n===Topographic vs. topological===\nA [[topographic map]] is primarily concerned with the [[topography|topographic]] description of a place, including (especially in the 20th and 21st centuries) the use of [[contour line]]s showing elevation. [[Terrain]] or relief can be shown in a variety of ways (see [[Cartographic relief depiction]]). In the present era, one of the most widespread and advanced methods used to form topographic maps is to use computer software to generate [[digital elevation model]]s which show shaded relief. Before such software existed, cartographers had to draw shaded relief by hand. One cartographer who is respected as a master of hand-drawn shaded relief is the Swiss professor Eduard Imhof whose efforts in hill shading were so influential that his method became used around the world despite it being so labor-intensive.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kennelly|first=Patrick|date=2006|title=A Uniform Sky Illumination Model to Enhance Shading of Terrain and Urban Areas|journal=Cartography and Geographic Information Science|volume=33|pages=21\u201336|doi=10.1559/152304006777323118|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/b7254610b5f6f23f536576bf01f0cc60d40f7cb1}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://icaci.org/eduard-imhof-1895-1986/|title=Eduard Imhof (1895\u20131986)|last=Ormeling|first=F.J.|date=1986-12-31|website=International Cartographic Association|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nA [[topological map]] is a very general type of map, the kind one might sketch on a napkin. It often disregards scale and detail in the interest of clarity of communicating specific route or relational information. [[Harry Beck|Beck's]] [[Tube map|London Underground map]] is an iconic example. Although the most widely used map of \"The Tube,\" it preserves little of reality: it varies scale constantly and abruptly, it straightens curved tracks, and it contorts directions. The only topography on it is the [[River Thames]], letting the reader know whether a station is north or south of the river. That and the topology of station order and interchanges between train lines are all that is left of the geographic space.<ref name=Ovenden>{{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5| pages=22, 60, 131, 132, 135}}</ref> Yet those are all a typical passenger wishes to know, so the map fulfills its purpose.<ref>{{cite book |author=Devlin, Keith |title=The Millennium Problems |url=https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit |url-access=registration |location=New York, New York |publisher=Basic Books |year=2002 |pages=[https://archive.org/details/millenniumproble00keit/page/162 162\u2013163] |isbn=978-0-465-01730-0}}</ref>\n\n==Map design==\n[[File:Livingston-Greenwich-map.jpg|thumb|right|Illustrated map.]]\n\n===Map purpose and selection of information===\n[[Arthur H.

Information richness or a map that is multivariate shows relationships within the map. Showing several variables allows comparison, which adds to the meaningfulness of the map. This also generates hypothesis and stimulates ideas and perhaps further research. In order to convey the message of the map, the creator must design it in a manner which will aid the reader in the overall understanding of its purpose. The title of a map may provide the \"needed link\" necessary for communicating that message, but the overall design of the map fosters the manner in which the reader interprets it.<ref>{{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}} p.&nbsp;93</ref>\n\nIn the 21st century it is possible to find a map of virtually anything from the inner workings of the [[human body]] to the [[virtual world]]s of [[cyberspace]]. Therefore, there are now a huge variety of different styles and types of map \u2013 for example, one area which has evolved a specific and recognisable variation are those used by [[public transport]] organisations to guide [[passenger]]s, namely [[urban rail and metro maps]], many of which are loosely based on 45 degree angles as originally perfected by [[Harry Beck]] and [[George Dow]].\n\n==== Cartographic process ====\n[[File:The Cartographic Process.png|thumb|]]The cartographic process begins with a real or imagined environment or setting. As map makers gather data on the subject they are mapping (usually through technology and/or remote sensing), they begin to recognize and detect patterns that can be used to arrange the data for map creation (i.e., they think about the data and its patterns as well as how to best visualize them on a map). After this, the cartographer compiles the data and experiments with the many different methods of map design and production (including [[Cartographic generalization|generalization]], [[Symbol|symbolization]], and other production methods) in an attempt to encode and portray the data on a map that will allow the map user to decode and interpret the map in the way that matches the intended purpose of the map maker. Next, the user of the map reads and analyzes the map by recognizing and interpreting the symbols and patterns that are found on the map. This leads the user to take action and draw conclusions based on the information that they find on the map. In this way, maps help shape how we view the world based on the spatial perspectives and viewpoints that they help create in our mind.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.e-education.psu.edu/geog160/node/1882|title=3.1 The Cartographic Process {{!}} GEOG 160: Mapping our Changing World|website=www.e-education.psu.edu|access-date=2019-12-14}}</ref>\n\n===Naming conventions===\n{{main|Toponymy|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps use text to [[Labeling (map design)|label]] places and for such things as the map title, legend and other information. Although maps are often made in one specific language, place names often differ between languages. So a map made in English may use the name ''Germany'' for that country, while a German map would use ''Deutschland'' and a French map ''Allemagne''. A non-native term for a place is referred to as an [[exonym]].\n\nIn some cases the correct name is not clear. For example, the nation of Burma officially changed its name to [[Myanmar]], but many nations do not recognize the ruling junta and continue to use ''Burma''. Sometimes an official name change is resisted in other languages and the older name may remain in common use. Examples include the use of ''Saigon'' for [[Ho Chi Minh City]], ''Bangkok'' for [[Bangkok|Krung Thep]] and ''Ivory Coast'' for [[Ivory Coast|C\u00f4te d'Ivoire]].\n\nDifficulties arise when [[transliteration]] or [[Transcription (linguistics)|transcription]] between [[writing system]]s is required. Some well-known places have well-established names in other languages and writing systems, such as ''Russia'' or ''Ru\u00dfland'' for \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u0301\u044f, but in other cases a system of transliteration or transcription is required. Even in the former case, the exclusive use of an exonym may be unhelpful for the map user. It will not be much use for an English user of a map of Italy to show Livorno ''only'' as \"Leghorn\" when road signs and railway timetables show it as \"Livorno\". In transliteration, the characters in one script are represented by characters in another. For example, the [[Cyrillic]] letter ''\u0420'' is usually written as ''R'' in the [[Latin script]], although in many cases it is not as simple as a one-for-one equivalence. Systems exist for transliteration of [[Arabic script|Arabic]], but the results may vary. For example, the Yemeni city of [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]] is written variously in English as Mocha, Al Mukha, al-Mukh\u0101, Mocca and Moka. Transliteration systems are based on relating written symbols to one another, while transcription is the attempt to spell in one language the phonetic sounds of another. Chinese writing is now usually converted to the Latin alphabet through the [[Pinyin]] phonetic transcription systems. Other systems were used in the past, such as [[Wade-Giles]], resulting in the city being spelled ''Beijing'' on newer English maps and ''Peking'' on older ones.\n\nFurther difficulties arise when countries, especially former colonies, do not have a strong national geographic naming standard. In such cases, cartographers may have to choose between various phonetic spellings of local names versus older imposed, sometimes resented, colonial names. Some countries have multiple official languages, resulting in multiple official placenames. For example, the capital of Belgium is both ''Brussel'' and ''Bruxelles''. In Canada, English and French are official languages and places have names in both languages. [[British Columbia]] is also officially named ''la Colombie-Britannique''. English maps rarely show the French names outside of Quebec, which itself is spelled ''Qu\u00e9bec'' in French.<ref>{{cite book |title=Illustrated Atlas of the World |publisher=[[Rand McNally]] |year=1992 |isbn=978-0-528-83492-9}}</ref>[[File:Legenda Michelin kaart 1940.jpg|thumb|Legend or key of a Belgian road map (Michelin 1940)]]\n\nThe study of placenames is called [[toponymy]], while that of the origin and historical usage of placenames as words is [[etymology]].\n\nIn order to improve legibility or to aid the illiterate, some maps have been produced using pictograms to represent places. The iconic example of this practice is [[Lance Wyman]]'s early plans for the [[Mexico City Metro]], on which stations were shown simply as stylized logos. Wyman also prototyped such a map for the [[Washington Metro]], though ultimately the idea was rejected. Other cities experimenting with such maps are [[Fukuoka]], [[Guadalajara]] and [[Monterrey]].<ref name=\"Ovenden\" />\n\n===Map symbology===\n{{main | Map symbol}}\nCartographic [[symbology]] encodes information on the map in ways intended to convey information to the map reader efficiently, taking into consideration the limited space on the map, models of human understanding through visual means, and the likely cultural background and education of the map reader. Symbology may be implicit, using universal elements of design, or may be more specific to cartography or even to the map.\n\nA map may have any of many kinds of symbolization. The following list provides some examples. These items are also elements of [[Page layout (cartography)|map layout.]]\n\n* A [[Page layout (cartography)#Legend|legend]], or key, explains the map's pictorial language.\n* A title indicates the region and perhaps the theme that the map portrays.\n* A neatline frames the entire map image.\n* A [[compass rose]] or north arrow provides orientation.\n* An overview map gives global context for the primary map.\n* A [[bar scale]] translates between map measurements and real distances.\n* A map projection provides a way to represent the curved surface on the plane of the map.\n\nThe map may declare its sources, accuracy, publication date and authorship, and so forth. The map image itself portrays the region.\n\n[[Map coloring]] is another form of symbology, one whose importance can reach beyond aesthetic. In complex thematic maps, for example, the color scheme's structure can critically affect the reader's ability to understand the map's information. Modern computer displays and print technologies can reproduce much of the [[gamut]] that humans can perceive, allowing for intricate exploitation of human visual discrimination in order to convey detailed information.\n\nQuantitative symbols give a visual indication of the magnitude of the phenomenon that the symbol represents. Two major classes of symbols are used to portray quantity. Proportional symbols change size according to phenomenon's magnitude, making them appropriate for representing statistics. [[Choropleth map]]s portray data collection areas, such as counties or census tracts, with color. Using color this way, the darkness and intensity (or value) of the color is evaluated by the eye as a measure of intensity or concentration.\n\n=====Examples of point symbols=====\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- class=\"hintergrundfarbe6\"\n! Symbol\n! Explanation\n|--\n|[[File:Schlaegel und Eisen nach DIN 21800.svg|26px]] [[File:Schlaegel und Eisen nach DIN 21800 gedreht um 180 Grad.svg|26px]]\n|[[mining|mine]] ([[Hammer and pick]] symbol), former mine\n|--\n|[[File:Gfi-set01-castle.png]] [[File:Gfi-set01-castle1.png]]\n|[[castle]], [[Burh|Burg]]\n|--\n|[[File:Set01-church.svg]] [[File:Set01-church1.svg]]\n|[[church (building)|church]], [[chapel]], [[monastery]] ([[\u2641]])\n|--\n|[[File:Gfi-set01-memorial.png]]\n|[[monument]]\n|--\n|[[File:Gfi-set01-hostel.svg]]\n|[[Hotel]]\n|--\n|[[File:Gfi-set01-airport.png]] [[File:Gfi-set01-airport1.png]]\n|[[airport]]\n|--\n|[[File:Gfi-set01-railway.png]] [[File:Gfi-set01-railway1.png]]\n|[[railway station]]\n|--\n|[[File:Gfi-set01-info.png]] [[File:Info Simple.svg|32px]]\n|[[Tourist information]]\n|}\n\n===Map labeling===\n{{main|Cartographic labeling}}\nMost maps label features so that the map reader can know features' names. For example, country names may be printed on a world map, each label within the outline of the country it names. Features and background may be in any color, which can make reading labels printed over them harder to read than reading text from a book.<ref>Jill Saligoe-Simmel,[https://www.drjill.net/map-fonts-article-1-the-basics-of-typography-for-cartography/ \"Using Text on Maps: Typography in Cartography\"]</ref> Two traits of good labels are legibility and easy feature association. In order for a label to be legible, it must have a type, size and color that are easy to read. Ideally, a label would not interfere with other map features or labels. A halo may be placed around the label to contrast it against the background. A label must also be easily associated with the feature it names, regardless of the feature's category or extent. Choosing a location for a label to enhance this association while avoiding clutter and conflict with other labels is an art that incorporates many techniques. One technique is to use a different font per category of feature. For example, using an italicized, dark blue font for a water label can suggest waves. Or, labels for contour lines can be thin and have the same color as the contours. In difficult cases where there is not enough space to place the label near the feature to form an unambiguous association, a leader line can connect the label to the feature.\n\n===Map generalization===\n{{main|Cartographic generalization}}\nA good map has to compromise between portraying the items of interest (or [[thematic map|themes]]) in the right place on the map, and the need to show that item using text or a symbol, which take up space on the map and might displace some other item of information. The cartographer is thus constantly making judgements about what to include, what to leave out and what to show in a ''slightly'' incorrect place. This issue assumes more importance as the scale of the map gets smaller (i.e. the map shows a larger area) because the information shown on the map takes up more space ''on the ground''. A good example from the late 1980s was the [[Ordnance Survey]]'s first digital maps, where the ''absolute'' positions of major roads were sometimes a scale distance of hundreds of meters away from [[ground truth]], when shown on digital maps at scales of 1:250,000 and 1:625,000, because of the overriding need to annotate the features.\n\n===Map projections===\n{{comparison_of_cartography_surface_development.svg|300px}}\n{{main|Map projection}}\n\nThe Earth being spherical, any flat representation generates distortions such that shapes and areas cannot both be conserved simultaneously, and distances can never all be preserved.<ref name=\"Albrecht 2005\">{{cite web|url=http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/lectures/lec6concepts/map%20coordinate%20systems/how%20to%20choose%20a%20projection.htm|last=Albrecht|first=Jochen|series=[http://www.geo.hunter.cuny.edu/~jochen/gtech201/201syllabusSp05.htm Introduction to Mapping Sciences, 2005]|title=Maps projections|accessdate=2013-08-13}}</ref> The mapmaker must choose a suitable ''map projection'' according to the space to be mapped and the purpose of the map.\n\n==Cartographic errors==\nSome maps contain deliberate errors or distortions, either as [[Cartographic propaganda|propaganda]] or as a \"[[watermark]]\" to help the copyright owner identify infringement if the error appears in competitors' maps. The latter often come in the form of nonexistent, misnamed, or misspelled \"[[trap streets]]\".<ref>{{cite book | last = Monmonier | first = Mark | title = How to Lie with Maps | publisher = University of Chicago Press | location = Chicago | year = 1996 | isbn = 978-0-226-53421-3 | page = 51 |editor=2nd.}}</ref> Other names and forms for this are [[paper townsite]]s, [[fictitious entry|fictitious entries]], and copyright [[Easter egg (media)|easter eggs]].<ref>[https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Copyright_Easter_Eggs Openstreetmap.org Copyright Easter Eggs]</ref>\n\nAnother motive for deliberate errors is cartographic \"vandalism\": a mapmaker wishing to leave his or her mark on the work. Mount Richard, for example, was a fictitious peak on the [[Rocky Mountains]]' [[continental divide]] that appeared on a [[Boulder County, Colorado]] map in the early 1970s. It is believed to be the work of draftsman Richard Ciacci. The fiction was not discovered until two years later.\n\n[[Sandy Island (New Caledonia)]] is an example of a fictitious location that stubbornly survives, reappearing on new maps copied from older maps while being deleted from other new editions.\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Main|Outline of cartography}}\n{{div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Animated mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Cartogram}}\n* {{annotated link|Terrain cartography|aka=Cartographic relief depiction}}\n* {{annotated link|City map}}\n* {{annotated link|Counter-mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Critical cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Fantasy map}}\n* {{annotated link|Figure-ground in map design}}\n* {{annotated link|Geoinformatics}}\n* {{annotated link|Geovisualization}}\n* {{annotated link|Geo warping}}\n* {{annotated link|History of cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|History of Cartography Project}}\n* {{annotated link|List of cartographers}}\n* {{annotated link|Locator map}}\n* {{annotated link|OpenStreetMap}}\n* {{annotated link|Pictorial map}}\n* {{annotated link|Planetary cartography}}\n* {{annotated link|Seafloor mapping}}\n* {{annotated link|Scribing (cartography)}}\n* {{annotated link|Toponymy}}\n* {{annotated link|World map}}\n* {{annotated link|Page layout (cartography)}}\n<!-- The article titled ''{{annotated link|great circle distance}}'' explains how to find that quantity if one knows the two latitudes and longitudes. -->\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|32em}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* {{cite book |last=Ovenden |first=Mark |authorlink=Mark Ovenden |title=Transit Maps of the World |location=New York, New York |publisher=[[Penguin Books]] |year=2007 |isbn=978-0-14-311265-5 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n;Mapmaking\n* {{cite book |author=MacEachren, A.M. |title=Some Truth with Maps: A Primer on Symbolization & Design |location=University Park |publisher=The Pennsylvania State University |year=1994 |isbn=978-0-89291-214-8}}\n* {{cite book |author=Monmonier, Mark |title=Mapping It Out |location=Chicago |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |year=1993 |isbn=978-0-226-53417-6}}\n* {{cite book |author1=Kraak, Menno-Jan  |author2=Ormeling, Ferjan |title=Cartography: Visualization of Spatial Data |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-13-088890-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Peterson, Michael P. |title=Interactive and Animated Cartography |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=1995 |isbn=978-0-13-079104-7}}\n* {{cite book |author=Slocum, T. |title=Thematic Cartography and Geographic Visualization |location=Upper Saddle River, New Jersey |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-13-035123-4}}\n\n;History\n* {{cite book |title=Mapping the World: An Illustrated History of Cartography |author=Ralph E Ehrenberg |publisher=National Geographic |date=October 11, 2005 |page=[https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 256] |isbn=978-0-7922-6525-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/mappingworldillu00ehre/page/256 }}\n* {{cite book |author=[[John Brian Harley|J.

We glimpse the lives of five women, each facing problems such as loneliness, dissatisfaction, longing, and or desire.\n\nIn the film's prologue, Kathy ([[Amy Brenneman]])\u2014a police detective\u2014and her partner are investigating the apparent suicide of an unknown woman. Dr. Keener ([[Glenn Close]]), a middle-aged doctor, attempts to care for her aging mother while coping with her own loneliness. She avoids intimacy, but also longs for it; we see both frustration and anticipation as she waits for phone calls from male colleagues. Dr. Keener decides to seek comfort or escape in Christine ([[Calista Flockhart]]) who reads tarot cards. Christine's partner Lilly ([[Valeria Golino]]) is critically ill with an unnamed disease, possibly cancer.\n\nRebecca ([[Holly Hunter]]) is a successful bank manager who's \"not big on regrets\". After a three-year involvement with married Robert ([[Gregory Hines]]}, she becomes pregnant. Before Rebecca visits Dr. Keener to get an abortion, she has a fling with Walter, ([[Matt Craven]]), a subordinate.\n\nRose ([[Kathy Baker]]) is a single mother who is writing children's books. She develops a sweet crush on a new little-person neighbor ([[Danny Woodburn]]), who catches Rose spying on him. Rose later experiences the shock of learning about her son's extensive sexual activity.\n\nKathy's sister, Carol Faber ([[Cameron Diaz]]), is a lovely blind woman who has an active social life. Kathy is attracted to the medical examiner in the suicide case, and her story ends with him taking her out on a date. In an epilogue, Dr. Keener drops into a bar, where she meets the male character, Walter, from previous stories (possibly the younger male alluded to in Christine's tarot card reading).\n\nCarmen, a woman who appears in five scenes in the five different stories, the first is walking past Dr. Keener's house, another is walking beside Rebecca, a third time is in the grocery store while Rose is shopping, the fourth time is walking past Christine's apartment building at night as Christine looks down from her balcony, and the final time is the [[Autopsy|post mortem]] examination by detective Kathy alongside Dr. Sam ([[Miguel Sandoval]]). Carol's imaginative story towards the end of the film helps explain the instances throughout the movie where she appears. According to Carol, she was back in town to reconnect with her ex, whom she had been talking to for months until her move back to Los Angeles. In each scene, she is, as Carol deduces, preparing for the big date with her ex. In the first scene she is in, she is probably looking for a place to rent; the second, she is seen carrying her ill-fated red dress; the third she is shopping for toiletries; the fourth she is seen walking back to her place, in which she looks visibly heartbroken, and final scene, in the coroners lab, echoes the beginning of the film, where she is found dead. Carol's story ends with what Kathy already concluded, she committed suicide over a love she, as Carol claims, could not revive, like the baby she had lost many years before.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Glenn Close]] \u2013 Dr. Elaine Keener\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] \u2013 Carol Faber \n* [[Calista Flockhart]] \u2013 Christine Taylor \n* [[Kathy Baker]] \u2013 Rose\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] \u2013 Detective Kathy Faber\n* [[Valeria Golino]] \u2013 Lilly\n* [[Holly Hunter]] \u2013 Rebecca Waynon\n* [[Matt Craven]] \u2013 Walter\n* [[Gregory Hines]] \u2013 Robert\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] \u2013 Sam\n* [[Noah Fleiss]] \u2013 Jay\n* [[Danny Woodburn]] \u2013 Albert\n* [[Penelope Allen]] \u2013 Nancy\n* [[Roma Maffia]] \u2013 Debbie\n* [[Mika Boorem]] \u2013 June\n\n== Production ==\nLine producer for this film was [[Effie T.

Carol's story ends with what Kathy already concluded, she committed suicide over a love she, as Carol claims, could not revive, like the baby she had lost many years before.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Glenn Close]] \u2013 Dr. Elaine Keener\n* [[Cameron Diaz]] \u2013 Carol Faber \n* [[Calista Flockhart]] \u2013 Christine Taylor \n* [[Kathy Baker]] \u2013 Rose\n* [[Amy Brenneman]] \u2013 Detective Kathy Faber\n* [[Valeria Golino]] \u2013 Lilly\n* [[Holly Hunter]] \u2013 Rebecca Waynon\n* [[Matt Craven]] \u2013 Walter\n* [[Gregory Hines]] \u2013 Robert\n* [[Miguel Sandoval]] \u2013 Sam\n* [[Noah Fleiss]] \u2013 Jay\n* [[Danny Woodburn]] \u2013 Albert\n* [[Penelope Allen]] \u2013 Nancy\n* [[Roma Maffia]] \u2013 Debbie\n* [[Mika Boorem]] \u2013 June\n\n== Production ==\nLine producer for this film was [[Effie T.

In fact, there is enormous diversity in [[Single-nucleotide polymorphism|SNP]] frequency between genes, reflecting different selective pressures on each gene as well as different mutation and recombination rates across the genome. However, studies on SNPs are biased towards coding regions, the data generated from them are unlikely to reflect the overall distribution of SNPs throughout the genome. Therefore, the [[SNP Consortium]] protocol was designed to identify SNPs with no bias towards coding regions and the Consortium's 100,000 SNPs generally reflect sequence diversity across the human chromosomes.The [[SNP Consortium]] aims to expand the number of SNPs identified across the genome to 300 000 by the end of the first quarter of 2001.<ref>{{cite journal |pmid=11005795 | volume=9 | issue=16 | title=Single nucleotide polymorphisms as tools in human genetics | year=2000 | journal=Hum.

Some inherited variation influences aspects of our biology that are not medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc.). Moreover, some genetic disorders only cause disease in combination with the appropriate environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders may be described as clinically defined diseases caused by genomic DNA sequence variation. In the most straightforward cases, the disorder can be associated with variation in a single gene. For example, [[cystic fibrosis]] is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1,300 different mutations known.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hamosh|first=Ada|last2=Scott|first2=Alan F.|last3=Amberger|first3=Joanna|last4=Bocchini|first4=Carol|last5=Valle|first5=David|last6=McKusick|first6=Victor A.|date=2002-01-01|title=Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a knowledgebase of human genes and genetic disorders|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11752252|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=1|pages=52\u201355|doi=10.1093/nar/30.1.52|issn=1362-4962|pmid=11752252}}</ref>\n\nDisease-causing mutations in specific genes are usually severe in terms of gene function and are fortunately rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they constitute a significant component of known medical conditions, especially in pediatric medicine. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified. Currently there are approximately 2,200 such disorders annotated in the [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|OMIM]] database.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStudies of genetic disorders are often performed by means of family-based studies. In some instances, population based approaches are employed, particularly in the case of so-called founder populations such as those in Finland, French-Canada, Utah, Sardinia, etc. Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders are usually performed by a [[geneticist]]-physician trained in clinical/medical genetics. The results of the [[Human Genome Project]] are likely to provide increased availability of [[genetic testing]] for gene-related disorders, and eventually improved treatment. Parents can be screened for hereditary conditions and [[Genetic counseling|counselled]] on the consequences, the probability of inheritance, and how to avoid or ameliorate it in their offspring.\n\nThere are many different kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e., has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.\n\nWith the advent of the Human Genome and [[International HapMap Project]], it has become feasible to explore subtle genetic influences on many common disease conditions such as diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc. Although some causal links have been made between genomic sequence variants in particular genes and some of these diseases, often with much publicity in the general media, these are usually not considered to be genetic disorders ''per se'' as their causes are complex, involving many different genetic and environmental factors. Thus there may be disagreement in particular cases whether a specific medical condition should be termed a genetic disorder.\n\nAdditional genetic disorders of mention are [[Kallmann syndrome|Kallman syndrome]] and [[Pfeiffer syndrome]] (gene FGFR1), [[Fuchs' dystrophy|Fuchs corneal dystrophy]] (gene TCF4), [[Hirschsprung's disease]] (genes RET and FECH), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (genes CCDC28B and BBS1), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 (gene BBS10), and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (genes D4Z4 and SMCHD1).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Katsanis|first=Nicholas|date=2016-11-17|title=The continuum of causality in human genetic disorders|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1107-9|journal=Genome Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=233|doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1107-9|issn=1474-760X|pmc=5114767|pmid=27855690}}</ref>\n\nGenome sequencing is now able to narrow the genome down to specific locations to more accurately find mutations that will result in a genetic disorder.

Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression and one of the most highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA methylation profile experiences dramatic changes. In early germ line cells, the genome has very low methylation levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased methylation activity.<ref name=\"pmid17320514\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Misteli T | title = Beyond the sequence: cellular organization of genome function | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 787\u2013800 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17320514 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.028 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17320505\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein BE, Meissner A, Lander ES | title = The mammalian epigenome | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 669\u201381 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17320505 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.033 }}</ref>\n\nEpigenetic patterns can be identified between tissues within an individual as well as between individuals themselves. Identical genes that have differences only in their epigenetic state are called '''epialleles'''. Epialleles can be placed into three categories: those directly determined by an individual's genotype, those influenced by genotype, and those entirely independent of genotype. The epigenome is also influenced significantly by environmental factors. Diet, toxins, and hormones impact the epigenetic state. Studies in dietary manipulation have demonstrated that methyl-deficient diets are associated with hypomethylation of the epigenome.

These are all large linear DNA molecules contained within the cell nucleus. The genome also includes the [[mitochondrial DNA]], a comparatively small circular molecule present in each [[mitochondrion]].

Such populations include Pakistan, Iceland, and Amish populations. These populations with a high level of parental-relatedness have been subjects of human knock out research which has helped to determine the function of specific genes in humans. By distinguishing specific knockouts, researchers are able to use phenotypic analyses of these individuals to help characterize the gene that has been knocked out.\n\n[[File:Consanguineous Mating resulting in Knockout.jpg|thumb|A pedigree displaying a first-cousin mating (carriers both carrying heterozygous knockouts mating as marked by double line) leading to offspring possessing a homozygous gene knockout.]]\n\nKnockouts in specific genes can cause genetic diseases, potentially have beneficial effects, or even result in no phenotypic effect at all.  However, determining a knockout's phenotypic effect and in humans can be challenging. Challenges to characterizing and clinically interpreting knockouts include difficulty calling of DNA variants, determining disruption of protein function (annotation), and considering the amount of influence [[mosaicism]] has on the phenotype.<ref name=\"Narasimhan VM 2016\"/>\n\nOne major study that investigated human knockouts is the Pakistan Risk of Myocardial Infarction study. It was found that individuals possessing a heterozygous loss-of-function gene knockout for the [[APOC3]] gene had lower triglycerides in the blood after consuming a high fat meal as compared to individuals without the mutation. However, individuals possessing homozygous loss-of-function gene knockouts of the APOC3 gene displayed the lowest level of triglycerides in the blood after the fat load test, as they produce no functional APOC3 protein.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Saleheen D, Natarajan P, Armean IM, Zhao W, Rasheed A, Khetarpal SA, Won HH, Karczewski KJ, O'Donnell-Luria AH, Samocha KE, Weisburd B, Gupta N, Zaidi M, Samuel M, Imran A, Abbas S, Majeed F, Ishaq M, Akhtar S, Trindade K, Mucksavage M, Qamar N, Zaman KS, Yaqoob Z, Saghir T, Rizvi SN, Memon A, Hayyat Mallick N, Ishaq M, Rasheed SZ, Memon FU, Mahmood K, Ahmed N, Do R, Krauss RM, MacArthur DG, Gabriel S, Lander ES, Daly MJ, Frossard P, Danesh J, Rader DJ, Kathiresan S  | display-authors = 6 | title = Human knockouts and phenotypic analysis in a cohort with a high rate of consanguinity | journal = Nature | volume = 544 | issue = 7649 | pages = 235\u2013239 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28406212 | pmc = 5600291 | doi = 10.1038/nature22034 | bibcode = 2017Natur.544..235S }}</ref>\n\n== Human genetic disorders ==\n{{details|Genetic disorder}}\n\nMost aspects of human biology involve both genetic (inherited) and non-genetic (environmental) factors. Some inherited variation influences aspects of our biology that are not medical in nature (height, eye color, ability to taste or smell certain compounds, etc.). Moreover, some genetic disorders only cause disease in combination with the appropriate environmental factors (such as diet). With these caveats, genetic disorders may be described as clinically defined diseases caused by genomic DNA sequence variation. In the most straightforward cases, the disorder can be associated with variation in a single gene. For example, [[cystic fibrosis]] is caused by mutations in the CFTR gene and is the most common recessive disorder in caucasian populations with over 1,300 different mutations known.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Hamosh|first=Ada|last2=Scott|first2=Alan F.|last3=Amberger|first3=Joanna|last4=Bocchini|first4=Carol|last5=Valle|first5=David|last6=McKusick|first6=Victor A.|date=2002-01-01|title=Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), a knowledgebase of human genes and genetic disorders|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11752252|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|volume=30|issue=1|pages=52\u201355|doi=10.1093/nar/30.1.52|issn=1362-4962|pmid=11752252}}</ref>\n\nDisease-causing mutations in specific genes are usually severe in terms of gene function and are fortunately rare, thus genetic disorders are similarly individually rare. However, since there are many genes that can vary to cause genetic disorders, in aggregate they constitute a significant component of known medical conditions, especially in pediatric medicine. Molecularly characterized genetic disorders are those for which the underlying causal gene has been identified. Currently there are approximately 2,200 such disorders annotated in the [[Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man|OMIM]] database.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nStudies of genetic disorders are often performed by means of family-based studies. In some instances, population based approaches are employed, particularly in the case of so-called founder populations such as those in Finland, French-Canada, Utah, Sardinia, etc. Diagnosis and treatment of genetic disorders are usually performed by a [[geneticist]]-physician trained in clinical/medical genetics. The results of the [[Human Genome Project]] are likely to provide increased availability of [[genetic testing]] for gene-related disorders, and eventually improved treatment. Parents can be screened for hereditary conditions and [[Genetic counseling|counselled]] on the consequences, the probability of inheritance, and how to avoid or ameliorate it in their offspring.\n\nThere are many different kinds of DNA sequence variation, ranging from complete extra or missing chromosomes down to single nucleotide changes. It is generally presumed that much naturally occurring genetic variation in human populations is phenotypically neutral, i.e., has little or no detectable effect on the physiology of the individual (although there may be fractional differences in fitness defined over evolutionary time frames). Genetic disorders can be caused by any or all known types of sequence variation. To molecularly characterize a new genetic disorder, it is necessary to establish a causal link between a particular genomic sequence variant and the clinical disease under investigation. Such studies constitute the realm of human molecular genetics.\n\nWith the advent of the Human Genome and [[International HapMap Project]], it has become feasible to explore subtle genetic influences on many common disease conditions such as diabetes, asthma, migraine, schizophrenia, etc. Although some causal links have been made between genomic sequence variants in particular genes and some of these diseases, often with much publicity in the general media, these are usually not considered to be genetic disorders ''per se'' as their causes are complex, involving many different genetic and environmental factors. Thus there may be disagreement in particular cases whether a specific medical condition should be termed a genetic disorder.\n\nAdditional genetic disorders of mention are [[Kallmann syndrome|Kallman syndrome]] and [[Pfeiffer syndrome]] (gene FGFR1), [[Fuchs' dystrophy|Fuchs corneal dystrophy]] (gene TCF4), [[Hirschsprung's disease]] (genes RET and FECH), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 1 (genes CCDC28B and BBS1), Bardet-Biedl syndrome 10 (gene BBS10), and facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy type 2 (genes D4Z4 and SMCHD1).<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Katsanis|first=Nicholas|date=2016-11-17|title=The continuum of causality in human genetic disorders|url=https://doi.org/10.1186/s13059-016-1107-9|journal=Genome Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=233|doi=10.1186/s13059-016-1107-9|issn=1474-760X|pmc=PMC5114767|pmid=27855690}}</ref>\n\nGenome sequencing is now able to narrow the genome down to specific locations to more accurately find mutations that will result in a genetic disorder.

This only analyzes a small portion of the genome, around 1-2%. The results of this sequencing can be used for clinical diagnosis of a genetic condition, including [[Usher syndrome]], retinal disease, hearing impairments, diabetes, epilepsy, [[Leigh syndrome|Leigh disease]], hereditary cancers, neuromuscular diseases, primary immunodeficiencies, [[severe combined immunodeficiency]] (SCID), and diseases of the mitochondria.<ref>{{Citation|last=Wong|first=Lee-Jun C.|title=Overview of the Clinical Utility of Next Generation Sequencing in Molecular Diagnoses of Human Genetic Disorders|date=2017|url=https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-56418-0_1|work=Next Generation Sequencing Based Clinical Molecular Diagnosis of Human Genetic Disorders|pages=1\u201311|editor-last=Wong|editor-first=Lee-Jun C.|publisher=Springer International Publishing|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-56418-0_1|isbn=978-3-319-56418-0|access-date=2020-04-03}}</ref> NGS can also be used to identify carriers of diseases before conception.

Epigenetic markers strengthen and weaken transcription of certain genes but do not affect the actual sequence of DNA nucleotides. DNA methylation is a major form of epigenetic control over gene expression and one of the most highly studied topics in epigenetics. During development, the human DNA methylation profile experiences dramatic changes. In early germ line cells, the genome has very low methylation levels. These low levels generally describe active genes. As development progresses, parental imprinting tags lead to increased methylation activity.<ref name=\"pmid17320514\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Misteli T | title = Beyond the sequence: cellular organization of genome function | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 787\u2013800 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17320514 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.028 }}</ref><ref name=\"pmid17320505\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Bernstein BE, Meissner A, Lander ES | title = The mammalian epigenome | journal = Cell | volume = 128 | issue = 4 | pages = 669\u201381 | date = Feb 2007 | pmid = 17320505 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2007.01.033 }}</ref>\n\nEpigenetic patterns can be identified between tissues within an individual as well as between individuals themselves. Identical genes that have differences only in their epigenetic state are called '''epialleles'''. Epialleles can be placed into three categories: those directly determined by an individual's genotype, those influenced by genotype, and those entirely independent of genotype. The epigenome is also influenced significantly by environmental factors. Diet, toxins, and hormones impact the epigenetic state. Studies in dietary manipulation have demonstrated that methyl-deficient diets are associated with hypomethylation of the epigenome. Such studies establish epigenetics as an important interface between the environment and the genome.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Scheen AJ, Junien C | title = [Epigenetics, interface between environment and genes: role in complex diseases] | journal = Revue M\u00e9dicale de Li\u00e8ge | volume = 67 | issue = 5\u20136 | pages = 250\u20137 | date = May\u2013Jun 2012 | pmid = 22891475 }}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Genetics]]\n* [[Genomics]]\n* [[Genographic Project]]\n* [[Genomic organization]]\n* [[Low copy repeats]]\n* [[Non-coding DNA]]\n* [[Whole genome sequencing]]\n* [[Universal Declaration on the Human Genome and Human Rights]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Wikiquote}}\n{{Commonscat}}\n*[http://www.ensembl.org/ Ensembl] The [[Ensembl]] Genome Browser Project\n*[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?taxid=9606 National Library of Medicine human genome viewer]\n*[http://genome.ucsc.edu/ UCSC Genome Browser].\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130102065343/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/info.shtml Human Genome Project].\n*[http://www.genome.gov/ The National Human Genome Research Institute]*[https://www.cdc.gov/genomics/default.htm The National Office of Public Health Genomics]\n*[https://grrreggg.github.io/gene/ Simple Human Genome viewer]\n\n{{Chromosomes}}\n{{Human genetics}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=August 2019}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Human Genome}}\n[[Category:Genetic mapping]]\n[[Category:Genomics]]\n[[Category:Human genetics|Genome]]\n[[Category:Human evolution|Genome]]\n[[Category:Chromosomes (human)| ]]\n", "name_user": "Keith D", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fix PMC warnings", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human_genome"}

Having had to learn English when he first came to the U.S. presented the young Lee with the sense of being an outsider, as did the \"preppy, upper-class\" atmosphere of Country Day. As a result, on the rare occasions that his parents bought him comics, Lee's favorite characters were the [[X-Men]], because they were outsiders themselves. Lee says that he benefited as an artist by connecting with characters that were themselves disenfranchised, like [[Spider-Man]], or who were born of such backgrounds, such as [[Superman]], who was created by two Jewish men from Cleveland to lift their spirits during the Depression. His classmates predicted in his senior yearbook that he would found his own comic book company.<ref name=stlmag/><ref name=Icons/> Despite this, Lee was resigned to following his father's career in medicine, attending [[Princeton University]] to study [[psychology]], with the intention of becoming a medical doctor.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=CBR2006>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523 |title=New York Comic Con, Day One: Jim Lee Spotlight |author=Tantimedh, Adi|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 25, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131227231842/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523|archivedate= December 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Comics career==\n===Rise to fame at Marvel Comics===\nIn 1986, as he was preparing to graduate, Lee took an art class that reignited his love of drawing, and led to his rediscovery of comics at a time when seminal works such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' spurred a renaissance within the American comics industry.<ref name=Icons/> After obtaining his psychology degree,<ref name=CBR2006/> he decided to postpone applying to medical school, and earned the reluctant blessing of his parents by allotting himself one year to succeed, vowing that he would attend medical school if he did not break into the comic book industry in that time.

The other major series of the initial years of Wildstorm, for which Lee either created characters, co-plotted or provided art for, included ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'' and ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]''.\n\nIn 1993, Lee and his friend, [[Valiant Comics]] publisher Steve Massarsky, arranged a Valiant-Image Comics crossover miniseries called ''[[Deathmate]]'', in which the Valiant characters would interact with those of WildStorm, and of Lee's fellow Image partner, [[Rob Liefeld]]. The miniseries would consist of four \"center books\" (each one denoted by a color rather than an issue number), two each produced by the respective companies, plus a prologue and epilogue book. Wildstorm produced ''Deathmate Black'', with Lee himself contributing to the writing. He illustrated the covers for that book, the ''Deathmate Tourbook'' and the prologue book, as well as contributing to the prologue's interior inks.\n\nWildStorm would expand its line to include other ongoing titles whose creative work was handled by other writers and artists, some of which were spinoffs of the earlier titles, or properties owned by other creators, such as [[Whilce Portacio]]'s ''[[Wetworks]]''. As publisher, Lee later expanded his comics line creating two publishing imprints of WildStorm, [[Homage Comics|Homage]] and [[Cliffhanger (comics)|Cliffhanger]] (that years later merged and were replaced by a single WildStorm Signature imprint), to publish creator-owned comics by some selected creators of the US comics industry.\n\nLee and [[Rob Liefeld]], another Marvel-illustrator-turned-Image-founder, returned to Marvel in 1996 to participate in a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of several classic characters; the project was known as [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]].

According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them himself, which he refused to do. Instead, he accepted an offer to re-imagine and relaunch (in the role of editor) three mainstream Marvel Universe titles: ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', and ''[[Nick Fury]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = McLauchlin | first= Jim | date = August 1997 | title = Lee Extends 'Reborn' Run | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 18\u201319}}</ref> Though scheduled to debut in December 1997, these three relaunches never appeared.\n\nLee returned to WildStorm, where he would publish series such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', as well as [[Alan Moore]]'s imprint, [[America's Best Comics]].

Lee purchased the art at a [[Sotheby's]] auction via Barry Geller, the producer of the faux film, who was selling it to help pay for his child's college tuition. Although the CIA operation that rescued the Americans remained classified for another 17 years, and thus Lee had no idea of the pages' historical significance, nor did Geller know their true monetary value when he sold them to help pay his son's college tuition (with Kirby's permission). Both Lee and Geller learned of the true story behind the art years later with the rest of the public. In August 2013, four of Lee's children were headed for college, and he and Carla decided to auction off the art through [[Heritage Auctions]] in order to pay for their education.<ref

([[Korean language|Korean]] \uc774\uc6a9\ucca0; born August 11, 1964) is a [[Korean American]] comic-book artist, writer, editor, and publisher. He is currently the Publisher and [[Chief creative officer|Chief Creative Officer]] of [[DC Comics]]. In recognition of his work, Lee has received a [[Harvey Award]], [[Inkpot Award]] and three [[Wizard Fan Award]]s.\n\nHe entered the industry in 1987 as an artist for [[Marvel Comics]], illustrating titles such as ''[[Alpha Flight (comic book)|Alpha Flight]]'' and ''[[The Punisher War Journal]]'', before gaining popularity on ''[[The Uncanny X-Men]]''. ''X-Men'' #1, the 1991 spin-off series premiere that Lee penciled and co-wrote with [[Chris Claremont]], remains the best-selling comic book of all time, according to ''[[Guinness World Records]]''. His style was later used for the designs of ''[[X-Men: The Animated Series]]''.<ref name=CBR.com>{{cite web|author=Nolan, L.D.|title=Jim Lee Launches Kickstarter for Comic Art Backpacks|publisher=[[CBR.com]]|url=https://www.cbr.com/jim-lee-kickstarter-comic-art-backpacks-hex/|date=|accessdate=June 28, 2019|archivedate=June 8, 2019|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190608003150/https://www.cbr.com/jim-lee-kickstarter-comic-art-backpacks-hex/}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, Lee and several other artists formed their own publishing company, [[Image Comics]], to publish their creator-owned titles, with Lee publishing titles such as ''[[WildC.A.T.s]]'' and ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]'' through his studio [[WildStorm Productions]].\n\nFinding that the role of publisher reduced the amount of time he was able to devote to illustration, Lee sold WildStorm in 1998 to [[DC Comics]], where he continued to run it as a DC imprint until 2010, as well as illustrating successful titles set in [[DC Universe|DC's main fictional universe]], such as the year-long \"[[Batman: Hush]]\" and \"[[Superman: For Tomorrow]]\" storylines, and books including ''[[Superman Unchained]]'' and the [[New 52]] run of ''[[Justice League]]''. On February 18, 2010, Lee was announced as the new Co-Publisher of DC Comics with [[Dan DiDio]], both replacing [[Paul Levitz]]. Upon DiDio's departure from the company in February 2020, Lee became the sole Publisher of DC Comics. Aside from illustrating comics, he has done work as a designer or creative director on other DC products, such as action figures, video games, branded automobiles and backpacks. Outside of the comics industry, Lee has also designed album covers, and one of [[General Mills]]' [[monster-themed cereals]] for its 2014 Halloween edition.\n\n==Early life==\nJim Lee was born on August 11, 1964 in [[Seoul]], South Korea.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=John Jackson |url=http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |title=Comics Industry Birthdays |work=[[Comics Buyer's Guide]] |date=June 10, 2005 |location=Iola, Wisconsin |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110218031356/http://cbgxtra.com/knowledge-base/for-your-reference/comics-industry-birthdays |archivedate=February 18, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ign.com/stars/jim-lee|title= About This Person: Jim Lee|publisher= [[IGN]]|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140119201325/http://www.ign.com/stars/jim-lee|archivedate=January 19, 2014 |url-status=live|accessdate= January 18, 2013}}</ref> He grew up in [[St. Louis]], Missouri,<ref name=stlmag>{{cite news|url=http://www.stlmag.com/media/St-Louis-Magazine/July-2010/Comic-Genius/ |title= Comic Genius |first= Byron |last= Kerman|newspaper=[[St. Louis Magazine]]|date=July 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807171733/http://www.stlmag.com/St-Louis-Magazine/July-2010/Comic-Genius/|archivedate= August 7, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=Icons>{{cite book|last1 = Lee|first1 = Jim|last2 = Baker|first2 = Bill|title = Icons: The DC Comics & WildStorm Art of Jim Lee|publisher = [[Titan Books]]|year = 2010|pages = 8 and 10|isbn = 978-1845765194}}</ref> where he lived a \"typical middle-class childhood\".<ref name=Icons/> Though given a Korean name at birth, he chose the name Jim when he became a naturalized U.S. citizen at age 12.<ref>Lee, Jim (November 14, 2017).

Having had to learn English when he first came to the U.S. presented the young Lee with the sense of being an outsider, as did the \"preppy, upper-class\" atmosphere of Country Day. As a result, on the rare occasions that his parents bought him comics, Lee's favorite characters were the [[X-Men]], because they were outsiders themselves. Lee says that he benefited as an artist by connecting with characters that were themselves disenfranchised, like [[Spider-Man]], or who were born of such backgrounds, such as [[Superman]], who was created by two Jewish men from Cleveland to lift their spirits during the Depression. His classmates predicted in his senior yearbook that he would found his own comic book company.<ref name=stlmag/><ref name=Icons/> Despite this, Lee was resigned to following his father's career in medicine, attending [[Princeton University]] to study [[psychology]], with the intention of becoming a medical doctor.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=CBR2006>{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523 |title=New York Comic Con, Day One: Jim Lee Spotlight |author=Tantimedh, Adi|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=February 25, 2006|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131227231842/http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=6523|archivedate= December 27, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Comics career==\n===Rise to fame at Marvel Comics===\nIn 1986, as he was preparing to graduate, Lee took an art class that reignited his love of drawing, and led to his rediscovery of comics at a time when seminal works such as [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'' and [[Alan Moore]] and [[Dave Gibbons]]' ''[[Watchmen]]'' spurred a renaissance within the American comics industry.<ref name=Icons/> After obtaining his psychology degree,<ref name=CBR2006/> he decided to postpone applying to medical school, and earned the reluctant blessing of his parents by allotting himself one year to succeed, vowing that he would attend medical school if he did not break into the comic book industry in that time. He submitted samples to various publishers, but did not find success.<ref name=Icons/> When Lee befriended St. Louis-area comics artists Don Secrease and [[Rick Burchett]], they convinced him he needed to show his portfolio to editors in person, prompting Lee to attend a New York comics convention,<ref name=stlmag/> where he met editor [[Archie Goodwin (comics)|Archie Goodwin]]. Goodwin invited Lee to Marvel Comics, where the aspiring artist received his first assignment by editor [[Carl Potts]], who hired him to pencil the mid-list series ''[[Alpha Flight]]'', segu\u00e9ing from that title in 1989 to ''[[Punisher: War Journal]]''.<ref name=Icons/><ref name=\"Gaffney\">Gaffney, Suzanne. \"Co-Conspirators Talk\".

The other major series of the initial years of Wildstorm, for which Lee either created characters, co-plotted or provided art for, included ''[[Stormwatch (comics)|Stormwatch]]'', ''[[Deathblow (comics)|Deathblow]]'' and ''[[Gen\u00b9\u00b3]]''.\n\nIn 1993, Lee and his friend, [[Valiant Comics]] publisher Steve Massarsky, arranged a Valiant-Image Comics crossover miniseries called ''[[Deathmate]]'', in which the Valiant characters would interact with those of WildStorm, and of Lee's fellow Image partner, [[Rob Liefeld]]. The miniseries would consist of four \"center books\" (each one denoted by a color rather than an issue number), two each produced by the respective companies, plus a prologue and epilogue book. Wildstorm produced ''Deathmate Black'', with Lee himself contributing to the writing. He illustrated the covers for that book, the ''Deathmate Tourbook'' and the prologue book, as well as contributing to the prologue's interior inks.\n\nWildStorm would expand its line to include other ongoing titles whose creative work was handled by other writers and artists, some of which were spinoffs of the earlier titles, or properties owned by other creators, such as [[Whilce Portacio]]'s ''[[Wetworks]]''. As publisher, Lee later expanded his comics line creating two publishing imprints of WildStorm, [[Homage Comics|Homage]] and [[Cliffhanger (comics)|Cliffhanger]] (that years later merged and were replaced by a single WildStorm Signature imprint), to publish creator-owned comics by some selected creators of the US comics industry.\n\nLee and [[Rob Liefeld]], another Marvel-illustrator-turned-Image-founder, returned to Marvel in 1996 to participate in a [[Reboot (continuity)|reboot]] of several classic characters; the project was known as [[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]. While Liefeld reworked ''[[Captain America]]'' and ''[[Avengers (comics)|The Avengers]]'', Lee plotted ''[[Iron Man]]''<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: \"Part of the 'Heroes Reborn' event, Iron Man was relaunched into a new universe courtesy of writers Scott Lobdell and Jim Lee, with pencils by Whilce Portacio.\"</ref> and plotted and illustrated ''[[Fantastic Four]]'' issues #1-6.<ref>Manning \"1990s\" in Gilbert (2008), p. 280: \"Jim Lee both wrote and drew this Heroes Reborn relaunch title with the help of fellow scripter Brandon Choi.\"</ref> Halfway through the project, Lee's studio took over Liefeld's two titles, finishing all four series. According to Lee, Marvel proposed continuing the Heroes Reborn lineup indefinitely, but under the condition that Lee would draw at least one of them himself, which he refused to do. Instead, he accepted an offer to re-imagine and relaunch (in the role of editor) three mainstream Marvel Universe titles: ''[[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]]'', ''[[Doctor Strange]]'', and ''[[Nick Fury]]''.<ref>{{cite news | last = McLauchlin | first= Jim | date = August 1997 | title = Lee Extends 'Reborn' Run | work = [[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | issue = 72 | pages = 18\u201319}}</ref> Though scheduled to debut in December 1997, these three relaunches never appeared.\n\nLee returned to WildStorm, where he would publish series such as ''[[The Authority (comics)|The Authority]]'' and ''[[Planetary (comics)|Planetary]]'', as well as [[Alan Moore]]'s imprint, [[America's Best Comics]]. Lee himself wrote and illustrated a 12-issue series called ''[[Divine Right: The Adventures of Max Faraday]]'', in which an internet slacker inadvertently manages to download the secrets of the universe, and is thrown into a wild [[fantasy]] world.\n\n=== Move to DC Comics ===\n[[File:Batman superman.PNG|thumb|left|300px|Lee's renditions of Superman and Batman]]\nBecause he felt his role as publisher and his growing family demands interfered with his role as an artist, Lee left [[Image Comics]] and sold WildStorm to [[DC Comics]] in late 1998,<ref name=\"WildcatsV2#1\">Lee, Jim (March 1999). \"Welcome and Happy New Year!\".

There is no emotional investment...I look at Jim Lee's work, and the guy's learning how to draw. He has some craft to what he does...I don't think it has even crossed their minds that comic books can be a medium for intimate self-expression.\" ''The Comics Journal'' publisher [[Gary Groth]] concurred, stating \"Lee's work is obviously more technically accomplished than Liefeld's, but otherwise it's conceptually comparable.\" Windsor-Smith added that he believed in the [[Image Comics]]' founders' exodus from Marvel Comics as an important step for creator autonomy and creator rights, and was angered when they returned to Marvel to do \"[[Heroes Reborn (comics)|Heroes Reborn]]\".<ref>{{cite journal|last = Groth|first = Gary|authorlink = Gary Groth|title = The Barry Windsor-Smith Interview|journal = [[The Comics Journal]]|issue = 190|pages = |publisher = [[Fantagraphics Books]]|date = September 1996|location= Seattle, Washington|url = http://www.tcj.com/the-barry-windsor-smith-interview/|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131227160504/http://www.tcj.com/the-barry-windsor-smith-interview/|archivedate= December 27, 2013|url-status=live|accessdate = July 28, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nLee is married to Carla Michelle Lee<ref name=ComicsBeat>[[MacDonald, Heidi]] (August 2, 2013).

Lee purchased the art at a [[Sotheby's]] auction via Barry Geller, the producer of the faux film, who was selling it to help pay for his child's college tuition. Although the CIA operation that rescued the Americans remained classified for another 17 years, and thus Lee had no idea of the pages' historical significance, nor did Geller know their true monetary value when he sold them to help pay his son's college tuition (with Kirby's permission). Both Lee and Geller learned of the true story behind the art years later with the rest of the public. In August 2013, four of Lee's children were headed for college, and he and Carla decided to auction off the art through [[Heritage Auctions]] in order to pay for their education.<ref
