Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].\n\nAnother subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:\n\n* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves\n* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.) (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=Oceanic%20island&f=false ''Foundations of Biogeography: Classic Papers with Commentaries''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418233729/https://books.google.com/books?id=KbkCgsEPv6YC&pg=PA316&dq=Oceanic+island&hl=en&sa=X&ei=NlR_UaycEMqhigLGhYHoAw&ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw |date=April 18, 2016 }}. University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions.

Examples are [[Madagascar]] and [[Socotra]] off [[Africa]], [[Geography of New Caledonia|New Caledonia]], [[New Zealand]], and some of the [[Seychelles]].\n\nAnother subtype is an island or [[shoal|bar]] formed by deposition of tiny rocks where water current loses some of its carrying capacity. This includes:\n\n* [[barrier island|barrier islands]], which are accumulations of [[sand]] deposited by sea currents on the continental shelves\n* [[fluvial processes|fluvial]] or [[alluvium|alluvial]] islands formed in [[river delta|river deltas]] or midstream within large rivers. While some are transitory and may disappear if the volume or speed of the current changes, others are stable and long-lived.\n\n[[Islet|Islets]] are very small islands.\n\n===Oceanic islands===\n{{Main article|High island}}\n\nOceanic islands are islands that do not sit on continental shelves. The vast majority are [[volcano|volcanic]] in origin, such as [[Saint Helena]] in the [[South Atlantic Ocean]].<ref>Lomolino, Mark V. (editor); (et al.)

University of Chicago Press. p. 316. {{ISBN|0-226-49236-2}}</ref> The few oceanic islands that are not volcanic are [[tectonic]] in origin and arise where plate movements have lifted up the ocean floor above the surface. Examples are [[Saint Peter and Paul Rocks]] in the Atlantic Ocean and [[Macquarie Island]] in the Pacific.\n\nOne type of volcanic oceanic island is found in a volcanic island arc. These islands arise from volcanoes where the [[subduction]] of one plate under another is occurring. Examples are the [[Aleutian Islands]], the [[Mariana Islands]], and most of [[Tonga]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The only examples in the Atlantic Ocean are some of the [[Lesser Antilles]] and the [[South Sandwich Islands]].\n\nAnother type of volcanic oceanic island occurs where an [[oceanic rift]] reaches the surface. There are two examples: [[Iceland]], which is the world's second largest volcanic island, and [[Jan Mayen]]. Both are in the Atlantic.\n\nA third type of volcanic oceanic island is formed over volcanic [[Hotspot (geology)|hotspots]]. A hotspot is more or less stationary relative to the moving [[tectonic plate]] above it, so a chain of islands results as the plate drifts. Over long periods of time, this type of island is eventually \"drowned\" by [[isostasy|isostatic adjustment]] and eroded, becoming a [[seamount]]. Plate movement across a hot-spot produces a line of islands oriented in the direction of the plate movement. An example is the [[Hawaiian Islands]], from [[Hawaii]] to [[Kure Atoll|Kure]], which continue beneath the sea surface in a more northerly direction as the [[Emperor Seamounts]]. Another chain with similar orientation is the [[Tuamotu Archipelago]]; its older, northerly trend is the [[Line Islands]]. The southernmost chain is the [[Austral Islands]], with its northerly trending part the atolls in the nation of [[Tuvalu]]. [[Tristan da Cunha]] is an example of a hotspot volcano in the Atlantic Ocean. Another hotspot in the Atlantic is the island of [[Surtsey]], which was formed in 1963.\n\nAn [[atoll]] is an island formed from a [[coral reef]] that has grown on an eroded and submerged volcanic island. The [[reef]] rises to the surface of the water and forms a new island. Atolls are typically ring-shaped with a central [[lagoon]]. Examples are the [[Line Islands]] in the Pacific and the [[Maldives]] in the [[Indian Ocean]].\n\n===Tropical islands===\n{{See also|Coral reef#Formation}}\n\n[[File:Landing Runway 18 (2121588367).jpg|thumb|right| Plane landing on an airport island, [[Velana International Airport]], [[Hulhul\u00e9 Island]], [[Maldives]]]]\n\nApproximately 45,000 [[Tropics|tropical]] islands with an [[area]] of at least {{convert|5|ha}} exist.<ref name=\"TI\">{{cite book\n|doi=10.1553/3-7001-2738-3\n|title=The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans\n|author=Austrian Academy of Sciences\n|author-link=Austrian Academy of Sciences}}</ref> Examples [[Coral reef#Formation|formed from coral reefs]] include [[Maldives]], [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Nauru]], and [[Polynesia]].<ref name=\"TI\"/> [[Granite]] islands include [[Seychelles]] and [[Tioman Island|Tioman]] and [[Volcano|volcanic]] islands such as [[Saint Helena]].\n\nThe socio-economic diversity of tropical islands ranges from the [[Stone Age]] societies in the interior of [[North Sentinel]], [[Madagascar]], [[Borneo]], and [[Papua New Guinea]] to the high-tech lifestyles of the city-islands of [[Singapore]] and [[Hong Kong]].<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Tropical Islands of the Indian and Pacific Oceans|last = Arnberger|first = Hertha, Erik|publisher = Austrian Academy of Sciences Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-3-7001-2738-3|location = Vienna|pages = }}</ref>\n\nInternational [[tourism]] is a significant factor in the economy of many tropical islands including Seychelles, [[Sri Lanka]], [[Mauritius]],  [[R\u00e9union]], [[Hawaii]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Maldives]].\n\n==Artificial islands==\n{{Main article|Artificial island}}\n\nAlmost all of [[Earth]]'s islands are natural and have been formed by tectonic forces or volcanic eruptions.

As part of the deal, Arnold Palmer would redesign the Palm course. The Orlando market for golf had a glut of course from the building boom then bust making profitability a challenge for any golf course. Disney hoped that Palmer's involvement and \"Palmer Advantage\" membership club would draw more attention to Disney's course. With the Osprey Ridge course sold to Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts to build a hotel, which was delayed until 2014, the golf management company would run the course until hotel construction begins.

In the case of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump 2016 campaign]], his former rival for the Republican nomination [[Chris Christie]] was appointed to lead the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] in May 2016, shortly after [[Ted Cruz]] and [[John Kasich]] suspended their campaigns (thus making Trump the presumptive nominee of the party). In addition to various other responsibilities, the transition team is responsible for making preliminary lists of potential [[executive branch]] appointees\u2014at least for the several dozen high-level positions if not for the several thousand lower-level positions\u2014and doing some early [[vetting]] work on those people.  The transition team also hires policy experts (over 100 in the case of the Trump transition team by October 2016), using primarily federal funds and federal office space, to help plan how the hypothetical-at-the-time future Trump administration will implement their policy-goals via the various federal agencies and departments.\n\nAfter the election in November 2016, when the ticket formed by Trump and Pence defeated the Clinton and Kaine ticket as well as various [[Third party (United States)|third party]] opponents, the transition team [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump#November 11 reshuffle|was quickly reshuffled]] and expanded; [[Mike Pence]] was given the lead role (over [[Chris Christie]]), and several additional top-level transition personnel were added to the transition effort, most of them from the now-finished campaign effort.  During the remainder of 2016, the team continued finding and vetting potential nominees for the various positions, as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] process was ongoing (including recounts in some states where the winning margin was relatively tiny) and before the presidential [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] in January 2017.\n\nPresident-elect Trump announced his first post-election Cabinet nominee, [[Jeff Sessions]] for the role of [[United States Attorney General]], on November 18, 2016.  (Trump had earlier announced Mike Pence as his pick for vice-presidential running mate in July 2016, which was shortly thereafter confirmed by the delegates to the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] when they officially nominated first Trump and then Pence.)  Although most positions were simultaneously under consideration by the transition team, the official announcement of offers, and the public acceptance of the offers, usually happens gradually as slots are filled ([[Richard Nixon]] being the exception).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| President<ref name=foxnewsNomsByWeek>{{cite tweet|user=FoxNewsResearch|author=Fox News Research|number=798959647453544449|date=November 16, 2016|title=Since 1968, George HW Bush is the only president-elect to announce cabinet nominations within the first week after\u2026|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|title=How Donald Trump's Cabinet Nominations Compare with Previous Presidents'|author=Randy Yeip|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207114131/http://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=cqNomineeDates />\n! colspan=10| Week\n! rowspan=2| Weighted<br />Average\n! rowspan=2| Notes\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n! 10\n|-\n| [[Nixon cabinet and appointments|Nixon '68]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 12\n| <!-- wk7 -->\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.0 weeks\n| <!--notes--> The [[United States Postmaster General|twelfth Cabinet role]] was [[United States Postal Service|quasi-privatized]] in 1971.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Administration and cabinet|Carter '76]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 --> 1\n| <!-- wk6 --> 2\n| <!-- wk7 --> 7\n| <!-- wk8 --> 2\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.8 weeks\n| <!--notes--> New roles:  [[United States Secretary of Energy|Energy]] in 1977, [[United States Department of Education|Education]] in 1979.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan#Administration and Cabinet|Reagan '80]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 8\n| <!-- wk7 --> 4\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10--> 1\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.6 weeks\n| <!--notes--> Reagan was unable to [[United States Department of Education#Opposition|abolish the federal Department of Education]].\n|-\n| [[Presidency of George H.

In the case of the [[Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|Trump 2016 campaign]], his former rival for the Republican nomination [[Chris Christie]] was appointed to lead the [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]] in May 2016, shortly after [[Ted Cruz]] and [[John Kasich]] suspended their campaigns (thus making Trump the presumptive nominee of the party). In addition to various other responsibilities, the transition team is responsible for making preliminary lists of potential [[executive branch]] appointees\u2014at least for the several dozen high-level positions if not for the several thousand lower-level positions\u2014and doing some early [[vetting]] work on those people.  The transition team also hires policy experts (over 100 in the case of the Trump transition team by October 2016), using primarily federal funds and federal office space, to help plan how the hypothetical-at-the-time future Trump administration will implement their policy-goals via the various federal agencies and departments.\n\nAfter the election in November 2016, when the ticket formed by Trump and Pence defeated the Clinton and Kaine ticket as well as various [[Third party (United States)|third party]] opponents, the transition team [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump#November 11 reshuffle|was quickly reshuffled]] and expanded; [[Mike Pence]] was given the lead role (over [[Chris Christie]]), and several additional top-level transition personnel were added to the transition effort, most of them from the now-finished campaign effort.  During the remainder of 2016, the team continued finding and vetting potential nominees for the various positions, as the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] process was ongoing (including recounts in some states where the winning margin was relatively tiny) and before the presidential [[Inauguration of Donald Trump|inauguration]] in January 2017.\n\nPresident-elect Trump announced his first post-election Cabinet nominee, [[Jeff Sessions]] for the role of [[United States Attorney General]], on November 18, 2016.  (Trump had earlier announced Mike Pence as his pick for vice-presidential running mate in July 2016, which was shortly thereafter confirmed by the delegates to the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]] when they officially nominated first Trump and then Pence.)  Although most positions were simultaneously under consideration by the transition team, the official announcement of offers, and the public acceptance of the offers, usually happens gradually as slots are filled ([[Richard Nixon]] being the exception).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=2| President<ref name=foxnewsNomsByWeek>{{cite tweet|user=FoxNewsResearch|author=Fox News Research|number=798959647453544449|date=November 16, 2016|title=Since 1968, George HW Bush is the only president-elect to announce cabinet nominations within the first week after\u2026|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|title=How Donald Trump's Cabinet Nominations Compare with Previous Presidents'|author=Randy Yeip|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207114131/http://www.wsj.com/graphics/how-donald-trumps-cabinet-nominations-compare-with-previous-presidents/|archive-date=February 7, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=cqNomineeDates />\n! colspan=10| Week\n! rowspan=2| Weighted<br />Average\n! rowspan=2| Notes\n|-\n! 1\n! 2\n! 3\n! 4\n! 5\n! 6\n! 7\n! 8\n! 9\n! 10\n|-\n| [[Nixon cabinet and appointments|Nixon '68]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 12\n| <!-- wk7 -->\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.0 weeks\n| <!--notes--> The [[United States Postmaster General|twelfth Cabinet role]] was [[United States Postal Service|quasi-privatized]] in 1971.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter#Administration and cabinet|Carter '76]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 --> 1\n| <!-- wk6 --> 2\n| <!-- wk7 --> 7\n| <!-- wk8 --> 2\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10-->\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.8 weeks\n| <!--notes--> New roles:  [[United States Secretary of Energy|Energy]] in 1977, [[United States Department of Education|Education]] in 1979.\n|-\n| [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan#Administration and Cabinet|Reagan '80]]\n| <!-- wk1 -->\n| <!-- wk2 -->\n| <!-- wk3 -->\n| <!-- wk4 -->\n| <!-- wk5 -->\n| <!-- wk6 --> 8\n| <!-- wk7 --> 4\n| <!-- wk8 -->\n| <!-- wk9 -->\n| <!-- wk10--> 1\n| style=\"background:linen\" |<!-- avg --> 6.6 weeks\n| <!--notes--> Reagan was unable to [[United States Department of Education#Opposition|abolish the federal Department of Education]].\n|-\n| [[Presidency of George H.

In 1893 the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]] transferred its administration rights of territory consisting mainly of [[Buganda Kingdom]] to the British Government.\n\nIn 1894 the Uganda Protectorate was established, and the territory was extended beyond the borders of Buganda to an area that roughly corresponds to that of present-day [[Uganda]].\n\n==Background==\n===Civil war===\nIn the mid 1880s, the [[Kingdom of Buganda]] was divided between four religious factions - pagans, [[Catholics]], [[Protestants]] and [[Muslims]] - each vying for political control.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\">Griffiths, Tudor. \u201cBishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94.\u201d Journal of Religion in Africa, vol. 31, no. 1, 2001, pp. 92\u2013114. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1581815.</ref>  In 1888, [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] was ousted in a coup led by the Muslim faction, who installed [[Kalema of Buganda|Kalema]] as leader. The following year, a Protestant and Catholic coalition formed to remove Kalema and return [[Mwanga II of Buganda|Mwanga II]] to power. This coalition secured an alliance with the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]], and succeeded in ousting Kalema and reinstating Mwanga in 1890.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>\n\nThe IBEAC sent [[Frederick Lugard, 1st Baron Lugard|Frederick Lugard]] to Bugunda in 1890 as its chief representative and to help maintain the peace between the competing factions. In 1891, Mwanga concluded a treaty with Lugard whereby Mwanga would place his land and tributary states under the protection of the IBEAC.<ref>Gray, John, and Carl Peters. \u201cAnglo-German Relations in Uganda, 1890-1892.\u201d The Journal of African History, vol. 1, no. 2, 1960, pp. 281\u2013297. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/180246.</ref>\n\nIn 1892, having subdued the Muslim faction, the Protestants and Catholics resumed their struggle for supremacy which led to civil war.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/> That same year, the British government extended their support for the IBEAC to remain in Buganda until 1893. Despite strong opposition to getting involved in Buganda, the government felt that withdrawal of British influence would lead to war and the threat of a fellow European power encroaching on Britain's sphere of influence in East Africa agreed with Germany in 1890.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>\n\nOn 31 March 1893, the IBEAC formally ended its involvement in Uganda. Missionaries, led by [[Alfred Tucker]], lobbied the British government to take over the administration of Uganda in place of the IBEAC, arguing that British withdrawal would lead to a continuance of the civil war between the different religious factions.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>  Shortly after, [[Gerald Portal|Sir Gerald Portal]], a representative of the British government on the ground in Uganda, proposed a plan of double chieftainships - whereby every chieftanship would have one Protestant and one Catholic chief. On 19 April 1893, the British government and the chiefs of Uganda signed a treaty giving effect to this plan.<ref name=\"Bishop Alfred Tucker and the Establishment of a British Protectorate in Uganda 1890-94\"/>\n\nOn 18 June 1894, the British government declared that Uganda would come under British protection as a [[Protectorate]].\n\n==British rule==\n===1894\u20131901===\nThe [[Buganda Agreement (1900)|Uganda Agreement of 1900]] solidified the power of the largely Protestant 'Bakungu' client-chiefs, led by Kagwa. London sent only a few officials to administer the country, relying primarily on the 'Bakungu' chiefs. For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe (the Ugandan capital) to the Buganda capital. By the 1920s the British administrators were more confident and had less need for military or administrative support. Colonial officials taxed cash crops produced by the peasants. There was popular discontent among the Baganda rank-and-file, which weakened the position of their leaders. In 1912 Kagwa moved to solidify 'Bakungu' power by proposing a second 'Lukiko' for Buganda with himself as president and the 'Bakungu' as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. British officials vetoed the idea when they discovered widespread popular opposition. Instead, British officials began some reforms and attempted to make the 'Lukiko' a genuine representative assembly.<ref>Michael Twaddle, \"The Bakungu chiefs of Buganda under British colonial rule, 1900\u20131930.\" ''Journal of African History'' 10#2 (1969): 309-322.</ref>\n\n[[File:The White Elephant, Punch 103.png|thumb|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting Uganda personified as a [[White elephant]] which the [[Imperial British East Africa Company|East Africa Company]] is attempting to sell to Britain (1892)]]\nAlthough momentous change occurred during the colonial era in [[Uganda]], some characteristics of late-nineteenth-century African society survived to reemerge at the time of independence. The status of [[Protectorate]] had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring [[Kenya]], insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration.\n\nColonial rule, however, affected local economic systems dramatically, in part because the first concern of the British was financial. Quelling the 1897 mutiny (see [[Uganda before 1900]]) had been costly\u2014units of the [[British Indian Army]] had been transported to Uganda at considerable expense. The new commissioner of Uganda in 1900, Sir [[Harry H. Johnston]], had orders to establish an efficient administration and to levy taxes as quickly as possible. Johnston approached the chiefs in [[Buganda]] with offers of jobs in the colonial administration in return for their collaboration.\n\nThe chiefs, were more interested in preserving Buganda as a self-governing entity, continuing the royal line of [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabakas]], and securing private land tenure for themselves and their supporters. Hard bargaining ensued, but the chiefs ended up with everything they wanted, including one-half of all the land in Buganda. The half left to the British as \"Crown Land\" was later found to be largely swamp and scrub.\n\nJohnston's [[Buganda Agreement of 1900]] imposed a tax on huts and guns, designated the chiefs as tax collectors, and testified to the continued alliance of British and Baganda interests. The British signed much less generous treaties with the other kingdoms ([[Toro (kingdom)|Toro]] in 1900, [[Ankole]] in 1901, and [[Bunyoro]] in 1933) without the provision of large-scale private land tenure. The smaller chiefdoms of [[Busoga]] were ignored.\n\n=== Buganda administrators ===\nThe Baganda immediately offered their services to the British as administrators over their recently conquered neighbours, an offer which was attractive to the economy-minded colonial administration. Baganda agents fanned out as local tax collectors and labour organizers in areas such as [[Kigezi]], [[Mbale]], and, significantly, Bunyoro. This subimperialism and Ganda cultural chauvinism were resented by the people being administered.\n\nWherever they went, Baganda insisted on the exclusive use of their language, [[Luganda language|Luganda]], and they planted [[banana]]s as the only proper food worth eating. They regarded their traditional dress\u2014long cotton gowns called [[kanzu]]s\u2014as civilized; all else was barbarian. They also encouraged and engaged in mission work, attempting to convert locals to their form of Christianity or Islam. In some areas, the resulting backlash aided the efforts of religious rivals\u2014for example, Catholics won converts in areas where oppressive rule was identified with a Protestant [[Muganda]] chief.\n\nThe people of [[Bunyoro]] were particularly aggrieved, having fought the Baganda and the British; having a substantial section of their heartland annexed to Buganda as the \"lost counties\", and finally having \"arrogant\" Baganda administrators issuing orders, collecting taxes, and forcing unpaid labour. In 1907 the Banyoro rose in a rebellion called ''nyangire'', or \"refusing\", and succeeded in having the Baganda subimperial agents withdrawn.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1901 the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] from the coast at [[Mombasa]] to the [[Lake Victoria]] port of [[Kisumu]] moved colonial authorities to encourage the growth of cash crops to help pay the railway's operating costs. Another result of the railway construction was the 1902 decision to transfer the eastern section of the Uganda Protectorate to the [[Kenya Colony]], then called the [[East Africa Protectorate]], to keep the entire line under one local colonial administration. Because the railway experienced cost overruns in Kenya, the British decided to justify its exceptional expense and pay its operating costs by introducing large-scale European settlement in a vast tract of land that became a centre of cash-crop agriculture known as the \"[[White Highlands]]\". A major part of the territory eventually left off of the \"East Africa Protectorate\" was the [[Uganda Scheme]], in which the British Empire offered to create a Jewish nation-state. The offer was made to the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist movement]] which rejected it, refusing to accept anything other than the ancient Land of Israel.\n\nIn many areas of Uganda, by contrast, agricultural production was placed in the hands of Africans, if they responded to the opportunity. Cotton was the crop of choice, largely because of pressure by the [[British Cotton Growing Association]], textile manufacturers who urged the colonies to provide raw materials for British mills. This was done by cash cropping the land. Even the [[Church Mission Society|CMS]] joined the effort by launching the [[Uganda Company]] (managed by a former missionary) to promote cotton planting and to buy and transport the produce.\n\nBuganda, with its strategic location on the lakeside, reaped the benefits of cotton growing. The advantages of this crop were quickly recognized by the Baganda chiefs who had newly acquired freehold estates, which came to be known as [[mailo land]] because they were measured in square miles. In 1905 the initial baled cotton export was valued at \u00a3200; in 1906, \u00a31,000; in 1907; \u00a311,000; and in 1908, \u00a352,000. By 1915 the value of cotton exports had climbed to \u00a3369,000, and Britain was able to end its subsidy of colonial administration in Uganda, while in Kenya the white settlers required continuing subsidies by the home government.\n\nThe income generated by cotton sales made the Buganda kingdom relatively prosperous, compared with the rest of colonial Uganda, although before [[World War I]] cotton was also being grown in the eastern regions of [[Busoga]], [[Lango sub-region|Lango]], and [[Teso sub-region|Teso]]. Many Baganda spent their new earnings on imported clothing, bicycles, metal roofing, and even cars. They also invested in their children's education. The Christian missions emphasized literacy skills, and African converts quickly learned to read and write. By 1911 two popular journals, ''Ebifa'' (News) and ''Munno'' (Your Friend), were published monthly in Luganda.\n\nHeavily supported by African funds, new schools were soon turning out graduating classes at Mengo High School, St. Mary's Kisubi, Namilyango, Gayaza, and [[King's College Budo]] \u2014 all in Buganda. The chief minister of the Buganda kingdom, Sir [[Apolo Kaggwa]], personally awarded a bicycle to the top graduate at [[King's College Budo]], together with the promise of a government job. The schools, in fact, had inherited the educational function formerly performed in the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]'s palace, where generations of young pages had been trained to become chiefs. Now the qualifications sought were literacy and skills, including typing and English translation.\n\nTwo important principles of precolonial political life carried over into the colonial era: clientage, whereby ambitious younger officeholders attached themselves to older high-ranking chiefs, and generational conflict, which resulted when the younger generation sought to expel their elders from office in order to replace them. After World War I, the younger aspirants to high office in Buganda became impatient with the seemingly perpetual tenure of Sir Apolo and his contemporaries, who lacked many of the skills that members of the younger generation had acquired through schooling.

The British colonial administration had also fought with the Lamogi clan of the Acholi People in what that culminated in to the Lamogi Rebellion.\n\n==1920 to 1961==\n{{Uganda Protectorate imagemap}}\nFar more promising as a source of political support were the British colonial officers, who welcomed the typing and translation skills of school graduates and advanced the careers of their favourites. The contest was decided after World War I, when an influx of British ex-military officers, now serving as district commissioners, began to feel that self-government was an obstacle to good government. Specifically, they accused Sir Apolo and his generation of inefficiency, abuse of power, and failure to keep adequate financial accounts\u2014charges that were not hard to document.\n\nSir Apolo resigned in 1926, at about the same time that a host of elderly Baganda chiefs were replaced by a new generation of officeholders. The Buganda treasury was also audited that year for the first time. Although it was not a nationalist organization, the Young Baganda Association claimed to represent popular African dissatisfaction with the old order. As soon as the younger Baganda had replaced the older generation in office, however, their objections to privilege accompanying power ceased. The pattern persisted in Ugandan politics up to and after independence.\n\nThe commoners, who had been labouring on the cotton estates of the chiefs before World War I, did not remain servile. As time passed, they bought small parcels of land from their erstwhile landlords. This land fragmentation was aided by the British, who in 1927 forced the chiefs to limit severely the rents and obligatory labour they could demand from their tenants. Thus the oligarchy of landed chiefs who had emerged with the Buganda Agreement of 1900 declined in importance, and agricultural production shifted to independent smallholders, who grew cotton, and later coffee, for the export market.\n\nUnlike [[Tanganyika]], which was devastated during the prolonged fighting between Britain and Germany in the [[East African Campaign of World War I]], Uganda prospered from wartime agricultural production. After the population losses from disease during the era of conquest and at the turn of the century (particularly the devastating [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic of 1900- 1906), Uganda's population was growing again. Even the 1930s depression seemed to affect smallholder cash farmers in Uganda less severely than it did the white settler producers in Kenya. Ugandans simply grew their own food until rising prices made export crops attractive again.\n\nTwo issues continued to create grievance through the 1930s and 1940s. The colonial government strictly regulated the buying and processing of cash crops, setting prices and reserving the role of intermediary for Asians, who were thought to be more efficient. The British and Asians firmly repelled African attempts to break into cotton ginning. In addition, on the Asian-owned sugar plantations established in the 1920s, labour for sugar-cane and other cash crops was increasingly provided by migrants from peripheral areas of Uganda and even from outside Uganda.\n\n==Independence==\nIn 1949 discontented Baganda rioted and burned down the houses of pro-government chiefs. The rioters had three demands: the right to bypass government price controls on the export sales of cotton, the removal of the Asian monopoly over cotton ginning, and the right to have their own representatives in local government replace chiefs appointed by the British. They were critical as well of the young kabaka, [[Mutesa II|Frederick Walugembe Mutesa II]] (also known as \"King Freddie\" or \"Kabaka Freddie\"), for his inattention to the needs of his people. The British governor, Sir [[John Hall (colonial administrator)|John Hall]], regarded the riots as the work of communist-inspired agitators and rejected the suggested reforms.\n\n[[File:BEA-KUT 1958 MiNr0094I pm B002.jpg|thumb|200px|Stamp of British East Africa with a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]\nFar from leading the people into confrontation, Uganda's would-be agitators were slow to respond to popular discontent. Nevertheless, the [[Uganda African Farmers Union]], founded by [[I.K. Musazi]] in 1947, was blamed for the riots and was banned by the British. Musazi's [[Uganda National Congress]] replaced the farmers union in 1952 when it was set up with [[Abu Mayanja]] as its first Secretary General, but because the congress remained a casual discussion group more than an organized political party, it stagnated and came to an end just two years after its inception.\n\nMeanwhile, the British began to move ahead of the Ugandans in preparing for independence. The effects of Britain's postwar withdrawal from [[India]], the march of nationalism in [[West Africa]], and a more liberal philosophy in the [[Colonial Office]] geared toward future self-rule all began to be felt in Uganda. The embodiment of these issues arrived in 1952 in the person of a new and energetic reformist governor, [[Andrew Cohen (statesman)|Sir Andrew Cohen]] (formerly undersecretary for African affairs in the Colonial Office).\n\nCohen set about preparing Uganda for independence. On the economic side, he removed obstacles to African cotton ginning, rescinded price discrimination against African-grown coffee, encouraged cooperatives, and established the [[Uganda Development Corporation]] to promote and finance new projects. On the political side, he reorganized the Legislative Council, which had consisted of an unrepresentative selection of interest groups heavily favouring the European community, to include African representatives elected from districts throughout Uganda. This system became a prototype for the future parliament.\n\n===Power politics in Buganda===\nThe prospect of elections caused a sudden proliferation of new political parties. This development alarmed the old-guard leaders within the Uganda kingdoms, because they realized that the centre of power would be at the national level. The spark that ignited wider opposition to Governor Cohen's reforms was a 1953 speech in London in which the secretary of state for colonies referred to the possibility of a federation of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika), similar to that established in central Africa.\n\nMany Ugandans were aware of the [[Central African Federation]] of [[Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] (later [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], and [[Malawi]]) and its domination by white settler interests. Ugandans deeply feared the prospect of an East African federation dominated by the settlers of Kenya, which was then in the midst of the bitter [[Mau Mau]] uprising. They had vigorously resisted a similar suggestion by the 1930 [[Hilton Young Commission]]. Confidence in Cohen vanished just as the governor was preparing to urge Buganda to recognize that its special status would have to be sacrificed in the interests of a new and larger nation-state.\n\nMutesa II, who had been regarded by his subjects as uninterested in their welfare, now refused to cooperate with Cohen's plan for an integrated Buganda. Instead, he demanded that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. Cohen's response to this crisis was to deport the kabaka to a comfortable exile in London. His forced departure made the kabaka an instant martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism and anticolonial sentiments set off a storm of protest. Cohen's action had backfired, and he could find no one among the Baganda prepared or able to mobilize support for his schemes. After two frustrating years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate [[Kabaka Freddie]].\n\nThe negotiations leading to the kabaka's return had an outcome similar to the negotiations of Commissioner Johnston in 1900; although appearing to satisfy the British, they were a resounding victory for the Baganda. Cohen secured the kabaka's agreement not to oppose independence within the larger Uganda framework. Not only was the kabaka reinstated in return, but for the first time since 1889, the monarch was given the power to appoint and dismiss his chiefs (Buganda government officials) instead of acting as a mere figurehead while they conducted the affairs of government.\n\nThe kabaka's new power was cloaked in the misleading claim that he would be only a \"constitutional monarch\", while in fact he was a leading player in deciding how Uganda would be governed. A new grouping of Baganda calling themselves \"the King's Friends\" rallied to the kabaka's defence. They were conservative, fiercely loyal to Buganda as a kingdom, and willing to entertain the prospect of participation in an independent Uganda only if it were headed by the kabaka. Baganda politicians who did not share this vision or who were opposed to the \"King's Friends\" found themselves branded as the \"King's Enemies\", which meant political and social ostracism.\n\nThe major exception to this rule were the Roman Catholic Baganda who had formed their own party, the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP), led by [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]]. Many Catholics had felt excluded from the Protestant-dominated establishment in Buganda ever since Lugard's Maxim had turned the tide in 1892. The kabaka had to be Protestant, and he was invested in a coronation ceremony modelled on that of British monarchs (who are invested by the Church of England's Archbishop of Canterbury) that took place at the main Protestant church. Religion and politics were equally inseparable in the other kingdoms throughout Uganda. The DP had Catholic as well as other adherents and was probably the best organized of all the parties preparing for elections. It had printing presses and the backing of the popular newspaper, Munno, which was published at the St. Mary's Kisubi mission.\n\nElsewhere in Uganda, the emergence of the kabaka as a political force provoked immediate hostility. Political parties and local interest groups were riddled with divisions and rivalries, but they shared one concern: they were determined not to be dominated by Buganda. In 1960 a political organizer from Lango, [[Milton Obote]], seized the initiative and formed a new party, the [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC), as a coalition of all those outside the Roman Catholic-dominated DP who opposed Buganda hegemony.\n\nThe steps Cohen had initiated to bring about the independence of a unified Uganda state had led to a polarization between factions from Buganda and those opposed to its domination. Buganda's population in 1959 was 2 million, out of Uganda's total of 6 million. Even discounting the many non-Baganda resident in Buganda, there were at least 1 million people who owed allegiance to the kabaka\u2014too many to be overlooked or shunted aside, but too few to dominate the country as a whole.\n\nAt the London Conference of 1960, it was obvious that Buganda autonomy and a strong unitary government were incompatible, but no compromise emerged, and the decision on the form of government was postponed. The British announced that elections would be held in March 1961 for \"responsible government\", the next-to-last stage of preparation before the formal granting of independence. It was assumed that those winning the election would gain valuable experience in office, preparing them for the probable responsibility of governing after independence.\n\nIn Buganda the \"King's Friends\" urged a total boycott of the election because their attempts to secure promises of future autonomy had been rebuffed. Consequently, when the voters went to the polls throughout Uganda to elect eighty-two [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] members, in Buganda only the Roman Catholic supporters of the DP braved severe public pressure and voted, capturing twenty of Buganda's twenty-one allotted seats. This artificial situation gave the DP a majority of seats, although they had a minority of 416,000 votes nationwide versus 495,000 for the UPC. Benedicto Kiwanuka became the new chief minister of Uganda.\n\nShocked by the results, the Baganda separatists, who formed a political party called [[Kabaka Yekka]], had second thoughts about the wisdom of their election boycott. They quickly welcomed the recommendations of a British commission that proposed a future federal form of government. According to these recommendations, Buganda would enjoy a measure of internal autonomy if it participated fully in the national government.\n\nFor its part, the UPC was equally anxious to eject its DP rivals from government before they became entrenched. Obote reached an understanding with Kabaka Freddie and the KY, accepting Buganda's special federal relationship and even a provision by which the kabaka could appoint Buganda's representatives to the National Assembly, in return for a strategic alliance to defeat the DP. The Kabaka was also promised the largely ceremonial position of Head of state of Uganda, which was of great symbolic importance to the Baganda.\n\nThis marriage of convenience between the UPC and the KY made inevitable the defeat of the DP interim administration. In the aftermath of the April 1962 final election leading up to independence, Uganda's national assembly consisted of forty-three UPC members, twenty-four KY members, and twenty-four DP members. The new UPC-KY coalition led Uganda into independence in October 1962, with Obote as prime minister, and the kabaka becoming president a year later.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{portal bar|Uganda}}\n{{Uganda topics}}\n{{British overseas territories}}\n{{Authority control}}\n{{coord missing|Uganda}}\n\n[[Category:Uganda Protectorate| ]]\n[[Category:Former British colonies and protectorates in Africa]]\n[[Category:History of Uganda]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1894]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1962]]\n[[Category:1894 establishments in Uganda]]\n[[Category:1962 disestablishments in Uganda]]\n[[Category:1894 establishments in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:1962 disestablishments in the British Empire]]\n[[Category:East Africa Protectorate]]\n[[Category:19th century in Uganda]]\n[[Category:20th century in Uganda]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use British English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox country\n| native_name                =\n| conventional_long_name                = Protectorate of Uganda\n| common_name                = Uganda\n| era                = New Imperialism\n| status                = Protectorate\n| empire                = United Kingdom\n| government_type                = Protectorate\n| year_start                = 1894\n| year_end                = 1962\n| life_span                = 1894\u20131962\n| today                = {{flag|Uganda}}\n| event_start                = [[Scramble for Africa|Protectorate established]]\n| date_start                =\n| event_end                = Independence\n| date_end                = 9 October\n| event1                = Self government\n| date_event1                = 1961\n| p1                = Imperial British East Africa Company\n| flag_p1                = Flag of the Imperial British East Africa Company.svg\n| s1                = Uganda (1962\u20131963)\n| flag_s1                = Flag_of_Uganda.svg\n| image_flag                = Flag of the Uganda Protectorate.svg\n| flag                =\n| image_coat                = Badge of the Uganda Protectorate.svg\n| symbol_type                = Badge\n| image_map                = LocationUganda.png\n| capital                = [[Entebbe]]\n| national_anthem                = [[God Save the Queen|\"God Save the King\"/\"Queen\"]]\n| common_languages                = [[English language|English]] (official)<br>[[Luganda]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]], [[Southern Luo language|Southern Luo]], [[Nkore language|Nkore]] widely spoken\n| religion                = [[Christianity]], [[Islam]]\n| currency                = [[Cowrie]] (precolonial era\u20131906)<br>[[East African rupee]] (1906-1920)<br>[[East African florin]] (1920-1921)<br>[[East African shilling]] (1921\u20131962)\n| stat_year1                = 1911\n| stat_area1                = 282309\n| stat_pop1                = 2,466,325<ref>https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Uganda/UGA-2016-05-23.pdf</ref>\n| stat_year2                = 1921\n| stat_area2                =\n| stat_pop2                = 2,854,608<ref>https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Uganda/UGA-2016-05-23.pdf</ref>\n| stat_year3                = 1931\n| stat_area3                =\n| stat_pop3                = 3,542,281<ref>https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Uganda/UGA-2016-05-23.pdf</ref>\n| demonym                =\n| area_km2                =\n| area_rank                =\n| GDP_PPP                =\n| GDP_PPP_year                =\n| HDI                =\n| HDI_year                =\n| stat_year4                = 1948\n| stat_year5                = 1959\n| stat_pop4                = 4,958,520<ref>https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Uganda/UGA-2016-05-23.pdf</ref>\n| stat_pop5                = 6,449,558<ref>https://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/sources/census/wphc/Uganda/UGA-2016-05-23.pdf</ref>\n}}\n{{History of Uganda}}\n\nThe '''British Protectorate of Uganda''' was a [[protectorate]] of the [[British Empire]] from 1894 to 1962.

For decades they were preferred because of their political skills, their Christianity, their friendly relations with the British, their ability to collect taxes, and the proximity of Entebbe (the Ugandan capital) to the Buganda capital. By the 1920s the British administrators were more confident and had less need for military or administrative support. Colonial officials taxed cash crops produced by the peasants. There was popular discontent among the Baganda rank-and-file, which weakened the position of their leaders. In 1912 Kagwa moved to solidify 'Bakungu' power by proposing a second 'Lukiko' for Buganda with himself as president and the 'Bakungu' as a sort of hereditary aristocracy. British officials vetoed the idea when they discovered widespread popular opposition. Instead, British officials began some reforms and attempted to make the 'Lukiko' a genuine representative assembly.<ref>Michael Twaddle, \"The Bakungu chiefs of Buganda under British colonial rule, 1900\u20131930.\" ''Journal of African History'' 10#2 (1969): 309-322.</ref>\n\n[[File:The White Elephant, Punch 103.png|thumb|''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' cartoon depicting Uganda personified as a [[White elephant]] which the [[Imperial British East Africa Company|East Africa Company]] is attempting to sell to Britain (1892)]]\nAlthough momentous change occurred during the colonial era in [[Uganda]], some characteristics of late-nineteenth-century African society survived to reemerge at the time of independence. The status of [[Protectorate]] had significantly different consequences for Uganda than had the region been made a colony like neighboring [[Kenya]], insofar as Uganda retained a degree of self-government that would have otherwise been limited under a full colonial administration.\n\nColonial rule, however, affected local economic systems dramatically, in part because the first concern of the British was financial. Quelling the 1897 mutiny (see [[Uganda before 1900]]) had been costly\u2014units of the [[British Indian Army]] had been transported to Uganda at considerable expense. The new commissioner of Uganda in 1900, Sir [[Harry H. Johnston]], had orders to establish an efficient administration and to levy taxes as quickly as possible. Johnston approached the chiefs in [[Buganda]] with offers of jobs in the colonial administration in return for their collaboration.\n\nThe chiefs, were more interested in preserving Buganda as a self-governing entity, continuing the royal line of [[Kabaka of Buganda|kabakas]], and securing private land tenure for themselves and their supporters. Hard bargaining ensued, but the chiefs ended up with everything they wanted, including one-half of all the land in Buganda. The half left to the British as \"Crown Land\" was later found to be largely swamp and scrub.\n\nJohnston's [[Buganda Agreement of 1900]] imposed a tax on huts and guns, designated the chiefs as tax collectors, and testified to the continued alliance of British and Baganda interests. The British signed much less generous treaties with the other kingdoms ([[Toro (kingdom)|Toro]] in 1900, [[Ankole]] in 1901, and [[Bunyoro]] in 1933) without the provision of large-scale private land tenure. The smaller chiefdoms of [[Busoga]] were ignored.\n\n=== Buganda administrators ===\nThe Baganda immediately offered their services to the British as administrators over their recently conquered neighbours, an offer which was attractive to the economy-minded colonial administration. Baganda agents fanned out as local tax collectors and labour organizers in areas such as [[Kigezi]], [[Mbale]], and, significantly, Bunyoro. This subimperialism and Ganda cultural chauvinism were resented by the people being administered.\n\nWherever they went, Baganda insisted on the exclusive use of their language, [[Luganda language|Luganda]], and they planted [[banana]]s as the only proper food worth eating. They regarded their traditional dress\u2014long cotton gowns called [[kanzu]]s\u2014as civilized; all else was barbarian. They also encouraged and engaged in mission work, attempting to convert locals to their form of Christianity or Islam. In some areas, the resulting backlash aided the efforts of religious rivals\u2014for example, Catholics won converts in areas where oppressive rule was identified with a Protestant [[Muganda]] chief.\n\nThe people of [[Bunyoro]] were particularly aggrieved, having fought the Baganda and the British; having a substantial section of their heartland annexed to Buganda as the \"lost counties\", and finally having \"arrogant\" Baganda administrators issuing orders, collecting taxes, and forcing unpaid labour. In 1907 the Banyoro rose in a rebellion called ''nyangire'', or \"refusing\", and succeeded in having the Baganda subimperial agents withdrawn.\n\nMeanwhile, in 1901 the completion of the [[Uganda Railway]] from the coast at [[Mombasa]] to the [[Lake Victoria]] port of [[Kisumu]] moved colonial authorities to encourage the growth of cash crops to help pay the railway's operating costs. Another result of the railway construction was the 1902 decision to transfer the eastern section of the Uganda Protectorate to the [[Kenya Colony]], then called the [[East Africa Protectorate]], to keep the entire line under one local colonial administration. Because the railway experienced cost overruns in Kenya, the British decided to justify its exceptional expense and pay its operating costs by introducing large-scale European settlement in a vast tract of land that became a centre of cash-crop agriculture known as the \"[[White Highlands]]\". A major part of the territory eventually left off of the \"East Africa Protectorate\" was the [[Uganda Scheme]], in which the British Empire offered to create a Jewish nation-state. The offer was made to the [[World Zionist Organization|Zionist movement]] which rejected it, refusing to accept anything other than the ancient Land of Israel.\n\nIn many areas of Uganda, by contrast, agricultural production was placed in the hands of Africans, if they responded to the opportunity. Cotton was the crop of choice, largely because of pressure by the [[British Cotton Growing Association]], textile manufacturers who urged the colonies to provide raw materials for British mills. This was done by cash cropping the land. Even the [[Church Mission Society|CMS]] joined the effort by launching the [[Uganda Company]] (managed by a former missionary) to promote cotton planting and to buy and transport the produce.\n\nBuganda, with its strategic location on the lakeside, reaped the benefits of cotton growing. The advantages of this crop were quickly recognized by the Baganda chiefs who had newly acquired freehold estates, which came to be known as [[mailo land]] because they were measured in square miles. In 1905 the initial baled cotton export was valued at \u00a3200; in 1906, \u00a31,000; in 1907; \u00a311,000; and in 1908, \u00a352,000. By 1915 the value of cotton exports had climbed to \u00a3369,000, and Britain was able to end its subsidy of colonial administration in Uganda, while in Kenya the white settlers required continuing subsidies by the home government.\n\nThe income generated by cotton sales made the Buganda kingdom relatively prosperous, compared with the rest of colonial Uganda, although before [[World War I]] cotton was also being grown in the eastern regions of [[Busoga]], [[Lango sub-region|Lango]], and [[Teso sub-region|Teso]]. Many Baganda spent their new earnings on imported clothing, bicycles, metal roofing, and even cars. They also invested in their children's education. The Christian missions emphasized literacy skills, and African converts quickly learned to read and write. By 1911 two popular journals, ''Ebifa'' (News) and ''Munno'' (Your Friend), were published monthly in Luganda.\n\nHeavily supported by African funds, new schools were soon turning out graduating classes at Mengo High School, St. Mary's Kisubi, Namilyango, Gayaza, and [[King's College Budo]] \u2014 all in Buganda. The chief minister of the Buganda kingdom, Sir [[Apolo Kaggwa]], personally awarded a bicycle to the top graduate at [[King's College Budo]], together with the promise of a government job. The schools, in fact, had inherited the educational function formerly performed in the [[Kabaka of Buganda|Kabaka]]'s palace, where generations of young pages had been trained to become chiefs. Now the qualifications sought were literacy and skills, including typing and English translation.\n\nTwo important principles of precolonial political life carried over into the colonial era: clientage, whereby ambitious younger officeholders attached themselves to older high-ranking chiefs, and generational conflict, which resulted when the younger generation sought to expel their elders from office in order to replace them. After World War I, the younger aspirants to high office in Buganda became impatient with the seemingly perpetual tenure of Sir Apolo and his contemporaries, who lacked many of the skills that members of the younger generation had acquired through schooling. Calling themselves the [[Young Baganda Association]], members of the new generation attached themselves to the young kabaka, [[Daudi Chwa]], who was the figurehead ruler of Buganda under indirect rule. But Kabaka Daudi never gained real political power, and after a short and frustrating reign, he died at the relatively young age of forty-three.\n\n===First World War era military forces===\nEarly on in the Protectorate's history of occupation the British colonial government had recognised the need for a local defence force.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lwanga-Luwyiigo|first1=Sanwiri|title=The Colonial Roots of Internal Conflict in Uganda|date=25 September 1987|issue=Makerere University|page=8|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1412/ISIC%2017-The%20colonial%20roots%20of%20internal%20conflict%20in%20Uganda%20-%20331408.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In 1895 the British colonial armed force in the Protectorate was the Uganda Rifles, who were formed as an internal security force (i.e. keeping the peace in tribal areas rather than defending against external aggression).<ref>{{cite book|last1=Omara-Otunnu|first1=Amii|title=Politics and the Military in Uganda, 1890\u20131985|date=1987|publisher=Springer|isbn=9781349187362|pages=19\u201321|url=https://books.google.com/?id=I9evCwAAQBAJ&pg=PA19&lpg=PA19&dq=%22Uganda+Rifles%22#v=onepage|accessdate=13 June 2017|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lwanga-Luwyiigo|first1=Sanwiri|title=The Colonial Roots of Internal Conflict in Uganda|date=25 September 1987|issue=Makerere University|page=7|url=https://opendocs.ids.ac.uk/opendocs/bitstream/handle/123456789/1412/ISIC%2017-The%20colonial%20roots%20of%20internal%20conflict%20in%20Uganda%20-%20331408.pdf?sequence=1|accessdate=13 June 2017}}</ref> In the late 19th Century the local defence force was largely composed of Sudanese troops brought in by the British, these troops were commanded by a mix of British and Sudanese officers, local tribes were not that evident in this force defending the interests of the [[Imperial British East Africa Company]].

The British colonial administration had also fought with the Lamogi clan of the Acholi People in what that culminated in to the Lamogi Rebellion.\n\n==1920 to 1961==\n{{Uganda Protectorate imagemap}}\nFar more promising as a source of political support were the British colonial officers, who welcomed the typing and translation skills of school graduates and advanced the careers of their favourites. The contest was decided after World War I, when an influx of British ex-military officers, now serving as district commissioners, began to feel that self-government was an obstacle to good government. Specifically, they accused Sir Apolo and his generation of inefficiency, abuse of power, and failure to keep adequate financial accounts\u2014charges that were not hard to document.\n\nSir Apolo resigned in 1926, at about the same time that a host of elderly Baganda chiefs were replaced by a new generation of officeholders. The Buganda treasury was also audited that year for the first time. Although it was not a nationalist organization, the Young Baganda Association claimed to represent popular African dissatisfaction with the old order. As soon as the younger Baganda had replaced the older generation in office, however, their objections to privilege accompanying power ceased. The pattern persisted in Ugandan politics up to and after independence.\n\nThe commoners, who had been labouring on the cotton estates of the chiefs before World War I, did not remain servile. As time passed, they bought small parcels of land from their erstwhile landlords. This land fragmentation was aided by the British, who in 1927 forced the chiefs to limit severely the rents and obligatory labour they could demand from their tenants. Thus the oligarchy of landed chiefs who had emerged with the Buganda Agreement of 1900 declined in importance, and agricultural production shifted to independent smallholders, who grew cotton, and later coffee, for the export market.\n\nUnlike [[Tanganyika]], which was devastated during the prolonged fighting between Britain and Germany in the [[East African Campaign of World War I]], Uganda prospered from wartime agricultural production. After the population losses from disease during the era of conquest and at the turn of the century (particularly the devastating [[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]] epidemic of 1900- 1906), Uganda's population was growing again. Even the 1930s depression seemed to affect smallholder cash farmers in Uganda less severely than it did the white settler producers in Kenya. Ugandans simply grew their own food until rising prices made export crops attractive again.\n\nTwo issues continued to create grievance through the 1930s and 1940s. The colonial government strictly regulated the buying and processing of cash crops, setting prices and reserving the role of intermediary for Asians, who were thought to be more efficient. The British and Asians firmly repelled African attempts to break into cotton ginning. In addition, on the Asian-owned sugar plantations established in the 1920s, labour for sugar-cane and other cash crops was increasingly provided by migrants from peripheral areas of Uganda and even from outside Uganda.\n\n==Independence==\nIn 1949 discontented Baganda rioted and burned down the houses of pro-government chiefs. The rioters had three demands: the right to bypass government price controls on the export sales of cotton, the removal of the Asian monopoly over cotton ginning, and the right to have their own representatives in local government replace chiefs appointed by the British. They were critical as well of the young kabaka, [[Mutesa II|Frederick Walugembe Mutesa II]] (also known as \"King Freddie\" or \"Kabaka Freddie\"), for his inattention to the needs of his people. The British governor, Sir [[John Hall (colonial administrator)|John Hall]], regarded the riots as the work of communist-inspired agitators and rejected the suggested reforms.\n\n[[File:BEA-KUT 1958 MiNr0094I pm B002.jpg|thumb|200px|Stamp of British East Africa with a portrait of [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]]]]\nFar from leading the people into confrontation, Uganda's would-be agitators were slow to respond to popular discontent. Nevertheless, the [[Uganda African Farmers Union]], founded by [[I.K. Musazi]] in 1947, was blamed for the riots and was banned by the British. Musazi's [[Uganda National Congress]] replaced the farmers union in 1952 when it was set up with [[Abu Mayanja]] as its first Secretary General, but because the congress remained a casual discussion group more than an organized political party, it stagnated and came to an end just two years after its inception.\n\nMeanwhile, the British began to move ahead of the Ugandans in preparing for independence. The effects of Britain's postwar withdrawal from [[India]], the march of nationalism in [[West Africa]], and a more liberal philosophy in the [[Colonial Office]] geared toward future self-rule all began to be felt in Uganda. The embodiment of these issues arrived in 1952 in the person of a new and energetic reformist governor, [[Andrew Cohen (statesman)|Sir Andrew Cohen]] (formerly undersecretary for African affairs in the Colonial Office).\n\nCohen set about preparing Uganda for independence. On the economic side, he removed obstacles to African cotton ginning, rescinded price discrimination against African-grown coffee, encouraged cooperatives, and established the [[Uganda Development Corporation]] to promote and finance new projects. On the political side, he reorganized the Legislative Council, which had consisted of an unrepresentative selection of interest groups heavily favouring the European community, to include African representatives elected from districts throughout Uganda. This system became a prototype for the future parliament.\n\n===Power politics in Buganda===\nThe prospect of elections caused a sudden proliferation of new political parties. This development alarmed the old-guard leaders within the Uganda kingdoms, because they realized that the centre of power would be at the national level. The spark that ignited wider opposition to Governor Cohen's reforms was a 1953 speech in London in which the secretary of state for colonies referred to the possibility of a federation of the three East African territories (Kenya, Uganda, and Tanganyika), similar to that established in central Africa.\n\nMany Ugandans were aware of the [[Central African Federation]] of [[Rhodesia]] and [[Nyasaland]] (later [[Zimbabwe]], [[Zambia]], and [[Malawi]]) and its domination by white settler interests. Ugandans deeply feared the prospect of an East African federation dominated by the settlers of Kenya, which was then in the midst of the bitter [[Mau Mau]] uprising. They had vigorously resisted a similar suggestion by the 1930 [[Hilton Young Commission]]. Confidence in Cohen vanished just as the governor was preparing to urge Buganda to recognize that its special status would have to be sacrificed in the interests of a new and larger nation-state.\n\nMutesa II, who had been regarded by his subjects as uninterested in their welfare, now refused to cooperate with Cohen's plan for an integrated Buganda. Instead, he demanded that Buganda be separated from the rest of the protectorate and transferred to Foreign Office jurisdiction. Cohen's response to this crisis was to deport the kabaka to a comfortable exile in London. His forced departure made the kabaka an instant martyr in the eyes of the Baganda, whose latent separatism and anticolonial sentiments set off a storm of protest. Cohen's action had backfired, and he could find no one among the Baganda prepared or able to mobilize support for his schemes. After two frustrating years of unrelenting Ganda hostility and obstruction, Cohen was forced to reinstate [[Kabaka Freddie]].\n\nThe negotiations leading to the kabaka's return had an outcome similar to the negotiations of Commissioner Johnston in 1900; although appearing to satisfy the British, they were a resounding victory for the Baganda. Cohen secured the kabaka's agreement not to oppose independence within the larger Uganda framework. Not only was the kabaka reinstated in return, but for the first time since 1889, the monarch was given the power to appoint and dismiss his chiefs (Buganda government officials) instead of acting as a mere figurehead while they conducted the affairs of government.\n\nThe kabaka's new power was cloaked in the misleading claim that he would be only a \"constitutional monarch\", while in fact he was a leading player in deciding how Uganda would be governed. A new grouping of Baganda calling themselves \"the King's Friends\" rallied to the kabaka's defence. They were conservative, fiercely loyal to Buganda as a kingdom, and willing to entertain the prospect of participation in an independent Uganda only if it were headed by the kabaka. Baganda politicians who did not share this vision or who were opposed to the \"King's Friends\" found themselves branded as the \"King's Enemies\", which meant political and social ostracism.\n\nThe major exception to this rule were the Roman Catholic Baganda who had formed their own party, the [[Democratic Party (Uganda)|Democratic Party]] (DP), led by [[Benedicto Kiwanuka]]. Many Catholics had felt excluded from the Protestant-dominated establishment in Buganda ever since Lugard's Maxim had turned the tide in 1892. The kabaka had to be Protestant, and he was invested in a coronation ceremony modelled on that of British monarchs (who are invested by the Church of England's Archbishop of Canterbury) that took place at the main Protestant church. Religion and politics were equally inseparable in the other kingdoms throughout Uganda. The DP had Catholic as well as other adherents and was probably the best organized of all the parties preparing for elections. It had printing presses and the backing of the popular newspaper, Munno, which was published at the St. Mary's Kisubi mission.\n\nElsewhere in Uganda, the emergence of the kabaka as a political force provoked immediate hostility. Political parties and local interest groups were riddled with divisions and rivalries, but they shared one concern: they were determined not to be dominated by Buganda. In 1960 a political organizer from Lango, [[Milton Obote]], seized the initiative and formed a new party, the [[Uganda People's Congress]] (UPC), as a coalition of all those outside the Roman Catholic-dominated DP who opposed Buganda hegemony.\n\nThe steps Cohen had initiated to bring about the independence of a unified Uganda state had led to a polarization between factions from Buganda and those opposed to its domination. Buganda's population in 1959 was 2 million, out of Uganda's total of 6 million. Even discounting the many non-Baganda resident in Buganda, there were at least 1 million people who owed allegiance to the kabaka\u2014too many to be overlooked or shunted aside, but too few to dominate the country as a whole.\n\nAt the London Conference of 1960, it was obvious that Buganda autonomy and a strong unitary government were incompatible, but no compromise emerged, and the decision on the form of government was postponed. The British announced that elections would be held in March 1961 for \"responsible government\", the next-to-last stage of preparation before the formal granting of independence. It was assumed that those winning the election would gain valuable experience in office, preparing them for the probable responsibility of governing after independence.\n\nIn Buganda the \"King's Friends\" urged a total boycott of the election because their attempts to secure promises of future autonomy had been rebuffed. Consequently, when the voters went to the polls throughout Uganda to elect eighty-two [[National Assembly of Uganda|National Assembly]] members, in Buganda only the Roman Catholic supporters of the DP braved severe public pressure and voted, capturing twenty of Buganda's twenty-one allotted seats. This artificial situation gave the DP a majority of seats, although they had a minority of 416,000 votes nationwide versus 495,000 for the UPC. Benedicto Kiwanuka became the new chief minister of Uganda.\n\nShocked by the results, the Baganda separatists, who formed a political party called [[Kabaka Yekka]], had second thoughts about the wisdom of their election boycott. They quickly welcomed the recommendations of a British commission that proposed a future federal form of government. According to these recommendations, Buganda would enjoy a measure of internal autonomy if it participated fully in the national government.\n\nFor its part, the UPC was equally anxious to eject its DP rivals from government before they became entrenched. Obote reached an understanding with Kabaka Freddie and the KY, accepting Buganda's special federal relationship and even a provision by which the kabaka could appoint Buganda's representatives to the National Assembly, in return for a strategic alliance to defeat the DP. The Kabaka was also promised the largely ceremonial position of Head of state of Uganda, which was of great symbolic importance to the Baganda.\n\nThis marriage of convenience between the UPC and the KY made inevitable the defeat of the DP interim administration. In the aftermath of the April 1962 final election leading up to independence, Uganda's national assembly consisted of forty-three UPC members, twenty-four KY members, and twenty-four DP members.

He was sentenced to 100 years in prison before being released in 2014 after serving almost 28 years.\n\nIn 1924, Christopher Furnari was born in New York to first-generation Sicilian-[[Italians|Italian]] emigrants from [[Furnari]], a commune in the [[Province of Messina]] in [[Sicily]]. By age 15, Furnari was managing his own [[loanshark]] operations in [[Brooklyn]] and Northern [[New Jersey]]. By 1943, the 19-year-old Furnari had already served two prison terms for armed robbery. Furnari was also sentenced to 15 to 30 years  \nafter he and several other youths were arrested with 3 girls in a car and charged with rape.\n\nIn 1956, Furnari was released from prison on [[parole]]. Furnari became an associate of [[Gaetano Lucchese|Gaetano \"Tommy Three-Finger Brown\" Lucchese]]'s crime family through Furnari's connection with mobster [[Anthony Corallo]]. During the late 1950s, Furnari became involved in [[illegal gambling]] and loansharking.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Furnari soon became an influential member of the Brooklyn faction of the family and was earning $25,000 a day. In 1962, at age 38, Furnari became a [[made man]] in the Lucchese family. In 1964, Furnari became a caporegime.\n\nThe Lucchese powerbase was traditionally in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]], the family's birthplace; the family's first three bosses, [[Gaetano Reina|Gaetano \"Tom\" Reina]], [[Tommy Gagliano|Tommaso \"Tommy\" Gagliano]], and Thomas Lucchese, were all from this area. In contrast, Furnari belonged to the less influential Brooklyn faction. Furnari operated his crew in [[Bensonhurst]] at the 19th Hole, a nondescript bar and mob social club.  His crew was involved in illegal gambling,<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> [[loansharking]],<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20060103112838/http://www.geocities.com/mafia_genius2004/1986mobsters.html</ref> extortion, burglary, narcotics dealing, occasional murder contracts, & union & construction rackets.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> At this time, Furnari's criminal record included convictions for assault and sex offenses.\n\nFurnari controlled New York District Council 9, which represented 6,000 workers who painted and decorated hotels, bridges, and subway stations in New York. Furnari managed the Council through the union secretary and treasurer, James Bishop, and Bishop's associate, Frank Arnold. Bishop and Arnold would pick up cash payments from the contractors, who charged a 10 to 15 percent tax on all major commercial painting jobs, and passed the payments to Furnari.\n\nThe 19th Hole, Furnari's social club, was the hub of criminal activity in Bensonhurst. Mobsters from every New York crime family conducted business in the club and socialized over food and drink. In the mid 1960s, aspiring mobsters [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]] joined Furnari's crew. Furnari saw that both men could make money and were willing to use violence if needed. Furnari put Amuso and Casso in charge of a large bookmaking operation and debt collecting operation.\n\nIn 1967, family boss Thomas Lucchese died of a [[brain tumor]], leaving the family to be run by an interim boss, [[Carmine Tramunti|Carmine \"Mr. Gribbs\" Tramunti]].<ref name=\"funeral\">Clines, Francis X.

Tramunti served as acting boss, even after Corallo was released from prison in 1970. In 1973, with Tramunti's imprisonment, Corallo finally became the official Lucchese boss.\n\nIn the early 1970s the [[Five Families]] of New York organized crime decided to \"open the books', allowing a new generation of mob associates to become [[made men]]. Furnari immediately sponsored Amuso and Casso for family membership and then made them overseers of the \"Bypass Gang\", a highly successful burglary ring. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Bypass Gang reportedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, jewelry, and other merchandise.\n\nIn January 1972, Furnari backed and sanctioned the squad of armed robbers who took the famed Pierre Hotel in Manhattan under siege and stole approximately $3 million  in jewels and cash. The [[Pierre Hotel robbery]] stands as the largest unrecovered hotel robbery in history. None of the perpetrators ever confessed to the heist, and only a diamond necklace valued at $780,000 was recovered. The case was never solved. The eight brazen armed robbers were: Robert Comfort, Sammy Nalo, Donald 'Tony the Greek', Al Green, Ali Ben, Bobby Germain, and Al Visconti.\n\nIn 1980, Furnari was promoted to [[consigliere]] in the Lucchese family.  He wanted Casso to take over as capo of the 19th Hole crew, but Casso declined and endorsed Amuso instead.  Casso opted to become Furnari's aide; a consigliere is allowed to have one soldier work directly for him.\n\nFurnari now enjoyed enormous influence both within his own family, the other New York families, and crime families from other US cities. Furnari continued to oversee his criminal interests from the 19th Hole, but spent much of his time providing advise and mediation for family members as well as settling disputes with the other families. Furnari reigned as one of New York's top Mafia bosses throughout the early 1980s until his 1985 racketeering indictment.\n\nOn February 25, 1985, Furnari was indicted in the [[Mafia Commission Trial|Mafia Commission]] case, the most comprehensive [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) prosecution brought against the mob at the time.<ref name=\"bosses arraigned\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H|title=Reputed Crime Bosses Arraigned|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/nyregion/reputed-crime-bosses-arraigned.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 1, 1985}}</ref> Furnari was indicted as a result of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) probe that used undercover surveillance and bugging techniques against the mob leaders. The bug that snared Furnari had been placed in [[Salvatore Avellino]]'s [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] car. FBI surveillance recorded Corallo conducting business with Furnari and other family leaders. Pleading not guilty to the charges, Furnari was released on $1.75 million bail pending trial.<ref name=\"11 plead\">{{cite news|title=11 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO RULING ORGANIZED CRIME IN NEW YORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/nyregion/11-plead-not-guilty-to-ruling-organized-crime-in-new-york.html?scp=2&sq=%22Christopher%20Furnari%22&st=cse|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1986, while Furnari was awaiting the Commission trial, the Lucchese family uncovered a new, protentially lucrative racket. A Russian-American [[crime family]] based in [[Brighton Beach]] in Brooklyn, run by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrant [[Marat Balagula]], had started to [[counterfeit|bootleg]] gasoline. By collecting gasoline taxes from customers and then not paying them to the government, Balagula was making very large profits. When [[Colombo crime family]] capo [[Michael Franzese]] started pressing Balagula for extortion payments, Balagula went to Furnari for help. Casso later reported on a meeting at the 19th Hole, in which Furnari told Balagula, \n\n<blockquote>Here there's enough for everybody to be happy... to leave the table satisfied. What we must avoid is trouble between us and the other families. I propose to make a deal with the others so there's no bad blood.... Meanwhile, we will send word out that from now on you and your people are with the Lucchese family. No one will bother you. If anyone does bother you, come to us and Anthony will take care of it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlo|2008|p=120}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the 19th Hole meeting, the [[Five Families]] imposed a two cent per gallon \"Family tax\" on Balagula's bootlegging operation, which became their greatest moneymaker after [[drug trafficking]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=53}}</ref> According to one former associate, \n\n<blockquote>The LCN reminded Marat of the [[apparatchik]]s in the [[Soviet Union]]. He thought as long as he gave them something they would be valuable allies. Then all of a sudden he was at risk of being killed if he couldn't pay to the penny.<ref>Robert Friedman, \"Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob has Invaded America,\" 2000. Pages 53-54.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author [[Philip Carlo]], \n\n<blockquote>It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls -- he was a ruthless killer when necessary -- but he also was a smart diplomatic administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off the proverbial map.<ref>Philip Carlo, \"Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\" 2008, page 152.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn June 12, 1986, one of Balagula's rivals, Russian gangster [[Vladimir Reznikov]], entered Balagula's nightclub in Brighton Beach. Reznikov pushed a [[9mm]] [[Beretta]] handgun against Balagula's skull and demanded $600,000 and a percentage of Balagula's rackets.

He insisted, however, on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt safer. At home, Balagula asked Casso to come help him.

According to Casso, \"After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1986, Furnari went on trial in the famous New York Mafia Commission case along with Corallo and underboss [[Salvatore Santoro|Salvatore \"Tom Mix\" Santoro]]. The charges included extortion and labor racketeering within the construction industry and murder for hire of former [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Carmine Galante|Carmine \"Lilo\" Galante]]. Galante had been gunned down on July 12, 1979 allegedly on the orders of the Commission. Some have argued that Furnari wasn't on the Commission then and had no connection with the Galante hit. However, Furnari could not use this as a defense argument.\n\nBy the fall of 1986, Corallo realized that he, Santoro and Furnari would not only be convicted, but were facing sentences that would all but assure they would die in prison. Furnari persuaded Corallo that either Amuso or Casso should become the new boss. At a meeting in Furnari's home, Furnari, Amuso and Casso all agreed that Amuso should succeed Corallo as boss.\n\nOn November 19, 1986 Furnari was convicted on all counts, including the Galante murder.<ref name=\"convicts 8\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title=U.S. JURY CONVICTS EIGHT AS MEMBERS OF MOB COMMISSION|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/20/nyregion/us-jury-convicts-eight-as-members-of-mob-commission.html?scp=1&sq=%22Mafia%20Commission%22%20trial&st=cse|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1986}}</ref> On January 13, 1987, Furnari was sentenced to 100 years in prison without parole and fined $240,000.<ref name=federal/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/14/nyregion/judge-sentences-8-mafia-leaders-to-prison-terms.html?scp=11&sq=Christopher%20Furnari&st=cse \"JUDGE SENTENCES 8 MAFIA LEADERS TO PRISON TERMS\"] By ARNOLD H.

In 1993, Casso was also captured; however, in 1994 he struck a deal with the government to testify against Furnari and other family leaders.\n\nIn 1995, Furnari started challenging the \"no parole\" stipulation of his sentence in court. The government had previously revoked Casso's witness deal with prosecutors, and in 1996 Casso was sentenced to life in prison. Furnari's lawyers insisted that Casso's court testimony against Furnari was tainted.\n\nIn July 2000, the [[Third Circuit]] Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the parole board officials had been denying Furnari's parole eligibility on the tainted assertions of mob turncoat Casso. However, in 2001, the [[Bureau of Prisons]] National Appeal Board ruled that Furnari was a multiple murderer and was not eligible for [[parole]], based on what some people considered to be Casso's discredited testimony. On February 15, 2006, Furnari filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in District Court claiming that the United States parole commission improperly had denied him parole. On June 20, 2007, the court denied his petition.\n\nFurnari was imprisoned in the Allenwood Medium [[Federal Correctional Institution]] (FCI) in [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"inmate locator\">{{cite web|title=Christopher Furnari|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=Christopher+&Middle=&LastName=Furnari&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=20&y=12|work=Bureau of Prisons inmate Locator|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> His projected release date was November 24, 2044, effectively a life sentence.

Born in 1934, DeFede grew up in the [[Queens]] borough of New York City.  In his early days, he operated a hot dog vendor truck in [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], running [[Numbers game|numbers rackets]] on the side.  A close friend and [[American handball|handball]] partner of Lucchese leader [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]], DeFede was inducted into the family in 1986 after Amuso became boss.  \n\nDeFede's rise and fall in the New York mob can all be attributed to Amuso. In 1994, Amuso was convicted of federal [[racketeering]] and murder charges and sent to prison for life. Amuso then named DeFede his acting boss to replace [[Alphonse D'Arco]] with a weaker and more controllable man at the top, after D'Arco became a government witness. \n\nOn April 28, 1998, DeFede was indicted on nine counts of racketeering stemming from his supervision of the family rackets in New York's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] from 1991 to 1996.  The prosecution reported that the Lucchese family had been grossing $40,000 per month from Garment District businesses since the mid-1980s.  In December 1998, DeFede pleaded guilty to the charges and received five years in prison.\n\nDuring the late '90s, Amuso's relationship with DeFede began to sour. Suspecting that DeFede was hiding money from the family, Amuso replaced him as acting boss with [[Steven Crea]], head of the family's powerful [[Bronx]] faction. Once Crea took over, family profits rose enormously. That was enough to convince Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits; Amuso reportedly decided to have him murdered.\n\nOn February 5, 2002, DeFede was released from a [[Lexington, Kentucky]] prison medical center. Having heard of Amuso's plans to kill him, DeFede immediately became a government informant. DeFede provided details concerning the Garment District rackets and the protection rackets in [[Howard Beach, Queens]]. He also provided information leading to the convictions of Crea, [[Louis Daidone]], Dominic Truscello, Joseph Tangorra, [[Anthony Baratta (organized criminal)|Anthony Baratta]], and a number of family captains, soldiers and associates.  While testifying against [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[Peter Gotti]], DeFede testified that he only earned  $1,014,000, or approximately $250,000 per year, during his tenure as acting boss.

He was sentenced to 100 years in prison before being released in 2014 after serving almost 28 years.\n\nIn 1924, Christopher Furnari was born in New York to first-generation Sicilian-[[Italians|Italian]] emigrants from [[Furnari]], a commune in the [[Province of Messina]] in [[Sicily]]. By age 15, Furnari was managing his own [[loanshark]] operations in [[Brooklyn]] and Northern [[New Jersey]]. By 1943, the 19-year-old Furnari had already served two prison terms for armed robbery. Furnari was also sentenced to 15 to 30 years  \nafter he and several other youths were arrested with 3 girls in a car and charged with rape.\n\nIn 1956, Furnari was released from prison on [[parole]]. Furnari became an associate of [[Gaetano Lucchese|Gaetano \"Tommy Three-Finger Brown\" Lucchese]]'s crime family through Furnari's connection with mobster [[Anthony Corallo]]. During the late 1950s, Furnari became involved in [[illegal gambling]] and loansharking.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> Furnari soon became an influential member of the Brooklyn faction of the family and was earning $25,000 a day. In 1962, at age 38, Furnari became a [[made man]] in the Lucchese family. In 1964, Furnari became a caporegime.\n\nThe Lucchese powerbase was traditionally in [[Manhattan]] and [[the Bronx]], the family's birthplace; the family's first three bosses, [[Gaetano Reina|Gaetano \"Tom\" Reina]], [[Tommy Gagliano|Tommaso \"Tommy\" Gagliano]], and Thomas Lucchese, were all from this area. In contrast, Furnari belonged to the less influential Brooklyn faction. Furnari operated his crew in [[Bensonhurst]] at the 19th Hole, a nondescript bar and mob social club.  His crew was involved in illegal gambling,<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> [[loansharking]],<ref name=\"web.archive.org\">https://web.archive.org/web/20060103112838/http://www.geocities.com/mafia_genius2004/1986mobsters.html</ref> extortion, burglary, narcotics dealing, occasional murder contracts, & union & construction rackets.<ref name=\"web.archive.org\"/> At this time, Furnari's criminal record included convictions for assault and sex offenses.\n\nFurnari controlled New York District Council 9, which represented 6,000 workers who painted and decorated hotels, bridges, and subway stations in New York. Furnari managed the Council through the union secretary and treasurer, James Bishop, and Bishop's associate, Frank Arnold. Bishop and Arnold would pick up cash payments from the contractors, who charged a 10 to 15 percent tax on all major commercial painting jobs, and passed the payments to Furnari.\n\nThe 19th Hole, Furnari's social club, was the hub of criminal activity in Bensonhurst. Mobsters from every New York crime family conducted business in the club and socialized over food and drink. In the mid 1960s, aspiring mobsters [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]] and [[Anthony Casso|Anthony \"Gaspipe\" Casso]] joined Furnari's crew. Furnari saw that both men could make money and were willing to use violence if needed. Furnari put Amuso and Casso in charge of a large bookmaking operation and debt collecting operation.\n\nIn 1967, family boss Thomas Lucchese died of a [[brain tumor]], leaving the family to be run by an interim boss, [[Carmine Tramunti|Carmine \"Mr. Gribbs\" Tramunti]].<ref name=\"funeral\">Clines, Francis X.

Police Record A Mafia Funeral - Mourners at Services for Luchese Are Photographed] (July 16, 1967) New York Times</ref>  Lucchese's real successor, [[Anthony Corallo|Anthony \"Tony Ducks\" Corallo]], was convicted of bribery in 1967 and sentenced in 1968 to prison for two years. Tramunti served as acting boss, even after Corallo was released from prison in 1970. In 1973, with Tramunti's imprisonment, Corallo finally became the official Lucchese boss.\n\nIn the early 1970s the [[Five Families]] of New York organized crime decided to \"open the books', allowing a new generation of mob associates to become [[made men]]. Furnari immediately sponsored Amuso and Casso for family membership and then made them overseers of the \"Bypass Gang\", a highly successful burglary ring. During the 1970s and 1980s, the Bypass Gang reportedly stole hundreds of millions of dollars in cash, jewelry, and other merchandise.\n\nIn January 1972, Furnari backed and sanctioned the squad of armed robbers who took the famed Pierre Hotel in Manhattan under siege and stole approximately $3 million  in jewels and cash. The [[Pierre Hotel robbery]] stands as the largest unrecovered hotel robbery in history. None of the perpetrators ever confessed to the heist, and only a diamond necklace valued at $780,000 was recovered. The case was never solved. The eight brazen armed robbers were: Robert Comfort, Sammy Nalo, Donald 'Tony the Greek', Al Green, Ali Ben, Bobby Germain, and Al Visconti.\n\nIn 1980, Furnari was promoted to [[consigliere]] in the Lucchese family.  He wanted Casso to take over as capo of the 19th Hole crew, but Casso declined and endorsed Amuso instead.  Casso opted to become Furnari's aide; a consigliere is allowed to have one soldier work directly for him.\n\nFurnari now enjoyed enormous influence both within his own family, the other New York families, and crime families from other US cities. Furnari continued to oversee his criminal interests from the 19th Hole, but spent much of his time providing advise and mediation for family members as well as settling disputes with the other families. Furnari reigned as one of New York's top Mafia bosses throughout the early 1980s until his 1985 racketeering indictment.\n\nOn February 25, 1985, Furnari was indicted in the [[Mafia Commission Trial|Mafia Commission]] case, the most comprehensive [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) prosecution brought against the mob at the time.<ref name=\"bosses arraigned\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H|title=Reputed Crime Bosses Arraigned|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/03/01/nyregion/reputed-crime-bosses-arraigned.html|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 1, 1985}}</ref> Furnari was indicted as a result of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) probe that used undercover surveillance and bugging techniques against the mob leaders. The bug that snared Furnari had been placed in [[Salvatore Avellino]]'s [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar]] car. FBI surveillance recorded Corallo conducting business with Furnari and other family leaders. Pleading not guilty to the charges, Furnari was released on $1.75 million bail pending trial.<ref name=\"11 plead\">{{cite news|title=11 PLEAD NOT GUILTY TO RULING ORGANIZED CRIME IN NEW YORK|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/07/02/nyregion/11-plead-not-guilty-to-ruling-organized-crime-in-new-york.html?scp=2&sq=%22Christopher%20Furnari%22&st=cse|accessdate=19 November 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=July 2, 1985}}</ref>\n\nIn early 1986, while Furnari was awaiting the Commission trial, the Lucchese family uncovered a new, protentially lucrative racket. A Russian-American [[crime family]] based in [[Brighton Beach]] in Brooklyn, run by [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] immigrant [[Marat Balagula]], had started to [[counterfeit|bootleg]] gasoline. By collecting gasoline taxes from customers and then not paying them to the government, Balagula was making very large profits. When [[Colombo crime family]] capo [[Michael Franzese]] started pressing Balagula for extortion payments, Balagula went to Furnari for help. Casso later reported on a meeting at the 19th Hole, in which Furnari told Balagula, \n\n<blockquote>Here there's enough for everybody to be happy... to leave the table satisfied. What we must avoid is trouble between us and the other families. I propose to make a deal with the others so there's no bad blood.... Meanwhile, we will send word out that from now on you and your people are with the Lucchese family. No one will bother you. If anyone does bother you, come to us and Anthony will take care of it.<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlo|2008|p=120}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAs a result of the 19th Hole meeting, the [[Five Families]] imposed a two cent per gallon \"Family tax\" on Balagula's bootlegging operation, which became their greatest moneymaker after [[drug trafficking]].<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=53}}</ref> According to one former associate, \n\n<blockquote>The LCN reminded Marat of the [[apparatchik]]s in the [[Soviet Union]]. He thought as long as he gave them something they would be valuable allies. Then all of a sudden he was at risk of being killed if he couldn't pay to the penny.<ref>Robert Friedman, \"Red Mafiya: How the Russian Mob has Invaded America,\" 2000. Pages 53-54.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to author [[Philip Carlo]], \n\n<blockquote>It didn't take long for word on the street to reach the Russian underworld: Marat Balagula was paying off the Italians; Balagula was a punk; Balagula had no balls. Balagula's days were numbered. This, of course, was the beginning of serious trouble. Balagula did in fact have balls -- he was a ruthless killer when necessary -- but he also was a smart diplomatic administrator and he knew that the combined, concerted force of the Italian crime families would quickly wipe the newly arrived Russian competition off the proverbial map.<ref>Philip Carlo, \"Gaspipe: Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\" 2008, page 152.</ref></blockquote>\n\nOn June 12, 1986, one of Balagula's rivals, Russian gangster [[Vladimir Reznikov]], entered Balagula's nightclub in Brighton Beach. Reznikov pushed a [[9mm]] [[Beretta]] handgun against Balagula's skull and demanded $600,000 and a percentage of Balagula's rackets. After Balagula acceded to his demands, Reznikov told him, \"Fuck with me and you're dead -- you and your whole fucking family; I swear I'll fuck and kill your wife as you watch -- you understand?\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Carlo|2008|p=153}}</ref>\n\nAfter Reznikov left the nightclub, Balagula suffered a massive [[heart attack]]. He insisted, however, on being treated at his home in Brighton Beach, where he felt safer. At home, Balagula asked Casso to come help him. Casso gave these instructions to Balagula, \"Send word to Vladimir that you have his money, that he should come to the club tomorrow. We'll take care of the rest.\"<ref>Philip Carlo, \"Gaspipe: The Confessions of a Mafia Boss,\" 2008, page 154.</ref> Casso also requested a photograph of Reznikov and a description of his car.\n\nThe next day, Reznikov arrived at Balagula's nightclub to pick up his money. Lucchese soldier [[Joseph Testa]] confronted Reznikov and fatally shot him. According to Casso, \"After that, Marat didn't have any problems with other Russians.\"<ref>{{Harvnb|Friedman|2000|p=55}}</ref>\n\nIn September 1986, Furnari went on trial in the famous New York Mafia Commission case along with Corallo and underboss [[Salvatore Santoro|Salvatore \"Tom Mix\" Santoro]]. The charges included extortion and labor racketeering within the construction industry and murder for hire of former [[Bonanno crime family]] boss [[Carmine Galante|Carmine \"Lilo\" Galante]]. Galante had been gunned down on July 12, 1979 allegedly on the orders of the Commission. Some have argued that Furnari wasn't on the Commission then and had no connection with the Galante hit. However, Furnari could not use this as a defense argument.\n\nBy the fall of 1986, Corallo realized that he, Santoro and Furnari would not only be convicted, but were facing sentences that would all but assure they would die in prison. Furnari persuaded Corallo that either Amuso or Casso should become the new boss. At a meeting in Furnari's home, Furnari, Amuso and Casso all agreed that Amuso should succeed Corallo as boss.\n\nOn November 19, 1986 Furnari was convicted on all counts, including the Galante murder.<ref name=\"convicts 8\">{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title=U.S. JURY CONVICTS EIGHT AS MEMBERS OF MOB COMMISSION|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/20/nyregion/us-jury-convicts-eight-as-members-of-mob-commission.html?scp=1&sq=%22Mafia%20Commission%22%20trial&st=cse|accessdate=2 December 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=November 20, 1986}}</ref> On January 13, 1987, Furnari was sentenced to 100 years in prison without parole and fined $240,000.<ref name=federal/><ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/14/nyregion/judge-sentences-8-mafia-leaders-to-prison-terms.html?scp=11&sq=Christopher%20Furnari&st=cse \"JUDGE SENTENCES 8 MAFIA LEADERS TO PRISON TERMS\"] By ARNOLD H.

In 1993, Casso was also captured; however, in 1994 he struck a deal with the government to testify against Furnari and other family leaders.\n\nIn 1995, Furnari started challenging the \"no parole\" stipulation of his sentence in court. The government had previously revoked Casso's witness deal with prosecutors, and in 1996 Casso was sentenced to life in prison. Furnari's lawyers insisted that Casso's court testimony against Furnari was tainted.\n\nIn July 2000, the [[Third Circuit]] Federal Court of Appeals ruled that the parole board officials had been denying Furnari's parole eligibility on the tainted assertions of mob turncoat Casso. However, in 2001, the [[Bureau of Prisons]] National Appeal Board ruled that Furnari was a multiple murderer and was not eligible for [[parole]], based on what some people considered to be Casso's discredited testimony. On February 15, 2006, Furnari filed a [[habeas corpus]] petition in District Court claiming that the United States parole commission improperly had denied him parole. On June 20, 2007, the court denied his petition.\n\nFurnari was imprisoned in the Allenwood Medium [[Federal Correctional Institution]] (FCI) in [[Allenwood, Pennsylvania]].<ref name=\"inmate locator\">{{cite web|title=Christopher Furnari|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&needingMoreList=false&FirstName=Christopher+&Middle=&LastName=Furnari&Race=U&Sex=U&Age=&x=20&y=12|work=Bureau of Prisons inmate Locator|accessdate=19 November 2011}}</ref> His projected release date was November 24, 2044, effectively a life sentence.

Born in 1934, DeFede grew up in the [[Queens]] borough of New York City.  In his early days, he operated a hot dog vendor truck in [[Coney Island, Brooklyn]], running [[Numbers game|numbers rackets]] on the side.  A close friend and [[American handball|handball]] partner of Lucchese leader [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio \"Vic\" Amuso]], DeFede was inducted into the family in 1986 after Amuso became boss.  \n\nDeFede's rise and fall in the New York mob can all be attributed to Amuso. In 1994, Amuso was convicted of federal [[racketeering]] and murder charges and sent to prison for life. Amuso then named DeFede his acting boss to replace [[Alphonse D'Arco]] with a weaker and more controllable man at the top, after D'Arco became a government witness. \n\nOn April 28, 1998, DeFede was indicted on nine counts of racketeering stemming from his supervision of the family rackets in New York's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]] from 1991 to 1996.  The prosecution reported that the Lucchese family had been grossing $40,000 per month from Garment District businesses since the mid-1980s.  In December 1998, DeFede pleaded guilty to the charges and received five years in prison.\n\nDuring the late '90s, Amuso's relationship with DeFede began to sour. Suspecting that DeFede was hiding money from the family, Amuso replaced him as acting boss with [[Steven Crea]], head of the family's powerful [[Bronx]] faction. Once Crea took over, family profits rose enormously. That was enough to convince Amuso that DeFede had been skimming profits; Amuso reportedly decided to have him murdered.\n\nOn February 5, 2002, DeFede was released from a [[Lexington, Kentucky]] prison medical center. Having heard of Amuso's plans to kill him, DeFede immediately became a government informant. DeFede provided details concerning the Garment District rackets and the protection rackets in [[Howard Beach, Queens]].

Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThe Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\n==Early life and college career==\nJackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected.

And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach.

Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.\n\nOn September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that.

Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass). Jackson had a passer rating of 36.5, had a 50% completion rate (10-20 for 50 yards), one interception, and one fumble.  Packers quarterback Brett Favre only managed a slightly better 52% completion rate (26-50) and threw two interceptions.

Jackson missed three games because of injuries, which included a strained groin, a concussion and a fractured index finger. The Vikings failed to make the playoffs.

Born and raised in [[Montgomery, Alabama]], Jackson played [[college football]] at [[Arkansas Razorbacks football|Arkansas]] and [[Alabama State Hornets football|Alabama State]], and in the [[National Football League]] (NFL) for the [[Minnesota Vikings]], [[Seattle Seahawks]], and [[Buffalo Bills]].\n\nThe Vikings selected Jackson in the second round of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], and Jackson played for the Vikings from 2006 to 2010. A reserve quarterback for much of his time with the Vikings, Jackson was starting quarterback for the [[2007 Minnesota Vikings season|2007 season]] and part of the [[2008 Minnesota Vikings season|2008 season]], after which Jackson started the Vikings' [[2008-09 NFL playoffs#NFC: Philadelphia Eagles 26, Minnesota Vikings 14|Wild Card playoff game]]. In 2011, Jackson signed with the Seahawks and was starting quarterback for [[2011 Seattle Seahawks season|the 2011 season]]. Jackson was then traded to the Bills before the [[2012 NFL season]] but never played a game.  Jackson returned to the Seahawks in 2013. He was the backup quarterback for [[Russell Wilson]] during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] over the [[Denver Broncos]].\n\n==Early life and college career==\nJackson was born and raised in Montgomery, Alabama, and graduated from [[Sidney Lanier High School]] of Montgomery in 2001.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.montgomeryadvertiser.com/story/sports/college/rankinfile/2016/02/29/montgomery-native-tarvaris-jackson-talks-lanier-alabama-state-football/81114924/ |title=Montgomery native Tarvaris Jackson talks Lanier, ASU football |website=The Montgomery Advertiser |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref> Jackson then enrolled at the [[University of Arkansas]] and played three games for the [[Arkansas Razorbacks football]] team as a freshman but suffered a season-ending injury.

They were also impressed by his workout at the [[NFL Combine|scouting combine]] (among the top 5 quarterbacks in ball speed and the 40-yard dash). Several NFL teams, including the Vikings, had arranged secret workouts with him too. Jackson was selected with the last pick in the 2nd round (64th overall) of the [[2006 NFL Draft]], while he was projected to go much later, in the sixth or seventh round.<ref name=\"draft scout\"/> The Vikings traded two 3rd round picks to get the 2nd round pick with which they drafted Jackson, fearing he might get picked sooner than anticipated. Jackson's early selection caused some surprise, as he was the 5th quarterback taken and the 1st [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-AA]] player selected (the previous I-AA quarterback drafted was [[Spergon Wynn]] in 2000). He was also the first quarterback from Alabama State to be drafted into the NFL since Ricky Jones in 1992. Even Jackson was surprised by the pick, saying, \"I was more focused on [getting drafted in] the third round and even that was stretching it\".<ref>[http://www.onnidan.com/05-06/news/april/alst0429.htm Jackson's Reaction]. Jackson's reaction after getting drafted.</ref> Most pre-draft publications did not even have him listed as one of the top 10 eligible quarterbacks, while he was the 5th selected.

And that's exactly what I see with Tarvaris Jackson is a guy that's a piece of clay, that has all the skills in terms of, No. 1, what's he look like throwing the football?...He's got a great throwing motion; he's athletic.  He has all those things that we're looking for, and he's wired right. That's important for a quarterback. I think he's a flatline guy. I think he's a sponge. You're talking about a guy that never had a coach there as a quarterback coach.

Only one quarterback from his draft class ([[Jay Cutler (American football)|Jay Cutler]]) did better. He also showed great scrambling skills averaging 11.3 yards in rushing (the only Viking other than [[Brad Johnson (American football)|Brad Johnson]] to average more than 3.3 yards in rushing). [[ESPN]] analyst [[Mike Tirico]] referred to Jackson as a right-handed [[Michael Vick]]. His pre-season performance was enough to surpass second and third-string quarterbacks [[Mike McMahon (American football)|Mike McMahon]] and [[J. T. O'Sullivan]] on the depth chart. After the pre-season, McMahon and O'Sullivan were cut from the team and [[Brooks Bollinger]] was brought in, whom Jackson then competed against for the number two spot.\n\nOn September 25, 2006, Jackson had minor knee surgery to repair the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]] in his knee. He returned to limited practice after two weeks, and then came back to play his first NFL game with the Vikings in week 13 against the [[2006 Chicago Bears|Chicago Bears]]<ref>[http://www.twincities.com/mld/twincities/sports/15727620.htm HOME - TwinCities.com<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> in the fourth quarter after Johnson was benched for throwing four interceptions and backup quarterback Brooks Bollinger was injured. Jackson completed three of his four passes before fumbling the ball to Chicago and the Bears then ran the clock out. Following this game when Jackson was asked if he was ready to take over as starter he said \"Not really...We still have a chance to make the playoffs, so we're still trying to do that.

Although Johnson had not thrown an interception that game and had a respectable passer rating of 94.2 in the game, the Minnesota fans jeered Johnson throughout the game and chanted \"We want Jackson!\" at numerous points because Johnson had only thrown nine touchdowns all season (in 14 games) and had a career worst 71.9 passer rating throughout the season. Jackson received a standing ovation as he trotted out onto the field. A landmark in Jackson's career happened that game when Jackson completed his first touchdown pass to [[Mewelde Moore]]. Jackson threw 177 yards, one touchdown, and ran three times for 20 yards while the Jets protected their large lead. He also threw an interception in the red zone.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/200612170min.htm |title=New York Jets at Minnesota Vikings - December 17th, 2006 |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=June 26, 2019}}</ref>\n\nJackson was named the starting quarterback for Minnesota towards the end of his rookie season.  Jackson's first game was a week 16 night game against the [[2006 Green Bay Packers|Green Bay Packers]] at [[Lambeau Field]].  Game conditions were very poor.  A steady rain fell throughout the evening and the kickoff temperature was only 36 degrees Fahrenheit. The Vikings lost by a score of 9-7 with the only Vikings score coming from an interception for a touchdown by defensive back [[Fred Smoot]]. The offense set a franchise low record of only three first downs the whole game, did not get close enough to the end zone to even attempt a field goal, and only had 27 passing yards gained against the NFL's 19th ranked defense (ranked 26th against the pass).
