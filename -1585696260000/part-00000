The club's traditional colours are blue, white and red. After a prolonged period of absence, they were propelled back into professional football in the mid 90s with the help of some experienced and talented footballers, including the ex-captain of English [[Aston Villa]] and Bulgarian international [[Stiliyan Petrov]].\n\nFC Montana was founded in 1921 when the few amateur sports clubs and organizations in the city decided to merge into one club. The new club was named SC Hristo Mihaylov after the Bulgarian communist party activist Hristo Popmihaylov, who was born in the town. Since then, Montana have spent a total of nine seasons in the [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian First League]] and 40 seasons in the lower [[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|Second League]]. They have also reached the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final once, in [[2016 Bulgarian Cup Final|2016]].\n\n==Honours==\n'''[[Bulgarian A Football Group|First League]]:'''\n* 9th place (2): [[1995\u201396 A Group|1995-96]], [[2015\u201316 A Group|2015-16]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|Second League]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (2):''' [[2008\u201309 B Group|2008-09]], [[2014\u201315 B Group|2014-15]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): [[2015\u201316 Bulgarian Cup|2015-16]]\n\n'''Bulgarian League Cup:'''\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): 1996\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stiliyan Petrov.JPG|right|130px|thumb|[[Stiliyan Petrov]] was raised in Montana's youth academy]]\n'''PFC Montana''' was founded on 1921 under the name '''SC Hristo Mihaylov''', after a union of a few sports clubs from the city. From 1957 to 1990 the sports club wears the name of '''FC Septemvriyska Slava'''. Since 1990, the club uses the name '''PFC Montana'''.\n\nUntil 2009, Montana has played three seasons in the [[A PFG|top flight]], between 1994 and 1997. Montana joined the division in 1994, and the same year the club finished thirteenth out of sixteen clubs in its first season. The same season, Montana reached the semi-final of the [[Bulgarian Cup]]. Montana's best season in the [[A PFG]] was in the 1995-96 season - 9th place. In this campaign, the team led by Anatoli Tonov, [[Todor Pramatarov]], Rumen Panayotov and [[Angel Chervenkov]], the club reached the final of the currently folded Bulgarian League Cup tournament, but was knocked out by [[Naftex Burgas|Neftochimic Burgas]]. In the 1996-97 season, Montana finished in the 15th place and was relegated to the [[B PFG|second division]]. A part of the squad was then the talented seventeen-year-old [[Stiliyan Petrov]], which was sold the same year to CSKA Sofia. Otherwise according to the fans, Boyan Gergov is Montana's most prominent figure, being the club's top goalscorer with a total of 157 goals in 364 matches. The following 1997-1998 season, after a financial collapse, Montana was relegated to the [[Bulgarian V AFG]]. However, after a 7-year stay in the V AFG, the club finished in the 2nd position in the North-West V AFG, and Montana returned in the West B PFG for the upcoming 2004-05 season.\n\nIn 2008, the chairman of PFC Montana appointed Ivan Marinov as a manager of the club. The following year, with the financial support of the mayor of the city Zlatko Zhivkov, the club finished the season in the West B PFG in the first place and therefore Montana gained promotion to the top flight for the upcoming season. The same year, Montana's striker [[Ventsislav Ivanov]] became the top goalscorer of the division with the impressive 19 goals.\n\nIn season 2009-10 in the then \"A\" football group, Montana finished 11th and remained in the league for 4 consecutive seasons, before being relegated to the lower division on 15th place. They remained in the \"B\" group for 2 seasons before finishing 1st and being promoted to the first division. They started the new 2015-16 season with a surprising 0-0 draw as a guest to a strong sided Beroe, then defeating with the impressive 6-0 Botev Plovdiv, with [[Ivan Minchev]] scoring a hattrick. The good matches continued as Montana finished 1-1 with the champion [[Ludogorets Razgrad]]. The same season Montana would go all the way to the Bulgarian Cup final, before losing 1-0 to [[CSKA Sofia]] in a match with above 33,300 attendance. However, Montana would later finish 9th in the \"A\" group and successfully defend its place in the relegation playoffs for the next season in the renamed \"First Legue\".

The club's traditional colours are blue, white and red. After a prolonged period of absence, they were propelled back into professional football in the mid 90s with the help of some experienced and talented footballers, including the ex-captain of English [[Aston Villa]] and Bulgarian international [[Stiliyan Petrov]].\n\nFC Montana was founded in 1921 when the few amateur sports clubs and organizations in the city decided to merge into one club. The new club was named SC Hristo Mihaylov after the Bulgarian communist party activist Hristo Popmihaylov, who was born in the town. Since then, Montana have spent a total of nine seasons in the [[First Professional Football League (Bulgaria)|Bulgarian First League]] and 40 seasons in the lower [[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|Second League]]. They have also reached the [[Bulgarian Cup]] final once, in [[2016 Bulgarian Cup Final|2016]].\n\n==Honours==\n'''[[Bulgarian A Football Group|First League]]:'''\n:* 9th place (2): [[1995\u201396 A Group|1995-96]], [[2015\u201316 A Group|2015-16]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|Second League]]:'''\n:* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (2):''' [[2008\u201309 B Group|2008-09]], [[2014\u201315 B Group|2014-15]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n:* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): [[2015\u201316 Bulgarian Cup|2015-16]]\n\n'''Bulgarian League Cup:'''\n:* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): 1996\n\n==History==\n[[File:Stiliyan Petrov.JPG|right|130px|thumb|[[Stiliyan Petrov]] was raised in Montana's youth academy]]\n'''PFC Montana''' was founded on 1921 under the name '''SC Hristo Mihaylov''', after a union of a few sports clubs from the city. From 1957 to 1990 the sports club wears the name of '''FC Septemvriyska Slava'''. Since 1990, the club uses the name '''PFC Montana'''.\n\nUntil 2009, Montana has played three seasons in the [[A PFG|top flight]], between 1994 and 1997. Montana joined the division in 1994, and the same year the club finished thirteenth out of sixteen clubs in its first season. The same season, Montana reached the semi-final of the [[Bulgarian Cup]]. Montana's best season in the [[A PFG]] was in the 1995-96 season - 9th place. In this campaign, the team led by Anatoli Tonov, [[Todor Pramatarov]], Rumen Panayotov and [[Angel Chervenkov]], the club reached the final of the currently folded Bulgarian League Cup tournament, but was knocked out by [[Naftex Burgas|Neftochimic Burgas]]. In the 1996-97 season, Montana finished in the 15th place and was relegated to the [[B PFG|second division]]. A part of the squad was then the talented seventeen-year-old [[Stiliyan Petrov]], which was sold the same year to CSKA Sofia. Otherwise according to the fans, Boyan Gergov is Montana's most prominent figure, being the club's top goalscorer with a total of 157 goals in 364 matches. The following 1997-1998 season, after a financial collapse, Montana was relegated to the [[Bulgarian V AFG]]. However, after a 7-year stay in the V AFG, the club finished in the 2nd position in the North-West V AFG, and Montana returned in the West B PFG for the upcoming 2004-05 season.\n\nIn 2008, the chairman of PFC Montana appointed Ivan Marinov as a manager of the club. The following year, with the financial support of the mayor of the city Zlatko Zhivkov, the club finished the season in the West B PFG in the first place and therefore Montana gained promotion to the top flight for the upcoming season. The same year, Montana's striker [[Ventsislav Ivanov]] became the top goalscorer of the division with the impressive 19 goals.\n\nIn season 2009-10 in the then \"A\" football group, Montana finished 11th and remained in the league for 4 consecutive seasons, before being relegated to the lower division on 15th place. They remained in the \"B\" group for 2 seasons before finishing 1st and being promoted to the first division. They started the new 2015-16 season with a surprising 0-0 draw as a guest to a strong sided Beroe, then defeating with the impressive 6-0 Botev Plovdiv, with [[Ivan Minchev]] scoring a hattrick. The good matches continued as Montana finished 1-1 with the champion [[Ludogorets Razgrad]]. The same season Montana would go all the way to the Bulgarian Cup final, before losing 1-0 to [[CSKA Sofia]] in a match with above 33,300 attendance. However, Montana would later finish 9th in the \"A\" group and successfully defend its place in the relegation playoffs for the next season in the renamed \"First Legue\".

The most characteristic early signs are [[pathologic nystagmus|nystagmus]] (rapid, involuntary, rhythmic motion of the eyes) and [[hypotonia|low muscle tone]].  Motor abilities are delayed or never acquired, mostly depending upon the severity of the mutation. Most children with Pelizaeus\u2013Merzbacher disease learn to understand language, and usually have some speech. Other signs may include [[tremor]], lack of coordination,  involuntary movements, weakness, unsteady [[gait]], and over time, spasticity in legs and arms.

Patients who have some form of asplenia have an increased susceptibility to these encapsulated bacterial infections mainly because they lack IgM memory B cells and their non-adherence to polysaccharide vaccines. Furthermore there is a deficiency of other splenic cells e.g. splenic macrophages.
