{"title_page": "Tenjiku shogi", "text_new": "'''Tenjiku shogi''' (\u5929\u7afa\u5c06\u68cb ''tenjiku sh\u014dgi,'' \"Indian chess\" or \u5929\u7afa\u5927\u5c06\u68cb ''tenjiku dai sh\u014dgi'' \"great Indian chess\") is a large-board [[Shogi variant|variant]] of [[shogi]] (Japanese chess).  The game dates back to the 15th or 16th century and was based on the earlier [[chu shogi]], which itself was based on [[dai shogi]].\n\nBecause of the terse and often incomplete wording of the historical sources for the large shogi variants, except for [[chu shogi]] and to a lesser extent [[dai shogi]] (which were at some points of time the most prestigious forms of shogi being played), the historical rules of [[Tianzhu (India)|tenjiku]] shogi are not clear. Different sources often differ significantly in the moves attributed to the pieces. The descriptions listed here are a likely reconstruction based on chu shogi, the primary basis of tenjiku shogi, but not all contemporary players follow these historically-based rules. It is not clear if the game was ever played much historically, as there is no record of sets ever having been made.\n\n== Rules of the game ==\n\n=== Objective ===\n\nThe objective of the game is to capture the opponent's king and, if present, the prince, which counts as a second king.  Unlike standard shogi, captured pieces may not be [[Shogi#Dropping|dropped]] back into play by the capturing player.\n\n=== Game equipment ===\n\nTwo players, Black and White (or \u5148\u624b ''sente'' and \u5f8c\u624b ''gote),'' play on a board composed of squares in a grid of 16 ''ranks'' (rows) by 16 ''files'' (columns) with a total of 256 squares.  The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. A pair of dots may be placed just beyond the fifth rank on each side to mark the promotion zones and aid in the initial setup of the two camps.\n\nEach player has a set of 78 wedge-shaped pieces of 36 types.  In all, the players must remember 43 moves for these pieces.  The pieces are of slightly different sizes. From largest to smallest (roughly most to least powerful) they are:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n* 1 King\n* 1 Great general\n* 1 Vice general\n* 2 Rook generals\n* 2 Bishop generals\n* 1 Free eagle\n* 1 Queen\n* 2 Soaring eagles\n* 2 Horned falcons\n* 2 Water buffalos\n* 4 Chariot soldiers\n* 2 Fire demons\n{{Col-3}}\n* 1 Lion hawk\n* 1 Lion\n* 2 Dragon kings\n* 2 Dragon horses\n* 2 Rooks\n* 2 Bishops\n* 1 Kirin\n* 1 Phoenix\n* 1 Drunken elephant\n* 2 Blind tigers\n* 2 Ferocious leopards\n* 2 Gold generals\n{{Col-3}}\n* 2 Silver generals\n* 2 Copper generals\n* 2 Vertical movers\n* 2 Side movers\n* 2 Reverse chariots\n* 2 Vertical soldiers\n* 2 Side soldiers\n* 2 Lances\n* 2 Knights\n* 2 Iron generals\n* 2 Dogs\n* 16 Pawns\n{{Col-end}}\n\nSeveral of the English names were chosen to correspond to rough equivalents in Western chess, rather than as translations of the Japanese names.\n\nEach piece has its name in the form of one or two [[kanji]] written on its face. On the reverse side of some pieces are two or three other characters, often in a different color such as red; this reverse side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. The pieces of the two sides do not differ in color, but instead each piece is shaped like a wedge, and faces forward, toward the opposing side. This shows who controls the piece during play.\n\n====Table of pieces====\n<!--This table was normalized to the Japanese shogi-piece articles on 2005 Oct. 01-->\n\nListed below are the pieces of the game and, if they promote, which pieces they promote to.

Within each block below, a piece (except the kings) promotes to the piece above it. Pieces at the top of each block do not promote (and if in ''italics'', and with an *asterisk, as stated before, these appear only upon promotion). Note that pieces may only promote ''once.'' For example, a gold general promotes to a rook, and a rook promotes to a dragon king, but a gold general promoted to a rook cannot promote a second time to a dragon king. This is clear from the equipment, for each piece only has two sides.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| '''Jeweled general''' || \u7389\u5c06 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=2 | || ''*Prince'' || \u592a\u5b50\n|-\n| '''King general''' || \u738b\u5c06 || \u2191 Drunk elephant || \u2191 \u9154\u8c61\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| Vice general || \u526f\u5c06 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=7 | || Great general || \u5927\u5c06\n|-\n| \u2191 Bishop general || \u2191 \u89d2\u5c06 || \u2191 Rook general || \u2191 \u98db\u5c06\n|-\n| \u2191 Horned falcon || \u2191 \u89d2\u9df9 || \u2191 Soaring eagle || \u2191 \u98db\u9df2\n|-\n| \u2191 Dragon horse || \u2191 \u9f8d\u99ac || \u2191 Dragon king || \u2191 \u9f8d\u738b\n|-\n| \u2191 Bishop || \u2191 \u89d2\u884c || \u2191 Rook || \u2191 \u98db\u8eca\n|-\n| \u2191 Ferocious leopard || \u2191 \u731b\u8c79 || \u2191 Gold general || \u2191 \u91d1\u5c06\n|-\n| colspan=2 align=center | || \u2191 Pawn || \u2191 \u6b69\u5175\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| Fire demon || \u706b\u9b3c || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=4 | || ''*Heavenly tetrarch'' || \u56db\u5929\u738b\n|-\n| \u2191 Water buffalo || \u2191 \u6c34\u725b || \u2191 Chariot soldier || \u2191\u8eca\u5175\n|-\n| \u2191 Side soldier || \u2191 \u6a2a\u5175 || \u2191 Vertical soldier || \u2191 \u7aea\u5175\n|-\n| \u2191 Knight || \u2191 \u6842\u99ac || \u2191 Iron general || \u2191 \u9244\u5c06\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| Free eagle || \u5954\u9df2 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=3 | || Lion hawk || \u7345\u9df9\n|-\n| \u2191 Queen || \u2191 \u5954\u738b || \u2191 Lion || \u2191 \u7345\u5b50\n|-\n| \u2191 Phoenix || \u2191 \u9cf3\u51f0 || \u2191 Kirin || \u2191 \u9e92\u9e9f\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| ''*Free boar'' || \u5954\u732a || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=3 | || ''*Flying ox'' || \u98db\u725b\n|-\n| \u2191 Side mover || \u2191 \u6a2a\u884c || \u2191 Vertical mover || \u2191 \u7aea\u884c\n|-\n| \u2191 Copper general || \u2191 \u9285\u5c06 || \u2191 Silver general || \u2191 \u9280\u5c06\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| ''*Multi general'' || \u96dc\u5c06 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=2 | || ''*Flying stag'' || \u98db\u9e7f\n|-\n| \u2191 Dog || \u2191 \u72ac || \u2191 Blind tiger || \u2191 \u76f2\u864e\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| ''*White horse'' || \u767d\u99d2 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=2 | || ''*Whale'' || \u9be8\u9be2\n|-\n| \u2191 Lance || \u2191 \u9999\u8eca || \u2191 Reverse chariot || \u2191 \u53cd\u8eca\n|}\n\n=== Setup ===\n\nThe initial setup of the board is as follows.

(The pieces are not differentiated by color; the traditional chess terms \"Black\" and \"White\" are only used to indicate who plays first, and to differentiate the sides during discussions of the game.) A ''move'' consists of moving a piece either to an empty square on the board or to a square occupied by an opposing piece, thus capturing that piece; and optionally of promoting the moving piece, if the move enters the ''promotion zone'' (that is, it starts outside the promotion zone and ends inside it), or if it is a capture and any part of it is in the promotion zone. Each of these options is detailed below.\n\nDespite the large size of the board and number of pieces, tenjiku shogi games are often quicker than smaller shogi variants because of the higher average power of the pieces.  Good use of the fire demons can make for a short game.\n\n=== Movement and capture ===\n\n''Tenjiku shogi pieces that occur in [[chu shogi]] or [[dai shogi]] move as they do in that game, but the pieces from dai shogi promote differently.''\n\nAn opposing piece is captured by ''displacement'': That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece, that is, by another piece controlled by the moving player. The one exception to this is the unique ''burn'' of the fire demon.\n\nEach piece on the game moves in a characteristic pattern. Pieces move either ''orthogonally'' (that is, forward, backward, left, or right, in the direction of one of the arms of a plus sign, '''+'''), or ''diagonally'' (in the direction of one of the arms of a multiplication sign, '''\u00d7'''). The vice general, fire demon, lion hawk, lion, and knight are exceptions, in that they do not move, or are not required to move, in a straight line.\n\nMany pieces are capable of several kinds of movement, with the type of movement most often depending on the direction. The movement categories are:\n\n====Step movers and limited range movers====\n\nSome pieces are limited to moving one square at a time. If a friendly piece occupies an adjacent square, the moving piece may not move in that direction; if an opposing piece is there, it may be displaced and captured.\n\nThe step movers are the king, drunk elephant, blind tiger, ferocious leopard, gold general, silver general, copper general, iron general, dog, and pawn. Other pieces may step in certain directions, but move differently in other directions.\n\nOther pieces have a limited range of two squares along a straight line. The water buffalo, chariot soldier, vertical soldier, and side soldier may move one or two squares in certain directions. They can only move to the second square if the first is unoccupied. They may capture on either square, but must stop where they capture.\n\n====Area movers====\n\nThe lion, lion hawk, vice general, and fire demon may take ''multiple'' (2 to 3) steps in a single turn. These do not have to be in a line, so these pieces can potentially reach every square within two or three steps of the starting square, not just squares along one of the diagonals or orthogonals. Such moves are also useful to get around obstructions. An area mover must stop where it captures.\n\n====Jumping pieces====\n\nSome pieces can ''jump'', or in the case of the knight can only jump: They pass over an intervening piece, whether friend or foe, with no effect on either. These are the free eagle, lion hawk, lion, soaring eagle, horned falcon, tetrarch, kirin, phoenix, and knight. These jumps all have a range of two squares: that is, the first square is passed over, and the piece lands (and captures) on the second. The knight jumps ''between'' the diagonals and orthogonals, and the lion and lion hawk may do so.\n\n====Ranging pieces====\n\nMany pieces can move any number of empty squares along a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, limited only by the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.\n\nThe ranging pieces are the great general, vice general, rook general, bishop general, free eagle, soaring eagle, horned falcon, queen, water buffalo, chariot soldier, fire demon, lion hawk, dragon king, dragon horse, rook, bishop, vertical mover, side mover, reverse chariot, vertical soldier, side soldier and lance.\n\n====Range jumping pieces====\n\nA few powerful pieces may jump over any number of pieces (including zero), friend or foe, along a diagonal or orthogonal, but only when making a capture. These are the great general, vice general, rook general, and bishop general.\n\nHowever, they may only jump over other pieces of ''lower rank'', whether friend or foe. None may jump a king or prince of either side. The relevant ranking is:\n#King, prince\n#Great general\n#Vice general\n#Rook general, bishop general\n\nThat is, bishop and rook generals cannot jump over any other range-jumping piece.\n\nThe range jumpers can nevertheless capture each other, even if they cannot jump over each other and there are other pieces outside the ranking in the way. (For example, though a rook general cannot jump over an enemy great general, it may still capture the great general.) They cannot capture a king or prince by jumping, but can do so without jumping.\n\nSome descriptions of the game do not limit this ability to moves making a capture. However, most mention that these pieces have two types of move, ranging and range jumping, suggesting that the capture rule may have been mistakenly omitted.\n\n====Multiple captures====\n\nThe lion, lion hawk, soaring eagle and horned falcon have sequential multiple-capture abilities, called \"lion moves\". The fire demon can \"burn\" multiple pieces simultaneously. These unusual moves are described below.\n\n====Other====\n\nThe heavenly tetrarch cannot move to an adjacent square, and has other idiosyncrasies; the fire demon 'burns' adjacent pieces. This is best described below.\n\n====Repeated board positions====\n\nA player is not allowed to make a move that would return the board to a previous position, with the same player to move. This rule prevents games from entering into a repeated loop.\n\n=== Promotion ===\n\n''Tenjiku shogi pieces that occur in [[chu shogi]] promote as they do in that game, with the exceptions of the lion and queen, which do not promote in chu shogi.''\n\nA player's ''promotion zone'' consists of the five far ranks, at the original line of the opponent's pawns and beyond. When a promotable piece makes a move entering the promotion zone, or makes a capture within the promotion zone&mdash;including captures entering, leaving, or entirely within the zone&mdash;it has the option of \"promoting\" to a more powerful rank.\n\nPieces which take multiple steps per move are probably not allowed to promote by crossing into the promotion zone and back out again: this is not explicitly stated in the rules, and chu shogi does not offer guidance here because such pieces do not promote in chu shogi, but it would contravene the usual stipulation that the move start outside and end inside the promotion zone. Another small piece of evidence is that the fire demon's burn is only calculated at the end of a turn, like promotion, and it does not apply to intermediate steps in the move. For similar reasons, ''igui'' or capturing probably does not allow promotion if the move begins and ends outside the promotion zone, even if it passes in and back out along the way.\n\nPromotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. As such, a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time. Promotion is not mandatory if the unpromoted piece could move further on a later turn, and in some cases it may be beneficial to leave the piece unpromoted. Promotion is permanent and promoted pieces may not revert to their original rank.\n\nPromoting a piece has the effect of changing how that piece moves. See above for what each piece promotes to and below for how they move.\n\nThe king, great general, vice general, free eagle, lion hawk, and fire demon do not promote, nor can already promoted pieces promote further.\n\nIf a piece is not promoted upon entering the promotion zone, then it may not promote until it leaves the zone and reenters unless it makes a capture.\n\nIf a piece which cannot retreat or move to the side advances to the far rank, so that it would otherwise have no further legal move, it is trapped. These pieces are the pawn, knight, iron general, and lance. In practice this would never occur for pawns or lances, which promote to pieces which keep their old moves, so that there is never any reason to defer their promotion, as stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player.\n\nThe situation for the knight and iron general, which promote to pieces that do not keep their old moves, is unclear. Since there could be a reason to defer their promotion, it is possible that they receive a second chance to promote at the far rank on a non-capture, as in chu shogi. (In chu shogi, this provision applies to pawns, which are not completely upward compatible with the gold generals they promote to because of the rules against trading lions.) This second chance, if it exists, can likewise be declined, leaving the knight or iron general as an immobile \"dead piece\" (\u6b7b\u306b\u99d2). However, this is uncertain, because it is not clear when the rule of pawn promotion was added to chu shogi (before or after the invention of tenjiku shogi), and because the Edo-era sources have numerous lacunae in the rules for the variants other than  sho shogi and chu shogi.\n\n===Movement diagrams===\nIn the diagrams below, the different types of moves are coded by symbol and by color: blue for step moves, green for multiple capture, red for range moves, yellow for jumps, and orange for ranging jumps.\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | '''Notation'''\n|-\n| align=center width=\"20\" style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || Jumps to this square, bypassing any intervening piece.\n|-\n| align=center width=\"20\" style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || Steps a limited number of squares along a straight line.\n|-\n| align=center width=\"20\" style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cf || Steps within an area, not restricted to a straight line.

Piece names with a grey background are present at the start of the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. [[Fairy chess piece#Ralph Betza's \"funny notation\"|Betza's funny notation]] has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation ''xxx'''''a'''''yyy'''''K''' stands for an ''xxx'''''K''' move possibly followed by an ''yyy'''''K''' move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a', or by numbers: thus ''a3K'' means a piece that can take up to three steps of a king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' (\"vertical\", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Thus ''mKa3K'' means a piece that takes up to three steps of a king, but must stop when it first captures. Square brackets are used to make it clear what legs the '''a''' modifier chains together: thus '''DaK''' would denote a [[dabbaba (chess)|dabbaba]] move followed by a king move, but '''D[aK]''' would denote a piece that can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.\n\nAnother extension is that inequalities can be used in place of numbers denoting range: thus, while R4 is a piece that moves like a rook, but only up to four squares, R(2\u2264''n''\u22644) is a piece that moves like a rook, but only two, three, or four squares. Further, '''p''n''''' refers to cannon-like pieces that can jump at most ''n'' pieces along their path, and '''pp''' means the same as '''p\u221e''' (just as '''WW''' is synonymous with '''W\u221e''', both meaning a rook). Finally, '''x''' stands for \"shooting\": the '''xK''' for instance can pass its turn (shooting empty squares), or it can shoot (capture) any adjacent enemy piece without moving.\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" width=\"100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=\"50%\" | '''Jeweled general''' (inferior player's king) \u7389\u5c06 ''gyokush\u014d''\n| style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" width=\"50%\" | '''Prince''' \u592a\u5b50 ''taishi''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n| width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | \u7389 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|}</center>\n* Step: The king can step one square in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal.

This move is equivalent to two turns for a king.\n**Unlike area movers, the lion can continue after a capture on the first step, capturing up to two pieces on each turn.\n**By moving back to its starting square, it can effectively capture a piece on an adjacent square without moving. This is called \u5c45\u55b0\u3044 ''igui'' \"stationary feeding\".\n**It can also do the same to an empty square, without capturing anything.  This is traditionally indicated by tapping the lion and leaving it in place.\n*Jump: A lion can jump anywhere within a distance of two squares: That is, anywhere it could reach in two step moves on an empty board, though of course it cannot land on a square occupied by a friendly piece. This is equivalent to jumping in any of the eight diagonal or orthogonal directions, or making any of the jumps of a knight in Western chess. (NAD[aK])\n''Note: The restrictions when capturing a lion in [[chu shogi]] do not apply in tenjiku shogi.''\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | '''Phoenix''' \u9cf3\u51f0 ''h\u014d\u014d''\n| style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | '''Kirin''' \u9e92\u9e9f ''kirin''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n| width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | \u9cf3 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|}</center>\n*Step: The phoenix can move one square in one of the four orthogonal directions.\n*Jump: It can jump to the second square in one of the four diagonal directions.

(fbR)\n|}</center>\n\n=== Repetition ===\nA player may not make a move if the resulting position is one that has previously occurred in the game ''with the same player to move''. (However, evidence from historical chu shogi mating problems suggests that this prohibition does not apply to a player who is in check.) This is called repetition (\u5343\u65e5\u624b ''sennichite''). Note that certain pieces have the ability to pass in certain situations (lions, soaring eagles, horned falcons, vice generals, fire demons, free eagles, and lion hawks). Such a pass move leaves the position unchanged, but it does not violate the repetition rule, as it will now be the turn of the other player to move. Of course, two consecutive passes are not possible, as the first player will see the same position as before.\n\n=== Check and mate ===\n\nWhen a player makes a move, such that the opponent's only remaining king or prince could be captured on the following move, the move is said to ''give check''; the king or prince is said to be ''in check''. If a player's last king or prince is in check and no legal move by that player will get it out of check, the checking move is also ''[[checkmate|mate]]'', and effectively wins the game.\n\nUnlike Western chess, a player need not move out of check in tenjiku shogi, and indeed may even move into check. Although obviously not often a good idea, a player with more than one royal may occasionally sacrifice one of these pieces as part of a [[gambit]].\n\n=== Game end ===\n\nA player who captures the opponent's sole remaining king or prince wins the game. This would presumably imply that [[checkmate]] and [[stalemate]] both lead to wins for the checkmating or stalemating player.\n\nIn practice these winning conditions are rarely fulfilled, as a player will typically resign when checkmated, as otherwise when loss is inevitable.\n\nA player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)\n\n== Handicaps ==\n\nGames between players of disparate strength may be played with handicaps, by analogy with chu shogi. In a handicap game, one or more of White's pieces is removed before the start of play, and White plays the first move of the game. However, no historical handicap system is known, unlike for chu shogi.\n\n== Game notation ==\n\nThe method used in English-language texts to express shogi moves was established by George Hodges in 1976. It is derived from the [[Algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation used for chess]], but modifications have been made for tenjiku shogi.\n\nA typical example is '''P-8g'''.\nThe first letter represents the piece moved (see above).\nPromoted pieces have a '''+''' added in front of the letter. e.g., '''+P''' for a promoted pawn.  The designation of the piece is followed by a symbol indicating the type of move: '''-''' for an ordinary move or '''x''' for a capture.  Next is the designation for the square on which the piece lands.  This consists of a number representing the file and a lowercase letter representing the rank, with '''1a''' being the top right corner (as seen from Black's point of view) and '''16p''' being the bottom left corner.  (This method of designating squares is based on Japanese convention, which, however, uses [[Japanese numerals]] instead of letters. For example, the square 2c is denoted by 2\u4e09 in Japanese.)\n\nIf a lion, horned falcon, soaring eagle or Heavenly Tetrarch captures by ''igui'', or the fire demon burns, the square of the piece being captured is used instead of the destination square, and this is preceded by the symbol '''!'''.  A piece moving next to a fire demon (suicide move) is followed by a '''*'''.  If a double or triple capture is made, than subsequent captures are added after the first capture.\n\nIf a move entitles the player to promote the piece, then a '''+''' is added to the end to signify that the promotion was taken, or an '''=''' to indicate that it was declined.\nFor example, '''Nx7d=''' indicates a knight capturing on 7d without promoting.\n\nIn cases where the above notation would be ambiguous, the designation of the start square is added after the designation for the piece in order to make clear which piece is meant.\n\nMoves are commonly numbered as in chess.\n\nIn handicap games White plays first, so Black's move 1 is replaced by an [[ellipsis]].\n\n==Notes on disputed moves==\n*Lion hawk\n:The Shogi Association (TSA) rules, for unknown reasons, interpreted \"like a lion\" to mean that the lion hawk did not have the full lion powers of jump and double capture, but only a two-step area move. This interpretation was never made in Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi, and has largely been abandoned in the West as well. Giving the lion hawk full lion powers brings the piece into line with the rest of the game,<ref name=CPAdams>[http://www.colina.demon.co.uk/tenjiku.pdf CP Adams's book on tenjiku tactics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050521122957/http://www.colina.demon.co.uk/tenjiku.pdf |date=2005-05-21 }}</ref> and is the only interpretation supported by the historical sources.\n\n*Free eagle\n:Western sources<ref name=CPAdams/> give the free eagle the move of a queen plus the ability to jump to the second square along an orthogonal. This however seems unlikely, given that such a move could be more easily expressed as \"moves as queen or kirin\".\n\n:Japanese Wikipedia states \u659c\u3081\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u98db\u3073\u8d8a\u3048\u3066\u306f\u884c\u3051\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u7e26\u6a2a\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u99d2\u3092\u98db\u3073\u8d8a\u3048\u3066\u884c\u3051\u308b \"it cannot jump on the diagonals, but can jump pieces on the orthogonals.\" The diagram shows an orthogonal ''range jump,'' but the free eagle does not appear in the ranking list of range-jumping pieces.\n\n:However, the Edo-era ''[[Sho Sh\u014dgi Zushiki]]'' states that it moves \u5982\u5954\u738b\u4ea6\u732b\u5204\u518d\u5ea6\u6b69\u517c\u4e8c\u884c \"as a queen or two times as a cat sword in two directions\", which could be taken as requiring the piece to finish on one of the orthogonals, if not exactly a jump; while elsewhere in the ''Sho Sh\u014dgi Zushiki'' and in the ''Sh\u014dgi Zushiki'' it says that \u5954\u738b\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3001\u732b\u5204\u306e\u52d5\u304d\uff08\u659c\u3081\u56db\u65b9\u5411\u306b1\u30de\u30b9\u52d5\u304f\uff09\u30922\u5ea6\u3067\u304d\u308b \"in addition to moving as a queen, it can make a [[ferz (chess)|cat-sword]] move (one square in one of the four diagonals) twice\", which has no such implication, but which Japanese Wikipedia says is thought to mean a jump. This creates a symmetry between the free eagle and lion hawk: the lion hawk is a lion combined with the diagonal moves of the queen, while the free eagle is a queen combined with the diagonal moves of the lion.\n\n*Fire demon\n:TSA rules state that if you move your fire demon next to an opposing fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.\n\n:Japanese Wikipedia states only that \u706b\u9b3c\u304c\u706b\u9b3c\u306e\u96a3\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u3068\u304d\u306f\u3001\u52d5\u3044\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u713c\u304b\u308c\u308b \"When a fire demon moves next to a fire demon, the moving piece is burnt,\" without mentioning the fate of surrounding pieces (thus perhaps implying that nothing special happens to them).\n\n:The two Edo-era sources have the orthogonal ranging move along the rank of the board. Western sources have it move along the file, but moving along the rank (as used in this article) would be more in keeping with the fire demon being a promoted water buffalo.\n\n*Heavenly tetrarch\n:Western sources do not have the ranging move along the orthogonal. However, the ''Sho Sh\u014dgi Zushiki'' states it moves \u5982\u8eca\u5175\u4ea6\u8fd1\u516b\u65b9\u4e0d\u884c\u5176\u5916\u5468\u4e8c\u4e09\u8981\u7528\u6b69 \"as a chariot soldier, also the eight neighboring squares without moving and taking two or three steps outside the periphery\", and this is consistent with it being a promoted chariot soldier.\n\n*Range-jumping generals\n:TSA rules state that the range-jumping generals cannot ''capture'' an equal or higher-ranking piece, not just that they cannot jump over them. This gives a huge advantage to Black, so that Black can win every game if played right, but is not supported by Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi and has been largely abandoned in the West as unplayable. This is due to the very terse wording of the historical documents, that do not make it clear if the capture of an equal or higher-ranking piece is allowed even if such a piece cannot be jumped over. The presence of the king in the hierarchy suggested the TSA rules, since the king cannot jump-capture at all, and in any situation where the enemy king could be jumped over it would not happen in practice as it would simply be captured. Due to the resulting playability problem, it was suggested that capturing would be allowed but not jumping, but this allowed for smothered mates in the opening and again gives a huge advantage to Black. However, the rule used in this article and ''The Chess Variant Pages'', which allows the capture of equal or higher-ranking pieces except kings or princes, removes this advantage to Black.\n\n== Strategy ==\n\n=== Piece values ===\nAccording to the German Chu Shogi Association, the average values of the pieces are (using the interpretations of the English-language sources):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Average piece values\n!

They have also been normalized so that the pawn is worth 1 point to avoid fractions. Additionally, pieces gain in value if they have a good chance of promotion (particularly for the water buffalo, which promotes to the most powerful piece in the game), and the jumping generals and fire demon tend to lose some power as the board empties (because they then cannot make full use of their jumping and burning abilities).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Shogi variant]]\n* [[Wa shogi]]\n* [[Chu shogi]]\n* [[Heian dai shogi]]\n* [[Dai shogi]]\n* [[Dai dai shogi]]\n* [[Maka dai dai shogi]]\n* [[Tai shogi]]\n* [[Taikyoku shogi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.chessvariants.com/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MStenjikushogi Tenjiku Shogi] at ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''\n* [http://www.shogi.net/shogi.html Shogi Net]\n* [http://history.chess.free.fr/papers/Tenjiku-Colin%20Adams.pdf CP Adams's book on tenjiku tactics]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120317120548/http://colina.demon.co.uk:5001/ CP Adams's Tenjiku shogi wiki]\n* [http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/tenjikushogi.html Gamerz.net/tenjiku shogi]\n* [http://history.chess.free.fr/tenjikushogi.htm History.chess/tenjiku shogi]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110311151740/http://www.luckydog.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/games/tenjiku/ Tenjiku shogi games and problems]\n* [http://hgm.nubati.net/tenjiku/tenjiku.html Tenjiku Shogi, the wild Chess game] (by H. G. Muller)\n\n{{Shogi variants}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tenjiku Shogi}}\n[[Category:Shogi variants]]\n", "text_old": "'''Tenjiku shogi''' (\u5929\u7afa\u5c06\u68cb ''tenjiku sh\u014dgi,'' \"Indian chess\" or \u5929\u7afa\u5927\u5c06\u68cb ''tenjiku dai sh\u014dgi'' \"great Indian chess\") is a large-board [[Shogi variant|variant]] of [[shogi]] (Japanese chess).  The game dates back to the 15th or 16th century and was based on the earlier [[chu shogi]], which itself was based on [[dai shogi]].\n\nBecause of the terse and often incomplete wording of the historical sources for the large shogi variants, except for [[chu shogi]] and to a lesser extent [[dai shogi]] (which were at some points of time the most prestigious forms of shogi being played), the historical rules of [[Tianzhu (India)|tenjiku]] shogi are not clear. Different sources often differ significantly in the moves attributed to the pieces. The descriptions listed here are a likely reconstruction based on chu shogi, the primary basis of tenjiku shogi, but not all contemporary players follow these historically-based rules. It is not clear if the game was ever played much historically, as there is no record of sets ever having been made.\n\n== Rules of the game ==\n\n=== Objective ===\n\nThe objective of the game is to capture the opponent's king and, if present, the prince, which counts as a second king.  Unlike standard shogi, captured pieces may not be [[Shogi#Dropping|dropped]] back into play by the capturing player.\n\n=== Game equipment ===\n\nTwo players, Black and White (or \u5148\u624b ''sente'' and \u5f8c\u624b ''gote),'' play on a board composed of squares in a grid of 16 ''ranks'' (rows) by 16 ''files'' (columns) with a total of 256 squares.  The squares are undifferentiated by marking or color. A pair of dots may be placed just beyond the fifth rank on each side to mark the promotion zones and aid in the initial setup of the two camps.\n\nEach player has a set of 78 wedge-shaped pieces of 36 types.  In all, the players must remember 43 moves for these pieces.  The pieces are of slightly different sizes. From largest to smallest (roughly most to least powerful) they are:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{Col-3}}\n* 1 King\n* 1 Great general\n* 1 Vice general\n* 2 Rook generals\n* 2 Bishop generals\n* 1 Free eagle\n* 1 Queen\n* 2 Soaring eagles\n* 2 Horned falcons\n* 2 Water buffalos\n* 4 Chariot soldiers\n* 2 Fire demons\n{{Col-3}}\n* 1 Lion hawk\n* 1 Lion\n* 2 Dragon kings\n* 2 Dragon horses\n* 2 Rooks\n* 2 Bishops\n* 1 Kirin\n* 1 Phoenix\n* 1 Drunken elephant\n* 2 Blind tigers\n* 2 Ferocious leopards\n* 2 Gold generals\n{{Col-3}}\n* 2 Silver generals\n* 2 Copper generals\n* 2 Vertical movers\n* 2 Side movers\n* 2 Reverse chariots\n* 2 Vertical soldiers\n* 2 Side soldiers\n* 2 Lances\n* 2 Knights\n* 2 Iron generals\n* 2 Dogs\n* 16 Pawns\n{{Col-end}}\n\nSeveral of the English names were chosen to correspond to rough equivalents in Western chess, rather than as translations of the Japanese names.\n\nEach piece has its name in the form of one or two [[kanji]] written on its face. On the reverse side of some pieces are two or three other characters, often in a different color such as red; this reverse side is turned up to indicate that the piece has been promoted during play. The pieces of the two sides do not differ in color, but instead each piece is shaped like a wedge, and faces forward, toward the opposing side. This shows who controls the piece during play.\n\n====Table of pieces====\n<!--This table was normalized to the Japanese shogi-piece articles on 2005 Oct. 01-->\n\nListed below are the pieces of the game and, if they promote, which pieces they promote to.

Within each block below, a piece (except the kings) promotes to the piece above it. Pieces at the top of each block do not promote (and if in ''italics'', and with an *asterisk, as stated before, these appear only upon promotion). Note that pieces may only promote ''once.'' For example, a gold general promotes to a rook, and a rook promotes to a dragon king, but a gold general promoted to a rook cannot promote a second time to a dragon king. This is clear from the equipment, for each piece only has two sides.\n\n{| class=wikitable\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| '''Jeweled general''' || \u7389\u5c06 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=2 | || ''*Prince'' || \u592a\u5b50\n|-\n| '''King general''' || \u738b\u5c06 || \u2191 Drunk elephant || \u2191 \u9154\u8c61\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| Vice general || \u526f\u5c06 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=7 | || Great general || \u5927\u5c06\n|-\n| \u2191 Bishop general || \u2191 \u89d2\u5c06 || \u2191 Rook general || \u2191 \u98db\u5c06\n|-\n| \u2191 Horned falcon || \u2191 \u89d2\u9df9 || \u2191 Soaring eagle || \u2191 \u98db\u9df2\n|-\n| \u2191 Dragon horse || \u2191 \u9f8d\u99ac || \u2191 Dragon king || \u2191 \u9f8d\u738b\n|-\n| \u2191 Bishop || \u2191 \u89d2\u884c || \u2191 Rook || \u2191 \u98db\u8eca\n|-\n| \u2191 Ferocious leopard || \u2191 \u731b\u8c79 || \u2191 Gold general || \u2191 \u91d1\u5c06\n|-\n| colspan=2 align=center | || \u2191 Pawn || \u2191 \u6b69\u5175\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| Fire demon || \u706b\u9b3c || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=4 | || ''*Heavenly tetrarch'' || \u56db\u5929\u738b\n|-\n| \u2191 Water buffalo || \u2191 \u6c34\u725b || \u2191 Chariot soldier || \u2191\u8eca\u5175\n|-\n| \u2191 Side soldier || \u2191 \u6a2a\u5175 || \u2191 Vertical soldier || \u2191 \u7aea\u5175\n|-\n| \u2191 Knight || \u2191 \u6842\u99ac || \u2191 Iron general || \u2191 \u9244\u5c06\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| Free eagle || \u5954\u9df2 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=3 | || Lion hawk || \u7345\u9df9\n|-\n| \u2191 Queen || \u2191 \u5954\u738b || \u2191 Lion || \u2191 \u7345\u5b50\n|-\n| \u2191 Phoenix || \u2191 \u9cf3\u51f0 || \u2191 Kirin || \u2191 \u9e92\u9e9f\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| ''*Free boar'' || \u5954\u732a || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=3 | || ''*Flying ox'' || \u98db\u725b\n|-\n| \u2191 Side mover || \u2191 \u6a2a\u884c || \u2191 Vertical mover || \u2191 \u7aea\u884c\n|-\n| \u2191 Copper general || \u2191 \u9285\u5c06 || \u2191 Silver general || \u2191 \u9280\u5c06\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| ''*Multi general'' || \u96dc\u5c06 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=2 | || ''*Flying stag'' || \u98db\u9e7f\n|-\n| \u2191 Dog || \u2191 \u72ac || \u2191 Blind tiger || \u2191 \u76f2\u864e\n|- style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\"\n| colspan=5 |\n|-\n| ''*White horse'' || \u767d\u99d2 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" rowspan=2 | || ''*Whale'' || \u9be8\u9be2\n|-\n| \u2191 Lance || \u2191 \u9999\u8eca || \u2191 Reverse chariot || \u2191 \u53cd\u8eca\n|}\n\n=== Setup ===\n\nThe initial setup of the board is as follows.

(The pieces are not differentiated by color; the traditional chess terms \"Black\" and \"White\" are only used to indicate who plays first, and to differentiate the sides during discussions of the game.) A ''move'' consists of moving a piece either to an empty square on the board or to a square occupied by an opposing piece, thus capturing that piece; and optionally of promoting the moving piece, if the move enters the ''promotion zone'' (that is, it starts outside the promotion zone and ends inside it), or if it is a capture and any part of it is in the promotion zone. Each of these options is detailed below.\n\nDespite the large size of the board and number of pieces, tenjiku shogi games are often quicker than smaller shogi variants because of the higher average power of the pieces.  Good use of the fire demons can make for a short game.\n\n=== Movement and capture ===\n\n''Tenjiku shogi pieces that occur in [[chu shogi]] or [[dai shogi]] move as they do in that game, but the pieces from dai shogi promote differently.''\n\nAn opposing piece is captured by ''displacement'': That is, if a piece moves to a square occupied by an opposing piece, the opposing piece is displaced and removed from the board. A piece cannot move to a square occupied by a friendly piece, that is, by another piece controlled by the moving player. The one exception to this is the unique ''burn'' of the fire demon.\n\nEach piece on the game moves in a characteristic pattern. Pieces move either ''orthogonally'' (that is, forward, backward, left, or right, in the direction of one of the arms of a plus sign, '''+'''), or ''diagonally'' (in the direction of one of the arms of a multiplication sign, '''\u00d7'''). The vice general, fire demon, lion hawk, lion, and knight are exceptions, in that they do not move, or are not required to move, in a straight line.\n\nMany pieces are capable of several kinds of movement, with the type of movement most often depending on the direction. The movement categories are:\n\n====Step movers and limited range movers====\n\nSome pieces are limited to moving one square at a time. If a friendly piece occupies an adjacent square, the moving piece may not move in that direction; if an opposing piece is there, it may be displaced and captured.\n\nThe step movers are the king, drunk elephant, blind tiger, ferocious leopard, gold general, silver general, copper general, iron general, dog, and pawn. Other pieces may step in certain directions, but move differently in other directions.\n\nOther pieces have a limited range of two squares along a straight line. The water buffalo, chariot soldier, vertical soldier, and side soldier may move one or two squares in certain directions. They can only move to the second square if the first is unoccupied. They may capture on either square, but must stop where they capture.\n\n====Area movers====\n\nThe lion, lion hawk, vice general, and fire demon may take ''multiple'' (2 to 3) steps in a single turn. These do not have to be in a line, so these pieces can potentially reach every square within two or three steps of the starting square, not just squares along one of the diagonals or orthogonals. Such moves are also useful to get around obstructions. An area mover must stop where it captures.\n\n====Jumping pieces====\n\nSome pieces can ''jump'', or in the case of the knight can only jump: They pass over an intervening piece, whether friend or foe, with no effect on either. These are the free eagle, lion hawk, lion, soaring eagle, horned falcon, tetrarch, kirin, phoenix, and knight. These jumps all have a range of two squares: that is, the first square is passed over, and the piece lands (and captures) on the second. The knight jumps ''between'' the diagonals and orthogonals, and the lion and lion hawk may do so.\n\n====Ranging pieces====\n\nMany pieces can move any number of empty squares along a straight orthogonal or diagonal line, limited only by the edge of the board. If an opposing piece intervenes, it may be captured by moving to that square and removing it from the board. A ranging piece must stop where it captures, and cannot bypass a piece that is in its way. If a friendly piece intervenes, the moving piece is limited to a distance that stops short of the intervening piece; if the friendly piece is adjacent, it cannot move in that direction at all.\n\nThe ranging pieces are the great general, vice general, rook general, bishop general, free eagle, soaring eagle, horned falcon, queen, water buffalo, chariot soldier, fire demon, lion hawk, dragon king, dragon horse, rook, bishop, vertical mover, side mover, reverse chariot, vertical soldier, side soldier and lance.\n\n====Range jumping pieces====\n\nA few powerful pieces may jump over any number of pieces (including zero), friend or foe, along a diagonal or orthogonal, but only when making a capture. These are the great general, vice general, rook general, and bishop general.\n\nHowever, they may only jump over other pieces of ''lower rank'', whether friend or foe. None may jump a king or prince of either side. The relevant ranking is:\n#King, prince\n#Great general\n#Vice general\n#Rook general, bishop general\n\nThat is, bishop and rook generals cannot jump over any other range-jumping piece.\n\nThe range jumpers can nevertheless capture each other, even if they cannot jump over each other and there are other pieces outside the ranking in the way. (For example, though a rook general cannot jump over an enemy great general, it may still capture the great general.) They cannot capture a king or prince by jumping, but can do so without jumping.\n\nSome descriptions of the game do not limit this ability to moves making a capture. However, most mention that these pieces have two types of move, ranging and range jumping, suggesting that the capture rule may have been mistakenly omitted.\n\n====Multiple captures====\n\nThe lion, lion hawk, soaring eagle and horned falcon have sequential multiple-capture abilities, called \"lion moves\". The fire demon can \"burn\" multiple pieces simultaneously. These unusual moves are described below.\n\n====Other====\n\nThe heavenly tetrarch cannot move to an adjacent square, and has other idiosyncrasies; the fire demon 'burns' adjacent pieces. This is best described below.\n\n====Repeated board positions====\n\nA player is not allowed to make a move that would return the board to a previous position, with the same player to move. This rule prevents games from entering into a repeated loop.\n\n=== Promotion ===\n\n''Tenjiku shogi pieces that occur in [[chu shogi]] promote as they do in that game, with the exceptions of the lion and queen, which do not promote in chu shogi.''\n\nA player's ''promotion zone'' consists of the five far ranks, at the original line of the opponent's pawns and beyond. When a promotable piece makes a move entering the promotion zone, or makes a capture within the promotion zone&mdash;including captures entering, leaving, or entirely within the zone&mdash;it has the option of \"promoting\" to a more powerful rank.\n\nPieces which take multiple steps per move are probably not allowed to promote by crossing into the promotion zone and back out again: this is not explicitly stated in the rules, and chu shogi does not offer guidance here because such pieces do not promote in chu shogi, but it would contravene the usual stipulation that the move start outside and end inside the promotion zone. Another small piece of evidence is that the fire demon's burn is only calculated at the end of a turn, like promotion, and it does not apply to intermediate steps in the move. For similar reasons, ''igui'' or capturing probably does not allow promotion if the move begins and ends outside the promotion zone, even if it passes in and back out along the way.\n\nPromotion is effected by turning the piece over after it moves, revealing the name of its promoted rank. As such, a promoted piece cannot then promote a second time. Promotion is not mandatory if the unpromoted piece could move further on a later turn, and in some cases it may be beneficial to leave the piece unpromoted. Promotion is permanent and promoted pieces may not revert to their original rank.\n\nPromoting a piece has the effect of changing how that piece moves. See above for what each piece promotes to and below for how they move.\n\nThe king, great general, vice general, free eagle, lion hawk, and fire demon do not promote, nor can already promoted pieces promote further.\n\nIf a piece which cannot retreat or move to the side advances to the far rank, so that it would otherwise have no further legal move, it is trapped. These pieces are the pawn, knight, iron general, and lance. In practice this would never occur for pawns or lances, which promote to pieces which keep their old moves, so that there is never any reason to defer their promotion, as stalemate is a loss for the stalemated player.\n\nThe situation for the knight and iron general, which promote to pieces that do not keep their old moves, is unclear. Since there could be a reason to defer their promotion, it is possible that they receive a second chance to promote at the far rank on a non-capture, as in chu shogi. (In chu shogi, this provision applies to pawns, which are not completely upward compatible with the gold generals they promote to because of the rules against trading lions.) This second chance, if it exists, can likewise be declined, leaving the knight or iron general as an immobile \"dead piece\" (\u6b7b\u306b\u99d2). However, this is uncertain, because it is not clear when the rule of pawn promotion was added to chu shogi (before or after the invention of tenjiku shogi), and because the Edo-era sources have numerous lacunae in the rules for the variants other than  sho shogi and chu shogi.\n\nIf a piece is not promoted upon entering the promotion zone, then it may not promote until it leaves the zone and reenters unless it makes a capture.\n\n===Movement diagrams===\nIn the diagrams below, the different types of moves are coded by symbol and by color: blue for step moves, green for multiple capture, red for range moves, yellow for jumps, and orange for ranging jumps.\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| colspan=\"2\" style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | '''Notation'''\n|-\n| align=center width=\"20\" style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || Jumps to this square, bypassing any intervening piece.\n|-\n| align=center width=\"20\" style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || Steps a limited number of squares along a straight line.\n|-\n| align=center width=\"20\" style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cf || Steps within an area, not restricted to a straight line.

Piece names with a grey background are present at the start of the game; those with a blue background only appear with promotion. [[Fairy chess piece#Ralph Betza's \"funny notation\"|Betza's funny notation]] has been included in brackets for easier reference, with the extension that the notation ''xxx'''''a'''''yyy'''''K''' stands for an ''xxx'''''K''' move possibly followed by an ''yyy'''''K''' move, not necessarily in the same direction. Larger numbers of 'legs' can be indicated by repeated application of 'a', or by numbers: thus ''a3K'' means a piece that can take up to three steps of a king. By default continuation legs can go into all directions, but can be restricted to a single line by a modifier 'v' (\"vertical\", interpreted relative to the piece's current position on its path). The default modality of all legs is the ability to move and capture: other possibilities are specified explicitly. Thus ''mKa3K'' means a piece that takes up to three steps of a king, but must stop when it first captures. Square brackets are used to make it clear what legs the '''a''' modifier chains together: thus '''DaK''' would denote a [[dabbaba (chess)|dabbaba]] move followed by a king move, but '''D[aK]''' would denote a piece that can move as a dabbaba, or twice as a king.\n\nAnother extension is that inequalities can be used in place of numbers denoting range: thus, while R4 is a piece that moves like a rook, but only up to four squares, R(2\u2264''n''\u22644) is a piece that moves like a rook, but only two, three, or four squares. Further, '''p''n''''' refers to cannon-like pieces that can jump at most ''n'' pieces along their path, and '''pp''' means the same as '''p\u221e''' (just as '''WW''' is synonymous with '''W\u221e''', both meaning a rook). Finally, '''x''' stands for \"shooting\": the '''xK''' for instance can pass its turn (shooting empty squares), or it can shoot (capture) any adjacent enemy piece without moving.\n\n<center>\n{| border=\"1\" width=\"100%\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" width=\"50%\" | '''Jeweled general''' (inferior player's king) \u7389\u5c06 ''gyokush\u014d''\n| style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" width=\"50%\" | '''Prince''' \u592a\u5b50 ''taishi''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n| width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | \u7389 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|}</center>\n* Step: The king can step one square in any direction, orthogonal or diagonal.

This move is equivalent to two turns for a king.\n**Unlike area movers, the lion can continue after a capture on the first step, capturing up to two pieces on each turn.\n**By moving back to its starting square, it can effectively capture a piece on an adjacent square without moving. This is called \u5c45\u55b0\u3044 ''igui'' \"stationary feeding\".\n**It can also do the same to an empty square, without capturing anything.  This is traditionally indicated by tapping the lion and leaving it in place.\n*Jump: A lion can jump anywhere within a distance of two squares: That is, anywhere it could reach in two step moves on an empty board, though of course it cannot land on a square occupied by a friendly piece. This is equivalent to jumping in any of the eight diagonal or orthogonal directions, or making any of the jumps of a knight in Western chess. (NAD[aK])\n''Note: The restrictions when capturing a lion in [[chu shogi]] do not apply in tenjiku shogi.''\n|-\n| style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | '''Phoenix''' \u9cf3\u51f0 ''h\u014d\u014d''\n| style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | '''Kirin''' \u9e92\u9e9f ''kirin''\n|- valign=\"top\"\n|<center>\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|- align=center\n| width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp; || width=\"20\" | &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || style=\"background:#e0e0e0;\" | \u9cf3 || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#d0d0f0;\" | \u25cb || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || style=\"background:#f0f0b0;\" | \u2606 || &nbsp;\n|- align=center\n| &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp; || &nbsp;\n|}</center>\n*Step: The phoenix can move one square in one of the four orthogonal directions.\n*Jump: It can jump to the second square in one of the four diagonal directions.

(fbR)\n|}</center>\n\n=== Repetition ===\nA player may not make a move if the resulting position is one that has previously occurred in the game ''with the same player to move''. (However, evidence from historical chu shogi mating problems suggests that this prohibition does not apply to a player who is in check.) This is called repetition (\u5343\u65e5\u624b ''sennichite''). Note that certain pieces have the ability to pass in certain situations (lions, soaring eagles, horned falcons, vice generals, fire demons, free eagles, and lion hawks). Such a pass move leaves the position unchanged, but it does not violate the repetition rule, as it will now be the turn of the other player to move. Of course, two consecutive passes are not possible, as the first player will see the same position as before.\n\n=== Check and mate ===\n\nWhen a player makes a move, such that the opponent's only remaining king or prince could be captured on the following move, the move is said to ''give check''; the king or prince is said to be ''in check''. If a player's last king or prince is in check and no legal move by that player will get it out of check, the checking move is also ''[[checkmate|mate]]'', and effectively wins the game.\n\nUnlike Western chess, a player need not move out of check in tenjiku shogi, and indeed may even move into check. Although obviously not often a good idea, a player with more than one royal may occasionally sacrifice one of these pieces as part of a [[gambit]].\n\n=== Game end ===\n\nA player who captures the opponent's sole remaining king or prince wins the game. This would presumably imply that [[checkmate]] and [[stalemate]] both lead to wins for the checkmating or stalemating player.\n\nIn practice these winning conditions are rarely fulfilled, as a player will typically resign when checkmated, as otherwise when loss is inevitable.\n\nA player who makes an illegal move loses immediately. (This rule may be relaxed in casual games.)\n\n== Handicaps ==\n\nGames between players of disparate strength may be played with handicaps, by analogy with chu shogi. In a handicap game, one or more of White's pieces is removed before the start of play, and White plays the first move of the game. However, no historical handicap system is known, unlike for chu shogi.\n\n== Game notation ==\n\nThe method used in English-language texts to express shogi moves was established by George Hodges in 1976. It is derived from the [[Algebraic chess notation|algebraic notation used for chess]], but modifications have been made for tenjiku shogi.\n\nA typical example is '''P-8g'''.\nThe first letter represents the piece moved (see above).\nPromoted pieces have a '''+''' added in front of the letter. e.g., '''+P''' for a promoted pawn.  The designation of the piece is followed by a symbol indicating the type of move: '''-''' for an ordinary move or '''x''' for a capture.  Next is the designation for the square on which the piece lands.  This consists of a number representing the file and a lowercase letter representing the rank, with '''1a''' being the top right corner (as seen from Black's point of view) and '''16p''' being the bottom left corner.  (This method of designating squares is based on Japanese convention, which, however, uses [[Japanese numerals]] instead of letters. For example, the square 2c is denoted by 2\u4e09 in Japanese.)\n\nIf a lion, horned falcon, soaring eagle or Heavenly Tetrarch captures by ''igui'', or the fire demon burns, the square of the piece being captured is used instead of the destination square, and this is preceded by the symbol '''!'''.  A piece moving next to a fire demon (suicide move) is followed by a '''*'''.  If a double or triple capture is made, than subsequent captures are added after the first capture.\n\nIf a move entitles the player to promote the piece, then a '''+''' is added to the end to signify that the promotion was taken, or an '''=''' to indicate that it was declined.\nFor example, '''Nx7d=''' indicates a knight capturing on 7d without promoting.\n\nIn cases where the above notation would be ambiguous, the designation of the start square is added after the designation for the piece in order to make clear which piece is meant.\n\nMoves are commonly numbered as in chess.\n\nIn handicap games White plays first, so Black's move 1 is replaced by an [[ellipsis]].\n\n==Notes on disputed moves==\n*Lion hawk\n:The Shogi Association (TSA) rules, for unknown reasons, interpreted \"like a lion\" to mean that the lion hawk did not have the full lion powers of jump and double capture, but only a two-step area move. This interpretation was never made in Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi, and has largely been abandoned in the West as well. Giving the lion hawk full lion powers brings the piece into line with the rest of the game,<ref name=CPAdams>[http://www.colina.demon.co.uk/tenjiku.pdf CP Adams's book on tenjiku tactics] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050521122957/http://www.colina.demon.co.uk/tenjiku.pdf |date=2005-05-21 }}</ref> and is the only interpretation supported by the historical sources.\n\n*Free eagle\n:Western sources<ref name=CPAdams/> give the free eagle the move of a queen plus the ability to jump to the second square along an orthogonal. This however seems unlikely, given that such a move could be more easily expressed as \"moves as queen or kirin\".\n\n:Japanese Wikipedia states \u659c\u3081\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u98db\u3073\u8d8a\u3048\u3066\u306f\u884c\u3051\u306a\u3044\u304c\u3001\u7e26\u6a2a\u306e\u5834\u5408\u306f\u99d2\u3092\u98db\u3073\u8d8a\u3048\u3066\u884c\u3051\u308b \"it cannot jump on the diagonals, but can jump pieces on the orthogonals.\" The diagram shows an orthogonal ''range jump,'' but the free eagle does not appear in the ranking list of range-jumping pieces.\n\n:However, the Edo-era ''[[Sho Sh\u014dgi Zushiki]]'' states that it moves \u5982\u5954\u738b\u4ea6\u732b\u5204\u518d\u5ea6\u6b69\u517c\u4e8c\u884c \"as a queen or two times as a cat sword in two directions\", which could be taken as requiring the piece to finish on one of the orthogonals, if not exactly a jump; while elsewhere in the ''Sho Sh\u014dgi Zushiki'' and in the ''Sh\u014dgi Zushiki'' it says that \u5954\u738b\u306e\u52d5\u304d\u306b\u52a0\u3048\u3066\u3001\u732b\u5204\u306e\u52d5\u304d\uff08\u659c\u3081\u56db\u65b9\u5411\u306b1\u30de\u30b9\u52d5\u304f\uff09\u30922\u5ea6\u3067\u304d\u308b \"in addition to moving as a queen, it can make a [[ferz (chess)|cat-sword]] move (one square in one of the four diagonals) twice\", which has no such implication, but which Japanese Wikipedia says is thought to mean a jump. This creates a symmetry between the free eagle and lion hawk: the lion hawk is a lion combined with the diagonal moves of the queen, while the free eagle is a queen combined with the diagonal moves of the lion.\n\n*Fire demon\n:TSA rules state that if you move your fire demon next to an opposing fire demon, only your fire demon is immolated; all other adjacent pieces survive. This implies that a fire demon's passive burn (how it automatically burns enemy pieces that end up next to it without moving) is faster than its active burn (how it burns enemy pieces that it moves next to). A few computer programs and books stipulate that other adjacent pieces are immolated as well, with only the opposing fire demon surviving, but this interpretation is not widely followed. Both variants are playable, though the TSA rules are more consistent in not allowing the suicidal fire demon to burn anything at all.\n\n:Japanese Wikipedia states only that \u706b\u9b3c\u304c\u706b\u9b3c\u306e\u96a3\u306b\u79fb\u52d5\u3057\u305f\u3068\u304d\u306f\u3001\u52d5\u3044\u305f\u65b9\u304c\u713c\u304b\u308c\u308b \"When a fire demon moves next to a fire demon, the moving piece is burnt,\" without mentioning the fate of surrounding pieces (thus perhaps implying that nothing special happens to them).\n\n:The two Edo-era sources have the orthogonal ranging move along the rank of the board. Western sources have it move along the file, but moving along the rank (as used in this article) would be more in keeping with the fire demon being a promoted water buffalo.\n\n*Heavenly tetrarch\n:Western sources do not have the ranging move along the orthogonal. However, the ''Sho Sh\u014dgi Zushiki'' states it moves \u5982\u8eca\u5175\u4ea6\u8fd1\u516b\u65b9\u4e0d\u884c\u5176\u5916\u5468\u4e8c\u4e09\u8981\u7528\u6b69 \"as a chariot soldier, also the eight neighboring squares without moving and taking two or three steps outside the periphery\", and this is consistent with it being a promoted chariot soldier.\n\n*Range-jumping generals\n:TSA rules state that the range-jumping generals cannot ''capture'' an equal or higher-ranking piece, not just that they cannot jump over them. This gives a huge advantage to Black, so that Black can win every game if played right, but is not supported by Japanese articles on tenjiku shogi and has been largely abandoned in the West as unplayable. This is due to the very terse wording of the historical documents, that do not make it clear if the capture of an equal or higher-ranking piece is allowed even if such a piece cannot be jumped over. The presence of the king in the hierarchy suggested the TSA rules, since the king cannot jump-capture at all, and in any situation where the enemy king could be jumped over it would not happen in practice as it would simply be captured. Due to the resulting playability problem, it was suggested that capturing would be allowed but not jumping, but this allowed for smothered mates in the opening and again gives a huge advantage to Black. However, the rule used in this article and ''The Chess Variant Pages'', which allows the capture of equal or higher-ranking pieces except kings or princes, removes this advantage to Black.\n\n== Strategy ==\n\n=== Piece values ===\nAccording to the German Chu Shogi Association, the average values of the pieces are (using the interpretations of the English-language sources):\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+Average piece values\n!

They have also been normalized so that the pawn is worth 1 point to avoid fractions. Additionally, pieces gain in value if they have a good chance of promotion (particularly for the water buffalo, which promotes to the most powerful piece in the game), and the jumping generals and fire demon tend to lose some power as the board empties (because they then cannot make full use of their jumping and burning abilities).\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Shogi variant]]\n* [[Wa shogi]]\n* [[Chu shogi]]\n* [[Heian dai shogi]]\n* [[Dai shogi]]\n* [[Dai dai shogi]]\n* [[Maka dai dai shogi]]\n* [[Tai shogi]]\n* [[Taikyoku shogi]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.chessvariants.com/index/msdisplay.php?itemid=MStenjikushogi Tenjiku Shogi] at ''[[The Chess Variant Pages]]''\n* [http://www.shogi.net/shogi.html Shogi Net]\n* [http://history.chess.free.fr/papers/Tenjiku-Colin%20Adams.pdf CP Adams's book on tenjiku tactics]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20120317120548/http://colina.demon.co.uk:5001/ CP Adams's Tenjiku shogi wiki]\n* [http://www.gamerz.net/pbmserv/tenjikushogi.html Gamerz.net/tenjiku shogi]\n* [http://history.chess.free.fr/tenjikushogi.htm History.chess/tenjiku shogi]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110311151740/http://www.luckydog.pwp.blueyonder.co.uk/games/tenjiku/ Tenjiku shogi games and problems]\n* [http://hgm.nubati.net/tenjiku/tenjiku.html Tenjiku Shogi, the wild Chess game] (by H.

In the north-west of the constituency are communities such as [[Hengoed]] and [[Ystrad Mynach]], extending in a southeasterly direction through [[Caerphilly]] and [[Llanbradach]] to the rural outcrops bordering [[Cardiff]].\n\n== Members of Parliament ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|Election!!Member<ref>{{Rayment-hc|c|1|date=March 2012}}</ref>!!Party\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]]\n| [[Alfred Onions]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1921 Caerphilly by-election|1921]]\n| [[Morgan Jones (Welsh politician)|Morgan Jones]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1939 Caerphilly by-election|1939]]\n| [[Ness Edwards]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1968 Caerphilly by-election|1968]]\n| [[Alfred Evans (politician)|Alfred Evans]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979]]\n|rowspan=\"2\"| [[Ednyfed Hudson Davies]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Social Democratic Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| ''1981''\n| [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|SDP]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[1983 United Kingdom general election|1983]]\n| [[Ron Davies (British politician)|Ron Davies]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|-\n|style=\"background-color: {{Labour Party (UK)/meta/color}}\" |\n| [[2001 United Kingdom general election|2001]]\n| [[Wayne David]]\n| [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]\n|}\n\n== Elections ==\n===Elections in the 2010s===\n\n{{Election box begin|title=[[2019 United Kingdom general election|General election 2019]]: Caerphilly<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/politics/constituencies/W07000076|title=Caerphilly parliamentary constituency -

This reaction mechanism is particularly unique relative to other enzymes that use the PLP cofactor because Glycine is initially deprotonated by a highly conserved active site lysine, leading to condensation with succinyl-CoA and loss of CoA. Protonation of the carbonyl group of the intermediate by an active site histidine leads to loss of the carboxyl group. The last intermediate is finally reprotonated to produce ALA. Dissociation of ALA from the enzyme is the rate limiting step of the enzymatic reaction and was shown to be depended upon a slow conformational change of the enzyme. The function of [[pyridoxal phosphate]] is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen, by utilizing the electrophilic [[pyridinium]] ring as an electron sink.\n:[[File:ALAS Reaction Mechanism Image.jpg|675px]]\n\nThe location of this enzyme in biological systems is indicative of the feedback that it may receive.

There are two forms of ALA synthase in the body. One form is expressed in red blood cell precursor cells ([[ALAS2]]), whereas the other ([[ALAS1]]) is ubiquitously expressed throughout the body. The red blood cell form is coded by a gene on chromosome x, whereas the other form is coded by a gene on chromosome 3.\n\nThe disease X-linked [[sideroblastic anemia]] is caused by mutations in the ALA synthase gene on chromosome X, whereas no diseases are known to be caused by mutations in the other gene. Gain of function mutations in the erythroid specific ALA synthase gene have been shown recently to cause a previously unknown form of porphyria known as X-linked-dominant protoporphyria.\n\n==Enzyme structure and properties==\nPLP-dependent enzymes are prevalent because they are needed to transform amino acids into other resources.<ref name=mol1 /> ALAS is a homodimer with similarly sized sub units and the active sites consisting of amino acid side chains such as arginine, threonine, and lysine exist at a subunity interface.<ref name=mol1 /> The protein when extracted from R. spheroids contains 1600-folds and weighs about 80,000 daltons.<ref  name=plants>{{cite journal|last1=Beale|first1=S I|title=\u03b4-Aminolevulinic Acid in Plants: Its Biosynthesis, Regulation, and Role in Plastid Development|journal=Annual Review of Plant Physiology|date=June 1978|volume=29|issue=1|pages=95\u2013120|doi=10.1146/annurev.pp.29.060178.000523}}</ref> Enzymatic activity varies for different sources of the enzyme.<ref name=plants />\n\n==Reaction mechanism==\n\nThe active sites of ALAS utilize three key amino acid side chains: Arg-85 and Thr-430 and Lys-313.

Before the reaction can begin, the PLP cofactor binds to the lysine side chain to form a Schiff base that promotes attack by glycine substrate.<ref>{{cite web|title=ALA synthase|url=http://flipper.diff.org/app/pathways/info/6362|website=flipper e nuvola|publisher=Turin University|accessdate=10 March 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 12686158 | volume=1647 | issue=1\u20132 | title=5-Aminolevulinic acid synthase: mechanism, mutations and medicine. | date=Apr 2003 | journal=Biochim Biophys Acta | pages=361\u20136| doi = 10.1016/s1570-9639(03)00095-5 | last1=Shoolingin-Jordan | first1=Peter M. | last2=Al-Daihan | first2=Sooad | last3=Alexeev | first3=Dmitriy | last4=Baxter | first4=Robert L. | last5=Bottomley | first5=Sylvia S. | last6=Kahari | first6=I.Donald | last7=Roy | first7=Ipsita | last8=Sarwar | first8=Muhammad | last9=Sawyer | first9=Lindsay | last10=Wang | first10=Shu-Fen }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=CHOI|first1=H|title=Cloning, expression, and characterization of 5-aminolevulinic acid synthase from Rhodopseudomonas palustris KUGB306|journal=FEMS Microbiology Letters|date=July 2004|volume=236|issue=2|pages=175\u2013181|doi=10.1016/j.femsle.2004.05.048}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Ferreira|first1=Gloria C.|last2=Neame|first2=Peter J.|last3=Dailey|first3=Harry A.|title=Heme biosynthesis in mammalian systems: Evidence of a schiff base linkage between the pyridoxal 5\u2032-phosphate cofactor and a lysine residue in 5-aminolevulinate synthase|journal=Protein Science|date=November 1993|volume=2|issue=11|pages=1959\u20131965|doi=10.1002/pro.5560021117|pmid=8268805|pmc=2142290}}</ref> Lysine acts as a general base during this mechanism,.<ref name=mol1 /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Hunter|first1=Gregory A.|last2=Ferreira|first2=Gloria C.|title=Lysine-313 of 5-Aminolevulinate Synthase Acts as a General Base during Formation of the Quinonoid Reaction Intermediates|journal=Biochemistry|date=March 1999|volume=38|issue=12|pages=3711\u20133718|doi=10.1021/bi982390w}}</ref> In the detailed reaction mechanism, the hydronium atoms that are added in come from a variety of residues that offer hydrogen bonds to facilitate ALA synthesis.<ref name=mol1 />\nALA synthase removes the [[carboxyl]] group from glycine and the [[coenzyme A|CoA]] from the succinyl-CoA by means of its prosthetic group [[pyridoxal phosphate]] (a vitamin b6 derivative), forming \u03b4-aminolevulinic acid (dALA), so called because the [[amino]] group is on the fourth carbon atom in the molecule. This reaction mechanism is particularly unique relative to other enzymes that use the PLP cofactor because Glycine is initially deprotonated by a highly conserved active site lysine, leading to condensation with succinyl-CoA and loss of CoA. Protonation of the carbonyl group of the intermediate by an active site histidine leads to loss of the carboxyl group. The last intermediate is finally reprotonated to produce ALA. Dissociation of ALA from the enzyme is the rate limiting step of the enzymatic reaction and was shown to be depended upon a slow conformational change of the enzyme. The function of [[pyridoxal phosphate]] is to facilitate the removal of hydrogen, by utilizing the electrophilic [[pyridinium]] ring as an electron sink.\n:[[File:ALAS Reaction Mechanism Image.jpg|675px]]\n\nThe location of this enzyme in biological systems is indicative of the feedback that it may receive. ALA Synthase has been found in bacteria, yeast, avian and mammalian liver and blood cells and bone marrow. The location of this enzyme in animal cells is within the mitochondria.<ref name =plants /> Since the enzyme appears to be located near its source of succinyl-CoA and the end of the heme pathway indicates that the starting and end points of heme biosynthesis serves as feedback for ALA synthase.<ref name =plants /> ALA synthase is also inhibited by [[hemin]] and [[glucose]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Doss M, Sixel-Dietrich F, Verspohl F | title = \"Glucose effect\" and rate limiting function of uroporphyrinogen synthase on porphyrin metabolism in hepatocyte culture: relationship with human acute hepatic porphyrias. | journal = J Clin Chem Clin Biochem | volume = 23 | issue = 9 | pages = 505\u201313 | year = 1985 | pmid = 4067519 | doi=10.1515/cclm.1985.23.9.505| url = https://edoc.hu-berlin.de/bitstream/18452/13180/1/cclm.1985.23.9.505.pdf }}</ref>\n\n[[Image:Heme synth step1.png|thumb|center|300px|Heme synthesis]]\n\n==Biological function==\nALAS1 and ALAS2 catalyze the first step in the process of heme synthesis.

However Britain also advanced inland for the first time, stretching to present-day Nkambe, and then further north to the Lake Chad areas. That whole strip of territory was then denoted as British Cameroons, which was administered as an appendage of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fanso |first1=V. |title=Public Documents on Southern Cameroons Unification 1959\u20131961 |date=2012}}</ref> In 1916 Britain and France signed a treaty known as the Simon-Milne Declaration, to respect the frontiers between the British Cameroons and French Cameroun. When Germany was finally defeated in 1918, it was compelled to sign the Treaties of Versailles in 1919, relinquishing control of all its colonies to the Allied and Associated Powers, including the territory known since 1916 as the British Cameroon. On 10 July 1919 Britain and France reiterated the boundary treaty concluded in 1916 and both undertook to administer their respective new colonial territories in accordance with Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant. British sovereignty over the Southern Cameroons was maintained until 1922 when Southern Cameroons became a Mandated Territory by the League of Nations.\n\nThe British Cameroons Administration Ordinance, 1924, as subsequently amended up to 1929, divided the British Cameroons into the Northern Cameroons (administered as part of Northern Nigeria) and the Southern Cameroons (administered as part of Eastern Nigeria). When the mandates system was transmuted into the trusteeship system in 1946 this arrangement was again provided for in the Order-in-Council of 2 August 1946 providing for the administration of the Nigeria Protectorate and Cameroons under British mandate. Meanwhile, the boundary between the British Cameroons and French Cameroun was more exactly defined in an agreement signed by the Governor-General of Nigeria and the Governor of French Cameroun in 1930 and approved by Britain and France.<ref>{{cite news |title=Declaration made by the Governor of the colony and protectorate of Nigeria and the Governor of the French Cameroons Defining the Boundary between British and French Cameroons |agency=His Majesty's Stationery Office London |issue=2 |publisher=Great Britain Foreign Office |date=1930}}</ref> In 1953 the Southern Cameroons representatives in the Eastern Nigerian Legislature demanded from Britain a regional status for the Southern Cameroons with seat of government in Buea. The Order in-Council of 1954 established a Legislative House known as the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons. An Executive Council was also established. The Southern Cameroons gained limited autonomy as a quasi-region within the Nigerian Federation. The first sitting of the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons met on 26 October 1954. [[EML Endeley|Dr. Endeley]] emerged as leader of the Southern Cameroons. His official title was Leader of Government Business, the reason being that the Southern Cameroons a quasi-region and therefore only semi-autonomous.\n\nIn 1958, the Southern Cameroons attained the status of a full region and became autonomous and fully self-governing. Dr. Endeley's official title accordingly changed to that of Premier (Prime Minister).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mbile |first1=N.N. |title=Cameroon Political Story: Memories of an Authentic Eye Witness |date=2011 |publisher=Langaa |location=Bamenda |pages=85\u201388}}</ref> In 1957, United Nations Resolutions 1064 (XI) of 26 Feb 1957 and 1207 (XII) of Dec 13, 1957 called on the Administering Authorities to hasten arrangements for Trust territories to attain self-governance or independence. In 1958 the House of Assembly and the House of Chiefs called for complete separation from Nigeria and total independence. In 1959 the opposition party Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP) won elections making it the first time in Africa that power changed hands peacefully from a government in power to an opposition party. [[John Ngu Foncha]] leader of the KNDP became the second Premier (Prime Minister) of the Southern Cameroons9. Furthermore, United Nations' resolutions 1350 (XIII) of March 13, 1959 and 1352 (XIV) of October 16, 1959 called on Britain, the Administering Authority to organize a plebiscite in the Southern Cameroons under UN supervision based on the following two 'alternatives': independence by joining Nigeria as one of the autonomous regions of that country or French Cameroun in a federation of two states, equal state in status.<ref>{{cite web |title=United Nations Trusteeship Council. 1961.

The Constitution put in place a full-fledged parliamentary and ministerial system of government modelled after that of the United Kingdom. This constitutional measure was taken contemporaneously with the separation of the Southern Cameroons from Nigeria. The Southern Cameroons attained the status of a full self-governing Territory though still a United Nations Trust Territory under Britain.\n\n===The plebiscite (1961)===\n[[File:Ambazonia emblem.jpg|thumb|Ambazonian Governing Council emblem]]\n\nThe United Nations had decided to put an end to all trusteeships by the end of 1960. All trusteeship territories were granted unconditional independence but British Southern Cameroons was faced with a choice: attaining independence by joining the French Cameroun Republic in a federation of two equal states or joining Nigeria as one of its federated regions. The reason for this position was based on the 1959 Phillipson Report, which claimed that Southern Cameroons was not economically capable of sustaining itself as an independent state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0u9bWHQzDnIC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=Phillipson+Report++cameroon#v=onepage&q=Phillipson+Report++cameroon&f=false |title=Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A Study of the Politics of Recognition and Representation in Cameroon |first1=Piet |last1=Konings |first2=Francis Beng|last2=Nyamnjoh|date=1 January 2003 |publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9004132953 }}</ref> The United Nations initiated discussions with French Cameroun on the terms of association of Southern Cameroons  if the outcome of the plebiscite was in favour of a federation of the two countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lynn (editor) |first1=M. |title=The future of the Southern Cameroons': co brief for Mr Macleod.

Although Southern Cameroons had voted to join French Cameroon upon achieving independence, French Cameroon voted against her independence. It was agreed that Britain, the UN, Southern Cameroons and French Cameroon would together discuss the terms of federation.<ref>{{cite web |title=1608 (XV) The future of the Trust Territory of the Cameroons under United Kingdom administration. 994th Plenary meeting. 21 April 1961.

Instead only the Southern Cameroons and the French Cameroon Republic delegations met in Foumban, a town in French Cameroon. (The UN and Britain gave no reasons for keeping away from the meeting.)  However instead of frank discussions, President [[Ahidjo]] of the French Cameroon Republic, presented the Southern Cameroons delegation with a copy of the French Cameroon constitution of 1960 and requested them to make suggestions for modification which might or might not be taken into account. The Southern Cameroonian delegation deeply disappointed by the condescending approach of Ahidjo returned home in the hope that the government of French Cameroon would reconsider its stance and open the constitution for amendment that will befit a federated state with two equal partners. However this was not to be. In August 1961 a Southern Cameroons delegation met with French Cameroonians in Yaound\u00e9 for further discussions about the constitution. Again no agreement was reached. Thus though the plebiscite was an expression of willingness to associate with French Cameroon, the discussions that were necessary to hammer out an agreed document and set the legal basis of the federation never took place, nor were any agreements subsequently signed between the two countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Achankeng |first1=F. |title=The Foumban \"Constitutional\" Talks and Prior Intentions of Negotiating: A Historico-Theoretical Analysis of a False Negotiation and the Ramifications for Political Developments in Cameroon |journal=Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective |date=2014 |volume=9 |pages=129\u2013154}}</ref>\n\n===The incorporation of the Southern Cameroons in French Cameroon (1961\u20131972)===\nOn 1 September 1961, the parliament of French Cameroon voted in favor of the new constitution. It was essentially the version for the Foumban conference written by Ahidjo and his French advisers in advance. To make it binding under international law, it should also have been voted by the parliament of Southern Cameroons. That did not happen. The lack of agreement and intergovernmental commitment is mentioned by Ambazonian independence representatives as an essential feature of the Union's illegality. A further concern mentioned is that the federal constitution gives the impression that French Cameroon reacquired the Southern Cameroons. In order to achieve this, the detour via the form of the Federation is chosen.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |last1=Anyangwe |first1=Carlson |title=What History Books Don't Tell You About the British Southern Cameroons.

On the next day, the army of French Cameroon marched over the border. The Mobile Wing (armed police of the Southern Cameroons) was disarmed by them.

His official title was 'Inspecteur Federal d'Administration'. He was accountable directly to the President of French Cameroon. Then followed a host of other French Cameroon civil servants, including subsequently its police force, which literally took over Southern Cameroons.\n\nFrench Cameroon was renamed East Cameroon and the Southern Cameroons were renamed West Cameroon. In 1965 Augustine N. Jua became the Prime Minister of West Cameroon but was sacked by President Ahidjo in 1968 and replaced by [[Solomon T. Muna|S. T. Muna]]. French advisors of president Ahidjo recommended the introduction of bilingual schools to educate and assimilate Southern Cameroonians in favour of French Cameroon.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hure |first1=Francis |title=memo of 12th April 1966 of the french ambassador in Cameroon to the french foreign minister |url=http://mendafilms.com/film-projects/freely-expressed-wishes-southern-cameroons-ambazonia.html |website=Mendafilms |accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> The aim was to slowly absorb the 'Anglo-Saxon' Southern Cameroonians into the francophone hemisphere.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Moreux |first1=Michel |title=confidential memo of 22nd of August 1968 consulat of France in Buea to the french ambassador in Yaound\u00e9 |url=http://mendafilms.com/film-projects/freely-expressed-wishes-southern-cameroons-ambazonia.html |website=Mendafilms |accessdate=18 August 2018}}</ref> That happened additional to the massive deployment of administrators from East Cameroon. Foncha expressed his unhappiness with Ahidjo's progressive assimilation and marginalization of the people of the former Southern Cameroons. Ahidjo sacked him from the position of Vice President and replaced him with S. T. Muna in 1970. In spring 1972 president Ahidjo declared to conduct a referendum about the form of the state. The West Cameroon lawmakers heavily opposed and rejected that idea. Under duress and to avoid bloodshed they submitted to Ahidjo's decision. On 20 May 1972 the referendum was conducted with a favorable outcome for Ahidjo. The whole process was in violation of Article 47 of the constitution of the federation which prohibited any attempt to change the federal form of the state. The name of the state was changed from 'Federal Republic of Cameroon' to the 'United Republic of Cameroon'.

In the view of some, including Gorji-Dinka, Bernard Fonlon, and Carlson Anyangwe, particularly in the former [[British Cameroon]], this meant a dissolution of the 1961 [[personal union]]. It was in this light that beginning in 1984, Ambazonia, was declared to represent an intervention of the people of Southern Cameroons to return the statehood of the former British Southern Cameroons territory.<ref>Marcel Fomotar.

The group under Gorji-Dinka believed that by \"operation of the law\", there should be an equal participation by the two states that made up the now extinct federation, in a new vision for their countries' (Republic of Cameroon and the Southern Cameroons) relations with each other. In the document, dubbed the \"new Social Order\", the Ambazonia's proposal of CACIN (the Cameroon-Ambazonia Confederacy of Independent Nations) was summarily rejected by the Republic of Cameroon.

On the west towards the [[Cameroon\u2013Nigeria border|border]] to Nigeria the lowlands of the Mamfe basin can be found. The area is covered with dense rain forest. There are protected areas like the [[Korup National Park]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ambazonia.org/en/67-korup-national-park|title=Korup National Park|website=ambazonia.org|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> or the [[Takamanda National Park]]. Further east towards Cameroon a series of volcanoes like the [[Manenguba|Manengouba]] or [[Mount Kupe|Kupe]] can be found. They stretch from the South along the border of Cameroon to the North where they go to the highlands of [[Bamenda]]. A bit isolated from the other volcanoes is the Mount [[Fako]] (Mount Cameroon) on the very Southern Tip of Ambazonia. At {{convert|4040|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} it is the highest mountain in Western Africa and the 28th highest in Africa overall.\n\n===Climate===\nAs large parts of Ambazonia are in the [[Western High Plateau]], they have a somewhat cooler climate than the surrounding areas in Cameroon and Nigeria. The [[Upland and lowland|lowlands]] along the coast and the river valleys of [[Manyu (department)|Manyu]], both of which are parts of the [[Benue Trough]], are warmer. Most of Ambazonia has a [[tropical monsoon climate]], with the coastal plain containing some of the rainiest places in the world (such as the village of [[Debundscha]]). The northeastern parts of [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]] (including the city of [[Bamenda]]) have a [[tropical savanna climate]], with distinct wet and dry seasons. At higher altitudes, such as the [[Oku Volcanic Field|Oku Massif]] and [[Mount Cameroon]], there are pockets where the temperatures fall sufficiently to be classified as a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]]. The top of Mount Cameroon has a [[polar climate]] of the [[tundra]] variant, unique in West Africa and extremely rare so close to the [[Equator]].<ref>Beck, H.E., Zimmermann, N. E., McVicar, T.

However Britain also advanced inland for the first time, stretching to present-day Nkambe, and then further north to the Lake Chad areas. That whole strip of territory was then denoted as British Cameroons, which was administered as an appendage of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Fanso |first1=V. |title=Public Documents on Southern Cameroons Unification 1959\u20131961 |date=2012}}</ref> In 1916 Britain and France signed a treaty known as the Simon-Milne Declaration, to respect the frontiers between the British Cameroons and French Cameroun. When Germany was finally defeated in 1918, it was compelled to sign the Treaties of Versailles in 1919, relinquishing control of all its colonies to the Allied and Associated Powers, including the territory known since 1916 as the British Cameroon. On 10 July 1919 Britain and France reiterated the boundary treaty concluded in 1916 and both undertook to administer their respective new colonial territories in accordance with Article 22 of the League of Nations Covenant. British sovereignty over the Southern Cameroons was maintained until 1922 when Southern Cameroons became a Mandated Territory by the League of Nations.\n\nThe British Cameroons Administration Ordinance, 1924, as subsequently amended up to 1929, divided the British Cameroons into the Northern Cameroons (administered as part of Northern Nigeria) and the Southern Cameroons (administered as part of Eastern Nigeria). When the mandates system was transmuted into the trusteeship system in 1946 this arrangement was again provided for in the Order-in-Council of 2 August 1946 providing for the administration of the Nigeria Protectorate and Cameroons under British mandate. Meanwhile, the boundary between the British Cameroons and French Cameroun was more exactly defined in an agreement signed by the Governor-General of Nigeria and the Governor of French Cameroun in 1930 and approved by Britain and France.<ref>{{cite news |title=Declaration made by the Governor of the colony and protectorate of Nigeria and the Governor of the French Cameroons Defining the Boundary between British and French Cameroons |agency=His Majesty's Stationery Office London |issue=2 |publisher=Great Britain Foreign Office |date=1930}}</ref> In 1953 the Southern Cameroons representatives in the Eastern Nigerian Legislature demanded from Britain a regional status for the Southern Cameroons with seat of government in Buea. The Order in-Council of 1954 established a Legislative House known as the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons. An Executive Council was also established. The Southern Cameroons gained limited autonomy as a quasi-region within the Nigerian Federation. The first sitting of the House of Assembly of the Southern Cameroons met on 26 October 1954. [[EML Endeley|Dr. Endeley]] emerged as leader of the Southern Cameroons. His official title was Leader of Government Business, the reason being that the Southern Cameroons a quasi-region and therefore only semi-autonomous.\n\nIn 1958, the Southern Cameroons attained the status of a full region and became autonomous and fully self-governing. Dr. Endeley's official title accordingly changed to that of Premier (Prime Minister).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Mbile |first1=N.N. |title=Cameroon Political Story: Memories of an Authentic Eye Witness |date=2011 |publisher=Langaa |location=Bamenda |pages=85\u201388}}</ref> In 1957, United Nations Resolutions 1064 (XI) of 26 Feb 1957 and 1207 (XII) of Dec 13, 1957 called on the Administering Authorities to hasten arrangements for Trust territories to attain self-governance or independence. In 1958 the House of Assembly and the House of Chiefs called for complete separation from Nigeria and total independence. In 1959 the opposition party Kamerun National Democratic Party (KNDP) won elections making it the first time in Africa that power changed hands peacefully from a government in power to an opposition party. [[John Ngu Foncha]] leader of the KNDP became the second Premier (Prime Minister) of the Southern Cameroons9. Furthermore, United Nations' resolutions 1350 (XIII) of March 13, 1959 and 1352 (XIV) of October 16, 1959 called on Britain, the Administering Authority to organize a plebiscite in the Southern Cameroons under UN supervision based on the following two 'alternatives': independence by joining Nigeria as one of the autonomous regions of that country or French Cameroun in a federation of two states, equal state in status.<ref>{{cite web |title=United Nations Trusteeship Council. 1961.

The Constitution put in place a full-fledged parliamentary and ministerial system of government modelled after that of the United Kingdom. This constitutional measure was taken contemporaneously with the separation of the Southern Cameroons from Nigeria. The Southern Cameroons attained the status of a full self-governing Territory though still a United Nations Trust Territory under Britain.\n\n===The plebiscite (1961)===\n[[File:Ambazonia emblem.jpg|thumb|Ambazonian Governing Council emblem]]\n\nThe United Nations had decided to put an end to all trusteeships by the end of 1960. All trusteeship territories were granted unconditional independence but British Southern Cameroons was faced with a choice: attaining independence by joining the French Cameroun Republic in a federation of two equal states or joining Nigeria as one of its federated regions. The reason for this position was based on the 1959 Phillipson Report, which claimed that Southern Cameroons was not economically capable of sustaining itself as an independent state.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0u9bWHQzDnIC&pg=PA33&lpg=PA33&dq=Phillipson+Report++cameroon#v=onepage&q=Phillipson+Report++cameroon&f=false |title=Negotiating an Anglophone Identity: A Study of the Politics of Recognition and Representation in Cameroon |first1=Piet |last1=Konings |first2=Francis Beng|last2=Nyamnjoh|date=1 January 2003 |publisher=BRILL|via=Google Books|isbn=9004132953 }}</ref> The United Nations initiated discussions with French Cameroun on the terms of association of Southern Cameroons  if the outcome of the plebiscite was in favour of a federation of the two countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lynn (editor) |first1=M. |title=The future of the Southern Cameroons': co brief for Mr Macleod.

Instead only the Southern Cameroons and the French Cameroon Republic delegations met in Foumban, a town in French Cameroon. (The UN and Britain gave no reasons for keeping away from the meeting.)  However instead of frank discussions, President [[Ahidjo]] of the French Cameroon Republic, presented the Southern Cameroons delegation with a copy of the French Cameroon constitution of 1960 and requested them to make suggestions for modification which might or might not be taken into account. The Southern Cameroonian delegation deeply disappointed by the condescending approach of Ahidjo returned home in the hope that the government of French Cameroon would reconsider its stance and open the constitution for amendment that will befit a federated state with two equal partners. However this was not to be. In August 1961 a Southern Cameroons delegation met with French Cameroonians in Yaound\u00e9 for further discussions about the constitution. Again no agreement was reached. Thus though the plebiscite was an expression of willingness to associate with French Cameroon, the discussions that were necessary to hammer out an agreed document and set the legal basis of the federation never took place, nor were any agreements subsequently signed between the two countries.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Achankeng |first1=F. |title=The Foumban \"Constitutional\" Talks and Prior Intentions of Negotiating: A Historico-Theoretical Analysis of a False Negotiation and the Ramifications for Political Developments in Cameroon |journal=Journal of Global Initiatives: Policy, Pedagogy, Perspective |date=2014 |volume=9 |pages=129\u2013154}}</ref>\n\n===The incorporation of the Southern Cameroons in French Cameroon (1961\u20131972)===\nOn 1 September 1961, the parliament of French Cameroon voted in favor of the new constitution. It was essentially the version for the Foumban conference written by Ahidjo and his French advisers in advance. To make it binding under international law, it should also have been voted by the parliament of Southern Cameroons. That did not happen. The lack of agreement and intergovernmental commitment is mentioned by Ambazonian independence representatives as an essential feature of the Union's illegality. A further concern mentioned is that the federal constitution gives the impression that French Cameroon reacquired the Southern Cameroons. In order to achieve this, the detour via the form of the Federation is chosen.<ref name=\"auto2\">{{cite web |last1=Anyangwe |first1=Carlson |title=What History Books Don't Tell You About the British Southern Cameroons.

In 1965 Augustine N. Jua became the Prime Minister of West Cameroon but was sacked by President Ahidjo in 1968 and replaced by [[Solomon T. Muna|S. T. Muna]].

Foncha expressed his unhappiness with Ahidjo's progressive assimilation and marginalization of the people of the former Southern Cameroons. Ahidjo sacked him from the position of Vice President and replaced him with S. T. Muna in 1970. In spring 1972 president Ahidjo declared to conduct a referendum about the form of the state. The West Cameroon lawmakers heavily opposed and rejected that idea. Under duress and to avoid bloodshed they submitted to Ahidjo's decision. On 20 May 1972 the referendum was conducted with a favorable outcome for Ahidjo. The whole process was in violation of Article 47 of the constitution of the federation which prohibited any attempt to change the federal form of the state. The name of the state was changed from 'Federal Republic of Cameroon' to the 'United Republic of Cameroon'.

Dinka was incarcerated the following January without trial and in the process became a \"martyr\" for separatist cause.{{sfn|Nkwi|Nchoji|2015|p=478}} \nThe name Ambazonia was used in 1984 by Fon Gorji-Dinka (leader of the Ambazonia advocacy group), when the parliament and government of the Republic of Cameroon changed the name of the country from the \"United Republic of Cameroon\" back to the pre-reunification name of the French Cameroun, the \"Republic of Cameroun\". In the view of some, including Gorji-Dinka, Bernard Fonlon, and Carlson Anyangwe, particularly in the former [[British Cameroon]], this meant a dissolution of the 1961 [[personal union]]. It was in this light that beginning in 1984, Ambazonia, was declared to represent an intervention of the people of Southern Cameroons to return the statehood of the former British Southern Cameroons territory.<ref>Marcel Fomotar.

The group under Gorji-Dinka believed that by \"operation of the law\", there should be an equal participation by the two states that made up the now extinct federation, in a new vision for their countries' (Republic of Cameroon and the Southern Cameroons) relations with each other. In the document, dubbed the \"new Social Order\", the Ambazonia's proposal of CACIN (the Cameroon-Ambazonia Confederacy of Independent Nations) was summarily rejected by the Republic of Cameroon.

There are protected areas like the [[Korup National Park]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ambazonia.org/en/67-korup-national-park|title=Korup National Park|website=ambazonia.org|access-date=2020-01-16}}</ref> or the [[Takamanda National Park]]. Further east towards Cameroon a series of volcanoes like the [[Manenguba|Manengouba]] or [[Mount Kupe|Kupe]] can be found. They stretch from the South along the border of Cameroon to the North where they go to the highlands of [[Bamenda]]. A bit isolated from the other volcanoes is the Mount [[Fako]] (Mount Cameroon) on the very Southern Tip of Ambazonia. At {{convert|4040|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=4}} it is the highest mountain in Western Africa and the 28th highest in Africa overall.\n\n===Climate===\nAs large parts of Ambazonia are in the [[Western High Plateau]], they have a somewhat cooler climate than the surrounding areas in Cameroon and Nigeria. The [[Upland and lowland|lowlands]] along the coast and the river valleys of [[Manyu (department)|Manyu]], both of which are parts of the [[Benue Trough]], are warmer. Most of Ambazonia has a [[tropical monsoon climate]], with the coastal plain containing some of the rainiest places in the world (such as the village of [[Debundscha]]). The northeastern parts of [[Northwest Region (Cameroon)|Northwest Region]] (including the city of [[Bamenda]]) have a [[tropical savanna climate]], with distinct wet and dry seasons. At higher altitudes, such as the [[Oku Volcanic Field|Oku Massif]] and [[Mount Cameroon]], there are pockets where the temperatures fall sufficiently to be classified as a [[Mediterranean climate#Warm-summer Mediterranean climate|warm-summer Mediterranean climate]]. The top of Mount Cameroon has a [[polar climate]] of the [[tundra]] variant, unique in West Africa and extremely rare so close to the [[Equator]].<ref>Beck, H.E., Zimmermann, N. E., McVicar, T.

He attended high school at [[San Dieguito High School]] and played [[college football]] at [[Palomar College]].  Unlike the \"soccer style\" approach which was becoming more and more widely used during his career, Dempsey's kicking style was the standard (of the day) straight-toe style.R.I.P TOM DEMPSEY\n\n==NFL career==\nDempsey is most widely known for kicking a 63-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] as time expired to give the Saints a 19\u201317 win over the [[Detroit Lions]] on November 8, 1970 at [[Tulane Stadium]] in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovin|first=Jeff|title=In Search of Trivia|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|year=1984|edition=1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrivia00jeff/page/408 408]|isbn=0-451-16250-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrivia00jeff/page/408}}</ref> Prior to 1974, the goal posts in the NFL were on the goal lines instead of the end lines, and a missed field goal was treated the same as a [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]]: if it missed, it was a [[touchback]] unless it landed in the field of play and was returned.  With time running out in the game, the Saints attempted a field goal with holder [[Joe Scarpati]] spotting at the Saints' own 37-yard line. The snap from [[Jackie Burkett]] was good, and Dempsey nailed the field goal with a couple of feet to spare. The win was one of only two for the Saints in that dismal season. For many years, it was believed that Saints quarterback [[Billy Kilmer]] was the holder of that historic kick, but photos of that day, as well as radio and television calls, revealed that  Scarpati was actually the holder.<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/hall/release.jsp?release_id=1859]</ref>\n\nWith the kick, Dempsey broke [[Bert Rechichar]]'s NFL record for longest field goal by seven yards. That record was equaled by [[Jason Elam]] in 1998, [[Sebastian Janikowski]] in 2011, [[David Akers]] in 2012, [[Graham Gano]] in 2018, and [[Brett Maher (American football)|Brett Maher]] in 2019. On December 8, 2013, [[Matt Prater]] topped Dempsey's mark by hitting a 64-yard field goal.\n\n[[File:Tom dempsey.jpg|thumb|left|Dempsey's special kicking shoe]]\nDempsey was born without toes on his right foot and no fingers on his right hand. He wore a modified shoe with a flattened and enlarged toe surface. This generated controversy about whether such a shoe gave a player an unfair advantage. When reporters would ask him if he thought it was unfair, he said, \"Unfair, eh? How 'bout you try kickin' a 63 yard field goal to win it with 2 seconds left an' yer wearin' a square shoe, oh yeah, and no toes either.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering \"The Kick\"|url=http://avoyellestoday.com/index.php/sports/1750-remembering-the-kick|website=avoyellestoday.com|publisher=Avoyelles Journal, Bunkie, Record, Marksville Weekly |accessdate=January 4, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104052651/http://avoyellestoday.com/index.php/sports/1750-remembering-the-kick|archivedate=January 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/sports/playmagazine/28lewis.html?pagewanted=8|title=The Kick Is Up and It's...A Career-Killer | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Lewis | date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}, New York Times, October 28, 2007</ref>\nAdditionally, when an analysis of his kick was carried out by [[ESPN]] ''[[Sport Science (TV series)|Sport Science]]'', it was found that his modified shoe had offered him no advantage \u2013 in fact, it was found that the smaller contact area could have reduced, not increased, the margin for error.<ref>{{cite web|title=World's Longest Field Goal|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu7IqQNA6Ls|publisher=ESPN Sport's Science}}</ref>\n\nThe league made two rule changes in the subsequent years to discourage further long field goal attempts. The first was in 1974, which moved the goal posts from the goal line to the back of the end zone (adding ten yards to the kick distance) and awarded the ball to the defense on a missed kick at the spot where the ball was snapped (this changed in 1994 to the spot of the kick). Then, in 1977, the [[1977 NFL season#Major rule changes|NFL added a rule]], informally known as the \"Tom Dempsey Rule\", that \"any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname | title=Rules of the Name, or How the Emmitt Rule Became the Emmitt Rule, | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211145916/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname | archivedate=December 11, 2007 }} Professional Football Researchers Association</ref><ref>{{cite web |  url=http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf |  title=Official NFL Rulebook 2006 |  url-status=dead |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216075609/http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf |  archivedate=February 16, 2010 }} See Rule 5, Section 3, Article 3 Paragraph (g)</ref>\n\n==Career regular season statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align: right; font-size: 90%; width: 800px;\"\n''Career high/best '''bolded'''''\n|-\n!

He attended high school at [[San Dieguito High School]] and played [[college football]] at [[Palomar College]].  Unlike the \"soccer style\" approach which was becoming more and more widely used during his career, Dempsey's kicking style was the standard (of the day) straight-toe style.\n\n==NFL career==\nDempsey is most widely known for kicking a 63-yard [[Field goal (football)|field goal]] as time expired to give the Saints a 19\u201317 win over the [[Detroit Lions]] on November 8, 1970 at [[Tulane Stadium]] in [[New Orleans]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Rovin|first=Jeff|title=In Search of Trivia|publisher=Penguin Group|location=New York|year=1984|edition=1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrivia00jeff/page/408 408]|isbn=0-451-16250-1|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/insearchoftrivia00jeff/page/408}}</ref> Prior to 1974, the goal posts in the NFL were on the goal lines instead of the end lines, and a missed field goal was treated the same as a [[punt (gridiron football)|punt]]: if it missed, it was a [[touchback]] unless it landed in the field of play and was returned.  With time running out in the game, the Saints attempted a field goal with holder [[Joe Scarpati]] spotting at the Saints' own 37-yard line. The snap from [[Jackie Burkett]] was good, and Dempsey nailed the field goal with a couple of feet to spare. The win was one of only two for the Saints in that dismal season. For many years, it was believed that Saints quarterback [[Billy Kilmer]] was the holder of that historic kick, but photos of that day, as well as radio and television calls, revealed that  Scarpati was actually the holder.<ref>[http://www.profootballhof.com/hall/release.jsp?release_id=1859]</ref>\n\nWith the kick, Dempsey broke [[Bert Rechichar]]'s NFL record for longest field goal by seven yards. That record was equaled by [[Jason Elam]] in 1998, [[Sebastian Janikowski]] in 2011, [[David Akers]] in 2012, [[Graham Gano]] in 2018, and [[Brett Maher (American football)|Brett Maher]] in 2019. On December 8, 2013, [[Matt Prater]] topped Dempsey's mark by hitting a 64-yard field goal.\n\n[[File:Tom dempsey.jpg|thumb|left|Dempsey's special kicking shoe]]\nDempsey was born without toes on his right foot and no fingers on his right hand. He wore a modified shoe with a flattened and enlarged toe surface. This generated controversy about whether such a shoe gave a player an unfair advantage. When reporters would ask him if he thought it was unfair, he said, \"Unfair, eh? How 'bout you try kickin' a 63 yard field goal to win it with 2 seconds left an' yer wearin' a square shoe, oh yeah, and no toes either.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Remembering \"The Kick\"|url=http://avoyellestoday.com/index.php/sports/1750-remembering-the-kick|website=avoyellestoday.com|publisher=Avoyelles Journal, Bunkie, Record, Marksville Weekly |accessdate=January 4, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150104052651/http://avoyellestoday.com/index.php/sports/1750-remembering-the-kick|archivedate=January 4, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/28/sports/playmagazine/28lewis.html?pagewanted=8|title=The Kick Is Up and It's...A Career-Killer | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Lewis | date=October 28, 2007 | accessdate=May 25, 2010}}, New York Times, October 28, 2007</ref>\nAdditionally, when an analysis of his kick was carried out by [[ESPN]] ''[[Sport Science (TV series)|Sport Science]]'', it was found that his modified shoe had offered him no advantage \u2013 in fact, it was found that the smaller contact area could have reduced, not increased, the margin for error.<ref>{{cite web|title=World's Longest Field Goal|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uu7IqQNA6Ls|publisher=ESPN Sport's Science}}</ref>\n\nThe league made two rule changes in the subsequent years to discourage further long field goal attempts. The first was in 1974, which moved the goal posts from the goal line to the back of the end zone (adding ten yards to the kick distance) and awarded the ball to the defense on a missed kick at the spot where the ball was snapped (this changed in 1994 to the spot of the kick). Then, in 1977, the [[1977 NFL season#Major rule changes|NFL added a rule]], informally known as the \"Tom Dempsey Rule\", that \"any shoe that is worn by a player with an artificial limb on his kicking leg must have a kicking surface that conforms to that of a normal kicking shoe.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname | title=Rules of the Name, or How the Emmitt Rule Became the Emmitt Rule, | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211145916/http://www.footballresearch.com/articles/frpage.cfm?topic=rulesname | archivedate=December 11, 2007 }} Professional Football Researchers Association</ref><ref>{{cite web |  url=http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf |  title=Official NFL Rulebook 2006 |  url-status=dead |  archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100216075609/http://blogmedia.thenewstribune.com/media/2006%20NFL%20RULEBOOK.pdf |  archivedate=February 16, 2010 }} See Rule 5, Section 3, Article 3 Paragraph (g)</ref>\n\n==Career regular season statistics==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible collapsed\" style=\"margin: auto; text-align: right; font-size: 90%; width: 800px;\"\n''Career high/best '''bolded'''''\n|-\n!
