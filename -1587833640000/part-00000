Optional was a [[Levi's]] interior trim package, which included spun nylon upholstery made to look like denim ([[fire safety]] regulations prohibited the use of real cotton denim). Details included removable map pockets, burnished copper denim rivets, and red Levi's logo tabs. Rear-seat legroom was increased. The X package received a new tape-striping pattern that kicked up over the Gremlin's rear wheel flares.\n\nSales improved to 122,844 units, nearly 30% more than 1972. A 1973 Gremlin purchased by ''[[Consumer Reports]]'' was top-rated in a group of six subcompact models tested for the June issue. That car had relatively few sample defects and proved reliable over a long-term test.\n\n==== 1974 ====\n[[File:1974 Gremlin.jpg|thumb|1974 AMC Gremlin]]\n\nThe [[Arab Oil Embargo]] of October 1973 came just as the 1974 model year began. AMC improved the Gremlin's back seat. A deeper front fascia made the car appear longer. A larger front bumper was mounted on self-restoring telescoping gas and oil cylinders. Unlike most other designs, the Gremlin did not use filler panel between bumper and body. A stronger rear bumper was set lower\u2014front and rear passenger car bumpers were now required by NHTSA to have uniform heights, take angle impacts, and sustain {{convert|5|mph|0|adj=on}} impacts with no damage.<ref>{{cite news |last=Norbye |first=Jan P. |title=New bumpers have uniform height, take angle impacts |work=Popular Science |pages=90\u201391 |date=October 1973 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=lpiMSzja6W4C&pg=PA90&lpg=PA90&dq=New+bumpers+have+uniform+Gremlin |volume=203 |issue=4 |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> The rear fascia was modified slightly to blend with the design changes. The Gremlin X stripe pattern was given a \"hockey stick\" look for 1974: the stripes followed the window line as it tapered aft, and swept up now to include four diagonal lines on the wide [[C-pillar]]. A new typeface for nameplates was used by AMC for 1974, including on the Gremlin. With the car's 1974 model year extended into November to delay the need to install [[catalytic converter]]s required by [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) 2004 regulations starting with 1975 models, AMC sold 171,128 1974 Gremlins, an increase of nearly 40% over 1973 and 130% over 1971.\n\n==== 1975 ====\n[[File:Gremlin rear (5904506887).jpg|thumb|right|1975 AMC Gremlin]]\nChanges for the 1975 model year Gremlins included standard [[electronic ignition]] developed by [[Prestolite Electric|Prestolite]].<ref name=\"pm-oct74\">{{cite news |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ytQDAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=AMC+polishes+its+petrol+pinchers |pages=105, 176|first=Michael |last=Lamm |title=AMC polishes its petrol pinchers|work=Popular Mechanics |date=October 1974 |volume=142 |issue=4 |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> All U.S. market Gremlins featured catalytic converters that required the use of unleaded regular-grade fuel. \"Unleaded Fuel Only\" warnings were placed by the fuel filler and on the [[fuel gauge]].

Oval headlight bezels replaced the previous circular items. The grille shape became a stretched hexagon and included in its insert two opposing loops stacked atop each other and housing new rounded parking/turn signal lights. Front fenders were taller, with a slight finned effect. A new \"Custom\" trim line debuted, featuring a striped interior trim called \"Potomac\", as well as a spare tire cover and other minor details. The A models were given another new striping scheme: the hockey stick-style stripe of the previous year adding a secondary extension that ran from the door-handle straight back. The X package was now available only on Custom models. Due to flagging sales, the {{convert|304|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8 engine option (now downgraded to {{convert|120|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}) was cancelled at midyear, after only 826 installations. (A total of 40,994 Gremlins were equipped with the V8 engine from 1972 to 1976.) A 4-speed [[manual transmission]] was made available at midyear. Sales tapered slightly to 52,941 - a decline of 5.5%. The 3 speed manual transmission  also had the option of an  electric overdrive when in 3rd gear.\nOperation was provided  by a push button on the turn signal bar.   There may have only been 600 to 700  of these built.\n\n==== 1977 ====\n[[File:1977 Gremlin white azfr.jpg|thumb|right|1977 AMC Gremlin featured new front end styling]]\n[[File:1977 AMC Gremlin 2 Liter Custom 2014-AMO-NC-d.jpg|thumb|right|1977 AMC Gremlin Custom 2 Liter]]\n\n1977 changes included redesigned sheet metal for the first time in the Gremlin's now 8-year history: revised hood, shorter front fenders, new bumpers, taller glass tailgate, enlarged taillights, and rear license plate now covering the fuel filler. The front end was shortened by four inches (102&nbsp;mm) with all new sheet metal and a crosshatch grille insert. Parking lights reverted to rectangular, and headlights were recessed into square bezels with rounded corners. The new hood had a small \"power bulge\" at the front. The base model now included carpeting, as well as rocker panel and wheel lip moldings. The \"Custom\" model was available with a list price of $2,998. The X package returned as a $189 option, with a new striping pattern that ran straight back from the front fenders and crested upward over the rear wheels. Front [[disc brake]]s became standard.\n\nAt the start of the model year, the Gremlin was available with either the standard {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or optional {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engines. Both had increased power from updated [[cylinder head]]s and two-barrel carburetors. In addition, AMC offered a carbureted four-cylinder engine: a [[Volkswagen]]/[[Audi]] {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], also used in fuel-injected form in the Porsche 924. It gave better fuel economy but less power than the standard six-cylinder engines, and reduced the Gremlin's weight by {{convert|250|lb|kg|0}}, allowing it to achieve an EPA rating of {{convert|21|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} in the city, and {{convert|33|mpgus|L/100 km mpgimp|abbr=on}} on the highway.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://auto.howstuffworks.com/1970-1978-amc-gremlin6.htm |title=1977 AMC Gremlin |author=Auto Editors of ''Consumer Guide'' |publisher=auto.howstuffworks.com |date= October 17, 2007 |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> It was reserved for the Custom version of the Gremlin because the expense of acquiring the rights to the engine meant that AMC could not afford to make it standard equipment.

The dashboard had high-level ventilation [[HVAC]], radio switchgear within easier reach, and a flat, full-width top. The X's tape striping pattern was revised to match the 1978 Concord Sport package design, with the stripe at the lower body side and curving over the wheel lip.\n\nAt mid-season, a '''GT''' package became available with a front [[Spoiler (automotive)|spoiler]] and flared wheel openings as on the 1978 AMX. The GT added an aluminum overlay to the instrument panel, was powered by the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 as standard, and had its own stripe scheme: a wide tape stripe, outlined by a narrow one, ran back from the front fenders and widened aft of the rear quarter windows. The package also included body-color fender flares and front air dam, as well as body-color bumpers, all of which combined to give the GT a modern, aggressive look. Fewer than 3,000 Gremlin GTs were built.<ref name=how78/>\n\nThe Gremlin's body shape had not changed appreciably in its nine years of production, and other more advanced subcompacts, lighter in weight, with more doors, better interiors and [[front-wheel drive]], had appeared on the market.

This is exactly the opposite case as the AMC Gremlin, which was offered with the option of a 304 V8. The three speed manual transmission with overdrive, the four-speed manual transmission, the V8 and Audi four cylinder engines were never available. Trim levels and versions like the two-seater, the Levis Gremlin, the Gremlin Custom and the Gremlin GT were also never available.\n\n==== 1974 ====\nThe introductory 1974 Gremlins became unique by incorporating the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> VAM never attempted to hide the relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with full synchromesh manual 3-speed transmission, heavy duty clutch, manual four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, 3.31:1 rear gear ratio, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, collapsible steering column with anti-theft lock, base steering wheel, side marker and hazard lights, column-mounted shifters only, two-tone padded dashboard with silver-colored front surfaces, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Factory options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, wheel trim rings and heavy duty cooling. All VAM Gremlins used AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory, which could be equipped with a universal tachometer or clock as dealership options. The introductory year production was 2,137.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== 1975 ====\nThe 1975 Gremlin models were upgraded, and along with the improvements to the larger car lines VAM took 9% of the Mexican market.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> VAM Gremlin interiors now featured individual folding front seats with low backs and new door panels, the \"two-tone\" dashboard with silver-painted front surfaces was replaced by a color-keyed unit, and a new fuel economy gauge was standard on the third space of the instrument cluster. Manual front disk brakes and electronic ignition were among the mechanical upgrades, while the compression ratio of the engine was dropped to 7.6:1. Both transmissions now came only with a floor-mounted shifter. VAM Gremlins ordered with automatic transmissions now included a heater and power steering at no charge. The exterior featured a variation of AMC's \"hockey stick\" side decal and a new design for headlight bezels, grille, and parking lights at the front end that AMC originally developed for its Hornet models. Production doubled to over 4,200 VAM Gremlins.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== 1976 ====\nThe Gremlin X version was added in 1976 as a separate model rather than an optional package. The X models included VAM's larger {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6, a 6000 RPM tachometer, sports steering wheel, 7.00X14 radial tires, Hurst linkage with T-shaped shifter for the manual transmissions, courtesy lights on parcel shelf, heater, power steering, tinted windshield, bright molding package (drip rails, wheel arches, rocker panels), wheel trim rings, and an in-house two-color rally stripe that was unique to the Mexican market.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> The 1976 VAM Gremlin X also came with an interior featuring the \"Navajo\" pattern cloth upholstery that was optional on AMC's Pacer DL models built for the Canadian and U.S. markets.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam.html | title=Arcticboy's VAM page, 1976 Gremlin X brochure cover |first=Bob |last=Wilson |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> The base VAM Gremlin now also included luxurious seating with a center armrest that was never available in the U.S. models.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.arcticboy.com/Pages/arcticboysvam2.html |title=Arcticboy's VAM page 2, 1976 Gremlin base model brochure cover |first=Bob |last=Wilson |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> Due to the debut of the Gremlin X and its sportier focus, the base Gremlin switched back to the standard column-mounted shifters for either transmission, but keeping the individual seat configuration. Both versions included revised gauges with a 160&nbsp;km/h speedometer, new side panel designs, longer folding sun visors, and a styled round dome light lens. Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n\n==== 1977 ====\nStarting with the 1977 models, all VAM Gremlins were powered by the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 regardless of trim level. The exterior featured the shorter new front end clip and rear end treatment as did the U.S. models.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> The 1977 Gremlin X model included a new digital tachometer and three-point retractable seatbelts, as well as new in-house VAM designs for the seats. The sporty side decal was slightly revised and for the most part was the same as the year before. The seatbelts on the base Gremlin were also changed to three-point units, which were fixed and lacked retractable mechanisms. The option list was expanded with the possibility of ordering a factory air conditioning system for the first time in the VAM line, which was available only in the X model. The previously optional dealership-offered universal air conditioning system remained available for the base model. The VAM Gremlin X (along with the 1977-1979 American ECD, Concord DL four-door equivalent) would be the only VAM car with the 258 six engine to be available with a factory air conditioning system, as all other VAM models with it would be 282 cu in units. Around 6,800 VAM Gremlins were sold during 1977.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== 1978 ====\nOnly a few changes were made to the 1978 VAM Gremlin. The dashboard design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel horn button, smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed lug nuts, while a new full-length body side decal incorporated the \"Gremlin X\" logo on the rear quarter panel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://theamcforum.com/forum/197478-vam-gremlin-and-197678-gremlin-x_topic49499.html |first=Mauricio |last=Jord\u00e1n |title=1974-78 VAM Gremlin and 1976-78 Gremlin X |publisher=The AMC Forum |date=April 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== Second Generation ====\n{{main article|AMC Spirit#VAM models}}\nVAM Gremlins used the updated body design of the U.S. and Canadian market [[AMC Spirit]] two-door sedan, as well as VAM versions of the Spirit Liftback, called the '''American GT''' and the '''Rally AMX'''.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> At the time, cars in Mexico took longer to be perceived as outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico.

A new typeface for nameplates was used by AMC for 1974, including on the Gremlin.

The front end was shortened by four inches (102&nbsp;mm) with all new sheet metal and a crosshatch grille insert. Parking lights reverted to rectangular, and headlights were recessed into square bezels with rounded corners. The new hood had a small \"power bulge\" at the front. The base model now included carpeting, as well as rocker panel and wheel lip moldings. The \"Custom\" model was available with a list price of $2,998. The X package returned as a $189 option, with a new striping pattern that ran straight back from the front fenders and crested upward over the rear wheels. Front [[disc brake]]s became standard.\n\nAt the start of the model year, the Gremlin was available with either the standard {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} or optional {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six-cylinder engines. Both had increased power from updated [[cylinder head]]s and two-barrel carburetors. In addition, AMC offered a carbureted four-cylinder engine: a [[Volkswagen]]/[[Audi]] {{convert|2.0|L|cuin|abbr=on}} [[Inline-four engine|inline-four]], also used in fuel-injected form in the Porsche 924.

Trim levels and versions like the two-seater, the Levis Gremlin, the Gremlin Custom and the Gremlin GT were also never available.\n\n==== 1974 ====\nThe introductory 1974 Gremlins became unique by incorporating the front clip of the 1974 U.S. AMC Hornet models.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> VAM never attempted to hide the relation between the two models, which never harmed the sales or image of either model and was favored by the public. The launch of the Gremlin in Mexico also meant the resurrection of the {{convert|232|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 engine that was discontinued in 1972. The engine was practically the same as in its final year except for a slightly lower compression ratio (8.3:1 instead of 8.5:1). The advertised output was still the same at 145 gross horsepower at 4,400 revolutions per minute and was restricted to one-barrel carburetors. In contrast, since 1973 all VAM-based Hornets had the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} six as the standard and only engine. VAM Gremlins were basic economy cars with full synchromesh manual 3-speed transmission, heavy duty clutch, manual four-wheel drum brakes, manual steering, front sway bar, 3.31:1 rear gear ratio, rigid four-bladed cooling fan, collapsible steering column with anti-theft lock, base steering wheel, side marker and hazard lights, column-mounted shifters only, two-tone padded dashboard with silver-colored front surfaces, electric wipers and washers, monaural AM radio, cigarette lighter, front and rear ashtrays, locking glovebox, folding bench seats, two-point front seatbelts, flip-open rear side vents, roof rack, full carpeting with driver's side rubber mat, padded sunvisors, sound-insulating cardboard-type headliner, dual coat hooks and round dome light. Factory options for 1974 included a column-mounted automatic transmission, power steering, power drum brakes, heater, parcel shelf, light group, remote-controlled driver and passenger side outside mirrors, sports steering wheel, bright molding package, wheel trim rings and heavy duty cooling. All VAM Gremlins used AMC's three-pod instrument cluster from the domestic-built Hornet with a blank in the third gauge position from the factory, which could be equipped with a universal tachometer or clock as dealership options. The introductory year production was 2,137.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== 1975 ====\nThe 1975 Gremlin models were upgraded, and along with the improvements to the larger car lines VAM took 9% of the Mexican market.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> VAM Gremlin interiors now featured individual folding front seats with low backs and new door panels, the \"two-tone\" dashboard with silver-painted front surfaces was replaced by a color-keyed unit, and a new fuel economy gauge was standard on the third space of the instrument cluster. Manual front disk brakes and electronic ignition were among the mechanical upgrades, while the compression ratio of the engine was dropped to 7.6:1. Both transmissions now came only with a floor-mounted shifter. VAM Gremlins ordered with automatic transmissions now included a heater and power steering at no charge. The exterior featured a variation of AMC's \"hockey stick\" side decal and a new design for headlight bezels, grille, and parking lights at the front end that AMC originally developed for its Hornet models.

Sales for 1976 increased to over 6,000 units.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n\n==== 1977 ====\nStarting with the 1977 models, all VAM Gremlins were powered by the {{convert|258|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} I6 regardless of trim level. The exterior featured the shorter new front end clip and rear end treatment as did the U.S. models.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> The 1977 Gremlin X model included a new digital tachometer and three-point retractable seatbelts, as well as new in-house VAM designs for the seats. The sporty side decal was slightly revised and for the most part was the same as the year before. The seatbelts on the base Gremlin were also changed to three-point units, which were fixed and lacked retractable mechanisms. The option list was expanded with the possibility of ordering a factory air conditioning system for the first time in the VAM line, which was available only in the X model. The previously optional dealership-offered universal air conditioning system remained available for the base model. The VAM Gremlin X (along with the 1977-1979 American ECD, Concord DL four-door equivalent) would be the only VAM car with the 258 six engine to be available with a factory air conditioning system, as all other VAM models with it would be 282 cu in units. Around 6,800 VAM Gremlins were sold during 1977.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== 1978 ====\nOnly a few changes were made to the 1978 VAM Gremlin. The dashboard design was from the new U.S. market Concord being restricted to the unit with black surfaces only (no wood imitation or brushed aluminum versions). For the Gremlin X there was a new VAM logo on the steering wheel horn button, smaller pointy volcano hubcaps with bright exposed lug nuts, while a new full-length body side decal incorporated the \"Gremlin X\" logo on the rear quarter panel.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://theamcforum.com/forum/197478-vam-gremlin-and-197678-gremlin-x_topic49499.html |first=Mauricio |last=Jord\u00e1n |title=1974-78 VAM Gremlin and 1976-78 Gremlin X |publisher=The AMC Forum |date=April 21, 2013 |accessdate=June 27, 2014}}</ref> The sporty model also got the set of four bumper guards as standard equipment. The base model got another set of new hubcaps with exposed lug nuts, but with a flat top instead. Production fell just below 6,000 VAM Gremlins.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/>\n\n==== Second Generation ====\n{{main article|AMC Spirit#VAM models}}\nVAM Gremlins used the updated body design of the U.S. and Canadian market [[AMC Spirit]] two-door sedan, as well as VAM versions of the Spirit Liftback, called the '''American GT''' and the '''Rally AMX'''.<ref name=\"Spanish-accent\"/> At the time, cars in Mexico took longer to be perceived as outdated than in the US and since the VAM Gremlin came to the public until 1974 instead of 1970, it was still relatively fresh among the Mexican buyers. Aside from this, the model kept a positive image throughout its whole run. In fact, it exceeded VAM's sales expectations in its first years. The company originally considered it a temporary low-volume model that would eventually be replaced by the upcoming Pacer model. In the end, the Gremlin stood and became VAM's all-time second best-selling line after the American. For these reasons VAM decided to keep the Gremlin name for the upcoming Spirit sedan model, being a testament of the very favorable image VAM cars in general held in Mexico. This was the third time a case like this happened within the company with Rebel and Matador models kept the name Rambler Classic and the Hornet the Rambler American name.\n\n=== Australia ===\n[[File:1971 AMI Rambler Gremlin AnnMD openal.jpg|thumb|left|One-off Australian Gremlin, first featured at the 1970 Sydney Motor Show.]]\n[[File:1971 AMI Rambler Gremlin AnnMD driver.jpg|thumb|right|Badged as a \"Rambler\" this test car was converted from LHD to RHD for evaluation purposes.]] \n\nAMC exported a complete knock-down Gremlin to its Australian partner, [[Australian Motor Industries]] (AMI) of Port Melbourne, Victoria in 1970 for evaluation purposes..<ref name=\"Boomerang\">{{cite web|url= http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2011/10/12/boomerang-the-only-gremlin-exported-to-australia-returns-to-the-united-states/ |first=Daniel |last=Strohl |title=Boomerang: The only Gremlin exported to Australia returns to the United States |date=October 12, 2011 |publisher=Hemmings Motor News |accessdate=September 1, 2019}}</ref> AMI assembled and marketed other AMC models (AMX, Hornet, Javelin, and Matador) in Australia, since 1961.
