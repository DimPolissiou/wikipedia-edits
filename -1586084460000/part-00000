{"title_page": "List of college athletic programs in Texas", "text_new": "{{short description|Wikipedia list article}}\nThe main article is '''[[College sports]]'''.\n\n'''Notes:'''\n*This list is in a tabular format, with columns arranged in the following order, from left to right:\n**Athletic team description (short school name and nickname), with a link to the school's athletic program article if it exists. When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but media now use \"Charleston\" for that school's athletic program).\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

When only one nickname is listed, it is used for teams of both sexes. (Note that in recent years, many schools have chosen to use the same nickname for men's and women's teams even when the nickname is distinctly masculine.) When two nicknames are given, the first is used for men's teams and the other is used for women's teams. Different nicknames for a specific sport within a school are noted separately below the table.\n**Full name of school.\n**Location of school.\n**Conference of the school (if conference column is left blank, the school is either independent or the conference is unknown).\n*Apart from the ongoing conversions, the following notes apply:\n**Following the normal standard of U.S. sports media, the terms \"University\" and \"College\" are ignored in alphabetization, unless necessary to distinguish schools (such as Boston College and Boston University) or are actually used by the media in normally describing the school (formerly the case for the College of Charleston, but media now use \"Charleston\" for that school's athletic program).\n**Schools are also alphabetized by the names they are most commonly referred to by sports media, with non-intuitive examples included in parentheses next to the school name. This means, for example, that campuses bearing the name \"University of North Carolina\" may variously be found at \"C\" (Charlotte), \"N\" (North Carolina, referring to the Chapel Hill campus), and \"U\" (the Asheville, Greensboro, Pembroke, and Wilmington campuses, all normally referred to as UNC-<nowiki/>{campus name}).\n**The prefix \"St.\", as in \"Saint\", is alphabetized as if it were spelled out.\n\n==[[NCAA]]==\n\n===[[NCAA Division I|Division I]]===\n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\"\n! rowspan=3|Team !! rowspan=3|School !! rowspan=3|City !! rowspan=3|Conference !! colspan=7|Sport sponsorship\n|-\n! rowspan=2|Foot-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Basketball !! rowspan=2|Base-<br/>ball !! rowspan=2|Soft-<br/>ball !! colspan=2|Soccer\n|-\n!

Serial ATA succeeded the earlier [[Parallel ATA]] (PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices.\n\nSerial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the [[Serial ATA International Organization]] (SATA-IO) which are then promulgated by the [[INCITS]] Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).<ref name=\"INCITS_T13\">{{cite web  |url=http://t13.org/ |title=Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment |date=March 1, 2011 |publisher=Technical Committee T13 AT Attachment |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSATA was announced in 2000<ref>\"Seagate, APT and Vitesse Unveil the First Serial ATA Disc Drive at Intel Developer Forum\", Seagate Technology, Aug. 22, 2000</ref> in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native [[hot swapping]], faster [[data transfer]] through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) [[I/O]] queuing protocol.\n\nSerial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the [[Serial ATA International Organization]] (SATA-IO). The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases and [[plugfest]]s. As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily INCITS T13<ref name=\"INCITS_T13\" /> and an INCITS [[T10 subcommittee|T10]] subcommittee ([[SCSI]]), a subgroup of T10 responsible for [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA-IO terminology and specifications.\n\nBefore SATA's introduction in 2000, PATA was simply known as ATA. The \"AT Attachment\" (ATA) name originated after the 1984 release of the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM Personal Computer AT]], more commonly known as the IBM AT.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ecse.rpi.edu/courses/S15/ECSE-4780/Labs/IDE/IDE_SPEC.PDF|title=Lamars, Lawrence J., ''Information technology - AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives'', Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, 1994, xi (introduction)|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-08-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617193535/https://ecse.rpi.edu/courses/S15/ECSE-4780/Labs/IDE/IDE_SPEC.PDF|archivedate=2016-06-17}}</ref> The IBM AT's controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks.  \"AT\" was IBM's abbreviation for \"Advanced Technology\"; thus, many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of \"Serial Advanced Technology Attachment\". However, the ATA specifications simply use the name \"AT Attachment\", to avoid possible trademark issues with IBM.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyl8SA1eHzIC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=IBM+%22PC+AT%22&source=bl&ots=zLaIGNPEQ5&sig=_HllkT8uzYOuUtuQmUg4v7c7OB4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihzd23jKPOAhVM7WMKHeQCC284ChDoAQgoMAI#v=onepage&q=AT%20&f=false|title= Govindarajalu, B., ''IBM PC And Clones: Hardware, Troubleshooting And Maintenance''|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company|website=Amazon.com |date=2002|page=xxxi |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\nSATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed [[serial communications|serial]] cable over two pairs of conductors. In contrast, parallel ATA (the [[retronym|redesignation]] for the legacy ATA specifications) uses a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at a much lower frequency. To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the same basic ATA and [[ATA Packet Interface|ATAPI]] command sets as legacy ATA devices.\n\nSATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop [[computer]]s; SATA's market share in the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|title=Serial ATA: Meeting Storage Needs Today and Tomorrow|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-10-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417133358/http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-17}}</ref> PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use; with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that use [[CompactFlash]] (CF) storage, which was designed around the legacy PATA standard.

After insertion, the device initializes and then operates normally. Depending upon the operating system, the host may also initialize, resulting in a [[hot swapping|hot swap]]. The powered host and device do not need to be in an idle state for safe insertion and removal, although unwritten data may be lost when power is removed.\n\nUnlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support hot plugging by design. However, this feature requires proper support at the host, device (drive), and operating-system levels. In general, SATA devices fulfill the device-side hot-plugging requirements, and most SATA [[host adapter]]s support this function.<ref name=linux-ata>{{cite web |url=http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Software_status#Hotplug_support|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124023117/http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Software_status#Hotplug_support|archivedate=2009-01-24 |title=Software status - ata Wiki |website=ata.wiki.kernel.org |date=2008-08-17 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref>\n\nFor eSATA, hot plugging is supported in [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] mode only. IDE mode does not support hot plugging.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.asrock.com/nettop/Intel/Core%20100HT-BD/ |title=Specification for some motherboard with eSATA connector}}</ref>\n\n===Advanced Host Controller Interface===\n[[Advanced Host Controller Interface]] (AHCI) is an open host controller interface published and used by Intel, which has become a [[de facto]] standard. It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such as [[hotplug]] and [[native command queuing]] (NCQ). If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset, SATA controllers typically operate in \"IDE{{Efn|Integrated Drive Electronics}} emulation\" mode, which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA (also called IDE) standard.\n\nWindows device drivers that are labeled as SATA are often running in IDE emulation mode unless they explicitly state that they are AHCI mode, in [[RAID]] mode, or a mode provided by a proprietary driver and command set that allowed access to SATA's advanced features before AHCI became popular. Modern versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux kernel|Linux]] with version 2.6.19 onward,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://linux-ata.org/driver-status.html#ahci|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010549/http://linux-ata.org/driver-status.html#ahci|archivedate=2007-03-12 |title=Serial ATA (SATA) Linux hardware/driver status report |website=linux-ata.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> as well as [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[OpenSolaris]], include support for AHCI, but earlier operating systems such as [[Windows XP]] do not. Even in those instances, a proprietary driver may have been created for a specific chipset, such as [[Intel]]'s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imst/sb/cs-020825.htm|title=Intel\u00ae Matrix Storage Technology - Unattended Installation Instructions Under Windows* XP|date=2 March 2007|publisher=[[Intel]]|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302101422/http://www.intel.com/support/chipsets/imst/sb/cs-020825.htm|archivedate=2 March 2007}}</ref>\n\n==Revisions==\nSATA revisions are typically designated with a dash followed by [[Roman numerals]], e.g. \"SATA-III\",<ref>http://kb.sandisk.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/8142/~/difference-between-sata-i,-sata-ii-and-sata-iii ''www.sandisk.com''.

First-generation SATA interfaces, now known as SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s, communicate at a rate of 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s,{{Efn|{{BDprefix|p=D}}}} and do not support [[Native Command Queuing]] (NCQ).

SATA cables can have lengths up to {{convert|1|m|ft}}, and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive. PATA [[ribbon cable]]s, in comparison, connect one motherboard socket to one or two hard drives, carry either 40 or 80 wires, and are limited to {{convert|45|cm|in}} in length by the PATA specification; however, cables up to {{convert|90|cm|in}} are readily available. Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces and reduce obstructions to [[air cooling]]. Although they are more susceptible to accidental unplugging and breakage than PATA, users can purchase cables that have a locking feature, whereby a small (usually metal) spring holds the plug in the socket.\n\nSATA connectors may be straight, right-angled, or left angled. Angled connectors allow lower-profile connections. Right-angled (also called 90-degree) connectors lead the cable immediately away from the drive, on the circuit-board side.  Left-angled (also called 270-degree) connectors lead the cable across the drive towards its top.\n\nOne of the problems associated with the transmission of data at high speed over electrical connections is described as ''noise'', which is due to electrical coupling between data circuits and other circuits. As a result, the data circuits can both affect other circuits and be affected by them. Designers use a number of techniques to reduce the undesirable effects of such unintentional coupling. One such technique used in SATA links is [[differential signaling]]. This is an enhancement over PATA, which uses [[single-ended signaling]].  The use of fully shielded, dual [[coaxial cabling|coax]] conductors, with multiple ground connections, for each differential pair<ref>Serial ATA Revision 3.0 ''6.1.8 Internal single lane cable''</ref> improves isolation between the channels and reduces the chances of lost data in difficult electrical environments.\n\n<gallery widths=\"250\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:SATA Data Cable.jpg|A seven-pin SATA data cable (left-angled version of the connector)\nFile:SATA Ports.jpg|SATA connector on a 3.5-inch hard drive, with data pins on the left and power pins on the right.

It is a wafer-type connector, like the SATA data connector, but much wider (fifteen pins versus seven) to avoid confusion between the two. Some early SATA drives included the four-pin Molex power connector together with the new fifteen-pin connector, but most SATA drives now have only the latter.\n\nThe new SATA power connector contains many more pins for several reasons:<ref name=\"allpinouts-sata\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Serial_ATA_%28SATA,_Serial_Advanced_Technology_Attachment%29 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108043955/http://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Serial_ATA_%28SATA%2C_Serial_Advanced_Technology_Attachment%29 \n |title=Serial ATA (SATA, Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) \n |accessdate=2016-07-05 \n |archivedate=2008-11-08 \n |website=allpinouts.org \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n* 3.3&nbsp;V is supplied along with the traditional 5&nbsp;V and 12&nbsp;V supplies. However, very few drives actually use it, so they may be powered from a four-pin Molex connector with an adapter.\n* Pin 3 in SATA revision 3.3 has been redefined as PWDIS and is used to enter and exit the POWER DISABLE mode for compatibility with SAS specification. If Pin 3 is driven HIGH (2.1\u20133.6&nbsp;V max), power to the drive circuitry is disabled. Drives with this feature do not power up in systems designed to SATA revision 3.1 or earlier. This is because Pin 3 driven HIGH prevents the drive from powering up.<ref name=\"power-disable\" />\n* To reduce impedance and increase current capability, each voltage is supplied by three pins in parallel, though one pin in each group is intended for precharging (see below). Each pin should be able to carry 1.5&nbsp;A.\n* Five parallel pins provide a low-impedance ground connection.\n* Two ground pins and one pin for each supplied voltage support [[hot swapping|hot-plug]] precharging. Ground pins 4 and 12 in a hot-swap cable are the longest, so they make contact first when the connectors are mated. Drive power connector pins 3, 7, and 13 are longer than the others, so they make contact next. The drive uses them to charge its internal bypass capacitors through current-limiting resistances. Finally, the remaining power pins make contact, bypassing the resistances and providing a low-impedance source of each voltage. This two-step mating process avoids glitches to other loads and possible arcing or erosion of the SATA power-connector contacts. \n* Pin 11 can function for [[staggered spinup]], activity indication, both, or nothing. It is an [[open-collector]] signal, which may be pulled down by the connector or the drive.  If pulled down at the connector (as it is on most cable-style SATA power connectors), the drive spins up as soon as power is applied.  If left floating, the drive waits until it is spoken to.  This prevents many drives from spinning up simultaneously, which might draw too much power. The pin is also pulled low by the drive to indicate drive activity.  This may be used to give feedback to the user through an [[LED]].\n\nPassive adapters are available that convert a four-pin [[Molex connector]] to a SATA power connector, providing the 5&nbsp;V and 12&nbsp;V lines available on the Molex connector, but not 3.3&nbsp;V. There are also four-pin Molex-to-SATA power adapters that include electronics to additionally provide the 3.3&nbsp;V power supply.<ref>[http://www.akasa.com.tw/update.php?tpl=product/product.detail.tpl&no=181&type=Cables&type_sub=SATA%20Cable%20Adapters&model=SATA2-20-PW Example of active power adapter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712125222/http://www.akasa.com.tw/update.php?tpl=product%2Fproduct.detail.tpl&no=181&type=Cables&type_sub=SATA%20Cable%20Adapters&model=SATA2-20-PW |date=2017-07-12 }}.</ref> However, most drives do not require the 3.3&nbsp;V power line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pinouts.ru/Power/sata-power_pinout.shtml |title=Serial ATA (SATA) power connector pinout and connections @ |website=pinouts.ru |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628184420/http://pinouts.ru/Power/sata-power_pinout.shtml |archivedate=2013-06-28 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Slimline connector====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; margin-top:0;\"\n|+ Slimline connector, power segment\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pin # !!

It uses a more robust connector, longer shielded cables, and stricter (but backward-compatible) electrical standards.  The protocol and logical signaling (link/transport layers and above) are identical to internal SATA.  The differences are:\n\n* Minimum transmit amplitude increased: Range is 500\u2013600&nbsp;mV instead of 400\u2013600&nbsp;mV.\n* Minimum receive amplitude decreased: Range is 240\u2013600&nbsp;mV instead of 325\u2013600&nbsp;mV.\n* Maximum cable length increased to {{convert|2|m|ft}} from {{convert|1|m|ft}}.\n* The eSATA cable and connector is similar to the SATA 1.0a cable and connector, with these exceptions:\n** The eSATA connector is mechanically different to prevent unshielded internal cables from being used externally. The eSATA connector discards the \"L\"-shaped key and changes the position and size of the guides.\n** The eSATA insertion depth is deeper: 6.6&nbsp;mm instead of 5&nbsp;mm. The contact positions are also changed.\n** The eSATA cable has an extra shield to reduce [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] to FCC and CE requirements. Internal cables do not need the extra shield to satisfy EMI requirements because they are inside a shielded case.\n** The eSATA connector uses metal springs for shield contact and mechanical retention.<!-- SATA might also do this -->\n** The eSATA connector has a design-life of 5,000 matings; the ordinary SATA connector is only specified for 50.\n\nAimed at the consumer market, eSATA enters an external storage market served also by the USB and FireWire interfaces. The SATA interface has certain advantages. Most external hard-disk-drive cases with FireWire or USB interfaces use either PATA or SATA drives and \"bridges\" to translate between the drives' interfaces and the enclosures' external ports; this bridging incurs some inefficiency. Some single disks can transfer 157&nbsp;MB/s during real use,<ref name=\"Tom2010HardDrives\"/> about four times the maximum transfer rate of USB 2.0 or [[IEEE 1394a|FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a)]] and almost twice as fast as the maximum transfer rate of FireWire 800. The S3200 [[FireWire]] 1394b specification reaches around 400&nbsp;MB/s (3.2&nbsp;Gbit/s), and [[USB 3.0]] has a nominal speed of 5&nbsp;Gbit/s. Some low-level drive features, such as [[S.M.A.R.T.]], may not operate through some USB<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki/USB |title=USB \u2013 smartmontools |website=sourceforge.net |accessdate=2012-01-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207000458/http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/smartmontools/wiki/USB |archivedate=2012-02-07 }}</ref> or FireWire or USB+FireWire bridges; eSATA does not suffer from these issues provided that the controller manufacturer (and its drivers) presents eSATA drives as ATA devices, rather than as [[SCSI]] devices, as has been common with [[Silicon Image]], [[JMicron]], and [[NVIDIA]] nForce drivers for Windows Vista. In those cases SATA drives do not have low-level features accessible.\n\nThe eSATA version of SATA&nbsp;6G operates at 6.0&nbsp;Gbit/s (the term \"SATA&nbsp;III\" is avoided by the [[SATA-IO]] organization to prevent confusion with SATA&nbsp;II 3.0&nbsp;Gbit/s, which was colloquially referred to as \"SATA&nbsp;3G\" [bit/s] or \"SATA&nbsp;300\" [MB/s] since the 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA&nbsp;I and 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA&nbsp;II were referred to as both \"SATA&nbsp;1.5G\" [bit/s] or \"SATA&nbsp;150\" [MB/s]). Therefore, eSATA connections operate with negligible differences between them.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hddlife.com/eng/faq.html |title=Questions about the indicators of health/performance (in percent) |website=hddlife.com |accessdate=2007-08-29 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070924055228/http://www.hddlife.com/eng/faq.html |archivedate=2007-09-24 }}</ref> Once an interface can transfer data as fast as a drive can handle them, increasing the interface speed does not improve data transfer.\n\nThere are some disadvantages, however, to the eSATA interface:\n* Devices built before the eSATA interface became popular lack external SATA connectors. \n* For small form-factor devices (such as external {{convert|2.5|in|mm|adj=on}} disks), a PC-hosted USB or FireWire link can usually supply sufficient power to operate the device. However, eSATA connectors cannot supply power, and require a power supply for the external device.

It is also known as Power over eSATA, Power eSATA, eSATA/USB Combo, or eSATA USB Hybrid Port (EUHP). An eSATAp port combines the four pins of the USB&nbsp;2.0 (or earlier) port, the seven pins of the eSATA port, and optionally two 12&nbsp;V power pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.addonics.com/technologies/euhp.php |title=Addonics Technology: Hybrid eSATA (eSATA USB hybrid) interface |website=addonics.com |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030192542/http://www.addonics.com/technologies/euhp.php |archivedate=2011-10-30 }}</ref> Both SATA traffic and device power are integrated in a single cable, as is the case with USB but not eSATA. The 5&nbsp;V power is provided through two USB pins, while the 12&nbsp;V power may optionally be provided. Typically desktop, but not notebook, computers provide 12&nbsp;V power, so can power devices requiring this voltage, typically 3.5-inch disk and CD/DVD drives, in addition to 5&nbsp;V devices such as 2.5-inch drives.\n\nBoth USB and eSATA devices can be used with an eSATAp port, when plugged in with a USB or eSATA cable, respectively. An eSATA device cannot be powered via an eSATAp cable, but a special cable can make both SATA or eSATA and power connectors available from an eSATAp port.\n\nAn eSATAp connector can be built into a computer with internal SATA and USB, by fitting a bracket with connections for internal SATA, USB, and power connectors and an externally accessible eSATAp port. Though eSATAp connectors have been built into several devices, manufacturers do not refer to an official standard.\n\n====Pre-standard implementations====\n* Prior to the final eSATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s specification, a number of products were designed for external connection of SATA drives. Some of these use the internal SATA connector, or even connectors designed for other interface specifications, such as [[FireWire]]. These products are not eSATA compliant. The final eSATA specification features a specific connector designed for rough handling, similar to the regular SATA connector, but with reinforcements in both the male and female sides, inspired by the USB connector. eSATA resists inadvertent unplugging, and can withstand yanking or wiggling, which could break a male SATA connector (the hard-drive or host adapter, usually fitted inside the computer). With an eSATA connector, considerably more force is needed to damage the connector\u2014and if it does break, it is likely to be the female side, on the cable itself,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} which is relatively easy to replace.\n* Prior to the final eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s specification many add-on cards and some motherboards advertised eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s support because they had 6&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA 3.0 controllers for internal-only solutions. Those implementations are non-standard, and eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s requirements were ratified in the July 18, 2011 SATA 3.1 specification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sata-io.org/sites/default/files/documents/SATA-Revision-3.0-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions About SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s and the SATA Revision 3.0 Specification |format=PDF |date=May\u2013June 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150446/https://www.sata-io.org/sites/default/files/documents/SATA-Revision-3.0-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref> Some products might not be fully eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s compliant.\n\n==={{Anchor|mSATA}}Mini-SATA (mSATA)===\n{{See also|PCI Express#MSATA|l1=PCI Express \u00a7 Mini-SATA (mSATA) variant}}\n[[File:MSATA SSD vs. 2.5\" SATA drive.JPG|thumb|An mSATA [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] on top of a 2.5-inch SATA drive]]\n\nMini-SATA (abbreviated as mSATA), which is distinct from the micro connector,<ref name=\"amazon-msata\" /> was announced by the Serial ATA International Organization on September 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=mSATA Press Release|url=http://www.sata-io.org/documents/mSATA-press%20release-v9.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726065816/http://www.sata-io.org/documents/mSATA-press%20release-v9.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref>  Applications include [[netbook]]s, [[laptop]]s and other devices that require a [[solid-state drive]] in a small footprint.\n\nThe physical dimensions of the mSATA connector are identical to those of the [[Mini-PCIe#PCI Express Mini Card|PCI Express Mini Card]] interface,<ref>{{cite web |title=Intel 310 SSD |url=http://download.intel.com/design/flash/nand/324042.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112092850/http://download.intel.com/design/flash/nand/324042.pdf |publisher=[[Intel]] |accessdate=11 March 2011 |archivedate=12 January 2011}}</ref> but the interfaces are electrically not compatible; the data signals (TX\u00b1/RX\u00b1 SATA, PETn0 PETp0 PERn0 PERp0 PCI Express) need a connection to the SATA host controller instead of the [[PCI Express]] host controller.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==={{Anchor|SFF-8784}}SFF-8784 connector===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|+ SFF-8784 connector<ref name=\"wdc-sff-8784\" />\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Bottom !! colspan=\"4\" | Top\n|-\n!

The SATA PHY contains a transmit pair and receive pair. When the SATA-link is not in use (example: no device attached), the transmitter allows the transmit pins to float to their common-mode voltage level. When the SATA-link is either active or in the link-initialization phase, the transmitter drives the transmit pins at the specified differential voltage (1.5&nbsp;V in SATA/I).\n\nSATA physical coding uses a line encoding system known as [[8b/10b encoding]]. This scheme serves multiple functions required to sustain a differential serial link. First, the stream contains necessary synchronization information that allows the SATA host/drive to extract clocking. The 8b/10b encoded sequence embeds periodic edge transitions to allow the receiver to achieve bit-alignment without the use of a separately transmitted reference clock waveform. The sequence also maintains a neutral ([[DC-balanced]]) bitstream, which lets transmit drivers and receiver inputs be [[AC-coupled]]. Generally, the actual SATA signalling is half-duplex, meaning that it can only read or write data at any one time.\n\nAlso, SATA uses some of the special characters defined in 8b/10b. In particular, the PHY layer uses the comma (K28.5) character to maintain symbol-alignment. A specific four-symbol sequence, the ALIGN primitive, is used for clock rate-matching between the two devices on the link. Other special symbols communicate flow control information produced and consumed in the higher layers (link and transport).\n\nSeparate point-to-point AC-coupled [[low-voltage differential signaling]] (LVDS) links are used for physical transmission between host and drive.\n\nThe PHY layer is responsible for detecting the other SATA/device on a cable, and link initialization. During the link-initialization process, the PHY is responsible for locally generating special out-of-band signals by switching the transmitter between electrical-idle and specific 10b-characters in a defined pattern, negotiating a mutually supported signalling rate (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0&nbsp;Gbit/s), and finally synchronizing to the far-end device's PHY-layer data stream. During this time, no data is sent from the link-layer.\n\nOnce link-initialization has completed, the link-layer takes over data-transmission, with the PHY providing only the 8b/10b conversion before bit transmission.\n\n==={{Anchor|FIS}}Link layer===\nAfter the PHY-layer has established a link, the link layer is responsible for transmission and reception of Frame Information Structures (FFFFFFISs) over the SATA link. FISs are packets containing control information or payload data. Each packet contains a header (identifying its type), and payload whose contents are dependent on the type. The link layer also manages flow control over the link.\n\n===Transport layer===\nLayer number three in the serial ATA specification is the transport layer. This layer has the responsibility of acting on the frames and transmitting/receiving the frames in an appropriate sequence. The transport layer handles the assembly and disassembly of FIS structures, which includes, for example, extracting content from register FISs into the task-file and informing the command layer. In an abstract fashion, the transport layer is responsible for creating and encoding FIS structures requested by the command layer, and removing those structures when the frames are received.\n\nWhen [[Direct memory access|DMA]] data is to be transmitted and is received from the higher command layer, the transport layer appends the FIS control header to the payload, and informs the link layer to prepare for transmission. The same procedure is performed when data is received, but in reverse order. The link layer signals to the transport layer that there is incoming data available. Once the data is processed by the link layer, the transport layer inspects the FIS header and removes it before forwarding the data to the command layer.\n\n==Topology==\n{{See also|Port multiplier}}\n[[File:Sata controlador multiplicador cropped.svg|thumb|SATA topology: host (H), multiplier (M), and device (D)]]\n\nSATA uses a point-to-point architecture. The physical connection between a controller and a storage device is not shared among other controllers and storage devices. SATA defines [[Port multiplier|multipliers]], which allows a single SATA controller port to drive up to fifteen storage devices. The multiplier performs the function of a hub; the controller and each storage device is connected to the hub.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sata-io.org/port-multipliers |title=Port Multipliers |publisher=SATA-IO |accessdate=2014-02-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825194748/http://www.sata-io.org/port-multipliers |archivedate=2014-08-25 }}</ref> This is conceptually similar to [[SAS expander]]s.\n\n{{As of|2012|alt=Modern}} PC systems have SATA controllers built into the motherboard, typically featuring two to eight ports. Additional ports can be installed through add-in SATA host adapters (available in variety of bus-interfaces: USB, PCI, PCIe).\n\n==Backward and forward compatibility==\n\n===SATA and PATA===\n[[File:PATA hard disk with SATA converter.png|thumb|PATA hard disk with SATA converter attached.]]\nAt the hardware interface level, SATA and PATA ([[Parallel ATA|Parallel AT Attachment]]) devices are completely incompatible: they cannot be interconnected without an adapter.\n\nAt the application level, SATA devices can be specified to look and act like PATA devices.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.sata-io.org/documents/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327214126/http://www.sata-io.org/documents/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf |title=A comparison with Ultra ATA Technology |format=PDF |publisher=SATA-IO |archivedate=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nMany motherboards offer a \"Legacy Mode\" option, which makes SATA drives appear to the OS like PATA drives on a standard controller. This ''Legacy Mode'' eases OS installation by not requiring that a specific driver be loaded during setup, but sacrifices support for some (vendor specific) features of SATA. Legacy Mode often if not always disables some of the boards' PATA or SATA ports, since the standard PATA controller interface supports only four drives. (Often, which ports are disabled is configurable.)\n\nThe common heritage of the ATA command set has enabled the proliferation of low-cost PATA to SATA bridge chips. Bridge chips were widely used on PATA drives (before the completion of native SATA drives) as well in standalone converters. When attached to a PATA drive, a device-side converter allows the PATA drive to function as a SATA drive. Host-side converters allow a motherboard PATA port to connect to a SATA drive.\n\nThe market has produced powered enclosures for both PATA and SATA drives that interface to the PC through USB, Firewire or eSATA, with the restrictions noted above. [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] cards with a SATA connector exist that allow SATA drives to connect to legacy systems without SATA connectors.\n\n==={{Anchor|FORCE-150|OPT1-ENABLED}}SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s===\nThe designers of SATA standard as an overall goal aimed for backward and [[forward compatibility]] with future revisions of the SATA standard. \nTo prevent interoperability problems that could occur when next generation SATA drives are installed on motherboards with standard legacy SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s host controllers, many manufacturers have made it easy to switch those newer drives to the previous standard's mode.\nExamples of such provisions include:\n* Seagate/Maxtor has added a user-accessible jumper-switch, known as the \"force 150\", to enable the drive switch between forced 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and 1.5/3&nbsp;Gbit/s negotiated operation.\n* Western Digital uses a jumper setting called ''OPT1 enabled'' to force 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s data transfer speed (OPT1 is enabled by putting the jumper on pins 5 and 6).\n* Samsung drives can be forced to 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s mode using software that may be downloaded from the manufacturer's website. Configuring some Samsung drives in this manner requires the temporary use of a SATA-2 (SATA 3.0&nbsp;Gbit/s) controller while programming the drive.\n\nThe \"force 150\" switch (or equivalent) is also useful for attaching SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s hard drives to SATA controllers on PCI cards, since many of these controllers (such as the [[Silicon Image]] chips) run at 3&nbsp;Gbit/s, even though the PCI bus cannot reach 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s speeds. This can cause data corruption in operating systems that do not specifically test for this condition and limit the disk transfer speed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\nSATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s devices only connect with SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s devices at the slower 3&nbsp;Gbit/s speed.\n\n===SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}\nSATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s are compatible with each other.

SCSI buses also allow connection of several drives on one shared channel, whereas SATA allows one drive per channel, unless using a port multiplier. Serial Attached SCSI uses the same physical interconnects as SATA, and most SAS HBAs also support 3 and 6&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA devices (an HBA requires support for ''Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol'').\n\nSATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s theoretically offers a maximum bandwidth of 300&nbsp;MB/s per device, which is only slightly lower than the rated speed for SCSI Ultra 320 with a maximum of 320&nbsp;MB/s total for all devices on a bus.<ref>Ultra-640 is specified, but devices do not exist</ref> SCSI drives provide greater sustained throughput than multiple SATA drives connected via a simple (i.e., command-based) [[port multiplier]] because of disconnect-reconnect and aggregating performance.<ref>FIS-based switching is comparable to SCSI's tagged command queueing</ref> In general, SATA devices link compatibly to SAS enclosures and adapters, whereas SCSI devices cannot be directly connected to a SATA bus.\n\nSCSI, SAS, and fibre-channel (FC) drives are more expensive than SATA, so they are used in [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[disk array]]s where the better performance justifies the additional cost. Inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the [[home computer|home-computer]] market, hence there is a view that they are less reliable. As those two worlds overlapped, the subject of reliability [[Hard disk drive#Integrity and failure|became somewhat controversial]]. Note that, in general, the failure rate of a disk drive is related to the quality of its heads, platters and supporting manufacturing processes, not to its interface.\n\nUse of serial ATA in the business market increased from 22% in 2006 to 28% in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Serial ATA: Meeting Storage Needs Today and Tomorrow|url=http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|publisher=SATA-IO|accessdate=26 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417133358/http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison with other buses===\n{{See also|List of device bit rates#Storage|l1=List of device bit rates}}\n\nSCSI-3 devices with SCA-2 connectors are designed for hot swapping.

Serial ATA succeeded the earlier [[Parallel ATA]] (PATA) standard to become the predominant interface for storage devices.\n\nSerial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the [[Serial ATA International Organization]] (SATA-IO) which are then promulgated by the [[INCITS]] Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment (INCITS T13).<ref name=\"INCITS_T13\">{{cite web  |url=http://t13.org/ |title=Technical Committee T13, AT Attachment |date=March 1, 2011 |publisher=Technical Committee T13 AT Attachment |access-date=July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nSATA was announced in 2000<ref>\"Seagate, APT and Vitesse Unveil the First Serial ATA Disc Drive at Intel Developer Forum\", Seagate Technology, Aug. 22, 2000</ref> in order to provide several advantages over the earlier PATA interface such as reduced cable size and cost (seven conductors instead of 40 or 80), native [[hot swapping]], faster [[data transfer]] through higher signaling rates, and more efficient transfer through an (optional) [[I/O]] queuing protocol.\n\nSerial ATA industry compatibility specifications originate from the [[Serial ATA International Organization]] (SATA-IO). The SATA-IO group collaboratively creates, reviews, ratifies, and publishes the interoperability specifications, the test cases and [[plugfest]]s. As with many other industry compatibility standards, the SATA content ownership is transferred to other industry bodies: primarily INCITS T13<ref name=\"INCITS_T13\" /> and an INCITS [[T10 subcommittee|T10]] subcommittee ([[SCSI]]), a subgroup of T10 responsible for [[Serial Attached SCSI]] (SAS). The remainder of this article strives to use the SATA-IO terminology and specifications.\n\nBefore SATA's introduction in 2000, PATA was simply known as ATA. The \"AT Attachment\" (ATA) name originated after the 1984 release of the [[IBM Personal Computer/AT|IBM Personal Computer AT]], more commonly known as the IBM AT.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://ecse.rpi.edu/courses/S15/ECSE-4780/Labs/IDE/IDE_SPEC.PDF|title=Lamars, Lawrence J., ''Information technology - AT Attachment Interface for Disk Drives'', Computer and Business Equipment Manufacturers Association, 1994, xi (introduction)|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-08-02|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617193535/https://ecse.rpi.edu/courses/S15/ECSE-4780/Labs/IDE/IDE_SPEC.PDF|archivedate=2016-06-17}}</ref> The IBM AT's controller interface became a de facto industry interface for the inclusion of hard disks.  \"AT\" was IBM's abbreviation for \"Advanced Technology\"; thus, many companies and organizations indicate SATA is an abbreviation of \"Serial Advanced Technology Attachment\". However, the ATA specifications simply use the name \"AT Attachment\", to avoid possible trademark issues with IBM.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyl8SA1eHzIC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq=IBM+%22PC+AT%22&source=bl&ots=zLaIGNPEQ5&sig=_HllkT8uzYOuUtuQmUg4v7c7OB4&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihzd23jKPOAhVM7WMKHeQCC284ChDoAQgoMAI#v=onepage&q=AT%20&f=false|title= Govindarajalu, B., ''IBM PC And Clones: Hardware, Troubleshooting And Maintenance''|publisher=Tata McGraw-Hill Publishing Company|website=Amazon.com |date=2002|page=xxxi |accessdate=2016-08-02}}</ref>\n\nSATA host adapters and devices communicate via a high-speed [[serial communications|serial]] cable over two pairs of conductors. In contrast, parallel ATA (the [[retronym|redesignation]] for the legacy ATA specifications) uses a 16-bit wide data bus with many additional support and control signals, all operating at a much lower frequency. To ensure backward compatibility with legacy ATA software and applications, SATA uses the same basic ATA and [[ATA Packet Interface|ATAPI]] command sets as legacy ATA devices.\n\nSATA has replaced parallel ATA in consumer desktop and laptop [[computer]]s; SATA's market share in the desktop PC market was 99% in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|title=Serial ATA: Meeting Storage Needs Today and Tomorrow|format=PDF|accessdate=2011-10-30|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417133358/http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-17}}</ref> PATA has mostly been replaced by SATA for any use; with PATA in declining use in industrial and embedded applications that use [[CompactFlash]] (CF) storage, which was designed around the legacy PATA standard.

After insertion, the device initializes and then operates normally. Depending upon the operating system, the host may also initialize, resulting in a [[hot swapping|hot swap]]. The powered host and device do not need to be in an idle state for safe insertion and removal, although unwritten data may be lost when power is removed.\n\nUnlike PATA, both SATA and eSATA support hot plugging by design.

In general, SATA devices fulfill the device-side hot-plugging requirements, and most SATA [[host adapter]]s support this function.<ref name=linux-ata>{{cite web |url=http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Software_status#Hotplug_support|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124023117/http://ata.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Software_status#Hotplug_support|archivedate=2009-01-24 |title=Software status - ata Wiki |website=ata.wiki.kernel.org |date=2008-08-17 |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref>\n\nFor eSATA, hot plugging is supported in [[Advanced Host Controller Interface|AHCI]] mode only.

It allows the use of advanced features of SATA such as [[hotplug]] and [[native command queuing]] (NCQ). If AHCI is not enabled by the motherboard and chipset, SATA controllers typically operate in \"IDE{{Efn|Integrated Drive Electronics}} emulation\" mode, which does not allow access to device features not supported by the ATA (also called IDE) standard.\n\nWindows device drivers that are labeled as SATA are often running in IDE emulation mode unless they explicitly state that they are AHCI mode, in [[RAID]] mode, or a mode provided by a proprietary driver and command set that allowed access to SATA's advanced features before AHCI became popular. Modern versions of [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[FreeBSD]], [[Linux kernel|Linux]] with version 2.6.19 onward,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://linux-ata.org/driver-status.html#ahci|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312010549/http://linux-ata.org/driver-status.html#ahci|archivedate=2007-03-12 |title=Serial ATA (SATA) Linux hardware/driver status report |website=linux-ata.org |date= |accessdate=2010-01-26}}</ref> as well as [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] and [[OpenSolaris]], include support for AHCI, but earlier operating systems such as [[Windows XP]] do not.

First-generation SATA interfaces, now known as SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s, communicate at a rate of 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s,{{Efn|{{BDprefix|p=D}}}} and do not support [[Native Command Queuing]] (NCQ). Taking [[8b/10b encoding]] overhead into account, they have an actual [[uncoded transfer rate]] of 1.2&nbsp;Gbit/s (150&nbsp;MB/s). The theoretical burst throughput of SATA 1.5 Gbit/s is similar to that of [[Parallel ATA|PATA]]/133, but newer SATA devices offer enhancements such as NCQ, which improve performance in a multitasking environment.\n\nDuring the initial period after SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s finalization, adapter and drive manufacturers used a \"bridge chip\" to convert existing PATA designs for use with the SATA interface.  Bridged drives have a SATA connector, may include either or both kinds of power connectors, and, in general, perform identically to their native-SATA equivalents.<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://techreport.com/review/6390/western-digital-raptor-wd740gd-sata-hard-drive\n |title       = Western Digital's Raptor WD740GD SATA hard drive: Single-user performance, multi-user potential\n |date        = 2004-03-08\n |accessdate  = 2015-06-16\n |author      = Geoff Gasior\n |website     = techreport.com\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20150325001151/http://techreport.com/review/6390/western-digital-raptor-wd740gd-sata-hard-drive\n |archivedate = 2015-03-25\n}}</ref>  However, most bridged drives lack support for some SATA-specific features such as NCQ.

SATA cables can have lengths up to {{convert|1|m|ft}}, and connect one motherboard socket to one hard drive. PATA [[ribbon cable]]s, in comparison, connect one motherboard socket to one or two hard drives, carry either 40 or 80 wires, and are limited to {{convert|45|cm|in}} in length by the PATA specification; however, cables up to {{convert|90|cm|in}} are readily available. Thus, SATA connectors and cables are easier to fit in closed spaces and reduce obstructions to [[air cooling]]. Although they are more susceptible to accidental unplugging and breakage than PATA, users can purchase cables that have a locking feature, whereby a small (usually metal) spring holds the plug in the socket.\n\nSATA connectors may be straight, right-angled, or left angled. Angled connectors allow lower-profile connections. Right-angled (also called 90-degree) connectors lead the cable immediately away from the drive, on the circuit-board side.  Left-angled (also called 270-degree) connectors lead the cable across the drive towards its top.\n\nOne of the problems associated with the transmission of data at high speed over electrical connections is described as ''noise'', which is due to electrical coupling between data circuits and other circuits. As a result, the data circuits can both affect other circuits and be affected by them. Designers use a number of techniques to reduce the undesirable effects of such unintentional coupling. One such technique used in SATA links is [[differential signaling]]. This is an enhancement over PATA, which uses [[single-ended signaling]].  The use of fully shielded, dual [[coaxial cabling|coax]] conductors, with multiple ground connections, for each differential pair<ref>Serial ATA Revision 3.0 ''6.1.8 Internal single lane cable''</ref> improves isolation between the channels and reduces the chances of lost data in difficult electrical environments.\n\n<gallery widths=\"250\" heights=\"150\">\nFile:SATA Data Cable.jpg|A seven-pin SATA data cable (left-angled version of the connector)\nFile:SATA Ports.jpg|SATA connector on a 3.5-inch hard drive, with data pins on the left and power pins on the right.

It is a wafer-type connector, like the SATA data connector, but much wider (fifteen pins versus seven) to avoid confusion between the two. Some early SATA drives included the four-pin Molex power connector together with the new fifteen-pin connector, but most SATA drives now have only the latter.\n\nThe new SATA power connector contains many more pins for several reasons:<ref name=\"allpinouts-sata\">{{cite web\n |url=http://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Serial_ATA_%28SATA,_Serial_Advanced_Technology_Attachment%29 \n |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108043955/http://www.allpinouts.org/index.php/Serial_ATA_%28SATA%2C_Serial_Advanced_Technology_Attachment%29 \n |title=Serial ATA (SATA, Serial Advanced Technology Attachment) \n |accessdate=2016-07-05 \n |archivedate=2008-11-08 \n |website=allpinouts.org \n |url-status=dead \n}}</ref>\n* 3.3&nbsp;V is supplied along with the traditional 5&nbsp;V and 12&nbsp;V supplies. However, very few drives actually use it, so they may be powered from a four-pin Molex connector with an adapter.\n* Pin 3 in SATA revision 3.3 has been redefined as PWDIS and is used to enter and exit the POWER DISABLE mode for compatibility with SAS specification. If Pin 3 is driven HIGH (2.1\u20133.6&nbsp;V max), power to the drive circuitry is disabled. Drives with this feature do not power up in systems designed to SATA revision 3.1 or earlier. This is because Pin 3 driven HIGH prevents the drive from powering up.<ref name=\"power-disable\" />\n* To reduce impedance and increase current capability, each voltage is supplied by three pins in parallel, though one pin in each group is intended for precharging (see below). Each pin should be able to carry 1.5&nbsp;A.\n* Five parallel pins provide a low-impedance ground connection.\n* Two ground pins and one pin for each supplied voltage support [[hot swapping|hot-plug]] precharging. Ground pins 4 and 12 in a hot-swap cable are the longest, so they make contact first when the connectors are mated. Drive power connector pins 3, 7, and 13 are longer than the others, so they make contact next. The drive uses them to charge its internal bypass capacitors through current-limiting resistances. Finally, the remaining power pins make contact, bypassing the resistances and providing a low-impedance source of each voltage. This two-step mating process avoids glitches to other loads and possible arcing or erosion of the SATA power-connector contacts. \n* Pin 11 can function for [[staggered spinup]], activity indication, both, or nothing. It is an [[open-collector]] signal, which may be pulled down by the connector or the drive.  If pulled down at the connector (as it is on most cable-style SATA power connectors), the drive spins up as soon as power is applied.  If left floating, the drive waits until it is spoken to.  This prevents many drives from spinning up simultaneously, which might draw too much power. The pin is also pulled low by the drive to indicate drive activity.  This may be used to give feedback to the user through an [[LED]].\n\nPassive adapters are available that convert a four-pin [[Molex connector]] to a SATA power connector, providing the 5&nbsp;V and 12&nbsp;V lines available on the Molex connector, but not 3.3&nbsp;V. There are also four-pin Molex-to-SATA power adapters that include electronics to additionally provide the 3.3&nbsp;V power supply.<ref>[http://www.akasa.com.tw/update.php?tpl=product/product.detail.tpl&no=181&type=Cables&type_sub=SATA%20Cable%20Adapters&model=SATA2-20-PW Example of active power adapter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712125222/http://www.akasa.com.tw/update.php?tpl=product%2Fproduct.detail.tpl&no=181&type=Cables&type_sub=SATA%20Cable%20Adapters&model=SATA2-20-PW |date=2017-07-12 }}.</ref> However, most drives do not require the 3.3&nbsp;V power line.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://pinouts.ru/Power/sata-power_pinout.shtml |title=Serial ATA (SATA) power connector pinout and connections @ |website=pinouts.ru |date=2013-05-31 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628184420/http://pinouts.ru/Power/sata-power_pinout.shtml |archivedate=2013-06-28 }}</ref>\n{{Clear}}\n\n====Slimline connector====\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em; margin-right:0; margin-top:0;\"\n|+ Slimline connector, power segment\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\"| Pin # !!

The differences are:\n\n* Minimum transmit amplitude increased: Range is 500\u2013600&nbsp;mV instead of 400\u2013600&nbsp;mV.\n* Minimum receive amplitude decreased: Range is 240\u2013600&nbsp;mV instead of 325\u2013600&nbsp;mV.\n* Maximum cable length increased to {{convert|2|m|ft}} from {{convert|1|m|ft}}.\n* The eSATA cable and connector is similar to the SATA 1.0a cable and connector, with these exceptions:\n** The eSATA connector is mechanically different to prevent unshielded internal cables from being used externally. The eSATA connector discards the \"L\"-shaped key and changes the position and size of the guides.\n** The eSATA insertion depth is deeper: 6.6&nbsp;mm instead of 5&nbsp;mm. The contact positions are also changed.\n** The eSATA cable has an extra shield to reduce [[Electromagnetic interference|EMI]] to FCC and CE requirements. Internal cables do not need the extra shield to satisfy EMI requirements because they are inside a shielded case.\n** The eSATA connector uses metal springs for shield contact and mechanical retention.<!-- SATA might also do this -->\n** The eSATA connector has a design-life of 5,000 matings; the ordinary SATA connector is only specified for 50.\n\nAimed at the consumer market, eSATA enters an external storage market served also by the USB and FireWire interfaces. The SATA interface has certain advantages. Most external hard-disk-drive cases with FireWire or USB interfaces use either PATA or SATA drives and \"bridges\" to translate between the drives' interfaces and the enclosures' external ports; this bridging incurs some inefficiency. Some single disks can transfer 157&nbsp;MB/s during real use,<ref name=\"Tom2010HardDrives\"/> about four times the maximum transfer rate of USB 2.0 or [[IEEE 1394a|FireWire 400 (IEEE 1394a)]] and almost twice as fast as the maximum transfer rate of FireWire 800. The S3200 [[FireWire]] 1394b specification reaches around 400&nbsp;MB/s (3.2&nbsp;Gbit/s), and [[USB 3.0]] has a nominal speed of 5&nbsp;Gbit/s.

In those cases SATA drives do not have low-level features accessible.\n\nThe eSATA version of SATA&nbsp;6G operates at 6.0&nbsp;Gbit/s (the term \"SATA&nbsp;III\" is avoided by the [[SATA-IO]] organization to prevent confusion with SATA&nbsp;II 3.0&nbsp;Gbit/s, which was colloquially referred to as \"SATA&nbsp;3G\" [bit/s] or \"SATA&nbsp;300\" [MB/s] since the 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA&nbsp;I and 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA&nbsp;II were referred to as both \"SATA&nbsp;1.5G\" [bit/s] or \"SATA&nbsp;150\" [MB/s]).

An eSATAp port combines the four pins of the USB&nbsp;2.0 (or earlier) port, the seven pins of the eSATA port, and optionally two 12&nbsp;V power pins.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.addonics.com/technologies/euhp.php |title=Addonics Technology: Hybrid eSATA (eSATA USB hybrid) interface |website=addonics.com |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111030192542/http://www.addonics.com/technologies/euhp.php |archivedate=2011-10-30 }}</ref> Both SATA traffic and device power are integrated in a single cable, as is the case with USB but not eSATA. The 5&nbsp;V power is provided through two USB pins, while the 12&nbsp;V power may optionally be provided. Typically desktop, but not notebook, computers provide 12&nbsp;V power, so can power devices requiring this voltage, typically 3.5-inch disk and CD/DVD drives, in addition to 5&nbsp;V devices such as 2.5-inch drives.\n\nBoth USB and eSATA devices can be used with an eSATAp port, when plugged in with a USB or eSATA cable, respectively. An eSATA device cannot be powered via an eSATAp cable, but a special cable can make both SATA or eSATA and power connectors available from an eSATAp port.\n\nAn eSATAp connector can be built into a computer with internal SATA and USB, by fitting a bracket with connections for internal SATA, USB, and power connectors and an externally accessible eSATAp port. Though eSATAp connectors have been built into several devices, manufacturers do not refer to an official standard.\n\n====Pre-standard implementations====\n* Prior to the final eSATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s specification, a number of products were designed for external connection of SATA drives. Some of these use the internal SATA connector, or even connectors designed for other interface specifications, such as [[FireWire]]. These products are not eSATA compliant. The final eSATA specification features a specific connector designed for rough handling, similar to the regular SATA connector, but with reinforcements in both the male and female sides, inspired by the USB connector. eSATA resists inadvertent unplugging, and can withstand yanking or wiggling, which could break a male SATA connector (the hard-drive or host adapter, usually fitted inside the computer). With an eSATA connector, considerably more force is needed to damage the connector\u2014and if it does break, it is likely to be the female side, on the cable itself,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} which is relatively easy to replace.\n* Prior to the final eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s specification many add-on cards and some motherboards advertised eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s support because they had 6&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA 3.0 controllers for internal-only solutions. Those implementations are non-standard, and eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s requirements were ratified in the July 18, 2011 SATA 3.1 specification.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sata-io.org/sites/default/files/documents/SATA-Revision-3.0-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |title=Frequently Asked Questions About SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s and the SATA Revision 3.0 Specification |format=PDF |date=May\u2013June 2009 |accessdate=2011-10-30 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222150446/https://www.sata-io.org/sites/default/files/documents/SATA-Revision-3.0-FAQ-FINAL.pdf |archivedate=2014-02-22 }}</ref> Some products might not be fully eSATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s compliant.\n\n==={{Anchor|mSATA}}Mini-SATA (mSATA)===\n{{See also|PCI Express#MSATA|l1=PCI Express \u00a7 Mini-SATA (mSATA) variant}}\n[[File:MSATA SSD vs. 2.5\" SATA drive.JPG|thumb|An mSATA [[Solid-state drive|SSD]] on top of a 2.5-inch SATA drive]]\n\nMini-SATA (abbreviated as mSATA), which is distinct from the micro connector,<ref name=\"amazon-msata\" /> was announced by the Serial ATA International Organization on September 21, 2009.<ref>{{cite news|title=mSATA Press Release|url=http://www.sata-io.org/documents/mSATA-press%20release-v9.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726065816/http://www.sata-io.org/documents/mSATA-press%20release-v9.pdf|archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref>  Applications include [[netbook]]s, [[laptop]]s and other devices that require a [[solid-state drive]] in a small footprint.\n\nThe physical dimensions of the mSATA connector are identical to those of the [[Mini-PCIe#PCI Express Mini Card|PCI Express Mini Card]] interface,<ref>{{cite web |title=Intel 310 SSD |url=http://download.intel.com/design/flash/nand/324042.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112092850/http://download.intel.com/design/flash/nand/324042.pdf |publisher=[[Intel]] |accessdate=11 March 2011 |archivedate=12 January 2011}}</ref> but the interfaces are electrically not compatible; the data signals (TX\u00b1/RX\u00b1 SATA, PETn0 PETp0 PERn0 PERp0 PCI Express) need a connection to the SATA host controller instead of the [[PCI Express]] host controller.\n\n{{Clear}}\n\n==={{Anchor|SFF-8784}}SFF-8784 connector===\n{| class=\"wikitable floatright\" style=\"margin-left: 1.5em;\"\n|+ SFF-8784 connector<ref name=\"wdc-sff-8784\" />\n|-\n! colspan=\"4\" | Bottom !! colspan=\"4\" | Top\n|-\n!

The SATA PHY contains a transmit pair and receive pair. When the SATA-link is not in use (example: no device attached), the transmitter allows the transmit pins to float to their common-mode voltage level. When the SATA-link is either active or in the link-initialization phase, the transmitter drives the transmit pins at the specified differential voltage (1.5&nbsp;V in SATA/I).\n\nSATA physical coding uses a line encoding system known as [[8b/10b encoding]]. This scheme serves multiple functions required to sustain a differential serial link. First, the stream contains necessary synchronization information that allows the SATA host/drive to extract clocking. The 8b/10b encoded sequence embeds periodic edge transitions to allow the receiver to achieve bit-alignment without the use of a separately transmitted reference clock waveform. The sequence also maintains a neutral ([[DC-balanced]]) bitstream, which lets transmit drivers and receiver inputs be [[AC-coupled]]. Generally, the actual SATA signalling is half-duplex, meaning that it can only read or write data at any one time.\n\nAlso, SATA uses some of the special characters defined in 8b/10b. In particular, the PHY layer uses the comma (K28.5) character to maintain symbol-alignment. A specific four-symbol sequence, the ALIGN primitive, is used for clock rate-matching between the two devices on the link. Other special symbols communicate flow control information produced and consumed in the higher layers (link and transport).\n\nSeparate point-to-point AC-coupled [[low-voltage differential signaling]] (LVDS) links are used for physical transmission between host and drive.\n\nThe PHY layer is responsible for detecting the other SATA/device on a cable, and link initialization. During the link-initialization process, the PHY is responsible for locally generating special out-of-band signals by switching the transmitter between electrical-idle and specific 10b-characters in a defined pattern, negotiating a mutually supported signalling rate (1.5, 3.0, or 6.0&nbsp;Gbit/s), and finally synchronizing to the far-end device's PHY-layer data stream. During this time, no data is sent from the link-layer.\n\nOnce link-initialization has completed, the link-layer takes over data-transmission, with the PHY providing only the 8b/10b conversion before bit transmission.\n\n==={{Anchor|FIS}}Link layer===\nAfter the PHY-layer has established a link, the link layer is responsible for transmission and reception of Frame Information Structures (FISs) over the SATA link. FISs are packets containing control information or payload data. Each packet contains a header (identifying its type), and payload whose contents are dependent on the type. The link layer also manages flow control over the link.\n\n===Transport layer===\nLayer number three in the serial ATA specification is the transport layer. This layer has the responsibility of acting on the frames and transmitting/receiving the frames in an appropriate sequence. The transport layer handles the assembly and disassembly of FIS structures, which includes, for example, extracting content from register FISs into the task-file and informing the command layer. In an abstract fashion, the transport layer is responsible for creating and encoding FIS structures requested by the command layer, and removing those structures when the frames are received.\n\nWhen [[Direct memory access|DMA]] data is to be transmitted and is received from the higher command layer, the transport layer appends the FIS control header to the payload, and informs the link layer to prepare for transmission. The same procedure is performed when data is received, but in reverse order. The link layer signals to the transport layer that there is incoming data available. Once the data is processed by the link layer, the transport layer inspects the FIS header and removes it before forwarding the data to the command layer.\n\n==Topology==\n{{See also|Port multiplier}}\n[[File:Sata controlador multiplicador cropped.svg|thumb|SATA topology: host (H), multiplier (M), and device (D)]]\n\nSATA uses a point-to-point architecture. The physical connection between a controller and a storage device is not shared among other controllers and storage devices. SATA defines [[Port multiplier|multipliers]], which allows a single SATA controller port to drive up to fifteen storage devices. The multiplier performs the function of a hub; the controller and each storage device is connected to the hub.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.sata-io.org/port-multipliers |title=Port Multipliers |publisher=SATA-IO |accessdate=2014-02-17 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140825194748/http://www.sata-io.org/port-multipliers |archivedate=2014-08-25 }}</ref> This is conceptually similar to [[SAS expander]]s.\n\n{{As of|2012|alt=Modern}} PC systems have SATA controllers built into the motherboard, typically featuring two to eight ports. Additional ports can be installed through add-in SATA host adapters (available in variety of bus-interfaces: USB, PCI, PCIe).\n\n==Backward and forward compatibility==\n\n===SATA and PATA===\n[[File:PATA hard disk with SATA converter.png|thumb|PATA hard disk with SATA converter attached.]]\nAt the hardware interface level, SATA and PATA ([[Parallel ATA|Parallel AT Attachment]]) devices are completely incompatible: they cannot be interconnected without an adapter.\n\nAt the application level, SATA devices can be specified to look and act like PATA devices.<ref>\n{{cite web |url=http://www.sata-io.org/documents/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327214126/http://www.sata-io.org/documents/serialata%20-%20a%20comparison%20with%20ultra%20ata%20technology.pdf |title=A comparison with Ultra ATA Technology |format=PDF |publisher=SATA-IO |archivedate=2012-03-27 |accessdate=2014-08-15}}</ref>\n\nMany motherboards offer a \"Legacy Mode\" option, which makes SATA drives appear to the OS like PATA drives on a standard controller. This ''Legacy Mode'' eases OS installation by not requiring that a specific driver be loaded during setup, but sacrifices support for some (vendor specific) features of SATA. Legacy Mode often if not always disables some of the boards' PATA or SATA ports, since the standard PATA controller interface supports only four drives. (Often, which ports are disabled is configurable.)\n\nThe common heritage of the ATA command set has enabled the proliferation of low-cost PATA to SATA bridge chips. Bridge chips were widely used on PATA drives (before the completion of native SATA drives) as well in standalone converters. When attached to a PATA drive, a device-side converter allows the PATA drive to function as a SATA drive. Host-side converters allow a motherboard PATA port to connect to a SATA drive.\n\nThe market has produced powered enclosures for both PATA and SATA drives that interface to the PC through USB, Firewire or eSATA, with the restrictions noted above. [[Peripheral Component Interconnect|PCI]] cards with a SATA connector exist that allow SATA drives to connect to legacy systems without SATA connectors.\n\n==={{Anchor|FORCE-150|OPT1-ENABLED}}SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s===\nThe designers of SATA standard as an overall goal aimed for backward and [[forward compatibility]] with future revisions of the SATA standard. \nTo prevent interoperability problems that could occur when next generation SATA drives are installed on motherboards with standard legacy SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s host controllers, many manufacturers have made it easy to switch those newer drives to the previous standard's mode.\nExamples of such provisions include:\n* Seagate/Maxtor has added a user-accessible jumper-switch, known as the \"force 150\", to enable the drive switch between forced 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and 1.5/3&nbsp;Gbit/s negotiated operation.\n* Western Digital uses a jumper setting called ''OPT1 enabled'' to force 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s data transfer speed (OPT1 is enabled by putting the jumper on pins 5 and 6).\n* Samsung drives can be forced to 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s mode using software that may be downloaded from the manufacturer's website. Configuring some Samsung drives in this manner requires the temporary use of a SATA-2 (SATA 3.0&nbsp;Gbit/s) controller while programming the drive.\n\nThe \"force 150\" switch (or equivalent) is also useful for attaching SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s hard drives to SATA controllers on PCI cards, since many of these controllers (such as the [[Silicon Image]] chips) run at 3&nbsp;Gbit/s, even though the PCI bus cannot reach 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s speeds. This can cause data corruption in operating systems that do not specifically test for this condition and limit the disk transfer speed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}\n\n===SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s===\n{{Expand section|date=October 2011}}\nSATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s devices only connect with SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s devices at the slower 3&nbsp;Gbit/s speed.\n\n===SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s===\n{{Expand section|date=July 2013}}\nSATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s and SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s are compatible with each other. Most devices that are only SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s can connect with devices that are SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s, and vice versa, though SATA 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s devices only connect with SATA 6&nbsp;Gbit/s devices at the slower 1.5&nbsp;Gbit/s speed.\n\n==Comparison to other interfaces==\n\n===SATA and SCSI===\nParallel [[SCSI]] uses a more complex bus than SATA, usually resulting in higher manufacturing costs. SCSI buses also allow connection of several drives on one shared channel, whereas SATA allows one drive per channel, unless using a port multiplier. Serial Attached SCSI uses the same physical interconnects as SATA, and most SAS HBAs also support 3 and 6&nbsp;Gbit/s SATA devices (an HBA requires support for ''Serial ATA Tunneling Protocol'').\n\nSATA 3&nbsp;Gbit/s theoretically offers a maximum bandwidth of 300&nbsp;MB/s per device, which is only slightly lower than the rated speed for SCSI Ultra 320 with a maximum of 320&nbsp;MB/s total for all devices on a bus.<ref>Ultra-640 is specified, but devices do not exist</ref> SCSI drives provide greater sustained throughput than multiple SATA drives connected via a simple (i.e., command-based) [[port multiplier]] because of disconnect-reconnect and aggregating performance.<ref>FIS-based switching is comparable to SCSI's tagged command queueing</ref> In general, SATA devices link compatibly to SAS enclosures and adapters, whereas SCSI devices cannot be directly connected to a SATA bus.\n\nSCSI, SAS, and fibre-channel (FC) drives are more expensive than SATA, so they are used in [[server (computing)|server]]s and [[disk array]]s where the better performance justifies the additional cost. Inexpensive ATA and SATA drives evolved in the [[home computer|home-computer]] market, hence there is a view that they are less reliable. As those two worlds overlapped, the subject of reliability [[Hard disk drive#Integrity and failure|became somewhat controversial]]. Note that, in general, the failure rate of a disk drive is related to the quality of its heads, platters and supporting manufacturing processes, not to its interface.\n\nUse of serial ATA in the business market increased from 22% in 2006 to 28% in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|title=Serial ATA: Meeting Storage Needs Today and Tomorrow|url=http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|publisher=SATA-IO|accessdate=26 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120417133358/http://www.serialata.org/documents/SATA-Rev-30-Presentation.pdf|archivedate=17 April 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Comparison with other buses===\n{{See also|List of device bit rates#Storage|l1=List of device bit rates}}\n\nSCSI-3 devices with SCA-2 connectors are designed for hot swapping. Many server and RAID systems provide hardware support for transparent hot swapping. The designers of the SCSI standard prior to SCA-2 connectors did not target hot swapping, but in practice, most RAID implementations support hot swapping of hard disks.\n\n<!-- Please do not change the Transfer speed MB/s entries, especially for SATA.

In [[2011 Rally Finland|Finland]] he finished 3rd, and looked like he has only mathematical chances of winning the title. But with victories in [[2011 Rallye Deutschland|Germany]] and [[2011 Rallye de France|France]], he put himself back into title contention, arriving in [[2011 Rally Catalunya|Spain]] only 3 points behind leader [[Juho H\u00e4nninen]].

The next round, [[2012 Rally Argentina|Rally Argentina]] started well for T\u00e4nak, but continued badly: he collected punctures, and slid back to 37th, but fought his way back to 10th. In [[2012 Acropolis Rally|Greece]], he was doing well until he had to stop due to suspension damage and had to use Rally2 again. He crashed out in [[2012 Rally New Zealand|New Zealand]], but on [[2012 Rally Finland|Rally Finland]], the next round, he bounced back with a 6th-place finish. He followed this up by two crashes in [[2012 Rallye Deutschland|Germany]] and [[2012 Wales Rally GB|Great Britain]]. After these poor performances, he went on to finish sixth in [[2012 Rallye de France|France]]. He scored his first podium in [[2012 Rally d'Italia Sardegna|Italy]], the penultimate round of the season, by finishing 3rd behind winner [[Mikko Hirvonen]] and [[Evgeny Novikov]]. The final round of the season, the [[2012 Rally de Espa\u00f1a|Catalunya Rally]], was bittersweet to him: on the first day, he was even leading the rally, and was lying fifth when he crashed out on the last stage.

In season total, he finished 6 rally events, of which one he won and came 2nd in the rest, all behind Georg Gross.\nAt the season finale, [[Saaremaa Ralli]], T\u00e4nak led the event at the penultimate stage by just 4.4 seconds ahead of Georg Gross. Five stages before the penultimate stage, T\u00e4nak, with his WRC experience, knew that he would have to really push in the early morning when others are still waking up. He succeeded and built a lead of 15.9 seconds ahead of [[Egon Kaur]] and 20 seconds ahead of Georg Gross. But it wasn't enough, he was driving on the limits of his [[Subaru Impreza]] and couldn't go any faster.

In [[2011 Rally d'Italia Sardegna|Italy]] he collected his first class win with an outstanding performance. He continued to impress in [[2011 Acropolis Rally|Greece]], as he was leading after the first day, but rolled his car on the first stage of the second day, and had to retire. In [[2011 Rally Finland|Finland]] he finished 3rd, and looked like he has only mathematical chances of winning the title. But with victories in [[2011 Rallye Deutschland|Germany]] and [[2011 Rallye de France|France]], he put himself back into title contention, arriving in [[2011 Rally Catalunya|Spain]] only 3 points behind leader [[Juho H\u00e4nninen]]. However, he hit a rock on the first stage, breaking his [[Ford Fiesta S2000|Fiesta S2000]]'s front [[crossmember]], and had to restart under [[World Rally Championship#Rally 2|SupeRally rules]], meaning that he basically lost all of his chances of becoming the champion. He finished the event sixth in SWRC, and runner-up to H\u00e4nninen in the championship standings.\n\nHe made his debut in a WRC-spec [[Ford Fiesta RS WRC|Ford Fiesta]] prepared by [[M-Sport Stobart Ford World Rally Team|M-Sport Stobart]] at the [[2011 Wales Rally GB]], testing tyre supplier [[DMACK]]'s tyre compounds in preparation for their entry into the championship in 2012.<ref name=\"Tanak DMACK\">{{cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/95876|title=Ott Tanak to give DMACK tyres their World Rally Car debut in Britain|first=David|last=Evans|work=[[Autosport]]|publisher=[[Haymarket Group|Haymarket Publications]]|date=3 November 2011|accessdate=4 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n===2012===\n[[File:2012 10 05 Rallye France, Route de liaison \u00e0 Colmar, Ott T\u00e4nak.jpg|right|thumb|T\u00e4nak at the [[2012 Rallye de France]]]]\nIn 2012, T\u00e4nak was the number one driver for [[M-Sport Ford World Rally Team]], and with a [[Ford Fiesta RS WRC]] he drove the full [[2012 World Rally Championship|2012 season]].

After retiring in Sweden with engine failure, he finished fifth in [[2012 Rally M\u00e9xico|Mexico]]. But in [[2012 Rally de Portugal|Portugal]], he slid off the road, forcing him to return under [[World Rally Championship#Rally 2|Rally2]] (formerly SupeRally) rules. The next round, [[2012 Rally Argentina|Rally Argentina]] started well for T\u00e4nak, but continued badly: he collected punctures, and slid back to 37th, but fought his way back to 10th. In [[2012 Acropolis Rally|Greece]], he was doing well until he had to stop due to suspension damage and had to use Rally2 again. He crashed out in [[2012 Rally New Zealand|New Zealand]], but on [[2012 Rally Finland|Rally Finland]], the next round, he bounced back with a 6th-place finish. He followed this up by two crashes in [[2012 Rallye Deutschland|Germany]] and [[2012 Wales Rally GB|Great Britain]].
