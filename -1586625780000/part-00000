From the 11th century, the Mossi people established [[Mossi Kingdoms|several separate kingdoms]]. \n[[File:Africa de l'O\u00e8st en 1875-es.svg|thumb|upright=1.6|West Africa circa 1875]]\n\nIn the 1890s, during the European [[Scramble for Africa]], the territory of Burkina Faso was invaded by [[French Third Republic|France]], and colonial control was established following a war of conquest between 1896 and 1904. The territory was made part of [[French West Africa]] in 1904, and the colony of [[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The colony was named for its location on the upper courses of the [[Volta River]] (the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[Red Volta|Red]] and [[White Volta]]).\n\n===8th Century to 18th century===\nHistorians began to debate about the exact dates when Burkina Faso's many ethnic groups arrived to the area.

At times these [[colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties amongst themselves. Through a complex series of events what is today Burkina Faso eventually became a French protectorate in 1896.<ref>[[#Rupley|Rupley]], pp.&nbsp;30\u201333</ref>\n\n[[File:French West Africa 1913 map.png|thumb|[[French West Africa]] circa 1913]]\nThe eastern and western regions, where a standoff against the forces of the powerful ruler [[Samori Ture]] complicated the situation, came under French occupation in 1897. By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered; however, French control of many parts remained uncertain.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe [[Anglo-French Convention of 1898|Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the French territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].\n\nThe language of colonial administration and schooling became French. The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.\n\n[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs s\u00e9n\u00e9galais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].<ref>Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, ''West African Challenge to Empire,'' 2001</ref>\n\nThe French government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.\n\n[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]\n[[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The French feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger.\n\nThe new colony was named ''Haute Volta,'' and Fran\u00e7ois Charles Alexis \u00c9douard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy \u2013 based on [[coercion]] \u2013 failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the French colonies of [[Ivory Coast]], [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Ivory Coast received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.\n\nFrance reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[French Union]]. The French designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan France]] on the European continent.\n\nOn 11 December 1958 the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Upper Volta (1958\u20131984)===\n[[File:Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], the first President of Upper Volta, examines documents of ratifying the country's independence in 1960]]\n{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}\nThe Republic of Upper Volta ({{lang-fr|link=no|R\u00e9publique de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]] are called the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]]. These were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].\n\nBefore attaining autonomy, it had been French Upper Volta and part of the French Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yam\u00e9ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.\n\n====Lamizana's rule and multiple coups====\nThe [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 military coup]] deposed Yam\u00e9ogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought]] and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.\n\nLamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.\n\nColonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat]]. The CSP continued to ban political parties and organizations, yet promised a transition to civilian rule and a new constitution.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vqEHU3iW2i0C&pg=PA137|title=Revolutionary Overthrow of Constitutional Orders in Africa|last=Anyangwe|first=Carlson|date=2012|publisher=African Books Collective|isbn=9789956727780|language=en}}</ref>{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n====1983 coup d'\u00e9tat====\nInfighting developed between the right and left factions of the CSP.

The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[Precambrian]] [[massif]]. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak, [[T\u00e9nakourou]], is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.\n\nThe country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the [[Black Volta]] (or ''Mouhoun''), the [[White Volta]] (''Nakamb\u00e9'') and the [[Red Volta]] (''Nazinon''). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the [[Komo\u00e9 River|Komo\u00e9]], which flows to the southwest. The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[drainage basin|drains]] 27% of the country's surface.\n\nThe Niger's [[tributary|tributaries]] \u2013 the B\u00e9li, Gorouol, Goud\u00e9bo, and Dargol \u2013 are [[Torrent (stream)|seasonal streams]] and flow for only four to six months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes \u2013 the principal ones are Tingrela, [[Lake Bam|Bam]], and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, B\u00e9li, Yomboli, and Markoye. [[Drought|Water shortages]] are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.\n[[File:WP 35, SDr9776.JPG|right|thumb|[[Savanna]]h near the [[Gbomblora Department]], on the road from [[Gaoua]] to [[Bati\u00e9, Burkina Faso|Bati\u00e9]]]]\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Regions of Burkina Faso|Provinces of Burkina Faso|Departments of Burkina Faso}}\nThe country is divided into [[Regions of Burkina Faso|13&nbsp;administrative regions]].

The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June through September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea.

Situated between 11\u00b03' and 13\u00b05'&nbsp;north [[latitude]], the Sudan-Sahel region is a transitional zone with regards to rainfall and temperature. Further to the south, the Sudan-Guinea zone receives more than {{convert|90|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}}<ref name=relationship/> of rain each year and has cooler average temperatures.\n\n=== Natural resources ===\nBurkina Faso's natural resources include gold, [[manganese]], [[limestone]], [[marble]], [[phosphate]]s, [[pumice]], and [[Salt mining|salt]].\n\n===Wildlife and the environment===\n{{Further|Wildlife of Burkina Faso}}\n\nBurkina Faso has a larger number of elephants than many countries in West Africa. Lions, leopards and buffalo can also be found here, including the dwarf or red buffalo, a smaller reddish-brown animal which looks like a fierce kind of short-legged cow.

The increase in consumption linked to growth of the wage bill also supported economic growth. Inflation remained low, 0.4% that year but the public deficit grew to 7.7% of GDP (vs. 3.5% in 2016). The government was continuing to get financial aid and loans to finance the debt. To finance the public deficit, the Government combined concessional aid and borrowing on the regional market. The World Bank said that the economic outlook remained favorable in the short and medium term, although that could be negatively impacted.

The policy also makes provisions for strengthening the ministry's strategic and operational capacities. One of the key priorities is to improve food security and self-sufficiency by boosting capacity in agricultural and environmental sciences. The creation of a centre of excellence in 2014 at the International Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou within the World Bank project provides essential funding for capacity-building in these priority areas.<ref name=\"UNESCO Science Report\" />\n\nA dual priority is to promote innovative, effective and accessible health systems. The government wishes to develop, in parallel, applied sciences and technology and social and human sciences. To complement the national research policy, the government has prepared a ''National Strategy to Popularize Technologies, Inventions and Innovations'' (2012) and a ''National Innovation Strategy'' (2014). Other policies also incorporate science and technology, such as that on ''Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research'' (2010), the ''National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security'' (2014) and the ''National Programme for the Rural Sector'' (2011).<ref name=\"UNESCO Science Report\" />\n\nIn 2013, Burkina Faso passed the Science, Technology and Innovation Act establishing three mechanisms for financing research and innovation, a clear indication of high-level commitment.

At times these [[colonialists]] and their armies fought the local peoples; at times they forged alliances with them and made treaties. The colonialist officers and their home governments also made treaties amongst themselves.

By 1898, the majority of the territory corresponding to Burkina Faso was nominally conquered; however, French control of many parts remained uncertain.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}\n\nThe [[Anglo-French Convention of 1898|Franco-British Convention of 14 June 1898]] created the country's modern borders. In the French territory, a war of conquest against local communities and political powers continued for about five years. In 1904, the largely pacified territories of the [[Volta River|Volta basin]] were integrated into the [[Upper Senegal and Niger]] colony of [[French West Africa]] as part of the reorganization of the French West African colonial empire. The colony had its capital in [[Bamako]].\n\nThe language of colonial administration and schooling became French. The public education system started from humble origins. Advanced education was provided for many years during the colonial period in Dakar.\n\n[[Conscription|Draftees]] from the territory participated in the European fronts of [[World War I]] in the battalions of the [[Tirailleurs s\u00e9n\u00e9galais|Senegalese Rifles]]. Between 1915 and 1916, the districts in the western part of what is now Burkina Faso and the bordering eastern fringe of Mali became the stage of one of the most important armed oppositions to colonial government: the [[Volta-Bani War]].<ref>Mahir Saul and Patrick Royer, ''West African Challenge to Empire,'' 2001</ref>\n\nThe French government finally suppressed the movement but only after suffering defeats. It also had to organize its largest expeditionary force of its colonial history to send into the country to suppress the insurrection. Armed opposition wracked the Sahelian north when the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] and allied groups of the Dori region ended their truce with the government.\n\n[[File:Mittelholzer-ouagadougou.jpg|thumb|The capital, [[Ouagadougou]], in 1930]]\n[[French Upper Volta]] was established on 1 March 1919. The French feared a recurrence of armed uprising and had related economic considerations. To bolster its administration, the colonial government separated the present territory of Burkina Faso from Upper Senegal and Niger.\n\nThe new colony was named ''Haute Volta,'' and Fran\u00e7ois Charles Alexis \u00c9douard Hesling became its first [[List of governors of Upper Volta|governor]]. Hesling initiated an ambitious road-making program to improve infrastructure and promoted the growth of cotton for export. The cotton policy \u2013 based on [[coercion]] \u2013 failed, and revenue generated by the colony stagnated. The colony was dismantled on 5 September 1932, being split between the French colonies of [[Ivory Coast]], [[French Sudan]] and [[Niger]]. Ivory Coast received the largest share, which contained most of the population as well as the cities of Ouagadougou and Bobo-Dioulasso.\n\nFrance reversed this change during the period of intense anti-colonial agitation that followed the end of [[World War II]]. On 4 September 1947, it revived the colony of Upper Volta, with its previous boundaries, as a part of the [[French Union]]. The French designated its colonies as departments of [[metropolitan France]] on the European continent.\n\nOn 11 December 1958 the colony achieved [[Self-governance|self-government]] as the [[Republic of Upper Volta]]; it joined the Franco-African Community. A revision in the organization of French Overseas Territories had begun with the passage of the Basic Law (Loi Cadre) of 23 July 1956. This act was followed by reorganization measures approved by the French parliament early in 1957 to ensure a large degree of self-government for individual territories. Upper Volta became an autonomous republic in the French community on 11 December 1958. Full independence from France was received in 1960.<ref name=WDL1>{{cite web|url=http://www.wdl.org/en/item/635|title=More (Language of the Moose people) Phrase Book|publisher=[[World Digital Library]]|accessdate=16 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n===Upper Volta (1958\u20131984)===\n[[File:Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo and Louis Jacquinot exchanging instruments of ratification for the independence of the Upper Volta.jpg|thumb|[[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], the first President of Upper Volta, examines documents of ratifying the country's independence in 1960]]\n{{main|Republic of Upper Volta}}\nThe Republic of Upper Volta ({{lang-fr|link=no|R\u00e9publique de Haute-Volta}}) was established on 11 December 1958 as a [[self-governing colony]] within the [[French Community]]. The name ''Upper Volta'' related to the nation's location along the upper reaches of the [[Volta River]]. The river's three [[Tributary|tributaries]] are called the [[Black Volta|Black]], [[White Volta|White]] and [[Red Volta]]. These were expressed in the three colors of the [[Flag of Upper Volta|former national flag]].\n\nBefore attaining autonomy, it had been French Upper Volta and part of the French Union. On 5 August 1960, it attained full independence from [[French Fourth Republic|France]]. The first president, [[Maurice Yam\u00e9ogo]], was the leader of the [[Voltaic Democratic Union]] (UDV). The 1960 constitution provided for election by [[universal suffrage]] of a president and a national assembly for five-year terms. Soon after coming to power, Yam\u00e9ogo banned all political parties other than the UDV. The government lasted until 1966. After much unrest, including mass demonstrations and strikes by students, labor unions, and civil servants, the military intervened.\n\n====Lamizana's rule and multiple coups====\nThe [[1966 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|1966 military coup]] deposed Yam\u00e9ogo, suspended the constitution, dissolved the National Assembly, and placed Lt. Col. [[Sangoul\u00e9 Lamizana]] at the head of a government of senior army officers. The army remained in power for four years. On 14 June 1976, the Voltans ratified a new constitution that established a four-year transition period toward complete civilian rule. Lamizana remained in power throughout the 1970s as president of military or mixed civil-military governments. Lamizana's rule coincided with the beginning of the [[Sahel drought]] and famine which had a devastating impact on Upper Volta and neighboring countries. After conflict over the 1976 constitution, a new constitution was written and approved in 1977. Lamizana was re-elected by open elections in 1978.\n\nLamizana's government faced problems with the country's traditionally powerful trade unions, and on 25 November 1980, Col. [[Saye Zerbo]] overthrew President Lamizana in a [[1980 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless coup]]. Colonel Zerbo established the Military Committee of Recovery for National Progress as the supreme governmental authority, thus eradicating the 1977 constitution.\n\nColonel Zerbo also encountered resistance from trade unions and was overthrown two years later by Maj. Dr. [[Jean-Baptiste Ou\u00e9draogo]] and the Council of Popular Salvation (CSP) in the [[1982 Upper Voltan coup d'\u00e9tat]].

The larger part of the country is covered by a [[peneplain]], which forms a gently undulating landscape with, in some areas, a few isolated hills, the last vestiges of a [[Precambrian]] [[massif]]. The southwest of the country, on the other hand, forms a [[sandstone]] massif, where the highest peak, [[T\u00e9nakourou]], is found at an elevation of {{convert|749|m|ft|0|sp=us}}. The massif is bordered by sheer cliffs up to {{convert|150|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} high. The average altitude of Burkina Faso is {{convert|400|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}} and the difference between the highest and lowest terrain is no greater than {{convert|600|m|ft|0|abbr=on|sp=us}}. Burkina Faso is therefore a relatively flat country.\n\nThe country owes its former name of Upper Volta to three rivers which cross it: the [[Black Volta]] (or ''Mouhoun''), the [[White Volta]] (''Nakamb\u00e9'') and the [[Red Volta]] (''Nazinon''). The Black Volta is one of the country's only two rivers which flow year-round, the other being the [[Komo\u00e9 River|Komo\u00e9]], which flows to the southwest. The basin of the [[Niger River]] also [[drainage basin|drains]] 27% of the country's surface.\n\nThe Niger's [[tributary|tributaries]] \u2013 the B\u00e9li, Gorouol, Goud\u00e9bo, and Dargol \u2013 are [[Torrent (stream)|seasonal streams]] and flow for only four to six months a year. They still can flood and overflow, however. The country also contains numerous lakes \u2013 the principal ones are Tingrela, [[Lake Bam|Bam]], and Dem. The country contains large ponds, as well, such as Oursi, B\u00e9li, Yomboli, and Markoye. [[Drought|Water shortages]] are often a problem, especially in the north of the country.\n[[File:WP 35, SDr9776.JPG|right|thumb|[[Savanna]]h near the [[Gbomblora Department]], on the road from [[Gaoua]] to [[Bati\u00e9, Burkina Faso|Bati\u00e9]]]]\n\n===Administrative divisions===\n{{main|Regions of Burkina Faso|Provinces of Burkina Faso|Departments of Burkina Faso}}\nThe country is divided into [[Regions of Burkina Faso|13&nbsp;administrative regions]].

The rainy season lasts approximately four months, May/June through September, and is shorter in the north of the country. Three climatic zones can be defined: the Sahel, the Sudan-Sahel, and the Sudan-Guinea.

Up until then, management of science, technology and innovation had fallen under the Department of Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research. Within this ministry, the Directorate General for Research and Sector Statistics is responsible for planning. A separate body, the Directorate General of Scientific Research, Technology and Innovation, co-ordinates research. This is a departure from the pattern in many other West African countries where a single body fulfils both functions. The move signals the government's intention to make science and technology a development priority.<ref name=\"UNESCO Science Report\" />\n\nIn 2012, Burkina Faso adopted a ''National Policy for Scientific and Technical Research'', the strategic objectives of which are to develop R&D and the application and commercialization of research results. The policy also makes provisions for strengthening the ministry's strategic and operational capacities. One of the key priorities is to improve food security and self-sufficiency by boosting capacity in agricultural and environmental sciences. The creation of a centre of excellence in 2014 at the International Institute of Water and Environmental Engineering in Ouagadougou within the World Bank project provides essential funding for capacity-building in these priority areas.<ref name=\"UNESCO Science Report\" />\n\nA dual priority is to promote innovative, effective and accessible health systems. The government wishes to develop, in parallel, applied sciences and technology and social and human sciences. To complement the national research policy, the government has prepared a ''National Strategy to Popularize Technologies, Inventions and Innovations'' (2012) and a ''National Innovation Strategy'' (2014). Other policies also incorporate science and technology, such as that on ''Secondary and Higher Education and Scientific Research'' (2010), the ''National Policy on Food and Nutrition Security'' (2014) and the ''National Programme for the Rural Sector'' (2011).<ref name=\"UNESCO Science Report\" />\n\nIn 2013, Burkina Faso passed the Science, Technology and Innovation Act establishing three mechanisms for financing research and innovation, a clear indication of high-level commitment. These mechanisms are the National Fund for Education and Research, the National Fund for Research and Innovation for Development and the Forum of Scientific Research and Technological Innovation.<ref name=\"UNESCO Science Report\" />\n\n==Society==\n\n===Demographics===\n[[File:Ouagadougou (3839513403).jpg|thumb|upright|A Burkinab\u00e8 [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] man in [[Ouagadougou]]]]\n{{main|Demographics of Burkina Faso}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px\"\n! colspan=\"4\" style=\"text-align:center; background:#cfb;\"|Population{{UN_Population|ref}}\n|-\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Year\n! style=\"background:#cfb;\"|Million\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|1950||style=\"text-align:right;\"|4.3\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|2000||style=\"text-align:right;\"|11.6\n|-\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{UN_Population|Year}}||style=\"text-align:right;\"|{{#expr:{{formatnum:{{UN_Population|Burkina Faso}}|R}}/1e6 round 1}}\n|}\nBurkina Faso is an ethnically integrated, secular state.

Traditional ritual ceremonies of the many ethnic groups in Burkina Faso have long involved dancing with [[mask]]s. Western-style theatre became common during colonial times, heavily influenced by [[French theatre]]. With independence came a new style of theatre inspired by [[Theatre of the Oppressed|forum theatre]] aimed at educating and entertaining Burkina Faso's rural people.\n\n===Arts and crafts===\n{{Main|Art of Burkina Faso}}\n[[File:Burkina faso artisan painted gourds.jpg|thumb|Artisan garland of decorative painted [[gourd]]s in [[Ouagadougou]]]]\n\nIn addition to several rich traditional artistic heritages among the peoples, there is a large artist community in Burkina Faso, especially in [[Ouagadougou]].

(In 2006 the Secretariat of FEPACI moved to South Africa, but the headquarters of the organization is still in Ouagadougou.)

He then returned to Malaysia to become a tutor at Department of Mathematics in the newly founded [[National University of Malaysia]], [[Kuala Lumpur]]. Few months later, Osman returned to [[London]] on a study leave in order to pursue [[Postgraduate education|postgraduate]] studies in [[Algebra]] at [[Bedford College, London|Bedford College]], [[University of London]]. The following year, he obtained his Master of Science. Osman started his doctoral study at the same College, specializing on algebraic group theory. He became intensely interested in [[religion]] and [[philosophy]] and began spending more time on Islamic thought and both Western and [[Islamic philosophy]], than on algebra. He was particularly attracted to the writings of two great Muslim thinkers, the Iranian philosopher [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], and the medieval Persian mystic [[Al-Ghazali|al-Ghazzali]].\u00a0The writings of both thinkers exerted a profound influence on his intellectual outlook which resulted in termination of his doctoral study in mathematics. Osman returned to Malaysia in October 1973 and became a lecturer of the Department of Mathematics at the National University of Malaysia. In October 1981, Osman went to [[Temple University]], [[Philadelphia]] to pursue his doctoral studies in Islamic philosophy of science under the supervision of Nasr. He wrote a thesis entitled\u00a0''Classification of the Sciences in Islamic Intellectual History: A Study in Islamic Philosophies of Science''\u00a0that has been published under the title\u00a0''Classification of Knowledge in Islam''.  After obtaining his PhD, Osman was promoted to Associate Professor in 1989 and Professor in 1992 as Chair of Philosophy of Science, a post that he still holds. From July until December 1992, he was a Fulbright Visiting Scholar at Department of History of Science, [[Harvard University]] where he undertook research on Mathematics in Muslim Culture. In 1995, he was appointed the [[University of Malaya]]\u2019s Deputy Vice Chancellor in charge of academic and human resource matters. He resigned from the post in June 2000 to take up a new appointment at [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington, D.C.|Washington DC]] as Malaysia Chair of Islam in Southeast Asia.\n\n==Influence==\n\nOsman has made a major contribution to the popularization of [[Science in the medieval Islamic world|Islamic science]] and intellectual discourses on religion and science, and to the advancement of cross-cultural studies of history and [[philosophy of science]]. His intellectual contribution has had an impact, not only in his own country, Malaysia, but also in various parts of the [[Muslim world]]. He is the main founder of Malaysian Islamic Academy of Science established in 1977.\u00a0\u00a0He was its first Secretary-General (1977-1981) and later President (1987-1992). Among the objectives of the Academy is to promote studies and research in religion and science, particularly from the Islamic point of view. In 1991, he founded the Academy's bilingual biannual journal\u00a0Kesturi, a publication dedicated to the pursuit of the unity of knowledge. He was the journal's first Chief Editor.\n\n==Major Works==\nOsman has authored eighteen books and more than three hundred articles.<ref>Notes on the contributors, ''Synthesis Philosophica'' '''62''' (2/2016) p. 451</ref> Some of his publications include:\n\n;As author\n\n* ''Islamic Civilisation and The Modern World: Thematic Essays'' (2015).\n* ''The History and Philosophy of Islamic Science''.
