It aired on December 9, 2008.\n\n==Plot==\n\nA troubled sixteen-year-old, Natalie, is singing at her school's Christmas program when she suddenly becomes disoriented and vomits. She is brought to [[Princeton-Plainsboro Teaching Hospital]], where the team discovers her [[liver]] is failing for an unknown reason. In House's office, they are exchanging Christmas gifts when House receives a mysterious gift wrapped in green wrapping paper. Kutner reads the note aloud, as it says \"Greg- made me think of you.\" The present turns out to be [[Joseph Bell|Dr. Joseph Bell's]] ''Manual of The Operations of Surgery''. House, annoyed, throws it in the trash. Afterwards, House conducts a [[differential diagnosis]], with the team entertaining ideas such as [[alcohol abuse]] and pill-popping. None of the symptoms fit with the entire picture. When Chase and Kutner question Natalie's classmates, Chase gets angry enough with their cruel attitudes to let them know they're in serious trouble and they should act like human beings and tell him something that isn't bullshit; one of the popular girls says they slipped \"[[Psilocybin mushroom|magic mushrooms]]\" into Natalie's food, and when she asks if Natalie will be OK Chase snaps at her that he has no way of knowing. Meanwhile, Foreman and Thirteen are still involved in the [[Huntington's Chorea|Huntington's]] drug trial. A woman whose disease is quite advanced drops out of the trial, saying that Foreman told her to \"get over it\" when her medication made her nauseous. Thirteen, annoyed, accuses Foreman of being like House.\n\nAfter briefly suggesting the gift was from a former patient and old flame [[Irene Adler]] (a reference to [[Sherlock Holmes]]) Wilson tells the team that it is in fact last year's gift from Wilson himself, which House never opened. Wilson accuses House of needing to create the false illusion of a gift because he just cannot be nice to anyone. They end up betting that he cannot get thanked by a patient.  Later, after Natalie's [[toxicology|tox-screen]] was clean, Taub and Kutner find painkillers in her school locker, which makes them think she tried to kill herself. They later suspect [[tuberculosis]], thinking she might have picked up something from the soup kitchen she normally attends.\n\nTo win the bet he made with Wilson, House puts on his lab coat (only the fourth time House is seen doing so, with the other occasions being the episodes \"[[Mob Rules (House)|Mob Rules]]\", \"[[Sex Kills]]\" and \"[[Games (House)|Games]]\") and acts very kind and caring toward his patients. A slightly dim woman, Whitney, who comes to the clinic with a terrible headache, compliments House on his hospitality, to which he responds, \"If you can't be nice, why be a doctor?\" He later deduces she is pregnant, much to her surprise. He then sarcastically insults her for not recognizing the common symptoms of early pregnancy, such as missing her period and putting on weight. She insists that she and her fiance are virgins, and asks for House to run a paternity test after he suggests that she has had an affair. He does run the test, but after sharing the results with them, he looks surprised, and leaves. He comes back later with the same set of results, and with a look of disbelief, states that Whitney is pregnant as a result of [[Parthenogenesis#Humans|human parthenogenesis]], a never-seen-before scientific phenomenon. Her baby only has maternal genes due to a spontaneous gene mutation which fertilized her egg, without ever needing male sperm. Her baby will be a virgin birth. Later, however, it is revealed that House faked those lab tests and just told them that story to cover up Whitney's blatant infidelity (as shown by the ''real'' results of the test), thereby 'saving' their potential marriage in House's eyes but saddling the fiance with a cheating potential future wife and someone else's baby (this is the \"mistaking Good for Evil\" that Cuddy refers to later in the episode but fails herself to rectify).\n\nThings make a turn for the worse for Natalie, as she has a [[Epileptic seizure|seizure]], ruling out TB but bringing her brain into the differential, along with liver and [[lungs]].  Kutner suggests a [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] [[allergy]], to which the team goes to test her.  Natalie admits to buying alcohol from her friend Simon, whom Kutner and Taub question. Taub suggests alcohol poisoning, but it turns out that she hardly even drank any of the alcohol she bought from Simon, as it was only a way to \"look cool\" and stay friends with him and he felt guilty over only associating with her in private because she wasn't popular. She goes into [[cardiac arrest]], ruling out the alcohol theory. But her high blood alcohol level nonetheless suggests [[leukemia]], and Wilson is brought in to help.  While Cuddy desperately tries to rule leukemia out, Wilson discusses the likelihood of it and says that she will die, even if they kill all the cancer, due to her failing heart and liver. A double transplant would not even save her. Cuddy then has an epiphany after talking with House about the pregnant couple and gravely realizes the only other disease that explains everything: post-partum [[Eclampsia]], which means that Natalie must have got pregnant and had a child. This turns out to be correct, and her friend Simon is the unknowing father. Natalie explains that she gave birth in an abandoned house but her daughter was [[Stillbirth|stillborn]]. Cuddy searches the house and finds the baby girl, alive, being cared for by a pair of homeless squatters, and brings the baby back to the hospital where she reunites her with her mother. Unfortunately, due to the extent of Natalie's failing organs, she will die within hours (although this is not shown in the episode). The baby ends up being in good health but is kept for observation as she is premature.\n\nIn the end, the whole team is full of Christmas spirit. Kutner finds a former classmate he used to bully and apologizes to him. During the episode he is shown to be furious about Natalie being bullied and when asked says that he was never bullied. Cuddy plans to become a foster parent and adopt the baby, as neither grandparent wants to care for her as she will recall memories too painful for them to handle, with House wishing her \"Merry Christmas, Cuddy.\" Thirteen tells Foreman that he is not like House, after he welcomed back the woman who dropped out of the trial and is taking better care of her. Foreman and Thirteen passionately kiss.\n\n== External links ==\n{{Wikiquote|House_(TV_series)/Season_5#Joy_To_The_World_.285.11.29|Joy to the World}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100912165300/http://www.fox.com/house/recaps/season-5/episode-11.htm \"Joy to the World\"] at [[Fox.com]]\n* {{IMDb episode|1273714|Joy to the World}}\n* {{tv.com episode|house/joy-to-the-world-1240256|Joy to the World}}\n\n{{House (TV series)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Joy To The World}}\n[[Category:House (season 5) episodes]]\n[[Category:Christmas television episodes]]\n[[Category:2008 American television episodes]]\n\n[[fr:Saison 5 de Dr House#\u00c9pisode 11 : Le Divin Enfant]]\n", "text_old": "{{DISPLAYTITLE:Joy to the World (''House'')}}\n{{Multiple issues|\n{{All plot|date=March 2011}}\n{{unreferenced|date=December 2008}}\n{{long plot|date=March 2011}}\n{{notability|Television|date=June 2010}}\n}}<!--- Not notable without significant coverage in independent reliable sources. --->\n\n{{Infobox television episode\n |title = Joy to the World\n |series = [[House (TV series)|House]]\n |image = \n |caption = \n |season = 5\n |episode = 11\n |director = [[David Straiton]]\n |writer = [[Peter Blake (writer)|Peter Blake]]\n |teleplay = \n |story = \n |producer = \n |music = \n |photographer = \n |editor = \n |production = \n |airdate = {{Start date|2008|12|9}}\n |length = \n |guests = * B.

The term \"dualistic-monism\" or [[dialectical monism]] has been coined in an attempt to express this fruitful [[paradox]] of simultaneous unity and duality.

Either of the two major aspects may manifest more strongly in a particular object, depending on the criterion of the observation.

''Yinyang'' meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".<ref name=\"Ames\" />\n\n==History==\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\">Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956</ref> He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] ({{lang|zh|\u9112\u884d}}; 305 \u2013 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\" />\n\n=== Chinese gender roles ===\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]</ref> Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\n==Nature==\nIn [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' at chapter 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref>&nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.<ref>Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref> Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:<ref>[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] & [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33</ref>\n*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.\n*Illness is the doorway to health.\n*Tragedy turns to comedy.\n*Disasters turn out to be blessings.\n\n==Symbolism and importance==\nYin is the black side, and yang is the white side. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.<ref>Osgood, Charles E. \"From Yang and Yin to and or but.\" Language 49.2 (1973): 380\u2013412 .

In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.<ref>Li CL.

Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five \"Confucian\" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.</ref> yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268b</span>) and yang is solid (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268a</span>). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' \u2631) or more yin (''e.g.'' \u2635) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', \u2630 is heavily yang, while \u2637 is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4dd5</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4ddf</span>). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\n===Taijitu===\n[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|The \"taichi symbol\" (''[[taijitu]]'').]]\n{{Main|Taijitu}}\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]\").

Chinese does have some ''yangyin'' [[collocation]]s, such as {{lang|zh|\u6d0b\u9280}} (lit. \"foreign silver\") \"silver coin/dollar\", but not even the most comprehensive dictionaries (e.g., the ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'') enter ''yangyin'' *{{lang|zh|\u967d\u9670}}.

The linguistic term \"[[Siamese twins (linguistics)|irreversible binomial]]\" refers to a collocation of two words A-B that cannot be idiomatically reversed as B-A, for example, English ''cat and mouse'' (not *''mouse and cat'') and ''friend or foe'' (not *''foe or friend'').<ref name=\"Ames\">Roger T. Ames, \"''Yin'' and ''Yang''\", in ''Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy'', ed. by Antonio S. Cua, Routledge, 2002, 847.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, the usual pattern among Chinese binomial compounds is for positive A and negative B, where the A word is dominant or privileged over B, for example, ''tiandi'' {{lang|zh|\u5929\u5730}} \"heaven and earth\" and ''nann\u00fc'' {{lang|zh|\u7537\u5973}} \"women and men\". ''Yinyang'' meaning \"dark and light; female and male; moon and sun\", however, is an exception. Scholars have proposed various explanations for why ''yinyang'' violates this pattern, including \"linguistic convenience\" (it is easier to say ''yinyang'' than ''yangyin''), the idea that \"proto-Chinese society was matriarchal\", or perhaps, since ''yinyang'' first became prominent during the late Warring States period, this term was \"purposely directed at challenging persistent cultural assumptions\".<ref name=\"Ames\" />\n\n==History==\nNeedham discusses Yin and Yang together with [[Wu Xing|Five Elements]] as part of the [[School of Naturalists]]. He says that it would be proper to begin with Yin and Yang before Five Elements because the former: \"lay, as it were, at a deeper level in Nature, and were the most ultimate principles of which the ancient Chinese could conceive. But it so happens that we know a good deal more about the historical origin of the Five-Element theory than about that of the Yin and the Yang, and it will therefore be more convenient to deal with it first.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\">Needham, Joseph; Science and Civilization in China Vol.2:  History of Scientific Thought; [[Cambridge University Press]]; 1956</ref> He then discusses [[Zou Yan]] ({{lang|zh|\u9112\u884d}}; 305 \u2013 240 BC) who is most associated with these theories. Although Yin and Yang are not mentioned in any of the surviving documents of Zou Yan, his school was known as the Yin Yang Jia (Yin and Yang School) Needham concludes \"There can be very little doubt that the philosophical use of the terms began about the beginning of the -4th century, and that the passages in older texts which mention this use are interpolations made later than that time.\"<ref name=\"Science and Civilization\" />\n\n=== Chinese gender roles ===\n\nIn spite of being used in a modern context to justify egalitarianism under the notion of both yin and yang being \"necessary\", in practise the concept of yin and yang has led to justification for China's patriarchal history.<ref>[https://www.iep.utm.edu/gender-c/]</ref> Particularly under [[Confucianism]], yang (as the sun principle) is considered superior to \"yin\" (the dark principle), hence men are afforded rulership positions whereas women are not unless, under some remarkable circumstances, they possess sufficient yang.\n\n==Nature==\nIn [[Daoism|Daoist]] philosophy, dark and light, yin and yang, arrive in the ''[[Tao Te Ching]]'' at chapter 42.<ref>{{cite web|last=Muller|first=Charles|title=Daode Jing|url=http://www.acmuller.net/con-dao/daodejing.html#div-43|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref>&nbsp; It becomes sensible from an initial quiescence or emptiness ([[Wuji (philosophy)|wuji]], sometimes symbolized by an empty circle), and continues moving until [[Wiktionary:quiescence|quiescence]] is reached again. For instance, dropping a stone in a calm pool of water will simultaneously raise waves and lower troughs between them, and this alternation of high and low points in the water will radiate outward until the movement dissipates and the pool is calm once more. Yin and yang thus are always opposite and equal qualities. Further, whenever one quality reaches its peak, it will naturally begin to transform into the opposite quality: for example, grain that reaches its full height in summer (fully yang) will produce seeds and die back in winter (fully yin) in an endless cycle.\n\nIt is impossible to talk about yin or yang without some reference to the opposite, since yin and yang are bound together as parts of a [[non-wellfounded mereology|mutual whole]] (for example, there cannot be the bottom of the foot without the top). A way to illustrate this idea is{{citation needed|date=June 2012}} to postulate the notion of a race with only women or only men; this race would disappear in a single generation. Yet, women and men together create new generations that allow the race they mutually create (and mutually come from) to survive. The interaction of the two gives birth to things, like manhood.<ref>Robin R. Wang {{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/yinyang/|title=Yinyang (Yin-yang)|work=[[Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]|accessdate=2018-03-09}}</ref> Yin and yang transform each other: like an undertow in the ocean, every advance is complemented by a retreat, and every rise transforms into a fall. Thus, a seed will sprout from the earth and grow upwards towards the sky{{mdash}}an intrinsically yang movement. Then, when it reaches its full potential height, it will fall. Also, the growth of the top seeks light, while roots grow in darkness.\n\nCertain catchphrases have been used to express yin and yang complementarity:<ref>[[Nyoiti Sakurazawa]] & [[William Dufty]] (1965) ''You Are All Sanpaku'', page 33</ref>\n*The bigger the front, the bigger the back.\n*Illness is the doorway to health.\n*Tragedy turns to comedy.\n*Disasters turn out to be blessings.\n\n==Symbolism and importance==\nYin is the black side, and yang is the white side. The relationship between yin and yang is often described in terms of sunlight playing over a mountain and a valley. Yin (literally the 'shady place' or 'north slope') is the dark area occluded by the mountain's bulk, while yang (literally the \"sunny place' or \"south slope\") is the brightly lit portion. As the sun moves across the sky, yin and yang gradually trade places with each other, revealing what was obscured and obscuring what was revealed.\n\nYin is characterized as slow, soft, yielding, diffuse, cold, wet, and passive; and is associated with water, earth, the moon, [[femininity]], and night time.\n\nYang, by contrast, is fast, hard, solid, focused, hot, dry, and active; and is associated with fire, sky, the sun, [[masculinity]] and daytime.<ref>Osgood, Charles E. \"From Yang and Yin to and or but.\" Language 49.2 (1973): 380\u2013412 . [[JSTOR]]</ref>\n\nYin and yang also applies to the human body. In traditional Chinese medicine good health is directly related to the balance between yin and yang qualities within oneself.<ref>Li CL.

Perspect Biol Med. 1974 Autumn;18(1):132-43.</ref>  If yin and yang become unbalanced, one of the qualities is considered deficient or has [[Emptiness|vacuity]].\n\n===''I Ching''===\nIn the ''[[I Ching]]'', originally a divination manual of the [[Western Zhou]] period (c. 1000\u2013750 BC),<ref>\nThe text of the ''I Ching'' has its origins in a [[Western Zhou]] divination text called the ''Changes of Zhou'' ({{lang|zh|\u5468\u6613}} ''Zh\u014du y\u00ec'').  Various modern scholars suggest dates ranging between the 10th and 4th centuries BC for the assembly of the text in approximately its current form. Nylan, Michael (2001), ''The Five \"Confucian\" Classics'' (2001), p. 228.</ref> yin and yang are represented by broken and solid lines: yin is broken (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268b</span>) and yang is solid (<span style=\"font-size: 24px\">\u268a</span>). These are then combined into [[ba gua|trigrams]], which are more yang (''e.g.'' \u2631) or more yin (''e.g.'' \u2635) depending on the number of broken and solid lines (''e.g.'', \u2630 is heavily yang, while \u2637 is heavily yin), and trigrams are combined into hexagrams (''e.g.'' <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4dd5</span> and <span style=\"font-size: 20px\">\u4ddf</span>). The relative positions and numbers of yin and yang lines within the trigrams determines the meaning of a trigram, and in hexagrams the upper trigram is considered yang with respect to the lower trigram, yin, which allows for complex depictions of interrelations.\n\n===Taijitu===\n[[File:Yin yang.svg|thumb|The \"taichi symbol\" (''[[taijitu]]'').]]\n{{Main|Taijitu}}\n\nThe principle of yin and yang is represented by the Taijitu (literally \"Diagram of the [[Taiji (philosophy)|Supreme Ultimate]]\").

Three programs comprise the Institute's summer season: the program for jazz; the program for piano and strings, and the program for singers. \n\n== Overview ==\nIn 1904, the A.C. Frost Company created Ravinia as an amusement park intended to lure riders to the fledgling [[Chicago and Milwaukee Electric Railroad]]. The amusement park boasted a baseball diamond, electric fountain and refectory or casino building with dining rooms and a dance floor.

For example, in the integral <math>\\textstyle \\int \\frac{  dx}{\\sqrt{-x^2 + c}}</math>, the substitution <math>\\sqrt{x^2 + c} = \\pm ix + t</math> can be used. Extensions to the complex numbers allows us to use every type of Euler substitution regardless of the coefficients on the quadratic.\n\nThe substitutions of Euler can be generalized to a larger class of functions. Consider integrals of the form\n\n: <math>\\int R_1\\Big(x, \\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\\Big) \\, \\log\\Big(R_2\\Big(x, \\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\\Big)\\Big) \\,  dx,</math>\n\nwhere <math>R_1</math> and <math>R_2</math> are rational functions of <math>x</math> and <math>\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}</math>. This integral can be transformed by the substitution <math>\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \\sqrt{a} + xt</math> into another integral\n\n: <math>\\int \\tilde R_1(t) \\log\\big(\\tilde R_2(t)\\big) \\,  dt,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\tilde R_1(t)</math> and <math>\\tilde R_2(t)</math> are now simply rational functions of <math>t</math>. In principle, [[factorization]] and [[partial fraction decomposition]] can be employed to break the integral down into simple terms, which can be integrated analytically through use of the [[dilogarithm]] function.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zwillinger |first1=Daniel |title=The Handbook of Integration |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=1992 |isbn=978-0867202939 |pages=145\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Integration by substitution]]\n* [[Trigonometric substitution]]\n* [[Tangent half-angle substitution|Weierstrass substitution]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=9681|title=Eulers Substitutions For Integration}}\n\n{{Integrals}}\n[[Category:Integral calculus]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|A method of integration for rational functions.}}\n{{calculus|expanded=integral}}\n'''Euler substitution''' is a method for evaluating integrals of the form\n\n: <math>\\int R(x, \\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}) \\,  dx,</math>\n\nwhere <math>R</math> is a rational function of <math>x</math> and <math>\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}</math>.

We have that <math>x = \\frac{c - t^2}{\\pm 2t\\sqrt{a} - b}</math> and that the <math>  dx</math> term is expressible rationally in <math>t</math>.\n\nIn this substitution, either the positive sign or the negative sign can be chosen.\n\n==Euler's second substitution==\nIf <math>c > 0</math>, we take\n:<math>\n \\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = xt \\pm \\sqrt{c}.\n</math>\nWe solve for <math>x</math> similarly as above and find\n<math>x = \\frac{\\pm 2t\\sqrt{c} - b}{a - t^2}.</math>\n\nAgain, either the positive or the negative sign can be chosen.\n\n==Euler's third substitution==\nIf the polynomial <math>ax^2 + bx + c</math> has real roots <math>\\alpha</math> and <math>\\beta</math>, we may choose\n<math>\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \\sqrt{a(x - \\alpha)(x - \\beta)} = (x - \\alpha)t</math>. This yields \n<math>x = \\frac{a\\beta - \\alpha t^2}{a - t^2},</math>\nand as in the preceding cases, we can express the entire integrand rationally in <math>t</math>.\n\n==Worked examples==\n{{Expand section|date=April 2018}}\n=== Examples for Euler's first substitution ===\n\n==== One ====\n\nIn the integral <math>\\int\\! \\frac{\\ dx}{\\sqrt{x^2+c}}</math> we can use the first substitution and set <math>\\sqrt{x^2+c} = -x+t</math>, thus\n:<math>x = \\frac{t^2-c}{2t} \\quad\\quad \\ dx = \\frac{t^2+c}{2t^2}\\,\\ dt</math>\n:<math>\\sqrt{x^2+c} = -\\frac{t^2-c}{2t}+t = \\frac{t^2+c}{2t}</math>\nAccordingly, we obtain:\n:<math>\\int \\frac{\\ dx}{\\sqrt{x^2+c}} = \\int \\frac{\\frac{t^2+c}{2t^2}}{\\frac{t^2+c}{2t}}\\, \\ dt = \\int\\!\\frac{\\ dt}{t} = \\ln|t|+C = \\ln|x+\\sqrt{x^2+c}|+C</math>\n\nThe cases <math>c = \\pm 1</math> give the formulas\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\frac{\\ dx}{\\sqrt{x^2+1}} &= \\mbox{arsinh}(x) + C  \\\\[6pt]\n\\int \\frac{\\ dx}{\\sqrt{x^2-1}} &= \\mbox{arcosh}(x) + C \\qquad (x > 1)\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==== Two ====\nFor finding the value of \n\n:<math>\\int\\frac{1}{x\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}}dx,</math> \nwe find <math>t</math> using the first substitution of Euler, <math>\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4} = \\sqrt{1}x+t = x+t</math>. Squaring both sides of the equation gives us <math>x^{2}+4x-4 = x^{2} + 2xt +t^{2}</math>, from which the <math>x^2</math> terms will cancel out. Solving for <math>x</math> yields \n:<math>x=\\frac{t^{2}+4}{4-2t}.</math>\n\nFrom there, we find that the differentials <math>dx</math> and <math>dt</math> are related by\n\n:<math>dx=\\frac{-2t^{2}+8t+8}{(4-2t)^{2}}dt.</math>\n\nHence,\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\frac{dx}{x\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}} &= \\int \\frac{\\frac{-2t^{2}+8t+8}{(4-2t)^{2}}}{(\\frac{t^{2}+4}{4-2t})(\\frac{-t^{2}+4t+4}{4-2t})}dt \\\\[6pt]\n&= 2\\int \\frac{dt}{t^{2}+4}= \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac t2\\right) +C && t=\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}-x\\\\[6pt]\n&= \\tan^{-1}\\left(\\frac{\\sqrt{x^{2}+4x-4}-x}{2}\\right)+C\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== Examples for Euler's second substitution ===\n\nIn the integral \n:<math>\\int\\! \\frac{dx}{x\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}},</math> \nwe can use the second substitution and set <math>\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2} = xt + \\sqrt{2}</math>. Thus\n\n:<math>x = \\frac{1-2\\sqrt{2}t}{t^2+1} \\qquad dx = \\frac{2\\sqrt{2}t^2-2t-2\\sqrt{2}}{(t^2+1)^2} dt,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2} = \\frac{1-2\\sqrt{2t}}{t^2+1}t + \\sqrt{2} = \\frac{-\\sqrt{2}t^2+t+\\sqrt{2}}{t^2+1}</math>\n\nAccordingly, we obtain:\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\n\\int \\frac{  dx}{x\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}} &= \\int \\frac{\\frac{2\\sqrt{2}t^2-2t-2\\sqrt{2}}{(t^2+1)^2}}{\\frac{1-2\\sqrt{2}t}{t^2+1}\\frac{-\\sqrt{2}t^2+t+\\sqrt{2}}{t^2+1}}   dt \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\int\\!\\frac{-2}{-2\\sqrt{2}t+1}  dt = \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\int\\frac{-2\\sqrt{2}}{-2\\sqrt{2}t+1}  dt  \\\\[6pt]\n&= \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{2}}\\ln \\Biggl|2\\sqrt{2}t-1 \\Biggl|+C = \\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\ln \\Biggl|2\\sqrt{2}\\frac{\\sqrt{-x^2+x+2}}{x}-1 \\Biggl|+C\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n=== Examples for Euler's third substitution ===\nTo evaluate\n:<math>\\int\\! \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2}}\\ dx,</math> \nwe can use the third substitution and set <math>\\sqrt{-(x-2)(x-1)} = (x-2)t</math>. Thus\n\n:<math>x = \\frac{-2t^2-1}{-t^2-1} \\qquad \\ dx = \\frac{2t}{(-t^2-1)^2}\\,\\ dt,</math>\nand\n:<math>\\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2} = (x-2)t = \\frac{t}{-t^2-1.}</math>\n\nNext,\n:<math>\\int \\frac{x^2}{\\sqrt{-x^2+3x-2}}\\ dx = \\int\\frac{(\\frac{-2t^2-1}{-t^2-1})^2\\frac{2t}{(-t^2-1)^2}}{\\frac{t}{-t^2-1}}\\ dt = \\int\\frac{2(-2t^2-1)^2}{((-t^2-1)^2)^3}\\ dt.</math>\nAs we can see this is a rational function which can be solved using partial fractions.\n\n==Generalizations==\n\nThe substitutions of Euler can be generalized by allowing the use of imaginary numbers. For example, in the integral <math>\\textstyle \\int \\frac{  dx}{\\sqrt{-x^2 + c}}</math>, the substitution <math>\\sqrt{x^2 + c} = \\pm ix + t</math> can be used. Extensions to the complex numbers allows us to use every type of Euler substitution regardless of the coefficients on the quadratic.\n\nThe substitutions of Euler can be generalized to a larger class of functions. Consider integrals of the form\n\n: <math>\\int R_1\\Big(x, \\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\\Big) \\, \\log\\Big(R_2\\Big(x, \\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}\\Big)\\Big) \\,  dx,</math>\n\nwhere <math>R_1</math> and <math>R_2</math> are rational functions of <math>x</math> and <math>\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c}</math>. This integral can be transformed by the substitution <math>\\sqrt{ax^2 + bx + c} = \\sqrt{a} + xt</math> into another integral\n\n: <math>\\int \\tilde R_1(t) \\log\\big(\\tilde R_2(t)\\big) \\,  dt,</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\tilde R_1(t)</math> and <math>\\tilde R_2(t)</math> are now simply rational functions of <math>t</math>. In principle, [[factorization]] and [[partial fraction decomposition]] can be employed to break the integral down into simple terms, which can be integrated analytically through use of the [[dilogarithm]] function.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Zwillinger |first1=Daniel |title=The Handbook of Integration |publisher=Jones and Bartlett |location=1992 |isbn=978-0867202939 |pages=145\u2013146}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Mathematics}}\n* [[Integration by substitution]]\n* [[Trigonometric substitution]]\n* [[Tangent half-angle substitution|Weierstrass substitution]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{PlanetMath attribution|id=9681|title=Eulers Substitutions For Integration}}\n\n{{Integrals}}\n[[Category:Integral calculus]]\n", "name_user": "2409:4062:2118:a087:2c70:8df8:6b43:8355", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eEuler's first substitution:DnxxjxnkaoMxjvng Kfngifmfm Jfjfnsjskgnkhle boob)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler_substitution"}
