It stars [[Pierce Brosnan]], [[Luke Bracey]] and [[Olga Kurylenko]] with the screenplay written by Michael Finch and [[Karl Gajdusek]]. The film is directed by [[Roger Donaldson]], who previously worked with Brosnan on ''[[Dante's Peak]]''. The film was released on August 27, 2014 in the United States.\n\n==Plot==\nIn 2008, [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] agent Peter Devereaux supervises a young operative, David Mason, during a protective mission in [[Montenegro]]. Mason disobeys Devereaux's orders not to fire.  He shoots and kills an assassin but also kills a child. \n\nFive years later, Devereaux is retired in [[Lausanne]], [[Switzerland]]. His former boss, John Hanley, arrives and convinces him to extract Natalia Ulanova, the aide of [[President of Russia|Russian President]]-elect and former [[Russian Ground Forces|Army]] General Arkady Fedorov. Ulanova breaks into Fedorov's [[safe]] and copies old photos depicting his war crimes. She contacts the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] extraction team, and escapes. Fedorov alerts the [[Federal Security Service|FSB]], who pursue her through the streets of [[Moscow]] until Devereaux rescues her. She gives him a name, Mira Filipova, which he relays to Hanley. The CIA team, co-ordinated by Hanley, is unaware of Devereaux's presence. \n\nThe station chief, Perry Weinstein, gives the order to kill Ulanova, which Mason does. A dying Ulanova hands Devereaux her phone containing the photos. As the CIA team leaves the parking lot, Devereaux kills everyone in the squad until he faces Mason at gunpoint. The two separate without shooting. It is revealed that Devereaux and Ulanova were involved before. Hanley is detained for interrogation. \n\nMeanwhile,'' [[New York Times]]'' journalist Edgar Simpson tracks down refugee case worker Alice Fournier and requests her assistance to write an expos\u00e9 of Fedorov's war crimes during the [[Second Chechen War]]. Alexa, an assassin, arrives in [[Belgrade]], and finds out that Fournier will meet Simpson in a [[Coffeehouse|cafe]]. Devereaux also arrives in Belgrade, heads to Hanley's house and finds Fournier as Filipova's only known contact. He arrives at the cafe and rescues Fournier from both Alexa and Mason's team. \n\nFournier says that Filipova pretended to Federov to be mute. She actually spoke Russian and overheard Fedorov's conversations, including the '[[false flag]]' conspiracy to bomb a Russian Army building to initiate war and seizure of Chechen oil fields. A former Fedorov associate, Denisov, confirms the conspiracy and reveals the CIA's involvement. Devereaux sends Fournier away.\n\nFedorov arrives in Belgrade for an energy conference. Fournier meets Simpson at his apartment where Alexa attacks them and kills him; but Fournier escapes. Devereaux infiltrates the CIA site where Hanley is being held; and Hanley claims Weinstein aided Fedorov and reveals that Fournier is actually Filipova. Mason also discovers the real Fournier died years ago and Filipova stole her identity. Filipova, disguised as a [[Prostitution|prostitute]], goes to Fedorov's hotel room. It is revealed that her family was murdered in front of her by Federov, who raped her later. She surprises Federov but is unable to kill him. As he overpowers her, Devereaux ascends the stairs in the Hotel, shoots the bodyguards, and saves her. \n\nDevereaux interrogates Federov, demanding to know the name of the CIA operative involved in the operation. Federov, filmed by Filipova's phone, admits it was Hanley, not Weinstein; and Filipova confirms it. Mason arrives at the hotel but Devereaux and Filipova escape after he knocks out Mason and leaves him Fedorov's recorded confession. However, when Mason and Celia arrive in Langley to present the evidence, they realize that Weinstein has been replaced by Hanley. \n\nDevereaux calls Lucy, his and Ulanova's daughter; Hanley answers the phone, having kidnapped her. Devereaux convinces Filipova to go to a train station and wait for him. There, she goes to a public computer to write her story regarding Fedorov. Devereaux meets with Hanley and Mason, stating she will be waiting at a bus station. Mason is tasked to go and recover her. Alexa finds Filipova at the station; but is knocked unconscious by her, who returns, finishes typing and sends it to the press. Hanley reveals his intention to blackmail Federov after he becomes the President, forcing Russia to join [[NATO]] <nowiki/>against the [[Middle-East]]. Celia, Mason's CIA partner, finds the kidnappers' location and he rescues Lucy. He returns to Hanley and helps Devereaux kill Hanley's men and subdue Hanley. Devereaux unites with Lucy and Filipova and they leave on the train.\n\nLater, Filipova testifies at the [[International Criminal Court]] against Fedorov, annulling his candidacy. Fedorov is later shot in the head by an unknown sniper.\n\n==Cast==\n{{div col}}\n* [[Pierce Brosnan]] as Peter H.

C. Lubenow, ''The Cambridge Apsotles 1820-1914'', Cambridge University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the Apostles' nickname dates from the number, twelve, of their founders. Membership consists largely of undergraduates, though there have been graduate student members, and members who already hold university and college posts. The society traditionally drew most of its members from [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's]], [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]], [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] Colleges.\n\n==Activities and membership==\n[[File:KingsCollegeChapel.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[King's College, Cambridge]]]]\nThe society is essentially a discussion group. Meetings are held once a week, traditionally on Saturday evenings, during which one member gives a prepared talk on a topic, which is later thrown open for discussion.\n\nThe usual procedure was for members to meet at the rooms of those whose turn it was to present the topic. The host would provide refreshments consisting of coffee and sardines on toast, called \"whales\".<ref name=frances>[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeapostl00broogoog/page/n230 <!-- pg=1 --> Brookfield, Frances Mary. ''The Cambridge \"Apostles\"'', C. Scribner's Sons, 1907]</ref> Women first gained acceptance into the society in the 1970s.\n\nThe Apostles retain a leather diary of their membership (\"the book\") stretching back to its founder, which includes handwritten notes about the topics on which each member has spoken. It is included in the so-called \"Ark\", which is a cedar chest containing collection of papers with some handwritten notes from the group's early days, about the topics members have spoken on, and the results of the division in which those present voted on the debate. It was a point of honour that the question voted on should bear only a tangential relationship to the matter debated.<ref name=kings>[http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/archive-centre/archive-month/january-2011.html \"A Cambridge secret revealed: the Apostles\", King's College, Cambridge, January 2011]</ref> The members referred to as the \"Apostles\" are the active, usually undergraduate members; former members are called \"angels\". Undergraduates apply to become angels after graduating or being awarded a fellowship. Every few years, amid great secrecy, all the angels are invited to an Apostles' dinner at a Cambridge college. There used to be an annual dinner, usually held in London.\n\nUndergraduates being considered for membership are called \"embryos\" and are invited to \"embryo parties\", where members judge whether the student should be invited to join. The \"embryos\" attend these parties without knowing they are being considered for membership. Becoming an Apostle involves taking an oath of secrecy and listening to the reading of a curse, originally written by Apostle [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]], the theologian, in or around 1851.\n\nFormer members have spoken of the lifelong bond they feel toward one another. [[Henry Sidgwick]], the philosopher, wrote of the Apostles in his memoirs that \"the tie of attachment to this society is much the strongest corporate bond which I have known in my life.\"\n\nEleven former members of the Apostles are buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge : [[Henry Jackson (classicist)|Henry Jackson]], classicist (1863); Sir [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]], classicist (1859); [[Desmond MacCarthy]], newspaper critic (1896); Sir [[Donald MacAlister]], physician (1876); [[Norman McLean]], orientalist (1888), [[G. E. Moore]], philosopher (1894); [[Frank P. Ramsey]], economist and philosopher (1921); [[Gerald Shove]], economist (1909); [[Vincent Henry Stanton]], Professor of Divinity (1872), [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]], Classicist (1871), and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], philosopher (1912). These eleven members were from [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. Johns College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]. A twelfth member [[Benjamin Hall Kennedy]] is buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge]].\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]] joined as students, as did [[John Maynard Keynes]], who invited [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to join. However, Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness and style of humour.<ref>McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: A Life: Young Ludwig 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 118.</ref> He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of the discussion on the Hearth Rug; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.)\n\n==Bloomsbury==\nThe Apostles became well known outside Cambridge in the years before the [[First World War]] with the rise to eminence of the group of intellectuals known as the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Lytton Strachey]] and his brother [[James Strachey|James]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Rupert Brooke]] were all Apostles. Keynes, Woolf and Lytton Strachey subsequently gained prominence as members of Bloomsbury.\n\n==Cambridge spy ring==\n\n{{main|Cambridge Five}}\n\nThe Apostles came to public attention again following the exposure of the [[Cambridge Five|Cambridge spy ring]] in 1951. Three Cambridge graduates with access to the top levels of government in Britain, one of them a former Apostle, were eventually found to have passed information to the [[KGB]]. The three known agents were Apostle [[Guy Burgess]], an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officer and secretary to the deputy foreign minister; [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald MacLean]], foreign office secretary; and [[Kim Philby]], MI6 officer and journalist.\n\nIn 1963, American writer [[Michael Straight]], also an Apostle, and later publisher of ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine, admitted to a covert relationship with the Soviets, and he named [[Anthony Blunt]], [[MI5]] officer, director of the [[Courtauld Institute]], and art adviser to the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] as his recruiter and a Soviet spy. Confronted with Straight's confession, Blunt acknowledged his own treason and revealed that he had also drawn into espionage his fellow Apostle Leonard \"Leo\" Long. Straight also told investigators that the Apostle John Peter Astbury had been recruited for Soviet intelligence by either Blunt or Burgess. Leo Long confessed to delivering classified information to the Soviets from 1940 until 1952.\n\nWriters have accused several other Apostles of being witting Soviet agents. [[Roland Perry]] in his book, ''[[Roland Perry#The Fifth Man|The Fifth Man]]'' (London: Pan Books, 1994) makes a circumstantial case against [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild]], who was a friend to both Burgess and Blunt. The espionage historian John Costello in ''The Mask of Treachery'' (London: William Collins & Sons, 1988) points a finger at the mathematician [[Alister Watson]]. [[Kimberley Cornish]], in his controversial ''[[The Jew of Linz]]'' (London: Century, 1998), makes the rather extravagant claim that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was the \"[[\u00e9minence grise]]\" of the Cambridge spies.\n\nIn the 1930s when Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt were elected the membership was mainly [[Marxism|Marxist]]. Documents from the Soviet archives included in the book ''The Crown Jewels'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), by [[Nigel West]] and [[Oleg Tsarev]], indicate that it was Burgess who seduced and led Blunt into the Soviet underground. As the Queen's art adviser, Blunt was knighted in 1956, but was stripped of his [[knighthood]] in 1979 after [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] publicly named him as a spy&mdash;his confession having been kept secret before then.\n\n== Known members ==\n* [[Partha Dasgupta]], emeritus [[Frank P.

C. Lubenow, ''The Cambridge Apsotles 1820-1914'', Cambridge University Press, 1999.</ref>\n\nThe origin of the Apostles' nickname dates from the number, twelve, of their founders. Membership consists largely of undergraduates, though there have been graduate student members, and members who already hold university and college posts. The society traditionally drew most of its members from [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's]], [[St John's College, Cambridge|St John's]], [[Jesus College, Cambridge|Jesus]], [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]] and [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]] Colleges.\n\n==Activities and membership==\n[[File:KingsCollegeChapel.jpg|thumb|left|280px|[[King's College, Cambridge]]]]\nThe society is essentially a discussion group. Meetings are held once a week, traditionally on Saturday evenings, during which one member gives a prepared talk on a topic, which is later thrown open for discussion.\n\nThe usual procedure was for members to meet at the rooms of those whose turn it was to present the topic. The host would provide refreshments consisting of coffee and sardines on toast, called \"whales\".<ref name=frances>[https://archive.org/details/cambridgeapostl00broogoog/page/n230 <!-- pg=1 --> Brookfield, Frances Mary. ''The Cambridge \"Apostles\"'', C. Scribner's Sons, 1907]</ref> Women first gained acceptance into the society in the 1970s.\n\nThe Apostles retain a leather diary of their membership (\"the book\") stretching back to its founder, which includes handwritten notes about the topics on which each member has spoken. It is included in the so-called \"Ark\", which is a cedar chest containing collection of papers with some handwritten notes from the group's early days, about the topics members have spoken on, and the results of the division in which those present voted on the debate. It was a point of honour that the question voted on should bear only a tangential relationship to the matter debated.<ref name=kings>[http://www.kings.cam.ac.uk/archive-centre/archive-month/january-2011.html \"A Cambridge secret revealed: the Apostles\", King's College, Cambridge, January 2011]</ref> The members referred to as the \"Apostles\" are the active, usually undergraduate members; former members are called \"angels\". Undergraduates apply to become angels after graduating or being awarded a fellowship. Every few years, amid great secrecy, all the angels are invited to an Apostles' dinner at a Cambridge college. There used to be an annual dinner, usually held in London.\n\nUndergraduates being considered for membership are called \"embryos\" and are invited to \"embryo parties\", where members judge whether the student should be invited to join. The \"embryos\" attend these parties without knowing they are being considered for membership. Becoming an Apostle involves taking an oath of secrecy and listening to the reading of a curse, originally written by Apostle [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]], the theologian, in or around 1851.\n\nFormer members have spoken of the lifelong bond they feel toward one another. [[Henry Sidgwick]], the philosopher, wrote of the Apostles in his memoirs that \"the tie of attachment to this society is much the strongest corporate bond which I have known in my life.\"\n\nEleven former members of the Apostles are buried in the [[Ascension Parish Burial Ground, Cambridge|Parish of the Ascension Burial Ground]] in Cambridge : [[Henry Jackson (classicist)|Henry Jackson]], classicist (1863); Sir [[Richard Claverhouse Jebb]], classicist (1859); [[Desmond MacCarthy]], newspaper critic (1896); Sir [[Donald MacAlister]], physician (1876); [[Norman McLean]], orientalist (1888), [[G. E. Moore]], philosopher (1894); [[Frank P. Ramsey]], economist and philosopher (1921); [[Gerald Shove]], economist (1909); [[Vincent Henry Stanton]], Professor of Divinity (1872), [[Arthur Woollgar Verrall]], Classicist (1871), and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], philosopher (1912). These eleven members were from [[Christ's College, Cambridge|Christ's]], [[King's College, Cambridge|King's]], [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. Johns College]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity]]. A twelfth member [[Benjamin Hall Kennedy]] is buried in the [[Mill Road Cemetery, Cambridge]].\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] and [[G. E. Moore]] joined as students, as did [[John Maynard Keynes]], who invited [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] to join. However, Wittgenstein did not enjoy it and attended infrequently. Russell had been worried that Wittgenstein would not appreciate the group's unseriousness and style of humour.<ref>McGuinness, Brian. ''Wittgenstein: A Life: Young Ludwig 1889-1921''. University of California Press, 1988, p. 118.</ref> He was admitted in 1912 but resigned almost immediately because he could not tolerate the level of the discussion on the Hearth Rug; they took him back though in the 1920s when he returned to Cambridge. (He also had trouble tolerating the discussions in the Moral Sciences Club.)\n\n==Bloomsbury==\nThe Apostles became well known outside Cambridge in the years before the [[First World War]] with the rise to eminence of the group of intellectuals known as the [[Bloomsbury Group]]. [[John Maynard Keynes]], [[Leonard Woolf]], [[Lytton Strachey]] and his brother [[James Strachey|James]], [[G. E. Moore]], [[E. M. Forster]] and [[Rupert Brooke]] were all Apostles. Keynes, Woolf and Lytton Strachey subsequently gained prominence as members of Bloomsbury.\n\n==Cambridge spy ring==\n\n{{main|Cambridge Five}}\n\nThe Apostles came to public attention again following the exposure of the [[Cambridge Five|Cambridge spy ring]] in 1951. Three Cambridge graduates with access to the top levels of government in Britain, one of them a former Apostle, were eventually found to have passed information to the [[KGB]]. The three known agents were Apostle [[Guy Burgess]], an [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] officer and secretary to the deputy foreign minister; [[Donald Duart Maclean|Donald MacLean]], foreign office secretary; and [[Kim Philby]], MI6 officer and journalist.\n\nIn 1963, American writer [[Michael Straight]], also an Apostle, and later publisher of ''[[The New Republic]]'' magazine, admitted to a covert relationship with the Soviets, and he named [[Anthony Blunt]], [[MI5]] officer, director of the [[Courtauld Institute]], and art adviser to the [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen]] as his recruiter and a Soviet spy. Confronted with Straight's confession, Blunt acknowledged his own treason and revealed that he had also drawn into espionage his fellow Apostle Leonard \"Leo\" Long. Straight also told investigators that the Apostle John Peter Astbury had been recruited for Soviet intelligence by either Blunt or Burgess. Leo Long confessed to delivering classified information to the Soviets from 1940 until 1952.\n\nWriters have accused several other Apostles of being witting Soviet agents. [[Roland Perry]] in his book, ''[[Roland Perry#The Fifth Man|The Fifth Man]]'' (London: Pan Books, 1994) makes a circumstantial case against [[Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild]], who was a friend to both Burgess and Blunt. The espionage historian John Costello in ''The Mask of Treachery'' (London: William Collins & Sons, 1988) points a finger at the mathematician [[Alister Watson]]. [[Kimberley Cornish]], in his controversial ''[[The Jew of Linz]]'' (London: Century, 1998), makes the rather extravagant claim that [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] was the \"[[\u00e9minence grise]]\" of the Cambridge spies.\n\nIn the 1930s when Guy Burgess and Anthony Blunt were elected the membership was mainly [[Marxism|Marxist]]. Documents from the Soviet archives included in the book ''The Crown Jewels'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999), by [[Nigel West]] and [[Oleg Tsarev]], indicate that it was Burgess who seduced and led Blunt into the Soviet underground. As the Queen's art adviser, Blunt was knighted in 1956, but was stripped of his [[knighthood]] in 1979 after [[Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]] publicly named him as a spy&mdash;his confession having been kept secret before then.\n\n== Known members ==\n* [[Partha Dasgupta]], emeritus [[Frank P.

Dead zones are caused by oxygen-depleting factors which include, but are not limited to, human pollution (4). This is a process called eutrophication, where oxygen levels decrease as elements such nitrogen and phosphorus increase. A healthy river will have increased amounts of oxygen for consumption by organisms (1). As nitrogen increases, algae (5) produce large amounts of oxygen, but die from increased nitrogen. Decomposers then use all of the remaining oxygen decomposing the algae, resulting in no oxygen left and no oxygen being produced. (2).]]\n\nIn March 2004, when the recently established [[UN Environment Programme]] published its first [[UN Environment Programme|Global Environment Outlook Year Book]] (''GEO Year Book 2003''), it reported 146 dead zones in the world's oceans where [[marine life]] could not be supported due to depleted oxygen levels. Some of these were as small as a square kilometre (0.4&nbsp;mi\u00b2), but the largest dead zone covered 70,000 square kilometres (27,000&nbsp;mi\u00b2).

These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these [[phytoplankton]], a phenomenon known as an [[algal bloom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Limnologist]] Dr. [[David Schindler]], whose research at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, <blockquote>\"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem.

Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Other algae are consumed and thus do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. Dead zones can be caused by natural and by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.<ref name=\"msnbc\">[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/22301669 Corn boom could expand 'dead zone' in Gulf] NBC News.msn.com</ref>\n\nNotable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region,<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.\n\nAdditionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as [[fjords]] or the [[Black Sea]], have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed.<ref>Pickard, G.L. and Emery, W.J. 1982.

Studies conducted along the [[Gulf Coast]] of [[North America]] have shown hypoxic conditions lead to reduction of reproductive rates and growth rates in a variety of organisms including fish and benthic invertebrates. Organisms able to leave the area typically do so when oxygen concentrations decrease to less than 2 mg l<sup>-1</sup>.<ref name=\":04\" /> At these oxygen concentrations and below, organisms that survive inside the oxygen deficient environment and are unable to escape the area will often exhibit progressively worsening stress behavior and die. Surviving organisms tolerant of hypoxic conditions often exhibit physiological adaptations appropriate for persisting within hypoxic environments. Examples of such adaptations include increased efficiency of oxygen intake and use, lowering required amount of oxygen intake through reduced growth rates or dormancy, and increasing the usage of anaerobic metabolic pathways. <ref name=\":04\" />\n\nCommunity composition in benthic communities is dramatically disrupted by periodic oxygen depletion events, such as those of Seasonal Dead Zones and occurring as a result of [[Diel vertical migration|Diel Cycles]]. The longterm effects of such hypoxic conditions result in a shift in communities, most commonly manifest as a decrease in species diversity through mass mortality events. Reestablishment of benthic communities depend upon composition of adjacent communities for larval recruitment.<ref name=\":04\" /> This results in a shift towards faster establishing colonizers with shorter and more opportunistic life strategies, potentially disrupting historic benthic compositions.\n\nThe influence of dead zones on fisheries and other marine commercial activities varies by the length of occurrence and location. Dead zones are often accompanied by a decrease in biodiversity and collapse in benthic populations, lowering the diversity of yield in commercial fishing operations, but in cases of eutrophication-related dead zone formations, the increase in nutrient availability can lead to temporary rises in select yields among pelagic populations, such as [[Anchovy|Anchovies]].<ref name=\":04\" /> However, studies estimate that the increased production in the surrounding areas do not offset the net decrease in productivity resulting from the dead zone.

The results, reported 18 March 2008 in [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], showed that scaling up corn production to meet the {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3|adj=on}} goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10\u201318%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force ([[Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs]]), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink.<ref name=\"Potera, 2008\" />\n\n==Reversal==\nThe recovery of benthic communities is primarily dependent upon the length and severity of hypoxic conditions inside the hypoxic zone. Less severe conditions and temporary depletion of oxygen allow rapid recovery of benthic communities in the area due to reestablishment by benthic larvae from adjacent areas, with longer conditions of hypoxia and more severe oxygen depletion leading to longer reestablishment periods.<ref name=\":12\" /> Recovery also depends upon stratification levels within the area, so heavily stratified areas in warmer waters are less likely to recover from anoxic or hypoxic conditions in addition to being more susceptible to eutrophication driven hypoxia.<ref name=\":12\" /> The difference in recovery ability and susceptibility to hypoxia in stratified marine environments is expected to complicate recovery efforts of dead zones in the future if [[Effects of global warming on oceans|ocean warming]] continues.\n\nSmall scale hypoxic systems with rich surrounding communities are the most likely to recover after nutrient influxes leading to eutrophication stop. However, depending on the extent of damage and characteristics of the zone, large scale hypoxic condition could also potentially recover after a period of a decade. For example, the [[Black Sea]] dead zone, previously the largest in the world, largely disappeared between 1991 and 2001 after fertilizers became too costly to use following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] and the demise of centrally planned economies in [[Eastern Europe|Eastern]] and [[Central Europe]].

These chemicals are the fundamental building blocks of single-celled, plant-like organisms that live in the water column, and whose growth is limited in part by the availability of these materials. Eutrophication can lead to rapid increases in the density of certain types of these [[phytoplankton]], a phenomenon known as an [[algal bloom]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Limnologist]] Dr. [[David Schindler]], whose research at the [[Experimental Lakes Area]] led to the banning of harmful phosphates in detergents, warned about algal blooms and dead zones, <blockquote>\"The fish-killing blooms that devastated the Great Lakes in the 1960s and 1970s haven't gone away; they've moved west into an arid world in which people, industry, and agriculture are increasingly taxing the quality of what little freshwater there is to be had here....This isn't just a prairie problem.

Increase in input of nitrogen and phosphorus generally causes Cyanobacteria to bloom. Other algae are consumed and thus do not accumulate to the same extent as Cyanobacteria.{{citation needed|date=August 2019}} Cyanobacteria are not good food for zooplankton and fish and hence accumulate in water, die, and then decompose. The bacterial degradation of their biomass consumes the oxygen in the water, thereby creating the state of [[Hypoxia (environmental)|hypoxia]]. Dead zones can be caused by natural and by [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] factors. Natural causes include coastal upwelling and changes in wind and water circulation patterns. Use of chemical [[fertilizer]]s is considered the major human-related cause of dead zones around the world. Runoff from sewage, urban land use, and fertilizers can also contribute to eutrophication.<ref name=\"msnbc\">[https://www.nbcnews.com/id/22301669 Corn boom could expand 'dead zone' in Gulf] NBC News.msn.com</ref>\n\nNotable dead zones in the United States include the northern Gulf of Mexico region,<ref name=\"economist.com\"/> surrounding the outfall of the Mississippi River, the coastal regions of the Pacific Northwest, and the Elizabeth River in Virginia Beach, all of which have been shown to be recurring events over the last several years.\n\nAdditionally, natural oceanographic phenomena can cause deoxygenation of parts of the water column. For example, enclosed bodies of water, such as [[fjords]] or the [[Black Sea]], have shallow sills at their entrances, causing water to be stagnant there for a long time.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The eastern tropical Pacific Ocean and northern Indian Ocean have lowered oxygen concentrations which are thought to be in regions where there is minimal circulation to replace the oxygen that is consumed.<ref>Pickard, G.L. and Emery, W.J. 1982.

Studies conducted along the [[Gulf Coast]] of [[North America]] have shown hypoxic conditions lead to reduction of reproductive rates and growth rates in a variety of organisms including fish and benthic invertebrates. Organisms able to leave the area typically do so when oxygen concentrations decrease to less than 2 mg l<sup>-1</sup>.<ref name=\":04\" /> At these oxygen concentrations and below, organisms that survive inside the oxygen deficient environment and are unable to escape the area will often exhibit progressively worsening stress behavior and die. Surviving organisms tolerant of hypoxic conditions often exhibit physiological adaptations appropriate for persisting within hypoxic environments. Examples of such adaptations include increased efficiency of oxygen intake and use, lowering required amount of oxygen intake through reduced growth rates or dormancy, and increasing the usage of anaerobic metabolic pathways. <ref name=\":04\" />\n\nCommunity composition in benthic communities is dramatically disrupted by periodic oxygen depletion events, such as those of Seasonal Dead Zones and occurring as a result of [[Diel vertical migration|Diel Cycles]]. The longterm effects of such hypoxic conditions result in a shift in communities, most commonly manifest as a decrease in species diversity through mass mortality events. Reestablishment of benthic communities depend upon composition of adjacent communities for larval recruitment.<ref name=\":04\" /> This results in a shift towards faster establishing colonizers with shorter and more opportunistic life strategies, potentially disrupting historic benthic compositions.\n\nThe influence of dead zones on fisheries and other marine commercial activities varies by the length of occurrence and location. Dead zones are often accompanied by a decrease in biodiversity and collapse in benthic populations, lowering the diversity of yield in commercial fishing operations, but in cases of eutrophication-related dead zone formations, the increase in nutrient availability can lead to temporary rises in select yields among pelagic populations, such as [[Anchovy|Anchovies]].<ref name=\":04\" /> However, studies estimate that the increased production in the surrounding areas do not offset the net decrease in productivity resulting from the dead zone.

The results, reported 18 March 2008 in [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]], showed that scaling up corn production to meet the {{convert|15|e9USgal|m3|adj=on}} goal would increase nitrogen loading in the Dead Zone by 10\u201318%. This would boost nitrogen levels to twice the level recommended by the Mississippi Basin/Gulf of Mexico Water Nutrient Task Force ([[Mississippi River Watershed Conservation Programs]]), a coalition of federal, state, and tribal agencies that have monitored the dead zone since 1997. The task force says a 30% reduction of nitrogen runoff is needed if the dead zone is to shrink.<ref name=\"Potera, 2008\" />\n\n==Reversal==\nThe recovery of benthic communities is primarily dependent upon the length and severity of hypoxic conditions inside the hypoxic zone.
