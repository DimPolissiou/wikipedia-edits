NASA found that only 11 of the 923 applicants were qualified, and hired all.\n\nWhen the group reported to the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], Slayton told them that \"We don't need you around here\". He offered to accept their resignations, and promised ground assignments if they did not quit, but warned them to not fool themselves that they would soon fly in space. With self-deprecation, the men named themselves the \"XS-11\", or \"Excess Eleven\".\n\nThe group would be the last group selected by NASA for over a decade. The seven members who stayed with NASA after the Apollo Program ended went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] [[mission specialist]]s, accomplishing a total of 15 flights between 1982 and 1996.\n\n== Background ==\nBy 1967, [[NASA]] had ambitious plans for the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (AAP) that would follow the [[Apollo program]]. These called for Apollo hardware to be used to create space stations in Earth and lunar orbit, the development of a [[space shuttle]] to service them, and further visits to the Moon, as many as six a year, leading to the establishment of permanent bases there. Plans called for no less than 45 crewed missions, utilizing 19 [[Saturn V]] and 26 [[Saturn IB]] rockets. There would be three orbital workshops, three orbital laboratories and four [[Apollo Telescope Mount]]s. The first AAP launch was expected to occur as early as April 1968 if the Moon landing went well. Each orbital laboratory was expected to be visited by two or three crews. To carry out this program, the nineteen pilot [[astronaut]]s of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] had been selected in 1966. NASA also decided to augment [[NASA Astronaut Group 4]], the scientist astronauts selected in 1965, with a second intake of scientist astronauts.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=172, 201\u2013202}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=117\u2013118}}<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite magazine |first=David S.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had proposed that NASA's budget be increased to $5.1 billion, of which $455 million was for the AAP. But the [[Apollo 1]] fire on January 27, 1967, had shaken faith in NASA, and the cost of the [[Vietnam War]] was inexorably rising. NASA's appropriation was cut to $4.59 billion, with AAP receiving only $122 million.<ref name=\"Wired\" />When the eleven new astronauts reported for duty on September 18, 1967, they were met by Shepard and Slayton.  In his welcome address to the newcomers, Slayton was blunt: {{quote|I might as well warn you troops that you won't be seeing any action for quite some time. We've been receiving word from Washington that the budget in the post-Apollo Program will be severely cut again next year and many flights will have to be postponed or scrapped. And it looks like things aren't going to get any better for a long time. Although we'd like to put all of you into space some time, we can't guarantee it, so you may as well face the prospect of long delays and perhaps no flights. We don't need you around here, at least for the time being. I'm saying this just so you'd understand. No bearing this in mind, any of you who feels like he doesn't want to hack this can walk out of the room right now. You'll be a free man an there'll be no misgivings either way.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|pp=80\u201381}} }}\n\nThe new astronaut group started calling themselves the Excess Eleven or XS-11.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|p=82}} Assignments for the group were further delayed by the requirement to complete a full year of [[US Air Force]] [[Undergraduate Pilot Training]] to become qualified as jet pilots like the [[NASA Astronaut Group 4|Group 4]] scientists before them. But first there was five months of classroom training, 330 hours of instruction, mainly in the form of lectures and field trips. Many of these were delivered by the astronauts themselves, and there was even a guest lecture on exobiology by [[Carl Sagan]]. Normally, there were two lectures per day of two hours duration, with afternoons and every other Friday free to allow the new scientist astronauts to pursue personal projects.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=171\u2013173}}\n\nThe next phase of their training was flight training. Only Chapman had a private pilot's license, and of the rest only Musgrave had flown a plane before. None had flown jets. While the Excess Eleven had hoped that it would be possible for them to undergo it together, this was considered impractical, as the US Air Force's training facilities were stretched by the needs of the war in Vietnam. Instead they were sent to several different flight schools in Arizona, Oklahoma and Texas.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=181\u2013182}} Training commenced with six weeks in the piston engine [[Cessna T-41 Mescalero]], then moved on to twenty in the subsonic jet [[Cessna T-37 Tweet]], and finally to twenty-seven weeks in the [[Northrop T-38 Talon]], the aircraft they would be flying for NASA.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|pp=184\u2013185}} By this time four astronauts had been killed in accidents involving the T-38.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|p=162}}\n\nAbout a third of each flight school class flunked, were dropped because they developed a fear of flying, or quit, usually because they discovered that they did like flying.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|p=190}} The response of the scientist astronauts was mixed.

A new role, the mission scientist, was created as an interface between the crew and the scientific community, as scientific aspects became more important with the later Apollo missions. The first so designated was England on [[Apollo 13]], although owing to the abort of the mission, he was not called upon to perform the role. Starting with Apollo 14, the mission scientist was p[art of the support crew. Chapman served in the role on [[Apollo 14]], Allen on [[Apollo 15]], England on [[Apollo 16]] and Parker on [[Apollo 17]].

NASA found that only 11 of the 923 applicants were qualified, and hired all.\n\nWhen the group reported to the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]], Slayton told them that \"We don't need you around here\". He offered to accept their resignations, and promised ground assignments if they did not quit, but warned them to not fool themselves that they would soon fly in space. With self-deprecation, the men named themselves the \"XS-11\", or \"Excess Eleven\".\n\nThe group would be the last group selected by NASA for over a decade. The seven members who stayed with NASA after the Apollo Program ended went on to form the core of early [[Space Shuttle]] [[mission specialist]]s, accomplishing a total of 15 flights between 1982 and 1996.\n\n== Background ==\nBy 1967, [[NASA]] had ambitious plans for the [[Apollo Applications Program]] (AAP) that would follow the [[Apollo program]]. These called for Apollo hardware to be used to create space stations in Earth and lunar orbit, the development of a [[space shuttle]] to service them, and further visits to the Moon, as many as six a year, leading to the establishment of permanent bases there. Plans called for no less than 45 crewed missions, utilizing 19 [[Saturn V]] and 26 [[Saturn IB]] rockets. There would be three orbital workshops, three orbital laboratories and four [[Apollo Telescope Mount]]s. The first AAP launch was expected to occur as early as April 1968 if the Moon landing went well. Each orbital laboratory was expected to be visited by two or three crews. To carry out this program, the nineteen pilot [[astronaut]]s of [[NASA Astronaut Group 5]] had been selected in 1966. NASA also decided to augment [[NASA Astronaut Group 4]], the scientist astronauts selected in 1965, with a second intake of scientist astronauts.{{sfn|Slayton|Cassutt|1994|pp=172, 201-202}}{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=117-118}}<ref name=\"Wired\">{{cite magazine |first=David S.

[[President of the United States|President]] [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] had proposed that NASA's budget be increased to $5.1 billion, of which $455 million was for the AAP. But the [[Apollo 1]] fire on January 27, 1967, had shaken faith in NASA, and the cost of the [[Vietnam War]] was inexorably rising. NASA's appropriation was cut to $4.59 billion, with AAP receiving only $122 million.<ref name=\"Wired\" />When the eleven new astronauts reported for duty on September 18, 1967, they were met by Shepard and Slayton.  In his welcome address to the newcomers, Slayton was blunt: {{quote|I might as well warn you troops that you won't be seeing any action for quite some time. We've been receiving word from Washington that the budget in the post-Apollo Program will be severely cut again next year and many flights will have to be postponed or scrapped. And it looks like things aren't going to get any better for a long time. Although we'd like to put all of you into space some time, we can't guarantee it, so you may as well face the prospect of long delays and perhaps no flights. We don't need you around here, at least for the time being. I'm saying this just so you'd understand. No bearing this in mind, any of you who feels like he doesn't want to hack this can walk out of the room right now. You'll be a free man an there'll be no misgivings either way.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|pp=80-81}} }}\n\nThe new astronaut group started calling themselves the Excess Eleven or XS-11.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|p=82}} Assignments for the group were further delayed by the requirement to complete a full year of [[US Air Force]] [[Undergraduate Pilot Training]] to become qualified as jet pilots like the [[NASA Astronaut Group 4|Group 4]] scientists before them. But first there was five months of classroom training, 330 hours of instruction, mainly in the form of lectures and field trips. Many of these were delivered by the astronauts themselves, and there was even a guest lecture on exobiology by [[Carl Sagan]]. Normally, there were two lectures per day of two hours duration, with afternoons and every other Friday free to allow the new scientist astronauts to pursue personal projects.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=171-173}}\n\nThe next phase of their training was flight training. Only Chapman had a private pilot's license, and of the rest only Musgrave had flown a plane before. None had flown jets. While the Excess Eleven had hoped that it would be possible for them to undergo it together, this was considered impractical, as the US Air Force's training facilities were stretched by the needs of the war in Vietnam. Instead they were sent to several different flight schools in Arizona, Oklahoma and Texas.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=181-182}} Training commenced with six weeks in the piston engine [[Cessna T-41 Mescalero]], then moved on to twenty in the subsonic jet [[Cessna T-37 Tweet]], and finally to twenty-seven weeks in the [[Northrop T-38 Talon]], the aircraft they would be flying for NASA.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|pp=184-185}} By this time four astronauts had been killed in accidents involving the T-38.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|p=162}}\n\nAbout a third of each flight school class flunked, were dropped because they developed a fear of flying, or quit, usually because they discovered that they did like flying.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|p=190}} The response of the scientist astronauts was mixed. Chapman found they he really enjoyed flying, especially in the T-38. Musgrave and Allen topped their classes, and Chapman came second in his.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=182-185}} O'Leary objected to the hazards of flight training, and after a month of flight training at [[Williams Air Force Base]] and two solo flights that he did not like flying. On April 22 he informed a sympathetic Slayton that he had decided to resign from the Astronaut Corps.{{sfn|O'Leary|1970|pp=198-199}} On August 23, NASA announced that Llewellyn had also tended his resignation after completing the first phase of flight training at [[Reese Air Force Base]].{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=182-185}}  \n\nThe final phase of their astronaut training involved [[scuba diving]] training with the Navy at the [[Naval Air Station Key West]], desert survival training at [[Fairchild Air Force Base]] in [[Pasco, Washington]], jungle survival training at [[Albrook Air Force Base]] in Panama, and water survival training at [[Pensacola Naval Air Station]] in Florida.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=185-188}}\n\n== Operations ==\nAfter completing their training, the XS-11 were divided between Apollo and AAP, with Allen, Chapman, England, Henize and Parker assigned to Apollo. A new role, the mission scientist, was created as an interface between the crew and the scientific community, as scientific aspects became more important with the later Apollo missions. The first so designated was England on [[Apollo 13]], although owing to the abort of the mission, he was not called upon to perform the role. Starting with Apollo 14, the mission scientist was p[art of the support crew. Chapman served in the role on [[Apollo 14]], Allen on [[Apollo 15]], England on [[Apollo 16]] and Parker on [[Apollo 17]]. In addition Henize and Parker also served on the Apollo 15 support crew, and Chapman on that of Apollo 16.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=210-212}}{{sfn|Orloff |2000|p=271}}\n\nHolmquest, Lenoir, Musgrave and Thornton were assigned to [[Skylab]], as AAP was renamed on February 17, 1970).{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=252-253}}  Musgrave (who cultivated a notable passion for flying, eventually accumulating over 17,700 hours in 160 different types of civilian and military aircraft)<ref name=\"Musgrave\"/> and Lenoir were the first members of the group to secure potential flight assignments as backup Science Pilots in the Skylab Program.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=256-257}} However Skylab B was cancelled and Skylab A abandoned in place after only three missions were flown.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=279-281}}\n\nChapman and Holmquest left the program in July 1972 due to the paucity of flight opportunities.<ref name=\"Chapman\"/><ref name=\"Holmquest\"/> England transferred to the [[United States Geological Survey]] in 1972 before rejoining the Astronaut Corps for a second nine-year stint in 1979.<ref name=\"England\"/> Allen also returned to active duty with the Astronaut Office in 1978 after a stint as director of Legislative Affairs at NASA Headquarters in Washington, DC, returning one day before the [[Thirty-Five New Guys]] arrived in order to secure his seniority. Holmquest also requested permission to return in October 1979, but his request was denied.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=332-334}}   The requirement for scientists to be trained as jet pilots was lifted with the creation of the [[Mission Specialist]] position in the [[Space Shuttle program]] in 1978.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=328-329}}\n\nThe seven remaining members of the Excess Eleven all went on to fly at least one Space Shuttle mission. Allen was the first, flying on  [[STS-5]] in {{OV|102|full=no}} in November 1982, fifteen years after he had been selected as an astronaut. Parker, Allen and Thornton flew two missions, and Musgrave ultimately flew six, the last being in 1996. He also carried out four [[extravehicular activities]], totally 26 hours and 19 minutes, and flew on all five space shuttles.{{sfn|Shayler|Burgess|2007|pp=506-509}}\n\n== Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=O'Leary |first=Brian |author-link=Brian O'Leary |title=The Making of an Ex-Astronaut |year=1970 |publisher=Michael Joseph |location=London |isbn=978-0-7181-0849-6 |oclc=500293846 |ref=harv }}\n* {{cite book |last=Orloff |first=Richard W. |title=Apollo by the Numbers: A Statistical Reference |series=NASA History Series |year= 2000 |publisher=NASA |location=Washington, DC |isbn=978-0-16-050631-4 |oclc=44775012 |id=SP-2000-4029 |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4029.pdf |access-date=March 30, 2020  |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=Shayler |first1=David J. |last2=Burgess |first2=Colin |author2-link = Colin Burgess (author) |title = NASA's Scientist Astronauts |publisher=Praxis Publishing  |isbn=978-0-387-21897-7 |oclc=1058309996 |year=2007 |ref=harv }}\n\n* {{cite book |last1=Slayton |first1=Donald K. \"Deke\" |author1-link=Deke Slayton |last2=Cassutt |first2=Michael |authorlink2=Michael Cassutt |title=Deke!

He defeated Atlanta area native Romjue in the general election of 1942.\n\n==External links==\n* [http://dl.mospace.umsystem.edu/mu/islandora/object/mu%3A138699 Historic Sanborn Map of Atlanta (1918)] from [[University of Missouri System|University of Missouri]] Digital Library\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Macon County, Missouri}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Cities in Missouri]]\n[[Category:Cities in Macon County, Missouri]]\n[[Category:1858 establishments in Missouri]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox settlement\n|official_name            = Atlanta, Missouri\n|settlement_type          = [[City]]\n|nickname                 = \n|motto                    =\n\n<!-- Images -->\n|image_skyline            = \n|imagesize                = \n|image_caption            = \n|image_flag               = \n|image_seal               =\n\n<!-- Maps -->\n|image_map = Macon_County_Missouri_Incorporated_and_Unincorporated_areas_Atlanta_Highlighted.svg\n|mapsize                  = 250px\n|map_caption              = Location of Atlanta, Missouri\n|image_map1               = \n|mapsize1                 = \n|map_caption1             =\n\n<!-- Location -->\n|subdivision_type         = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n|subdivision_name         = United States\n|subdivision_type1        = [[U.S. state|State]]\n|subdivision_name1        = [[Missouri]]\n|subdivision_type2        = [[List of counties in Missouri|County]]\n|subdivision_name2        = [[Macon County, Missouri|Macon]]\n|government_footnotes     = \n|government_type          = \n|leader_title             = \n|leader_name              = \n|leader_title1            = \n|leader_name1             = \n|established_title        = \n|established_date         =\n\n<!-- Area -->\n|unit_pref                = Imperial\n|area_footnotes           = <ref name=\"CenPopGazetteer2016\">{{cite web|title=2017 U.S. Gazetteer Files|url=https://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/2017_Gazetteer/2017_gaz_place_29.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=Jan 10, 2019}}</ref>\n|area_magnitude           = \n|area_total_km2           = 0.89\n|area_land_km2            = 0.89\n|area_water_km2           = 0.00\n|area_total_sq_mi         = 0.34\n|area_land_sq_mi          = 0.34\n|area_water_sq_mi         = 0.00\n\n<!-- Population -->\n|population_as_of         = [[2010 United States Census|2010]]\n|population_est           = 372\n|pop_est_as_of            = 2018\n|population_footnotes     = <ref name =\"FactFinder\"/>\n|population_total         = 385\n|population_density_km2   = 422.86\n|population_density_sq_mi = 1096.49\n\n<!-- General information -->\n|timezone                 = [[North American Central Time Zone|Central (CST)]]\n|utc_offset               = -6\n|timezone_DST             = CDT\n|utc_offset_DST           = -5\n|elevation_footnotes      = \n|elevation_m              = 275\n|elevation_ft             = 902\n|coordinates              = {{coord|39|53|57|N|92|28|49|W|region:US_type:city|display=inline,title}}\n|postal_code_type         = [[ZIP code]]\n|postal_code              = 63530\n|area_code                = [[Area code 660|660]]\n|blank_name               = [[Federal Information Processing Standard|FIPS code]]\n|blank_info               = 29-02422<ref name=\"GR2\">{{cite web|url=http://factfinder2.census.gov |publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]] |accessdate=2008-01-31 |title=American FactFinder |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130911234518/http://factfinder2.census.gov/ |archivedate=2013-09-11 }}</ref>\n|blank1_name              = [[Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] feature ID\n|blank1_info              = 0713468<ref name=\"GR3\">{{cite web|url=http://geonames.usgs.gov|accessdate=2008-01-31|title=US Board on Geographic Names|publisher=[[United States Geological Survey]]|date=2007-10-25}}</ref>\n|website                  = \n|footnotes                = \n|pop_est_footnotes = <ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\"/>\n}}\n'''Atlanta''' is a city in [[Macon County, Missouri|Macon County]], [[Missouri]], United States.

Founded by Peter Loughrey in 1992, LAMA especially champions Modern and Contemporary works by [[California]] and West Coast artists and designers. \n\nAuctions are held three times a year in [[Van Nuys|Van Nuys, CA]] and feature a wide range of material including [[painting]], [[photography]], [[prints]], [[sculpture]], [[ceramics]], [[furniture]], [[jewelry]], and [[lighting]]. Since LAMA\u2019s first auction, held at Loughrey\u2019s Bedrock Gallery on La Brea Ave. on October 10, 1992, the boutique auction house has carved a niche in the international market with milestone auctions dedicated to individual designers [[Charles and Ray Eames]], [[Paul Laszlo]], and [[R.M. Schindler]], among others.<ref>Connie Koenenn (October 1999), [http://articles.latimes.com/1999/oct/14/news/cl-22003 Thoroughly Modern Milieu], LA Times. Retrieved 01-21-2010.</ref> LAMA has set dozens of world auction records, including many for works by California artists and designers such as [[Peter Alexander]], [[Ruth Asawa]], [[Larry Bell]], [[Chris Burden]], [[Jay DeFeo]], [[Lorser Feitelson]], [[Mike Kelley]], [[Vasa Mihich]], [[Ken Price]], [[Ed Ruscha]], and [[De Wain Valentine]]. \n\n{{TOC left}}\n\n==History: 1990s==\n\nPeter Loughrey opened a vintage furniture gallery, \"Bedrock,\" in October 1989 and, three years later, founded Los Angeles Modern Auctions (LAMA). The company's first auction occurred on October 10, 1992, featuring 150 lots. In 1993, Mr. Loughrey chose to close the gallery and moved to London in order to continue his education at Sotheby's Institute of Art. There he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark Man Ray auction at Sotheby's, London.\n\nIn 1995, Peter married Shannon Carragher and the two re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. On May 18, 1996 Peter and Shannon conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss|Eric Owen Moss 'Samitaur' building]] in Culver City, California. Five months later, on October 27, 1996 they held an additional auction at the Chait Gallery in Beverly Hills. \n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. This same year, the auction house acquired more than 500 [[Eames: The Architect and the Painter|Eames]] leg splints from an army surplus, and distributed them via MoMA and MOCA gift stores. \n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. First, it was featured in an article on antiques by Wendy Moonan in ''The New York Times,'' which stated: \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> Additionally, www.lamodern.com was launched on February 2nd of the same year, thereby increasing the visibility and accessibility of the company.  To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was given the honor of interviewing [[Pierre Koenig]] for Echoes Magazine, an architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]]. \n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the modern art and design markets. 'Modern Monthly' auctions were held, where the average lot was under $500. The goal of these auctions was to reach young collectors with accessible prices. This same year, LAMA was chosen by [[ARCO]] (\u201cAtlantic Ritchfield Corporation\u201d) to liquidate the company's fine art corporate collection. This was the first major fine art commission for the auction house. More notable, perhaps, was LAMA\u2019s achievement of a world record for a Charles Eames & Eero Saarinen \"Conversation\" prototype, designed in 1941. The price realized for the piece was $129,000, a world record at the time for a design by Eames.\n\n==History: 2000 to 2010==\n\nThe new millennium saw major growth for Los Angeles Modern Auctions. Peter Loughrey was included in [[Art+Auction|Art & Auction]]'s \"Power Issue,\" the publication's annual survey of the art world's most powerful people. After achieving the record price for Eames in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity to auction a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes. These pieces were handmade by Eames and were from the collection of John and Marilyn Newhart, who authored ''Eames Design- the Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames.'' \n\nIn 2002, [[Playboy Enterprises]] chose LAMA to conduct the first ever auction of items from the magazine's archive while Peter and Shanon were employed at [[Butterfields]].  During the same year, LAMA organized the  first auction dedicated to a single collection, that of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd-- also while at Butterfield's. The success of the corporate and single owner sale further solidified LAMA's place in the modern art and design field. \n\nPeter Loughrey signed on with [[Antiques Roadshow]] in 2003 to be an appraiser for the PBS show. This relationship has continued to today, as Peter continues to featured on program. \n\nTwo more world records were achieved at LAMA in 2004, when works by George Nakashima achieved prices over $100,000. To this day, Nakashima is a regular feature in LAMA auctions. This same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Peter to co-curate, 'Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration.' This show featured the work of the Italian designer, architect and artist who also continues to be a regular feature in LAMA sales. In 2005, ACME and Peter co-curated another show, \"Dutch Design\".  On May 22, 2005 a series of pieces by Laszlo were featured in the LAMA auction, making it the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at one time. \n\nDuring the June 3, 2007 sale, LAMA established a new world record price for \"Marilyn\" (#28) by Andy Warhol, realizing $144,000. This great achievement was soon followed by the October 14 sale in which \"Car Hood\" by Judy Chicago realized $288,000.\n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale in which the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection were auctioned. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!. Also in 2008, Peter and Shannon chose to leave their West Hollywood location to move their current location in Van Nuys, California.  \n\n==LAMA Auction Process==\n\nThe auction process at Los Angeles Modern Auctions is similar to that of other auction houses. For those interested in consigning work to LAMA, there are a few simple steps:\n\n1. Submit Material: Email or mail images and item descriptions of the works. Also, one can make an appointment to bring the works to the showroom if that is more convenient. \n\n2.

The company's first auction occurred on October 10, 1992, featuring 150 lots. In 1993, Mr. Loughrey chose to close the gallery and moved to London in order to continue his education at Sotheby's Institute of Art. There he apprenticed in the Vintage Automobile Department and worked as a porter in the landmark Man Ray auction at Sotheby's, London.\n\nIn 1995, Peter married Shannon Carragher and the two re-opened Los Angeles Modern Auctions. On May 18, 1996 Peter and Shannon conducted their first joint auction at the [[Eric Owen Moss|Eric Owen Moss 'Samitaur' building]] in Culver City, California. Five months later, on October 27, 1996 they held an additional auction at the Chait Gallery in Beverly Hills. \n\nHaving built a reputation for expertise in the field of modernist design, LAMA was chosen to liquidate the Silver Lake architectural offices of [[Richard Neutra]]. This same year, the auction house acquired more than 500 [[Eames: The Architect and the Painter|Eames]] leg splints from an army surplus, and distributed them via MoMA and MOCA gift stores. \n\n1998 was a pivotal year for LAMA. First, it was featured in an article on antiques by Wendy Moonan in ''The New York Times,'' which stated: \"The definition of antiques is changing daily, and, as usual, Los Angeles sets the trends.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/16/arts/antiques.html|title=ANTIQUES|last=Moonan|first=Wendy|date=1998-10-16|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-10-19}}</ref> Additionally, www.lamodern.com was launched on February 2nd of the same year, thereby increasing the visibility and accessibility of the company.  To cap off an already important year, Peter Loughrey was given the honor of interviewing [[Pierre Koenig]] for Echoes Magazine, an architect best known for his work on the famed [[Case Study Houses]]. \n\nBy 1999, LAMA had established itself as an important player in the modern art and design markets. 'Modern Monthly' auctions were held, where the average lot was under $500. The goal of these auctions was to reach young collectors with accessible prices. This same year, LAMA was chosen by [[ARCO]] (\u201cAtlantic Ritchfield Corporation\u201d) to liquidate the company's fine art corporate collection. This was the first major fine art commission for the auction house. More notable, perhaps, was LAMA\u2019s achievement of a world record for a Charles Eames & Eero Saarinen \"Conversation\" prototype, designed in 1941. The price realized for the piece was $129,000, a world record at the time for a design by Eames.\n\n==History: 2000 to 2010==\n\nThe new millennium saw major growth for Los Angeles Modern Auctions. Peter Loughrey was included in [[Art+Auction|Art & Auction]]'s \"Power Issue,\" the publication's annual survey of the art world's most powerful people. After achieving the record price for Eames in 1999, LAMA was given the opportunity to auction a selection of rare examples by the designer including \"DCW\" prototypes. These pieces were handmade by Eames and were from the collection of John and Marilyn Newhart, who authored ''Eames Design- the Work of the Office of Charles and Ray Eames.'' \n\nIn 2002, [[Playboy Enterprises]] chose LAMA to conduct the first ever auction of items from the magazine's archive while Peter and Shanon were employed at [[Butterfields]].  During the same year, LAMA organized the  first auction dedicated to a single collection, that of Michael and Gabrielle Boyd-- also while at Butterfield's. The success of the corporate and single owner sale further solidified LAMA's place in the modern art and design field. \n\nPeter Loughrey signed on with [[Antiques Roadshow]] in 2003 to be an appraiser for the PBS show. This relationship has continued to today, as Peter continues to featured on program. \n\nTwo more world records were achieved at LAMA in 2004, when works by George Nakashima achieved prices over $100,000. To this day, Nakashima is a regular feature in LAMA auctions. This same year, ACME Gallery in Los Angeles asked Peter to co-curate, 'Gio Ponti: Furnished Settings & Figuration.' This show featured the work of the Italian designer, architect and artist who also continues to be a regular feature in LAMA sales. In 2005, ACME and Peter co-curated another show, \"Dutch Design\".  On May 22, 2005 a series of pieces by Laszlo were featured in the LAMA auction, making it the largest and most comprehensive Laszlo commission to ever surface for sale at one time. \n\nDuring the June 3, 2007 sale, LAMA established a new world record price for \"Marilyn\" (#28) by Andy Warhol, realizing $144,000. This great achievement was soon followed by the October 14 sale in which \"Car Hood\" by Judy Chicago realized $288,000.\n\nIn 2008, LAMA conducted its first house sale in which the entire contents of the Linda Sullivan collection were auctioned. This same year, LAMA was featured in Forbes' SOLD!. Also in 2008, Peter and Shannon chose to leave their West Hollywood location to move their current location in Van Nuys, California.  \n\n==LAMA Auction Process==\n\nThe auction process at Los Angeles Modern Auctions is similar to that of other auction houses. For those interested in consigning work to LAMA, there are a few simple steps:\n\n1. Submit Material: Email or mail images and item descriptions of the works. Also, one can make an appointment to bring the works to the showroom if that is more convenient. \n\n2. Receive Auction Estimate: Once the specialists review the items, they will establish an auction estimate based upon the current market value of the work. This estimate is free of charge. \n\n3. Establish a Commission Structure: A commission is a flat percentage based on the total value of the consignment. This is an all-inclusive fee which includes all listing fees, advertising and promotional material. \n\n\n==World Records==\n\nSince the company's founding in 1992, LAMA has achieved several world records at auction for works of fine art and design.  \n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|-\n!Sale Date!!Artist!!Title!!Price Realized!!Record\n|-\n|Oct. 2016||Jay DeFeo||''Apex'' ||$281,250||Any work by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Feb. 2016||Mary Corse||''Copper-Four Crosses''||$100,000||Any work by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Feb. 2016||John Lautner||Floor Lamp||$43,750||Any design at auction\n|-\n|Feb. 2016||James Gill||''Infinite Regress DNA''||$22,500||Any work by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Ed Ruscha||''Double Standard''||$206,250||Any print by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Mike Kelley||''Nazi War Cave #1''||$740,000||Any work on paper by the artist at auction\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Robert Mapplethorpe||''Self Portrait''||$87,500||New record for the edition\n|-\n|Oct. 2014||Maria Pergay||Flying Carpet, daybed||$162,500||New record for the design at auction\n|-\n|May 2010||Francois-Xavier Lalanne||''Singes Attentifs SI & SII''||$199,062.50||New record for 'Monkeys' at auction\n|-\n|June 2007||Andy Warhol||''Marilyn (#28)''||$144,000||New record for ''Marilyn'' series by Warhol\n|-\n|May 1999||Charles Eames & Eero Saarinen||\"Conversation\" prototype\narmchair\n||$129,000||New record for this design at auction\n|}\n\n==Awards==\n\nThe Printing Industries of America recognized LAMA in 2012 for its May 6, 2012 Modern Art & Design Auction catalog as the \"Best Services Catalog\". \n\n==Television==\n\nPeter Loughrey is a repeat appraiser on PBS's [[Antiques Roadshow]].

The stake marking the founding of \"Terminus\" was driven into the ground in 1837 (called the [[Atlanta Zero Mile Post|Zero Mile Post]]). In 1839, homes and a store were built there and the settlement grew.  Between 1845 and 1854, rail lines arrived from four different directions, and the rapidly growing town quickly became the rail hub for the entire [[Southern United States]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Atlanta, as a distribution hub, became the target of a [[Atlanta Campaign|major Union campaign]], and in 1864, Union [[William Sherman]]'s troops set on fire and destroyed the city's assets and buildings, save churches and hospitals. After the war, the population grew rapidly, as did manufacturing, while the city retained its role as a rail hub. Coca-Cola was launched here in 1886 and grew into an Atlanta-based world empire. Electric streetcars arrived in 1889,<ref>Carson, O.E., ''The Trolley Titans'', [[Interurban Press]], Glendale, CA, 1981, p.xi</ref> and the city added new \"streetcar suburbs\".\n\nThe city's elite black colleges were founded between 1865 and 1885, and despite disenfranchisement and the later imposition of [[Jim Crow]] laws in the 1910s, a prosperous [[black middle class]] and [[American Black Upper Class|upper class]] emerged. By the early 20th century, [[Sweet Auburn|\"Sweet\" Auburn Avenue]] was called \"the most prosperous Negro street in the nation\". In the 1950s, blacks started moving into city neighborhoods that had previously kept them out, while Atlanta's first freeways enabled large numbers of whites to move to, and commute from, new suburbs. Atlanta was home to [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and a major center for the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Resulting desegregation occurred in stages over the 1960s. Slums were razed and the new [[Atlanta Housing Authority]] built public-housing projects.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to mid-'70s, nine suburban malls opened, and the downtown shopping district declined, but just north of it, gleaming office towers and hotels rose, and in 1976, the new [[Georgia World Congress Center]] signaled Atlanta's rise as a major convention city. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, [[Maynard Jackson]], and in ensuing decades, black political leaders worked successfully with the white business community to promote business growth, while still empowering black businesses. From the mid-'70s to mid-'80s most of the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] rapid transit system was built. While the suburbs grew rapidly, much of the city itself deteriorated and the city lost 21% of its population between 1970 and '90.\n\nIn 1996, Atlanta hosted the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]], for which new facilities and infrastructure were built. Hometown airline [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] continued to grow, and by 1998\u20139, [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta's airport]] was the busiest in the world. Since the mid-'90s, [[Gentrification of Atlanta|gentrification]] has given new life to many of the city's [[Intown Atlanta|intown neighborhoods]]. The 2010 census showed affluent blacks leaving the city for newer exurban properties and growing suburban towns, younger whites moving back to the city, and a much more diverse metropolitan area with heaviest growth in the exurbs at its outer edges.\n \n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Native American civilization: before 1836==\nThe region where Atlanta and its suburbs were built was originally [[Creek people|Creek]] and [[Cherokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] territory. In 1813, the Creeks, who had been recruited by the British to assist them in the [[War of 1812]], attacked and burned [[Fort Mims]] in southwestern [[Alabama]]. The conflict broadened and became known as the [[Creek War]]. In response, the United States built a string of forts along the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] Rivers, including Fort Daniel on top of Hog Mountain near present-day [[Dacula, Georgia]], and Fort Gilmer. Fort Gilmer was situated next to an important Indian site called [[Standing Peachtree]], a [[Creek Indian]] village. The site traditionally marked a Native American meeting place at the boundary between Creek and Cherokee lands, at the point where [[Peachtree Creek]] flows into the Chattahoochee. The fort was soon renamed Fort Peachtree. A road was built linking Fort Peachtree and Fort Daniel following the route of existing trails.<ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia's Forts |publisher=Our Georgia History |url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/lists/georgia_forts.html |accessdate=June 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n<!--[[Image:Early atlanta indian trails.jpg|thumb|left|A map showing roads and Indian trails circa 1815, with late 19th-century Fulton County and City of Atlanta outlines overlaid.

Late 19th- and early 20th-century immigration added a very small number of new Europeans to the mix.  After Reconstruction, whites had used a variety of tactics, including militias and legislation, to re-establish political and social supremacy throughout the South. Starting with a poll tax in 1877, by the turn of the century, Georgia passed a variety of legislation that completed the disfranchisement of blacks.  Not even college-educated men could vote.  Nonetheless, African Americans in Atlanta had been developing their own businesses, institutions, churches, and a strong, educated middle class.\n\n===Coca-Cola===\nThe identities of Atlanta and [[Coca-Cola]] have been intertwined since 1886, when [[John Pemberton]] developed the soft drink in response to Atlanta and Fulton County going \"dry\". The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta. [[Asa Griggs Candler]] acquired a stake in Pemberton's company in 1887 and incorporated it as the [[Coca Cola Corporation|Coca Cola Company]] in 1888.<ref name=\"Pendergrast2000\">{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| authorlink=Mark Pendergrast | title = For God, country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books (AZ)| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8 }}</ref> In 1892, Candler incorporated a second company, [[The Coca-Cola Company|''The'' Coca-Cola Company]], the current corporation. By the time of its 50th anniversary, the drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA. Coca-Cola's world headquarters have remained in Atlanta ever since. In 1991, the company opened the [[World of Coca-Cola]], which has remained one of the city's top visitor attractions.\n\n[[File:Cleveland at atlanta expo 1895.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Grover Cleveland|President Cleveland]] at the opening of the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]]]]\n\n===Cotton States Expo and Booker T. Washington speech===\nIn 1895, the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]] was held at what is now [[Piedmont Park]]. Nearly 800,000 visitors attended the event. The exposition was designed to promote the region to the world and showcase products and new technologies, as well as to encourage trade with Latin America. The exposition featured exhibits from several states, including various innovations in agriculture and technology. President [[Grover Cleveland]] presided over the opening of the exposition, but the event is best remembered for the both hailed and criticized [[Atlanta Exposition Speech|\"Atlanta Compromise\" speech]] given by [[Booker T. Washington]] in which Southern blacks would work meekly and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic education and due process in law.\n\n==Streetcar suburbs and World War II: 1906\u20131945==\n\n===1906 race riot and results===\n[[File:Le Petit Journal 7 Oct 1906.jpg|thumb|left|The cover of French magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' in October 1906 depicting the Atlanta Race Riot]]\n\nCompetition between working-class whites and black for jobs and housing gave rise to fears and tensions.

[[Sweet Auburn|\"Sweet\" Auburn Avenue]] became home to [[Alonzo Herndon]]'s [[Atlanta Mutual Life Insurance Company|Atlanta Mutual]], the city's first black-owned life insurance company, and to a celebrated concentration of black businesses, newspapers, churches, and nightclubs. In 1956, ''Fortune'' magazine called Sweet Auburn \"the richest Negro street in the world\", a phrase originally coined by civil-rights leader [[John Wesley Dobbs]].<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2507 \"Auburn Avenue (Sweet Auburn)\", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']</ref> Sweet Auburn and Atlanta's [[Atlanta University Center|elite black colleges]] formed the nexus of a prosperous [[black middle class]] and [[American Black Upper Class|upper class]], which arose despite enormous social and legal obstacles.\n\n===Jim Crow laws===\n[[File:Ponce de leon springs segregation.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at entrance to [[Ponce de Leon amusement park]] in 1908 indicating \"colored persons admitted as servants only\"]]\n[[Jim Crow laws]] were passed in swift succession in the years after the riot. The result was in some cases segregated facilities, with nearly always inferior conditions for black customers, but in many cases it resulted in no facilities at all available to blacks, e.g. all parks were designated whites-only (although a private park, [[Joyland (Atlanta)|Joyland]], did open in 1921). In 1910, the city council passed an ordinance requiring that restaurants be designated for one race only, hobbling black restaurant owners who had been attracting both black and white customers. In the same year, [[Streetcars in Atlanta|Atlanta's streetcars]] were segregated, with black patrons required to sit in the rear. If not enough seats were available for all white riders, the blacks sitting furthest forward in the trolley were required to stand and give their seats to whites. In 1913, the city created official boundaries for white and black residential areas. And in 1920, the city prohibited black-owned salons from serving white women and children.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Our_kind_of_people.html?id=_FWTEBzgNdcC Lawrence Otis Graham, ''Our Kind of People: inside America's Black upper class'', p. 335]</ref>\n\nBeyond this, blacks were subject to the South's \"racial protocol\", whereby, according to the ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'':<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3610 \"Segregation\", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[A]ll blacks were required to pay obeisance to all whites, even those whites of low social standing. And although they were required to address whites by the title \"sir,\" blacks rarely received the same courtesy themselves. Because even minor breaches of racial etiquette often resulted in violent reprisals, the region's codes of deference transformed daily life into a theater of ritual, where every encounter, exchange, and gesture reinforced black inferiority.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish supervisor at a factory in Atlanta, was put on trial for raping and murdering a 13-year-old white employee from Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. After doubts about Frank's guilt led his death sentence to be commuted in 1915, riots broke out in Atlanta among whites.  They kidnapped Frank from the State Prison Farm in the city of Milledgeville, with the collusion of prison guards, and took him to Marietta, where he was lynched. Later that year, the Klan was reborn in Atlanta.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Country music scene===\n{{Main|Country music in Atlanta}}\nMany [[Appalachia]]n people came to Atlanta to work in the cotton mills and brought their music with them. Starting with a 1913 fiddler's convention, Atlanta became the center of a thriving [[country music in Atlanta|country-music scene]]. Atlanta was an important center for country music recording and talent recruiting in the 1920s and 1930s, and a live music center for an additional two decades after that.\n\n===Growth===\n[[Image:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumbnail|right|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles]]\nIn 1914, [[Asa Griggs Candler]], the founder of [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and brother to former Emory President [[Warren Candler]], persuaded the [[Methodist Episcopal Church South]] to build the new campus of [[Emory University]] in the emerging affluent suburb of [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]], which borders northeastern Atlanta.\n\n===Great Atlanta Fire of 1917===\n[[Image:1917fireatlanta.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Great Atlanta Fire in the Fourth Ward]]\n{{Main|Great Atlanta Fire of 1917}}\nOn May 21, 1917, the [[Great Atlanta Fire of 1917|Great Atlanta Fire]] destroyed 1,938 buildings, mostly wooden, in what is now the [[Old Fourth Ward]]. The fire resulted in 10,000 people becoming homeless. Only one person died, a woman who died of a heart attack when seeing her home in ashes.\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] hit Atlanta. With the city government nearing bankruptcy, the Coca-Cola Company had to help bail out the city's deficit. The federal government stepped in to help Atlantans by establishing [[Techwood Homes]], the nation's first federal [[public housing|housing project]] in 1935.\n\n===''Gone with the Wind'' premiere===\nOn December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']], the movie based on Atlanta resident [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s best-selling novel. Stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], and [[Olivia de Havilland]] were in attendance. The premiere was held at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]], at Peachtree and Forsyth Streets, current site of the [[Georgia-Pacific]] building. An enormous crowd, numbering 300,000 people according to the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', filled the streets on an ice-cold night in Atlanta. A rousing ovation greeted a group of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans who were guests of honor.\n\n====Absence of film's black stars at event====\nNoticeably absent was [[Hattie McDaniel]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as Mammy, as well as [[Butterfly McQueen]] (Prissy). The black actors were barred from attending the premiere, from appearing in the [[souvenir program]], and from all the film's advertising in the South. Director [[David Selznick]] had attempted to bring McDaniel to the premiere, but [[MGM]] advised him not to do so. Clark Gable angrily threatened to boycott the premiere, but McDaniel convinced him to attend, anyway.<ref>Harris, Warren G.

Delta became the world's largest airline in 2008 after acquiring [[Northwest Airlines]].\n\n===World War II===\nWith the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], soldiers from around the [[Southeastern United States]] went through Atlanta to train and later be discharged at Fort McPherson. War-related manufacturing such as the [[Bell Aircraft]] factory in the suburb of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] helped boost the city's population and economy. Shortly after the war in 1946, the Communicable Disease Center, later called the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was founded in Atlanta from the old Malaria Control in War Areas offices and staff.\n\n==Suburbanization and Civil Rights: 1946\u20131989==\n[[File:Atlanta annexation 1952.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1952 annexation]]\nIn 1951, the city received the [[All-America City Award]] due to its rapid growth and high standard of living in the southern U.S.\n\nAnnexation was the central strategy for growth. In 1952, Atlanta annexed [[Buckhead]] as well as vast areas of what are now northwest, southwest, and south Atlanta, adding {{convert|82|mi2|km2}} and tripling its area. By doing so, 100,000 new affluent white residents were added, preserving white political power, expanding the city's property tax base, and enlarging the traditional white upper middle class leadership. This class now had room to expand inside the city limits.\n\nFederal court decisions in 1962 and1963 ended the county-unit system, thus greatly reducing rural Georgia control over the state legislature, enabling Atlanta and other cities to gain proportional political power. The federal courts opened the Democratic Party primary to black voters, who surged in numbers and became increasingly well organized through the Atlanta Negro Voters League.<ref>Mack H.

However, by the late 1950s, such efforts proved futile as [[blockbusting]] drove whites to sell their homes in neighborhoods such as [[Adamsville (Atlanta)|Adamsville]], [[Center Hill (Atlanta)|Center Hill]], [[Grove Park (Atlanta)|Grove Park]] in northwest Atlanta, and white sections of [[Edgewood (Atlanta)|Edgewood]] and [[Kirkwood (Atlanta)|Kirkwood]] on the east side.

One such instance occurred on October 12, 1958, when [[Bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple|a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed]]. A group of [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] calling themselves the \"Confederate Underground\" claimed responsibility. The temple's leader, Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, actively spoke out in support of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement and against segregation, which is likely why the congregation was targeted.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hatfield |first1=Edward A. |title=Temple Bombing |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/temple-bombing |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgia Humanities and the University of Georgia Press}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the Civil Rights Movement, with [[Martin Luther King|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. On October 19, 1960, a sit-in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr. King and several students.  This drew attention from the national media and from presidential candidate [[John F.

Historic neighborhoods such as [[Washington-Rawson]] and [[Copenhill]] were damaged or destroyed in the process. Additional proposed freeways were never built due to the [[Atlanta freeway revolts|protests of city residents]]. The opposition lasted three decades, with then-governor [[Jimmy Carter]] playing a key role in stopping [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|I-485]] through [[Morningside-Lenox Park|Morningside]] and [[Virginia Highland]] to [[Inman Park]] in 1973, but pushing hard in the 1980s for a [[Atlanta freeway revolts#Battling Jimmy Carter's \"Presidential Parkway\"|\"Presidential Parkway\"]] between downtown, the new [[Carter Center]], and [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]]/[[Emory University|Emory]].\n\n===Urban renewal===\nIn the 1960s, slums such as [[Buttermilk Bottom]] near today's Civic Center were razed, in principle to build better housing, but much of the land remained empty until the 1980s, when mixed-income communities were built in what was renamed [[Bedford Pine]]. The African-American community east of downtown suffered as the center of the black economy moved squarely to southwestern Atlanta. During the 1960s, African-American citizens'-rights groups such as [[U-Rescue]] emerged to address the lack of housing for poor blacks.\n\n===Shoppers move to new malls as Downtown gains new roles===\n{{Anchor|transformation of downtown}}\nThe first major mall built in Atlanta was [[Lenox Square]] in Buckhead, opening in August 1959. From 1964 until 1973, nine major malls opened, most at the Perimeter freeway: [[Cobb Center]] in 1963, [[Avondale Mall|Columbia Mall]] in 1964, [[North DeKalb Mall|North DeKalb]] and [[Greenbriar Mall|Greenbriar]] malls in 1965, [[Gallery at South DeKalb|South DeKalb Mall]] in 1968, [[Phipps Plaza]] (near Lenox Square) in 1969, [[Perimeter Mall|Perimeter]] and [[Northlake Mall (Atlanta)|Northlake]] malls in 1971, and [[Cumberland Mall]] in 1973. [[Downtown Atlanta]] became less and less a shopping destination for the area's shoppers. [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] closed its flagship store downtown in 1991, leaving government offices the major presence in the [[South Downtown]] area around it.\n\nOn the north side of Five Points, Downtown continued as the [[Downtown Atlanta#Buildings|largest concentration of office space]] in Metro Atlanta, though it began to compete with Midtown, Buckhead, and the suburbs. The first four towers of [[Peachtree Center]] were built in 1965\u20131967, including the [[Hyatt Regency Atlanta]], designed by [[John Portman]], with its 22-story atrium. In total, 17 buildings of more than 15n floors were built in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2207 \"Atlanta\", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']</ref> The center of gravity of Downtown Atlanta correspondingly moved north from the [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]] area towards [[Peachtree Center]].\n\nAtlanta's convention and hotel facilities also grew immensely. [[John C. Portman, Jr.]] designed and opened what is now the [[AmericasMart]] merchandise mart in 1958; the Sheraton Atlanta, the city's first convention hotel, was built in the 1960s; the Atlanta Hilton opened in 1971; as did two Portman-designed hotels: the Peachtree Plaza Hotel now owned by [[Westin Peachtree Plaza Hotel|Westin]] in 1976, and the [[Atlanta Marriott Marquis|Marriott]] in 1985. The [[Omni Coliseum]] opened in 1976, as did the [[Georgia World Congress Center]] (GWCC).

He helped arrange for the rebuilding of the airport's huge terminal to modern standards, and this airport was renamed the [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] in his honor shortly after his death, also named after him is the new [[Maynard Holbrook Jackson, Jr. International Terminal]] which opened in May 2012.

A 1968 referendum to fund MARTA failed, but in 1971, Fulton and DeKalb Counties passed a 1% sales tax increase to pay for operations, while Clayton and Gwinnett counties overwhelmingly rejected the tax in referendum, fearing the introduction of crime and \"undesirable elements\".<ref name=bullard>{{cite book| author=Bullard, R.

Over the two-year period, at least 22 children, and 6 adults were killed, all of them black. Atlanta native [[Wayne Williams]], also black and 23 years old at the time of the last murder, was convicted of two of the murders and sent to prison for life. The rest of the crimes remain unsolved today.\n\n[[File:Andrew Young.jpg|thumb|120px|Andrew Young]]\n\n===Mayor Andrew Young===\nIn 1981, after being urged by a number of people, including [[Coretta Scott King]], the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Democratic Congressman [[Andrew Young]] ran for [[mayor]] of [[Atlanta]]. He was elected later that year with 55% of the vote, succeeding [[Maynard Jackson]]. As mayor of Atlanta, he brought in $70 billion of new private investment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} He continued and expanded Maynard Jackson's programs for including minority and female-owned businesses in all city contracts. The Mayor's Task Force on Education established the Dream Jamboree College Fair that tripled the college scholarships given to Atlanta public school graduates. In 1985, he was involved in privatizing the Atlanta Zoo, which was renamed [[Zoo Atlanta]]. The then-moribund zoo was overhauled, making ecological habitats specific to different animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nYoung was re-elected as Mayor in 1985 with more than 80% of the vote. Atlanta hosted the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] during Young's tenure. He was prohibited by [[term limits]] from running for a third term. He was succeeded by Maynard Jackson who returned as mayor from 1990 to 1994. [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]] succeeded Jackson as mayor in 1994 and served through 2002.\n\n===Campbell mayorship and failure of Atlanta Empowerment Zone===\nIn November 1994, the Atlanta Empowerment Zone was established, a 10-year, $250 million federal program to revitalize Atlanta's 34 poorest neighborhoods including [[The Bluff (Atlanta)|The Bluff]]. Scathing reports from both the U.S. [[Department of Housing and Urban Development]] and the Georgia Department of Community Affairs revealed corruption, waste, bureaucratic incompetence, and specifically called out interference by mayor [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]].<ref>[http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2000/11/06/editorial5.html \"Empowerment zones: Boondoggle or aid to poor?\", ''Atlanta Business Chronicle'', November 6, 2000]</ref><ref name=cl2>[http://clatl.com/atlanta/federal-grants-go-to-groups-with-shaky-past/Content?oid=1269825 Scott Henry, \"Federal grants go to groups with shaky past\", ''Creative Loafing'', September 26, 2007]</ref>\n\nIn 1993-1996 about 250,000 people attended [[Freaknik]], an annual Spring Break gathering for African Americans which was not centrally organized and which resulted in much traffic gridlock and increased crime.

Following the announcement, Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation, including the completion of long-contested [[Freedom Parkway]]. Former Mayor [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]] allowed many \"tent cities\" to be built, creating a carnival atmosphere around the games. Atlanta became the third American city to host the Summer Olympics, after [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] ([[1904 Summer Olympics]]) and [[Los Angeles]] ([[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]). The games themselves were notable in the realm of sporting events, but they were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies. A dramatic event was the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]], in which two people died, one from a heart attack, and several others were injured. [[Eric Robert Rudolph]] was later convicted of the bombing as an anti-government and pro-life protest.\n\n===Shirley Franklin mayorship===\n[[Shirley Franklin]]'s 2001 run for mayor was her first run for public office.

The stake marking the founding of \"Terminus\" was driven into the ground in 1837 (called the [[Atlanta Zero Mile Post|Zero Mile Post]]). In 1839, homes and a store were built there and the settlement grew.  Between 1845 and 1854, rail lines arrived from four different directions, and the rapidly growing town quickly became the rail hub for the entire [[Southern United States]]. During the [[American Civil War]], Atlanta, as a distribution hub, became the target of a [[Atlanta Campaign|major Union campaign]], and in 1864, Union [[William Sherman]]'s troops set on fire and destroyed the city's assets and buildings, save churches and hospitals. After the war, the population grew rapidly, as did manufacturing, while the city retained its role as a rail hub. Coca-Cola was launched here in 1886 and grew into an Atlanta-based world empire. Electric streetcars arrived in 1889,<ref>Carson, O.E., ''The Trolley Titans'', [[Interurban Press]], Glendale, CA, 1981, p.xi</ref> and the city added new \"streetcar suburbs\".\n\nThe city's elite black colleges were founded between 1865 and 1885, and despite disenfranchisement and the later imposition of [[Jim Crow]] laws in the 1910s, a prosperous [[black middle class]] and [[American Black Upper Class|upper class]] emerged. By the early 20th century, [[Sweet Auburn|\"Sweet\" Auburn Avenue]] was called \"the most prosperous Negro street in the nation\". In the 1950s, blacks started moving into city neighborhoods that had previously kept them out, while Atlanta's first freeways enabled large numbers of whites to move to, and commute from, new suburbs. Atlanta was home to [[Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and a major center for the [[Civil Rights Movement]]. Resulting desegregation occurred in stages over the 1960s. Slums were razed and the new [[Atlanta Housing Authority]] built public-housing projects.\n\nFrom the mid-1960s to mid-'70s, nine suburban malls opened, and the downtown shopping district declined, but just north of it, gleaming office towers and hotels rose, and in 1976, the new [[Georgia World Congress Center]] signaled Atlanta's rise as a major convention city. In 1973, the city elected its first black mayor, [[Maynard Jackson]], and in ensuing decades, black political leaders worked successfully with the white business community to promote business growth, while still empowering black businesses. From the mid-'70s to mid-'80s most of the [[Metropolitan Atlanta Rapid Transit Authority|MARTA]] rapid transit system was built. While the suburbs grew rapidly, much of the city itself deteriorated and the city lost 21% of its population between 1970 and '90.\n\nIn 1996, Atlanta hosted the [[1996 Summer Olympics|Summer Olympics]], for which new facilities and infrastructure were built. Hometown airline [[Delta Air Lines|Delta]] continued to grow, and by 1998-9, [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport|Atlanta's airport]] was the busiest in the world. Since the mid-'90s, [[Gentrification of Atlanta|gentrification]] has given new life to many of the city's [[Intown Atlanta|intown neighborhoods]]. The 2010 census showed affluent blacks leaving the city for newer exurban properties and growing suburban towns, younger whites moving back to the city, and a much more diverse metropolitan area with heaviest growth in the exurbs at its outer edges.\n \n{{TOC limit|limit=2}}\n\n==Native American civilization: before 1836==\nThe region where Atlanta and its suburbs were built was originally [[Creek people|Creek]] and [[Cherokee]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] territory. In 1813, the Creeks, who had been recruited by the British to assist them in the [[War of 1812]], attacked and burned [[Fort Mims]] in southwestern [[Alabama]]. The conflict broadened and became known as the [[Creek War]]. In response, the United States built a string of forts along the [[Ocmulgee River|Ocmulgee]] and [[Chattahoochee River|Chattahoochee]] Rivers, including Fort Daniel on top of Hog Mountain near present-day [[Dacula, Georgia]], and Fort Gilmer. Fort Gilmer was situated next to an important Indian site called [[Standing Peachtree]], a [[Creek Indian]] village. The site traditionally marked a Native American meeting place at the boundary between Creek and Cherokee lands, at the point where [[Peachtree Creek]] flows into the Chattahoochee. The fort was soon renamed Fort Peachtree. A road was built linking Fort Peachtree and Fort Daniel following the route of existing trails.<ref>{{cite web |title=Georgia's Forts |publisher=Our Georgia History |url=http://ourgeorgiahistory.com/lists/georgia_forts.html |accessdate=June 26, 2007}}</ref>\n\n<!--[[Image:Early atlanta indian trails.jpg|thumb|left|A map showing roads and Indian trails circa 1815, with late 19th-century Fulton County and City of Atlanta outlines overlaid.

As part of the effort to modernize the South, Grady and many others also supported the creation of the [[Georgia School of Technology]] (now the Georgia Institute of Technology), which was founded on the city's northern outskirts in 1885. With Grady's support, the [[Confederate Soldiers' Home]] was built in 1889.\n{{see also|History of Georgia Tech}}\n\nIn 1880, Sister Cecilia Carroll, RSM, and three companions traveled from Savannah, Georgia to Atlanta to minister to the sick. With just 50 cents in their collective purse, the sisters opened the Atlanta Hospital, the first medical facility in the city after the Civil War. This later became known as Saint Joseph's Hospital.\n\n===Expansion and the first planned suburbs===\n[[File:House Inman Park 4.jpg|thumb|left|[[Inman Park]], one of Atlanta's first planned garden suburbs]]\n\nStarting in 1871, [[Streetcars in Atlanta|horse-drawn, and later, starting in 1888, electric streetcars]] fueled real estate development and [[Atlanta ward system|the city's expansion]]. [[Washington-Rawson|Washington Street]] south of downtown and [[Peachtree Street]] north of the central business district became wealthy residential areas.\n\nIn the 1890s, [[West End (Atlanta)|West End]] became the suburb of choice for the city's elite, but [[Inman Park]], planned as a harmonious whole, soon overtook it in prestige. Peachtree Street's mansions reached ever further north into what is now Midtown Atlanta, including [[Amos G. Rhodes]]' (founder of the [[Rhodes Furniture]] Company in 1875) mansion, [[Rhodes Hall]], which can still be visited.\n\nAtlanta surpassed Savannah as Georgia's largest city by 1880.\n\n===Disenfranchisement of blacks===\n{{See also|Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era}}\nAs Atlanta grew, ethnic and racial tensions mounted. Late 19th- and early 20th-century immigration added a very small number of new Europeans to the mix.  After Reconstruction, whites had used a variety of tactics, including militias and legislation, to re-establish political and social supremacy throughout the South. Starting with a poll tax in 1877, by the turn of the century, Georgia passed a variety of legislation that completed the disfranchisement of blacks.  Not even college-educated men could vote.  Nonetheless, African Americans in Atlanta had been developing their own businesses, institutions, churches, and a strong, educated middle class.\n\n===Coca-Cola===\nThe identities of Atlanta and [[Coca-Cola]] have been intertwined since 1886, when [[John Pemberton]] developed the soft drink in response to Atlanta and Fulton County going \"dry\". The first sales were at Jacob's Pharmacy in Atlanta. [[Asa Griggs Candler]] acquired a stake in Pemberton's company in 1887 and incorporated it as the [[Coca Cola Corporation|Coca Cola Company]] in 1888.<ref name=\"Pendergrast2000\">{{cite book| author = Mark Pendergrast| authorlink=Mark Pendergrast | title = For God, country and Coca-Cola| date = March 16, 2000| publisher = Basic Books (AZ)| isbn = 978-0-465-05468-8 }}</ref> In 1892, Candler incorporated a second company, [[The Coca-Cola Company|''The'' Coca-Cola Company]], the current corporation. By the time of its 50th anniversary, the drink had reached the status of a national icon in the USA. Coca-Cola's world headquarters have remained in Atlanta ever since. In 1991, the company opened the [[World of Coca-Cola]], which has remained one of the city's top visitor attractions.\n\n[[File:Cleveland at atlanta expo 1895.jpeg|thumb|left|[[Grover Cleveland|President Cleveland]] at the opening of the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]]]]\n\n===Cotton States Expo and Booker T. Washington speech===\nIn 1895, the [[Cotton States and International Exposition]] was held at what is now [[Piedmont Park]]. Nearly 800,000 visitors attended the event. The exposition was designed to promote the region to the world and showcase products and new technologies, as well as to encourage trade with Latin America. The exposition featured exhibits from several states, including various innovations in agriculture and technology. President [[Grover Cleveland]] presided over the opening of the exposition, but the event is best remembered for the both hailed and criticized [[Atlanta Exposition Speech|\"Atlanta Compromise\" speech]] given by [[Booker T. Washington]] in which Southern blacks would work meekly and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic education and due process in law.\n\n==Streetcar suburbs and World War II: 1906\u20131945==\n\n===1906 race riot and results===\n[[File:Le Petit Journal 7 Oct 1906.jpg|thumb|left|The cover of French magazine ''[[Le Petit Journal (newspaper)|Le Petit Journal]]'' in October 1906 depicting the Atlanta Race Riot]]\n\nCompetition between working-class whites and black for jobs and housing gave rise to fears and tensions.

[[Sweet Auburn|\"Sweet\" Auburn Avenue]] became home to [[Alonzo Herndon]]'s [[Atlanta Mutual Life Insurance Company|Atlanta Mutual]], the city's first black-owned life insurance company, and to a celebrated concentration of black businesses, newspapers, churches, and nightclubs. In 1956, ''Fortune'' magazine called Sweet Auburn \"the richest Negro street in the world\", a phrase originally coined by civil-rights leader [[John Wesley Dobbs]].<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2507 \"Auburn Avenue (Sweet Auburn)\", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']</ref> Sweet Auburn and Atlanta's [[Atlanta University Center|elite black colleges]] formed the nexus of a prosperous [[black middle class]] and [[American Black Upper Class|upper class]], which arose despite enormous social and legal obstacles.\n\n===Jim Crow laws===\n[[File:Ponce de leon springs segregation.jpg|thumb|right|Sign at entrance to [[Ponce de Leon amusement park]] in 1908 indicating \"colored persons admitted as servants only\"]]\n[[Jim Crow laws]] were passed in swift succession in the years after the riot. The result was in some cases segregated facilities, with nearly always inferior conditions for black customers, but in many cases it resulted in no facilities at all available to blacks, e.g. all parks were designated whites-only (although a private park, [[Joyland (Atlanta)|Joyland]], did open in 1921). In 1910, the city council passed an ordinance requiring that restaurants be designated for one race only, hobbling black restaurant owners who had been attracting both black and white customers. In the same year, [[Streetcars in Atlanta|Atlanta's streetcars]] were segregated, with black patrons required to sit in the rear. If not enough seats were available for all white riders, the blacks sitting furthest forward in the trolley were required to stand and give their seats to whites. In 1913, the city created official boundaries for white and black residential areas. And in 1920, the city prohibited black-owned salons from serving white women and children.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books/about/Our_kind_of_people.html?id=_FWTEBzgNdcC Lawrence Otis Graham, ''Our Kind of People: inside America's Black upper class'', p. 335]</ref>\n\nBeyond this, blacks were subject to the South's \"racial protocol\", whereby, according to the ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'':<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-3610 \"Segregation\", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']</ref>\n\n<blockquote>[A]ll blacks were required to pay obeisance to all whites, even those whites of low social standing. And although they were required to address whites by the title \"sir,\" blacks rarely received the same courtesy themselves. Because even minor breaches of racial etiquette often resulted in violent reprisals, the region's codes of deference transformed daily life into a theater of ritual, where every encounter, exchange, and gesture reinforced black inferiority.</blockquote>\n\nIn 1913, [[Leo Frank]], a Jewish supervisor at a factory in Atlanta, was put on trial for raping and murdering a 13-year-old white employee from Marietta, a suburb of Atlanta. After doubts about Frank's guilt led his death sentence to be commuted in 1915, riots broke out in Atlanta among whites.  They kidnapped Frank from the State Prison Farm in the city of Milledgeville, with the collusion of prison guards, and took him to Marietta, where he was lynched. Later that year, the Klan was reborn in Atlanta.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n\n===Country music scene===\n{{Main|Country music in Atlanta}}\nMany [[Appalachia]]n people came to Atlanta to work in the cotton mills and brought their music with them. Starting with a 1913 fiddler's convention, Atlanta became the center of a thriving [[country music in Atlanta|country-music scene]]. Atlanta was an important center for country music recording and talent recruiting in the 1920s and 1930s, and a live music center for an additional two decades after that.\n\n===Growth===\n[[Image:Peachtree1907.jpg|thumbnail|right|In 1907, Peachtree Street, the main street of Atlanta, was busy with streetcars and automobiles]]\nIn 1914, [[Asa Griggs Candler]], the founder of [[The Coca-Cola Company]] and brother to former Emory President [[Warren Candler]], persuaded the [[Methodist Episcopal Church South]] to build the new campus of [[Emory University]] in the emerging affluent suburb of [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]], which borders northeastern Atlanta.\n\n===Great Atlanta Fire of 1917===\n[[Image:1917fireatlanta.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Great Atlanta Fire in the Fourth Ward]]\n{{Main|Great Atlanta Fire of 1917}}\nOn May 21, 1917, the [[Great Atlanta Fire of 1917|Great Atlanta Fire]] destroyed 1,938 buildings, mostly wooden, in what is now the [[Old Fourth Ward]]. The fire resulted in 10,000 people becoming homeless. Only one person died, a woman who died of a heart attack when seeing her home in ashes.\n\nIn the 1930s, the [[Great Depression]] hit Atlanta. With the city government nearing bankruptcy, the Coca-Cola Company had to help bail out the city's deficit. The federal government stepped in to help Atlantans by establishing [[Techwood Homes]], the nation's first federal [[public housing|housing project]] in 1935.\n\n===''Gone with the Wind'' premiere===\nOn December 15, 1939, Atlanta hosted the premiere of [[Gone with the Wind (film)|''Gone with the Wind'']], the movie based on Atlanta resident [[Margaret Mitchell]]'s best-selling novel. Stars [[Clark Gable]], [[Vivien Leigh]], and [[Olivia de Havilland]] were in attendance. The premiere was held at [[Loew's Grand Theatre]], at Peachtree and Forsyth Streets, current site of the [[Georgia-Pacific]] building. An enormous crowd, numbering 300,000 people according to the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', filled the streets on an ice-cold night in Atlanta. A rousing ovation greeted a group of [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veterans who were guests of honor.\n\n====Absence of film's black stars at event====\nNoticeably absent was [[Hattie McDaniel]], who won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as Mammy, as well as [[Butterfly McQueen]] (Prissy). The black actors were barred from attending the premiere, from appearing in the [[souvenir program]], and from all the film's advertising in the South. Director [[David Selznick]] had attempted to bring McDaniel to the premiere, but [[MGM]] advised him not to do so. Clark Gable angrily threatened to boycott the premiere, but McDaniel convinced him to attend, anyway.<ref>Harris, Warren G.

Delta became the world's largest airline in 2008 after acquiring [[Northwest Airlines]].\n\n===World War II===\nWith the entry of the United States into [[World War II]], soldiers from around the [[Southeastern United States]] went through Atlanta to train and later be discharged at Fort McPherson. War-related manufacturing such as the [[Bell Aircraft]] factory in the suburb of [[Marietta, Georgia|Marietta]] helped boost the city's population and economy. Shortly after the war in 1946, the Communicable Disease Center, later called the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] was founded in Atlanta from the old Malaria Control in War Areas offices and staff.\n\n==Suburbanization and Civil Rights: 1946\u20131989==\n[[File:Atlanta annexation 1952.jpg|thumb|left|300px|1952 annexation]]\nIn 1951, the city received the [[All-America City Award]] due to its rapid growth and high standard of living in the southern U.S.\n\nAnnexation was the central strategy for growth. In 1952, Atlanta annexed [[Buckhead]] as well as vast areas of what are now northwest, southwest, and south Atlanta, adding {{convert|82|mi2|km2}} and tripling its area. By doing so, 100,000 new affluent white residents were added, preserving white political power, expanding the city's property tax base, and enlarging the traditional white upper middle class leadership. This class now had room to expand inside the city limits.\n\nFederal court decisions in 1962 and1963 ended the county-unit system, thus greatly reducing rural Georgia control over the state legislature, enabling Atlanta and other cities to gain proportional political power. The federal courts opened the Democratic Party primary to black voters, who surged in numbers and became increasingly well organized through the Atlanta Negro Voters League.<ref>Mack H.

However, by the late 1950s, such efforts proved futile as [[blockbusting]] drove whites to sell their homes in neighborhoods such as [[Adamsville (Atlanta)|Adamsville]], [[Center Hill (Atlanta)|Center Hill]], [[Grove Park (Atlanta)|Grove Park]] in northwest Atlanta, and white sections of [[Edgewood (Atlanta)|Edgewood]] and [[Kirkwood (Atlanta)|Kirkwood]] on the east side.

Board of Education]]'', which helped usher in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], racial tensions in Atlanta erupted in acts of violence. One such instance occurred on October 12, 1958, when [[Bombing of the Hebrew Benevolent Congregation Temple|a Reform Jewish temple on Peachtree Street was bombed]]. A group of [[white supremacy|white supremacists]] calling themselves the \"Confederate Underground\" claimed responsibility. The temple's leader, Rabbi Jacob Rothschild, actively spoke out in support of the burgeoning Civil Rights Movement and against segregation, which is likely why the congregation was targeted.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Hatfield |first1=Edward A. |title=Temple Bombing |url=https://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/articles/arts-culture/temple-bombing |website=New Georgia Encyclopedia |publisher=Georgia Humanities and the University of Georgia Press}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1960s, Atlanta was a major organizing center of the Civil Rights Movement, with [[Martin Luther King|Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.]], and students from Atlanta's historically black colleges and universities playing major roles in the movement's leadership. On October 19, 1960, a sit-in at the lunch counters of several Atlanta department stores led to the arrest of Dr. King and several students.  This drew attention from the national media and from presidential candidate [[John F.

Historic neighborhoods such as [[Washington-Rawson]] and [[Copenhill]] were damaged or destroyed in the process. Additional proposed freeways were never built due to the [[Atlanta freeway revolts|protests of city residents]]. The opposition lasted three decades, with then-governor [[Jimmy Carter]] playing a key role in stopping [[Interstate 485 (Georgia)|I-485]] through [[Morningside-Lenox Park|Morningside]] and [[Virginia Highland]] to [[Inman Park]] in 1973, but pushing hard in the 1980s for a [[Atlanta freeway revolts#Battling Jimmy Carter's \"Presidential Parkway\"|\"Presidential Parkway\"]] between downtown, the new [[Carter Center]], and [[Druid Hills, Georgia|Druid Hills]]/[[Emory University|Emory]].\n\n===Urban renewal===\nIn the 1960s, slums such as [[Buttermilk Bottom]] near today's Civic Center were razed, in principle to build better housing, but much of the land remained empty until the 1980s, when mixed-income communities were built in what was renamed [[Bedford Pine]]. The African-American community east of downtown suffered as the center of the black economy moved squarely to southwestern Atlanta. During the 1960s, African-American citizens'-rights groups such as [[U-Rescue]] emerged to address the lack of housing for poor blacks.\n\n===Shoppers move to new malls as Downtown gains new roles===\n{{Anchor|transformation of downtown}}\nThe first major mall built in Atlanta was [[Lenox Square]] in Buckhead, opening in August 1959. From 1964 until 1973, nine major malls opened, most at the Perimeter freeway: [[Cobb Center]] in 1963, [[Avondale Mall|Columbia Mall]] in 1964, [[North DeKalb Mall|North DeKalb]] and [[Greenbriar Mall|Greenbriar]] malls in 1965, [[Gallery at South DeKalb|South DeKalb Mall]] in 1968, [[Phipps Plaza]] (near Lenox Square) in 1969, [[Perimeter Mall|Perimeter]] and [[Northlake Mall (Atlanta)|Northlake]] malls in 1971, and [[Cumberland Mall]] in 1973. [[Downtown Atlanta]] became less and less a shopping destination for the area's shoppers. [[Rich's (department store)|Rich's]] closed its flagship store downtown in 1991, leaving government offices the major presence in the [[South Downtown]] area around it.\n\nOn the north side of Five Points, Downtown continued as the [[Downtown Atlanta#Buildings|largest concentration of office space]] in Metro Atlanta, though it began to compete with Midtown, Buckhead, and the suburbs. The first four towers of [[Peachtree Center]] were built in 1965-1967, including the [[Hyatt Regency Atlanta]], designed by [[John Portman]], with its 22-story atrium. In total, 17 buildings of more than 15n floors were built in the 1960s.<ref>[http://www.georgiaencyclopedia.org/nge/Article.jsp?id=h-2207 \"Atlanta\", ''New Georgia Encyclopedia'']</ref> The center of gravity of Downtown Atlanta correspondingly moved north from the [[Five Points (Atlanta)|Five Points]] area towards [[Peachtree Center]].\n\nAtlanta's convention and hotel facilities also grew immensely. [[John C.

He helped arrange for the rebuilding of the airport's huge terminal to modern standards, and this airport was renamed the [[Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport]] in his honor shortly after his death, also named after him is the new [[Maynard Holbrook Jackson, Jr. International Terminal]] which opened in May 2012.

The rest of the crimes remain unsolved today.\n\n[[File:Andrew Young.jpg|thumb|120px|Andrew Young]]\n\n===Mayor Andrew Young===\nIn 1981, after being urged by a number of people, including [[Coretta Scott King]], the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., Democratic Congressman [[Andrew Young]] ran for [[mayor]] of [[Atlanta]]. He was elected later that year with 55% of the vote, succeeding [[Maynard Jackson]]. As mayor of Atlanta, he brought in $70 billion of new private investment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} He continued and expanded Maynard Jackson's programs for including minority and female-owned businesses in all city contracts. The Mayor's Task Force on Education established the Dream Jamboree College Fair that tripled the college scholarships given to Atlanta public school graduates. In 1985, he was involved in privatizing the Atlanta Zoo, which was renamed [[Zoo Atlanta]]. The then-moribund zoo was overhauled, making ecological habitats specific to different animals.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nYoung was re-elected as Mayor in 1985 with more than 80% of the vote. Atlanta hosted the [[1988 Democratic National Convention]] during Young's tenure. He was prohibited by [[term limits]] from running for a third term. He was succeeded by Maynard Jackson who returned as mayor from 1990 to 1994.

Following the announcement, Atlanta undertook several major construction projects to improve the city's parks, sports facilities, and transportation, including the completion of long-contested [[Freedom Parkway]]. Former Mayor [[Bill Campbell (mayor)|Bill Campbell]] allowed many \"tent cities\" to be built, creating a carnival atmosphere around the games. Atlanta became the third American city to host the Summer Olympics, after [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]] ([[1904 Summer Olympics]]) and [[Los Angeles]] ([[1932 Summer Olympics|1932]] and [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]]). The games themselves were notable in the realm of sporting events, but they were marred by numerous organizational inefficiencies. A dramatic event was the [[Centennial Olympic Park bombing]], in which two people died, one from a heart attack, and several others were injured. [[Eric Robert Rudolph]] was later convicted of the bombing as an anti-government and pro-life protest.\n\n===Shirley Franklin mayorship===\n[[Shirley Franklin]]'s 2001 run for mayor was her first run for public office.
