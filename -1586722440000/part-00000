He appeared in over 90 films, starting in [[silent film]]s from 1925 until his death in 1956. He is perhaps best known for his role as Juan Harker in [[Universal Pictures]]' Spanish-language version of ''[[Dracula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'' in 1931, the English language role of [[Jonathan Harker]] originated by [[David Manners]].\n\n==Early life==\nNorton was born to an affluent family in [[Buenos Aires]] on June 16, 1905. His birth name was Alfredo Carlos Birab\u00e9n.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636161/bio Barry Norton (I) - Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrNnPKBh?url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0636161/bio |date=19 January 2011 }}</ref> In 1923, he emigrated to the United States as a second cabin class passenger under the name of Carlos Manuel A. Biraben on the S/S Vestris, which had sailed from Buenos Aires, 12 March, and arrived at the Port of New York on 1 April 1923. Years later, he became a naturalized United States citizen.\n\n==Career==\n{{one source|section|date=July 2015}}\nArriving in Hollywood in the 1920s, Norton first appeared as an extra in ''[[The Black Pirate]]'' (1926) but was soon cast in [[Fox Films]]' ''The Lily'' that same year. His big break came when he was given the role of Pvt. \"Mother's Boy\" Lewisohn in ''[[What Price Glory? (1926 film)|What Price Glory?]]'', which turned out to be a huge commercial success. He landed substantial roles in ''Legion of the Condemned'' and ''[[4 Devils]]'' (both 1928), which were also very successful. His acting was well received by audiences and critics at the time, and during the silent era he avoided being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] as a [[Latin lover (stereotype)|Latin lover]]. One theater owner in Golden City, Montana said, \"[Norton] has as yet to show me a bad performance. There's a boy that is a 'natural'.\"<ref>[http://www.cinemaweb.com/silentfilm/bookshelf/16_bor_4.htm#83 Profile], cinemaweb.com; accessed July 4, 2015.</ref>\n\nIn the early 1930s, Norton could still get leading roles in major films. Major Hollywood studios started producing alternate-language versions of their prestige productions, and he became one of dozens of Latino actors needed. ''[[Dr\u00e1cula (1931 Spanish-language film)|Dr\u00e1cula]]'' was one of these films, but Norton also appeared in Spanish-language versions of ''[[Paramount on Parade]]'' (1930), ''[[The Benson Murder Case]]'' (1930), and ''[[The Criminal Code]]'' (1931). In a few cases, he appeared in both versions of a film. Examples include ''Storm Over the Andes'' (Spanish version: ''Alas sobre El Chaco''), ''[[Devil Monster|The Sea Fiend]]'' (''El diablo del Mar''), and ''[[Captain Calamity (film)|Captain Calamity]]'' (''El capitan Tormenta''), the latter film reuniting him with [[Lupita Tovar]], his romantic interest from ''Dracula''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=6YhMoUyUbS4C&pg=PA10 Rodriguez, Clara.

With the decline in Spanish-language film production in Los Angeles, Norton's opportunities for leading roles became less and less frequent. Though he had a pleasing voice, his Argentine accent seemed incongruous with his appearance. According to some sources, he  never mastered English very well.<ref>[http://www.ovguide.com/celebrity/barry_norton.htm Barry Norton Video] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5vrNpKCa8?url=http://www.ovguide.com/celebrity/barry_norton.htm |date=19 January 2011 }}</ref> In 1933, he secured what would be his last important role, playing [[Jean Parker]]'s Spanish fianc\u00e9 in [[Frank Capra]]'s ''[[Lady for a Day]]'' (1933).

For the rest of his career, Norton continued to reside in Los Angeles and obtain small roles in films. Many films he appeared in are now considered to be classics.\n\n==Personal life==\nNorton was married to Josephine Byers, a woman from [[California]] by whom he had a daughter, Sharon, and two grandchildren.

It is the binary decision rule used most often in influential decision-making bodies, including all \nthe [[legislature]]s of [[Electoral democracy|democratic nation]]s.\n\n== Distinction with plurality ==\nThough [[Plurality voting system|plurality]] (first-past-the post) is often mistaken for majority rule, they are not the same.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" /> Plurality makes the option with the most votes the winner, regardless of whether the fifty percent threshold is passed. This is equivalent to majority rule when there are only two alternatives. However, when there are more than two alternatives, it is possible for plurality to choose an alternative that has less than fifty percent of the votes cast in its favor.\n\n== Use ==\n\nMajority rule is used pervasively in many modern western democracies. It is frequently used in legislatures and other bodies in which alternatives can be considered and amended in a process of deliberation until the final version of a proposal is adopted or rejected by majority rule.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" /> It is one of the basic rules prescribed in books like ''[[Robert's Rules of Order]]''.<ref>{{Cite book|title = Robert's Rules of Order Newly Revised|last = Robert|first = Henry M.|publisher = Da Capo Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978-0-306-82020-5|location = Philadelphia, PA|pages = 4|edition = 11th|quote = The basic principle of decision in a [[deliberative assembly]] is that, to become the act or choice of the body, a proposition must be adopted by a ''majority vote''. . .|ref = harv|display-authors=etal}}</ref> The rules in such books and those rules adopted by groups may additionally prescribe the use of a [[Supermajority|supermajoritarian]] rule under certain circumstances, such as a two-thirds rule to close debate.<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Robert|2011|p = 401}}</ref>\n\nMany [[referendum]]s are decided by majority rule.\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== May's Theorem ===\n{{main|May's Theorem}}\nAccording to [[Kenneth May]], majority rule is the only reasonable decision rule that is \"fair\", that is, that does not privilege voters by letting some votes count for more or privilege an alternative by requiring fewer votes for its passing. Stated more formally, majority rule is the only binary decision rule that has the following properties:<ref name=\"May\">{{cite journal |jstor = 1907651|title = A Set of Independent Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for Simple Majority Decision|journal = Econometrica|volume = 20|issue = 4|pages = 680\u2013684|last1 = May|first1 = Kenneth O.|year = 1952|doi = 10.2307/1907651}}</ref><ref name=\"Fey\">Mark Fey, \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20030806231803/http://troi.cc.rochester.edu/~markfey/papers/May.pdf May's Theorem with an Infinite Population]\", ''Social Choice and Welfare'', 2004, Vol. 23, issue 2, pages 275\u2013293.</ref>\n\n* '''Fairness:''' This can be further separated into two properties:\n** '''Anonymity:''' The decision rule treats each voter identically. When using majority rule, it makes no difference who casts a vote; indeed the voter's identity need not even be known.\n** '''Neutrality:''' The decision rule treats each alternative equally. This is unlike [[Supermajority|supermajoritarian]] rules, which can allow an alternative that has received fewer votes to win.\n* '''Decisiveness:''' The decision rule selects a unique winner.\n* '''Monotonicity:''' The decision rule would always, if a voter were to change a preference, select the alternative that the voter preferred, if that alternative would have won before the change in preference. Similarly, the decision rule would never, if a voter were to change a preference, select a candidate the voter did not prefer, if that alternative would not have won before the change in preference.\n\nStrictly speaking, it has been shown that majority rule meets these criteria only if the number of voters is odd or infinite. If the number of voters is even, there is the chance that there will be a tie, and so the criterion of neutrality is not met. Many deliberative bodies reduce one participant's voting capacity\u2014namely, they allow the chair to vote only to break ties. This substitutes a loss of total anonymity for the loss of neutrality.\n\n=== Other properties ===\nIn group decision-making it is possible for a [[voting paradox]] to form. That is, it is possible that there are alternatives a, b, and c such that a majority prefers a to b, another majority prefers b to c, and yet another majority prefers c to a.\nBecause majority rule requires an alternative to have only majority support to pass, a majority under majority rule is especially vulnerable to having its decision overturned. (The minimum number of alternatives that can form such a cycle (voting paradox) is 3 if the number of voters is different from 4, because the [[Nakamura number]] of the majority rule is 3. For supermajority rules the minimum number is often greater, because the Nakamura number is often greater.)\n\nAs Rae argued and Taylor proved in 1969, majority rule is the rule that maximizes the likelihood that the issues a voter votes for will pass and that the issues a voter votes against will fail.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\nSchmitz and Tr\u00f6ger (2012) consider a collective choice problem with two alternatives and they show that the majority rule maximizes utilitarian welfare among all incentive compatible, anonymous, and neutral voting rules, provided that the voters\u2019 types are independent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|last2=Tr\u00f6ger|first2=Thomas|date=2012|title=The (sub-)optimality of the majority rule|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=74|issue=2|pages=651\u2013665|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2011.08.002|issn=0899-8256|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/32716/1/MPRA_paper_32716.pdf}}</ref> Yet, when the voters\u02bc utilities are stochastically correlated, other dominant-strategy choice rules may perform better than the majority rule. Azrieli and Kim (2014) extend the analysis for the case of independent types to asymmetric environments and by considering both anonymous and non-anonymous rules.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Azrieli|first=Yaron|last2=Kim|first2=Semin|date=2014|title=Pareto efficiency and weighted majority rules|journal=International Economic Review|language=en|volume=55|issue=4|pages=1067\u20131088|doi=10.1111/iere.12083|issn=0020-6598}}</ref> \n\n== Limitations ==\n\n=== Arguments for limitations ===\n\n==== Minority rights ====\n\nBecause a majority can win a vote under majority rule, it has been commonly argued that majority rule can lead to a \"[tyranny of the majority]\". Supermajoritarian rules, such as the three-fifths supermajority rule required to end a [[filibuster]] in the [[United States Senate]], have been proposed as preventative measures of this problem. Other experts argue that this solution is questionable. Supermajority rules do not guarantee that it is a minority that will be protected by the supermajority rule; they only establish that one of two alternatives is the [[status quo]], and privilege it against being overturned by a mere majority. To use the example of the US Senate, if a majority votes against [[cloture]], then the filibuster will continue, even though a minority supports it. Anthony McGann argues that when there are multiple minorities and one is protected (or privileged) by the supermajority rule, there is no guarantee that the protected minority won't be one that is already privileged, and if nothing else it will be the one that has the privilege of being aligned with the status quo.<ref name=\"Tyranny\">{{cite journal | url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=csd | title = The Tyranny of the Supermajority: How Majority Rule Protects Minorities | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | author = Anthony J.

Inalienable rights, including who can vote, which cannot be transgressed by a majority, can be decided beforehand as a separate act,<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EMB-F6Forx8C&pg=PA223 |page=223 |title=Democracy and the Rule of Law |isbn=9780521532662 |last1=Przeworski |first1=Adam |last2=Maravall |first2=Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda |date=2003-07-21 }}</ref> by charter or constitution. Thereafter, any decision that unfairly targets a minority's right could be said to be [[majoritarian]], but would not be a legitimate example of a majority decision because it would violate the requirement for [[civil rights|equal rights]]. In response, advocates of unfettered majority rule argue that because the procedure that privileges constitutional rights is generally some sort of supermajoritarian rule, this solution inherits whatever problems this rule would have. They also add the following: First, constitutional rights, being words on paper, cannot by themselves offer protection. Second, under some circumstances, the rights of one person cannot be guaranteed without making an imposition on someone else; as Anthony McGann wrote, \"one man's right to property in the antebellum South was another man's slavery\". Finally, as [[Amartya Sen]] stated when presenting the [[liberal paradox]], a proliferation of rights may make everyone worse off.<ref name=\"Logic\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iv1sTJtPEp8C |title = The Logic of Democracy: Reconciling Equality, Deliberation, and Minority Protection|isbn = 0472069497|last1 = McGann|first1 = Anthony J.|year = 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Erroneous priorities====\nThe '''erroneous priorities effect''' ('''EPE''') states that groups acting upon what they initially consider important are almost always misplacing their effort. When groups do this they have not yet determined which factors are most influential in their potential to achieve desired change.  Only after identifying those factors are they ready to take effective action. EPE was discovered by [[Kevin Dye]] after extensive research at the [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>Dye, K.M. and Conaway, D.S. (1999) 'Lessons learned from five years of application of the cogniscope', Approach to the Food and Drug Administration, CWA Report, Interactive Management Consultants, Paoli.</ref><ref name=\"collective wisdom\">{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/about/How_People_Harness_Their_Collective_Wisd.html?id=k3vvYZLBhS8C |last=Dye |first=K. |year=1999 |chapter=Dye's law of requisite evolution of observations |editor-last=Christakis |editor-first= A.N. |editor-last2=Bausch |editor-first2=K. |title=How People Harness their Collective Wisdom and Power |page=166\u2013169 }}</ref> The discovery of EPE led to the recognition that even with good intentions for [[participatory democracy]], people cannot collectively take effective actions unless they change the paradigm for languaging and voting.<ref>Flanagan, T.R., and Christakis, A.N. (2010) The Talking Point: Creating an Environment for ExploringComplex Meaning, Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, CT.</ref> EPE is a negative consequence of phenomena such as [[spreadthink]] and [[groupthink]]. Effective priorities for actions that are dependent on recognizing the influence patterns of global interdependencies, are defeated by the EPE, when priorities are chosen on the basis of aggregating individual stakeholder subjective voting that is largely blind to those interdependencies. Dye's work resulted in the discovery of the 6th law of the science of [[structured dialogic design]],<ref name=\"collective wisdom\"/> namely: \"Learning occurs in a dialogue as the observers search for influence relationships among the members of a set of observations.\"\n\n==== Other arguments for limitations ====\n\nSome argue that majority rule can lead to poor deliberation practice or even to \"an aggressive culture and conflict\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consens#wrong| title = What's wrong with majority voting?| accessdate = 2006-01-17 | year = 2005 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  Seeds for Change}}</ref> Along these lines, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} have asserted that majority rule fails to measure the [[intensity of preference]]s. For example, the authors of ''An Anarchist Critique of Democracy'' argue that \"two voters who are casually interested in doing something\" can defeat one voter who has \"dire opposition\" to the proposal of the two.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thoughtcrime.org/writings/democracy.html | title = An Anarchist Critique of Democracy | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | year = 2005 | website = | publisher = |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080429224620/http://www.thoughtcrime.org/writings/democracy.html |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}</ref>\n\nVoting theorists have often claimed that cycling leads to debilitating instability.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" /> Buchanan and Tullock argue that unanimity is the only decision rule that guarantees economic efficiency.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\nSupermajority rules are often used in binary decisions where a positive decision is weightier than a negative one. Under the standard definition of special majority voting, a positive decision is made if and only if a substantial portion of the votes support that decision\u2014for example, two thirds or three fourths.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008|reason=What is the standard definition of special majority voting? Who defined it?}} For example, US jury decisions require the support of at least 10 of 12 jurors, or even unanimous support. This supermajoritarian concept follows directly from the [[presumption of innocence]] on which the US legal system is based. [[Rousseau]] advocated the use of supermajority voting on important decisions when he said, \"The more the deliberations are important and serious, the more the opinion that carries should approach unanimity.\"<ref>Rousseau. The Social Contract. bk. 4, ch. 2.</ref>\n\n=== Arguments against limitations ===\n\n==== Minority rights ====\n\nMcGann argues that majority rule helps to protect [[minority rights]], at least in settings in which deliberation occurs. The argument is that cycling ensures that parties that lose to a majority have an interest to remain part of the group's process, because the decision can easily be overturned by another majority. Furthermore, if a minority wishes to overturn a decision, it needs to form a coalition with only enough of the group members to ensure that more than half approves of the new proposal. (Under supermajority rules, a minority might need a coalition consisting of something greater than a majority to overturn a decision.)<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\nTo support the view that majority rule protects minority rights better than supermajority rules McGann points to the cloture rule in the US Senate, which was used to prevent the extension of civil liberties to racial minorities.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" /> Ben Saunders, while agreeing that majority rule may offer better protection than supermajority rules, argues that majority rule may nonetheless be of little help to the most despised minorities in a group.<ref name=\"Saunders\">{{cite web | url = https://oxford.academia.edu/documents/BenSaunders_SubmittedThesis.pdf | title = Democracy-as-Fairness: Justice, Equal Chances, and Lotteries | accessdate = September 8, 2013 | author = Ben Saunders | year = 2008 | website = | publisher = |archivedate=September 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910032028/http://oxford.academia.edu/documents/BenSaunders_SubmittedThesis.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==== Other arguments against limitations ====\nSome argue{{Who|date=April 2010}} that deliberative democracy flourishes under majority rule. They argue that under majority rule, participants always have to convince more than half the group at the very least, while under supermajoritarian rules participants might only need to persuade a minority.<ref name=\"Saunders\" /> Furthermore, proponents argue that cycling gives participants an interest to compromise, rather than strive to pass resolutions that only have the bare minimum required to \"win\".<ref name=\"Logic\" />\n\nAnother argument for majority rule is that within this atmosphere of compromise, there will be times when a minority faction will want to support the proposal of another faction in exchange for support of a proposal it believes to be vital. Because it would be in the best interest of such a faction to report the true intensity of its preference, so the argument goes, majority rule differentiates weak and strong preferences. McGann argues that situations such as these give minorities incentive to participate, because there are few permanent losers under majority rule, and so majority rule leads to systemic stability. He points to governments that use majority rule which largely goes unchecked\u2014the governments of the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], and [[Sweden]], for example\u2014as empirical evidence of majority rule's stability.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeal to the majority]]\n* [[Arrow's theorem]]\n* [[Condorcet's jury theorem]]\n* [[Majority criterion]]\n* [[Majority loser criterion]]\n* [[Mutual majority criterion]]\n* [[Majoritarianism]]\n* [[Majoritarian democracy]]\n* [[No independence before majority rule]] (NIBMAR)\n* [[Ochlocracy]]\n* [[Quadratic voting]]\n* [[Voting paradox]]\n* [[Voting system criterion]]\n* [[Voting system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Black | first = Duncan | title = The theory of committees and elections | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1958 | oclc = 387017 }}\n* {{cite thesis | degree = D.Phil. | last = Farquharson | first = Robin | date = 1969 | title = Theory of voting | publisher = [[Oxford University]] | oclc = 51803346 | isbn = 9780300011210 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/theoryofvoting00farq }}\n* {{cite book | last = Volk | first = Kyle | title = Moral minorities and the making of American democracy | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780199371914 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Corneo | first1 = Giacomo | last2 = Neher | first2 = Frank | title = Democratic redistribution and rule of the majority | journal = [[European Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 40 | issue = A | pages = 96\u2013109 | doi= 10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.08.003 | date = December 2015 | ref = harv | url = https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp5112.pdf }}\n\n{{voting systems}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Monotonic electoral systems]]\n[[Category:Voting theory]]\n", "text_old": "{{Globalize|article|Western culture|date=July 2018}}\n{{short description|Decision rule that selects alternatives which have a majority}}\n{{for2|the Canadian comedy series|[[Majority Rules!]]|the band|[[Majority Rule (band)]]}}\n{{Democracy}}\n{{Electoral systems}}\n{{Politics}}\n'''Majority rule''' is a decision rule that selects alternatives which have a [[majority]], that is, more than half the votes.

Many deliberative bodies reduce one participant's voting capacity\u2014namely, they allow the chair to vote only to break ties. This substitutes a loss of total anonymity for the loss of neutrality.\n\n=== Other properties ===\nIn group decision-making it is possible for a [[voting paradox]] to form. That is, it is possible that there are alternatives a, b, and c such that a majority prefers a to b, another majority prefers b to c, and yet another majority prefers c to a.\nBecause majority rule requires an alternative to have only majority support to pass, a majority under majority rule is especially vulnerable to having its decision overturned. (The minimum number of alternatives that can form such a cycle (voting paradox) is 3 if the number of voters is different from 4, because the [[Nakamura number]] of the majority rule is 3. For supermajority rules the minimum number is often greater, because the Nakamura number is often greater.)\n\nAs Rae argued and Taylor proved in 1969, majority rule is the rule that maximizes the likelihood that the issues a voter votes for will pass and that the issues a voter votes against will fail.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\nSchmitz and Tr\u00f6ger (2012) consider a collective choice problem with two alternatives and they show that the majority rule maximizes utilitarian welfare among all incentive compatible, anonymous, and neutral voting rules, provided that the voters\u2019 types are independent.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schmitz|first=Patrick W.|last2=Tr\u00f6ger|first2=Thomas|date=2012|title=The (sub-)optimality of the majority rule|journal=Games and Economic Behavior|volume=74|issue=2|pages=651\u2013665|doi=10.1016/j.geb.2011.08.002|issn=0899-8256|url=https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/32716/1/MPRA_paper_32716.pdf}}</ref> Yet, when the voters\u02bc utilities are stochastically correlated, other dominant-strategy choice rules may perform better than the majority rule.

Supermajoritarian rules, such as the three-fifths supermajority rule required to end a [[filibuster]] in the [[United States Senate]], have been proposed as preventative measures of this problem. Other experts argue that this solution is questionable. Supermajority rules do not guarantee that it is a minority that will be protected by the supermajority rule; they only establish that one of two alternatives is the [[status quo]], and privilege it against being overturned by a mere majority. To use the example of the US Senate, if a majority votes against [[cloture]], then the filibuster will continue, even though a minority supports it. Anthony McGann argues that when there are multiple minorities and one is protected (or privileged) by the supermajority rule, there is no guarantee that the protected minority won't be one that is already privileged, and if nothing else it will be the one that has the privilege of being aligned with the status quo.<ref name=\"Tyranny\">{{cite journal | url = http://repositories.cdlib.org/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1001&context=csd | title = The Tyranny of the Supermajority: How Majority Rule Protects Minorities | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | author = Anthony J.

Thereafter, any decision that unfairly targets a minority's right could be said to be [[majoritarian]], but would not be a legitimate example of a majority decision because it would violate the requirement for [[civil rights|equal rights]]. In response, advocates of unfettered majority rule argue that because the procedure that privileges constitutional rights is generally some sort of supermajoritarian rule, this solution inherits whatever problems this rule would have. They also add the following: First, constitutional rights, being words on paper, cannot by themselves offer protection. Second, under some circumstances, the rights of one person cannot be guaranteed without making an imposition on someone else; as Anthony McGann wrote, \"one man's right to property in the antebellum South was another man's slavery\". Finally, as [[Amartya Sen]] stated when presenting the [[liberal paradox]], a proliferation of rights may make everyone worse off.<ref name=\"Logic\">{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iv1sTJtPEp8C |title = The Logic of Democracy: Reconciling Equality, Deliberation, and Minority Protection|isbn = 0472069497|last1 = McGann|first1 = Anthony J.|year = 2006}}</ref>\n\n====Erroneous priorities====\nThe '''erroneous priorities effect''' ('''EPE''') states that groups acting upon what they initially consider important are almost always misplacing their effort. When groups do this they have not yet determined which factors are most influential in their potential to achieve desired change.  Only after identifying those factors are they ready to take effective action. EPE was discovered by [[Kevin Dye]] after extensive research at the [[Food and Drug Administration]].<ref>Dye, K.M. and Conaway, D.S.

(2010) The Talking Point: Creating an Environment for ExploringComplex Meaning, Information Age Publishing, Greenwich, CT.</ref> EPE is a negative consequence of phenomena such as [[spreadthink]] and [[groupthink]]. Effective priorities for actions that are dependent on recognizing the influence patterns of global interdependencies, are defeated by the EPE, when priorities are chosen on the basis of aggregating individual stakeholder subjective voting that is largely blind to those interdependencies. Dye's work resulted in the discovery of the 6th law of the science of [[structured dialogic design]],<ref name=\"collective wisdom\"/> namely: \"Learning occurs in a dialogue as the observers search for influence relationships among the members of a set of observations.\"\n\n==== Other arguments for limitations ====\n\nSome argue that majority rule can lead to poor deliberation practice or even to \"an aggressive culture and conflict\".<ref>{{cite web | url = http://seedsforchange.org.uk/free/consens#wrong| title = What's wrong with majority voting?| accessdate = 2006-01-17 | year = 2005 | work = Consensus Decision Making | publisher =  Seeds for Change}}</ref> Along these lines, some{{Who|date=April 2010}} have asserted that majority rule fails to measure the [[intensity of preference]]s. For example, the authors of ''An Anarchist Critique of Democracy'' argue that \"two voters who are casually interested in doing something\" can defeat one voter who has \"dire opposition\" to the proposal of the two.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.thoughtcrime.org/writings/democracy.html | title = An Anarchist Critique of Democracy | accessdate = 2008-06-09 | year = 2005 | website = | publisher = |archiveurl = https://archive.is/20080429224620/http://www.thoughtcrime.org/writings/democracy.html |archivedate = 2008-04-29}}</ref>\n\nVoting theorists have often claimed that cycling leads to debilitating instability.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" /> Buchanan and Tullock argue that unanimity is the only decision rule that guarantees economic efficiency.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\nSupermajority rules are often used in binary decisions where a positive decision is weightier than a negative one. Under the standard definition of special majority voting, a positive decision is made if and only if a substantial portion of the votes support that decision\u2014for example, two thirds or three fourths.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008|reason=What is the standard definition of special majority voting? Who defined it?}} For example, US jury decisions require the support of at least 10 of 12 jurors, or even unanimous support. This supermajoritarian concept follows directly from the [[presumption of innocence]] on which the US legal system is based. [[Rousseau]] advocated the use of supermajority voting on important decisions when he said, \"The more the deliberations are important and serious, the more the opinion that carries should approach unanimity.\"<ref>Rousseau. The Social Contract. bk. 4, ch. 2.</ref>\n\n=== Arguments against limitations ===\n\n==== Minority rights ====\n\nMcGann argues that majority rule helps to protect [[minority rights]], at least in settings in which deliberation occurs. The argument is that cycling ensures that parties that lose to a majority have an interest to remain part of the group's process, because the decision can easily be overturned by another majority. Furthermore, if a minority wishes to overturn a decision, it needs to form a coalition with only enough of the group members to ensure that more than half approves of the new proposal. (Under supermajority rules, a minority might need a coalition consisting of something greater than a majority to overturn a decision.)<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\nTo support the view that majority rule protects minority rights better than supermajority rules McGann points to the cloture rule in the US Senate, which was used to prevent the extension of civil liberties to racial minorities.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" /> Ben Saunders, while agreeing that majority rule may offer better protection than supermajority rules, argues that majority rule may nonetheless be of little help to the most despised minorities in a group.<ref name=\"Saunders\">{{cite web | url = https://oxford.academia.edu/documents/BenSaunders_SubmittedThesis.pdf | title = Democracy-as-Fairness: Justice, Equal Chances, and Lotteries | accessdate = September 8, 2013 | author = Ben Saunders | year = 2008 | website = | publisher = |archivedate=September 10, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080910032028/http://oxford.academia.edu/documents/BenSaunders_SubmittedThesis.pdf }}</ref>\n\n==== Other arguments against limitations ====\nSome argue{{Who|date=April 2010}} that deliberative democracy flourishes under majority rule. They argue that under majority rule, participants always have to convince more than half the group at the very least, while under supermajoritarian rules participants might only need to persuade a minority.<ref name=\"Saunders\" /> Furthermore, proponents argue that cycling gives participants an interest to compromise, rather than strive to pass resolutions that only have the bare minimum required to \"win\".<ref name=\"Logic\" />\n\nAnother argument for majority rule is that within this atmosphere of compromise, there will be times when a minority faction will want to support the proposal of another faction in exchange for support of a proposal it believes to be vital. Because it would be in the best interest of such a faction to report the true intensity of its preference, so the argument goes, majority rule differentiates weak and strong preferences. McGann argues that situations such as these give minorities incentive to participate, because there are few permanent losers under majority rule, and so majority rule leads to systemic stability. He points to governments that use majority rule which largely goes unchecked\u2014the governments of the [[Netherlands]], [[Austria]], and [[Sweden]], for example\u2014as empirical evidence of majority rule's stability.<ref name=\"Tyranny\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[Appeal to the majority]]\n* [[Arrow's theorem]]\n* [[Condorcet's jury theorem]]\n* [[Majority criterion]]\n* [[Majority loser criterion]]\n* [[Mutual majority criterion]]\n* [[Majoritarianism]]\n* [[Majoritarian democracy]]\n* [[No independence before majority rule]] (NIBMAR)\n* [[Ochlocracy]]\n* [[Quadratic voting]]\n* [[Voting paradox]]\n* [[Voting system criterion]]\n* [[Voting system]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book | last = Black | first = Duncan | title = The theory of committees and elections | publisher = Cambridge University Press | location = Cambridge | year = 1958 | oclc = 387017 }}\n* {{cite thesis | degree = D.Phil. | last = Farquharson | first = Robin | date = 1969 | title = Theory of voting | publisher = [[Oxford University]] | oclc = 51803346 | isbn = 9780300011210 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/theoryofvoting00farq }}\n* {{cite book | last = Volk | first = Kyle | title = Moral minorities and the making of American democracy | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford | year = 2014 | isbn = 9780199371914 }}\n* {{cite journal | last1 = Corneo | first1 = Giacomo | last2 = Neher | first2 = Frank | title = Democratic redistribution and rule of the majority | journal = [[European Journal of Political Economy]] | volume = 40 | issue = A | pages = 96\u2013109 | doi= 10.1016/j.ejpoleco.2015.08.003 | date = December 2015 | ref = harv | url = https://www.cesifo-group.de/DocDL/cesifo1_wp5112.pdf }}\n\n{{voting systems}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Monotonic electoral systems]]\n[[Category:Voting theory]]\n", "name_user": "Nihiltres", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:Simplified hatnote syntax", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Majority_rule"}

Such borders are mostly located in Africa and southern Asia. The [[Vienna Convention on Road Traffic]] regulates the use of foreign registered vehicles in the 78 countries that have ratified it.\n\nLHT Thailand has three RHT neighbours: Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar.

Please do not change this spelling to curb.** -->\nIn RHT jurisdictions, vehicles are configured with LHD, with the steering wheel on the left side. In LHT jurisdictions, the reverse is true. The driver's side, the side closest to the centre of the road, is sometimes called the ''offside'', while the passenger side, the side closest to the side of the road, is sometimes called the ''nearside''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reverso.net/english-cobuild/nearside |title=Nearside (dictionary definition) |publisher=Dictionary.reverso.net |accessdate=12 December 2010}}</ref><!-- This article uses UK English. -->\n\nMost windscreen wipers are designed to clear the driver's side better and have a longer blade on the driver's side<ref>{{cite web |last1=Unrau |first1=Jason |title=Why Is One Wiper Blade Longer Than the Other? |url=https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/why-is-one-wiper-blade-longer-than-the-other |website=Your Mechanic |accessdate=15 April 2019}}</ref> and wipe up from the passenger side to the driver's side. Thus on LHD configurations, they wipe up from right to left, viewed from inside the vehicle, and do the opposite on RHD vehicles.\n\nHistorically there was less consistency in the relationship of the position of the driver to the handedness of traffic. Most American cars produced before 1910 were RHD.<ref name=\"On The Right Side of the Road\"/> In 1908 [[Henry Ford]] standardised the [[Model T]] as LHD in RHT America,<ref name=\"On The Right Side of the Road\"/> arguing that with RHD and RHT, the passenger was obliged to \"get out on the street side and walk around the car\" and that with steering from the left, the driver \"is able to see even the wheels of the other car and easily avoids danger.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Miller|first1=Wayne|title=Car Crazy: The Battle for Supremacy between Ford and Olds and the Dawn of the Automobile Age|date=2015|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=9781610395526|page=279|url=https://books.google.com/?id=JgIrCgAAQBAJ&pg=PR4&dq=car+crazy+wayne+miller|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> By 1915 other manufacturers followed Ford's lead, due to the popularity of the Model T.<ref name=\"On The Right Side of the Road\"/>\n\nIn specialised cases, the driver will sit on the nearside, or kerbside. Examples include:\n*Where the driver needs a good view of the nearside, e.g. [[street sweeper]]s, or vehicles driven along unstable road edges.<ref>[http://www.lhdspecialist.com/location_of_the_steering_wheel.php LHD Specialist: Location of the Steering Wheel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110921030931/http://www.lhdspecialist.com/location_of_the_steering_wheel.php |date=21 September 2011 }}</ref>\n*Where it is more convenient for the driver to be on the nearside, e.g. delivery vehicles.

However, in many cases, railways were built using LHT British technology and, while road traffic switched to RHT, rail remained LHT. Examples include: Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Egypt, France, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Laos, Monaco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Yemen. In Indonesia it is the reverse (RHT for rails (even for LRT systems) and LHT for roads). France is mainly LHT for trains, except for the classic lines in [[Alsace-Lorraine]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Strasbourg to Paris Driver's eye view PREVIEW |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOJZ9imhq8 |via=YouTube |publisher=Video 125 |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> which belonged to Germany from 1870 to 1918, when the railways were built, along with most metro systems. China is basically LHT for long-distance trains and RHT for metro systems. Spain, which is RHT for railways has LHT for metros in Madrid and Bilbao. Metros and light rail sides of operation vary, and might not match railways or roads in their country. Trams generally operate at the same side as other road traffic because they frequently share roads.\n\n==Boat traffic==\n[[File:Riverine Patrol Boat Cockpit Console.jpg|thumb|]]\n\nBoats are traditionally piloted from [[starboard]] to facilitate [[priority to the right]]. \nAccording to the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]] (the right-hand side), and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. For aircraft the US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water, and in aircraft with side-by-side cockpit seating, the pilot-in-command (or more senior flight officer) traditionally occupies the left seat.<ref>[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/2EA99FD06D59A9BC852566CF00614DEA FAR Sec. 91.115](c): \"When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to the right to keep well clear.\"</ref>\n\n==Worldwide distribution by country==\n[[Image:Driving standards historic.png|thumb|Countries with left- and right-hand traffic, currently and formerly.

Conversely, many RHT countries were part of the [[French colonial empire]].\n\nIn LHT traffic keeps left, and cars have the steering wheel on the right, putting the driver on the side closest to the centre of the road. [[Roundabout]]s circulate clockwise. In RHT everything is reversed: traffic keeps right, the driver sits on the left side of the car, and roundabouts circulate counterclockwise.\n\nIn most countries rail traffic follows the handedness of the roads, although many of the countries that switched road traffic from LHT to RHT did not switch their trains. Boat traffic on rivers is effectively RHT. Boats are traditionally piloted from the [[starboard]] side to facilitate [[priority to the right]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==History==\nHistorically, many places kept left, while many others kept right, often within the same country. There are many myths which attempt to explain why one or the other is preferred.<ref name=\"mcmanus\"/> About 90 percent of people are right handed,<ref>{{cite web |last1=Searing |first1=Linda |title=The Big Number: Lefties make up about 10 percent of the world |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/the-big-number-lefties-make-up-about-10-percent-of-the-world/2019/08/09/69978100-b9e2-11e9-bad6-609f75bfd97f_story.html |website=Washington Post |accessdate=27 November 2019 |language=en}}</ref> and many explanations reference this. Horses are traditionally mounted from the left, and led from the left, with the reins in the right hand. So people walking horses might use RHT, to keep the animals separated. Also referenced is the need for pedestrians to keep their swords in the right hand and pass on the left as in LHT, for self-defence. It has been suggested that wagon-drivers whipped their horses with their right hand, and thus sat on the left hand side of the wagon, as in RHT. It has been written that in the year 1300, [[Pope Boniface VIII]] directed pilgrims to keep left, however it has also been written that he directed them to keep to the right, and there is no documentary evidence to back either claim.<ref name=\"mcmanus\"/>\n\n===Europe===\n[[File:Danish motorcyclists about to cross the border between Sweden and Norway in 1934.png|thumb|right|Border between Sweden and Norway in 1934]]\n[[File:Kungsgatan 1967.jpg|thumb|Traffic moves from left to right in [[Stockholm]], Sweden, on 3 September 1967]]\n\nThe first reference in [[English law]] to LHT was in 1756, with regard to [[London Bridge]].<ref name=\"hamer\">{{cite journal|last1=Hamer|first1=Mike|date=25 December 1986 \u2013 1 January 1987|title=Left is right on the road|url=https://books.google.com/?id=qfak8nsMNGIC&pg=PA16#v=onepage|journal=New Scientist|issue=20 December 1986/1 January 1987|pages=16\u201318|accessdate=7 October 2016}}</ref>{{Better source|date=February 2020}}\n\nA frequently-heard story is that Napoleon changed the custom from LHT to RHT in France and the countries he conquered after the [[French Revolution]].

However, in many cases, railways were built using LHT British technology and, while road traffic switched to RHT, rail remained LHT. Examples include: Argentina, Belgium, Bolivia, Cambodia, Chile, Egypt, France, Iraq, Israel, Italy, Laos, Monaco, Myanmar, Nigeria, Peru, Portugal, Senegal, Slovenia, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Tunisia, Venezuela, and Yemen. In Indonesia it is the reverse (RHT for rails (even for LRT systems) and LHT for roads). France is mainly LHT for trains, except for the classic lines in [[Alsace-Lorraine]],<ref>{{cite web |title=Strasbourg to Paris Driver's eye view PREVIEW |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EdOJZ9imhq8 |via=YouTube |publisher=Video 125 |accessdate=11 March 2019}}</ref> which belonged to Germany from 1870 to 1918, when the railways were built, along with most metro systems. China is basically LHT for long-distance trains and RHT for metro systems. Spain, which is RHT for railways has LHT for metros in Madrid and Bilbao. Metros and light rail sides of operation vary, and might not match railways or roads in their country. Trams generally operate at the same side as other road traffic because they frequently share roads.\n\n==Boat traffic==\n[[File:Riverine Patrol Boat Cockpit Console.jpg|thumb|]]\n\nBoats are traditionally piloted from [[starboard]] to facilitate [[priority to the right]]. \nAccording to the [[International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea]], water traffic is effectively RHT: a vessel proceeding along a narrow channel must keep to [[starboard]] (the right-hand side), and when two power-driven vessels are meeting head-on both must alter course to starboard also. For aircraft the US [[Federal Aviation Regulations]] suggest RHT principles, both in the air and on water, and in aircraft with side-by-side cockpit seating, the pilot-in-command (or more senior flight officer) traditionally occupies the left seat.<ref>[http://www.airweb.faa.gov/REGULATORY_AND_GUIDANCE_LIBRARY%5CRGFAR.NSF/0/2EA99FD06D59A9BC852566CF00614DEA FAR Sec. 91.115](c): \"When aircraft, or an aircraft and a vessel, are approaching head-on, or nearly so, each shall alter its course to the right to keep well clear.\"</ref>\n\n==Worldwide distribution by country==\n[[Image:Driving standards historic.png|thumb|Countries with left- and right-hand traffic, currently and formerly.

It began as a railway from [[Clifton, Greater Manchester|Clifton]] via [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] to [[Rawtenstall]], and during its short life grew into a complex network of lines connecting towns and cities including [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Blackburn]].\n\nDuring a period of rapid growth the company acquired several of its competitors, including the [[Blackburn and Preston Railway]], which it purchased to gain access to Preston.  It faced competition from companies such as the [[North Union Railway]], and was involved in a notable stand-off in 1849 with the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]. Following several years of discussions, the East Lancashire Railway was in 1859 amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.  Parts of the network remain in use today, and a section of the original line between Bury and Rawtenstall is now operated as a [[heritage railway]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Manchester and Bolton Railway ===\n{{Main|Manchester and Bolton Railway}}\nIn 1830, the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal|Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Company]] began to promote the construction of a railway along the line of their canal from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], to [[Bolton]] and Bury.<ref name=\"Hadfieldpp256257\">{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1970|pp=256\u2013257.}}</ref>  Following an [[act of parliament]] to enable them to become a railway company,<ref name=\"Hadfieldpp256257\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Paget-Tomlinson|2006|pp=148\u2013149.}}</ref> they built their line from Manchester to Bolton, although on a slightly different alignment than was first planned.

A second BBA&CER act allowed it to lease or sell itself to the MB&RR, and so <!-- on 24 July 1845? -->in 1845 the two companies joined.  The MB&RR later that year changed its name to the East Lancashire Railway (ELR).<ref name=\"Broadbridgepp1819\"/>\n\nThe following year, the ELR acquired the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]] (LO&PR),<ref name=\"Scrivenorp13\"/><ref>9 & 10 Vict. c. 381</ref> which gave it direct access to [[Liverpool Docks]].  The LO&PR's line would run from a junction with the [[Liverpool and Bury Railway]] at Walton-on-the-Hill<!-- not the one in Surrey --> to a junction with the B&PR.  The enabling act also allowed the LO&PR to build further branch lines, and the ELR obtained further acts including one which allowed it to build a connection to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].<ref name=\"Broadbridgepp1819\"/>  Following the acquisition on 3 August 1846,<ref>{{Harvnb|Greville|Holt|1960a|pp=99\u2013100.}}</ref> a disagreement ensued over traffic priorities and arrangements for the ELR at the NUR's station in Preston.  The ELR proposed a new station and a separate line with a new crossing of the Ribble, but this proved controversial; Preston Corporation petitioned against the proposed line, producing a series of witnesses who attested to the damage they presumed would be caused by the embankment necessary for the scheme to proceed.  Several members of the corporation were also shareholders of the rival [[Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway]], and the petition's proposer was brother-in-law to a director of the rival [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]].  In the end the ELR won its bid, but had to landscape its embankment (which later became the dividing line between [[Avenham Park|Avenham]] and [[Miller Park, Preston|Miller]] Parks), make an ornamental arch for carriages and pedestrians crossing under the railway, and build a footbridge on the river viaduct.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2001|pp=329\u2013330.}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the former MB&RR line from [[Clifton, Greater Manchester|Clifton]] to [[Rawtenstall]] was inaugurated on Friday 25 September 1846.

Large crowds were gathered along the course of the railway.  In Bury, the train was extended to about 30&nbsp;carriages and three engines, and more passengers were collected before the train finished its journey in Rawtenstall.

The ELR had become accustomed to running their trains on to the L&YR line and then later declaring of the number of passengers liable for a toll but, in March 1849, the L&YR insisted that ELR trains stop at Clifton so that passenger numbers and tickets could be checked by their own employees.  The ELR accused the L&YR of trying to impede their traffic, particularly as they had recently gained a connection to Bradford, in competition with the L&YR.  They stated that the L&YR had access to their accounts, and to the returns made by their staff.<ref name=\"Extraordinary\">{{Citation | title = Extraordinary Scene At A Railway Junction | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/806/402/60276180w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS136216687&dyn=4!zoom_2?sw_aep=mclib | work = [[The Times]] | date = 15 March 1849 | page = 8 | issue = 20124 | volume = F | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 12 March 1849, despite the presence of police from Bury and [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], the L&YR placed a large baulk of timber across the ELR's line at Clifton Junction, effectively blocking it.  Employees from both companies arrived at the scene, and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold.  The L&YR also pulled a train past the junction, blocking the [[Railroad directions#United Kingdom|up line]] to the city.  Its engine was pointed south-east toward Manchester, available to any ELR passengers who wished to continue their journey.  An ELR train arrived from Bury, and stopped.  L&YR employees attempted to take tickets from the ELR's passengers, but were refused, as the ELR had already taken tickets at their Ringley Road station.  ELR employees then removed the baulk of timber, and in an effort to push the L&YR train out of the way, drove their train forward.  The L&YR had anticipated this, and moved another engine (taken from a L&YR train from Manchester) to the front of their Manchester-bound train.  The ELR then blocked the L&YR [[Railroad directions#United Kingdom|down line]] with another of their trains, laden with stone, moving it to a position directly abreast of the L&YR train.  The line remained completely blocked until about mid-day, with a queue of trains from both companies, and from the [[Blackburn and Darwen Railway]], building up on each side of the blockage.  The situation was eventually defused when the L&YR withdrew their train.<ref name=\"Extraordinary\"/>\n\nThe General Manager of the ELR, Richard Hacking, wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper expressing his annoyance at the L&YR's tactics.  He claimed to have received a letter from the company sent on 9 March 1849 informing him of proposed changes to operational procedures resulting from a near-collision at [[Clifton Junction]].  The first change was that ELR trains would at all times give way to L&YR trains on the Manchester and Bolton line; a stop signal was to be placed {{convert|400|yd}} along the ELR line from the junction, to be activated whenever a L&YR train was in sight.  The second change was that \"for the safety of the public\"<ref name=\"Battle\"/> all ELR trains would be required to stop before the [[Railroad switch|points]] at the junction, where all passenger tickets to Manchester would be collected by L&YR employees.  A daily return would be required of all passengers and other freight booked from Salford \"for the purpose of keeping regularly and balancing punctually the accounts of the two companies\".<ref name=\"Battle\"/>  Hacking claimed to have replied stating that the near-collision had occurred because the L&YR's engine driver had ignored a signal at Clifton Junction, and that the ELR would not accept the changes requested by the L&YR. The ELR refused to supply tickets at any point, although they considered it reasonable to supply more information on their traffic using the L&YR line.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{Citation | title = Letters to the Editor - Obstruction of East Lancashire Railway | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS101220463&dyn=12!xrn_34_0_CS101220463&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | last = Hacking | first = Richard | date = 15 March 1849 | volume = F | page = 6 | issue = 20124 | work = [[The Times]] | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clifton viaduct looking north.jpg|centre|700px|thumb|The disused [[Clifton Viaduct]].

In his letter he concluded that the purpose of the L&YR's demands was to impede the flow of ELR traffic to Manchester and onwards to Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Battle\"/>\n\nHacking's account of the events of 12 March is similar to that reported by ''The Times''.  He claims to have travelled to Clifton to witness an L&YR clerk being prevented from collecting tickets, and to have then continued on another train to Manchester.  On his arrival there, he saw L&YR employees ready to pull up the rails to the ELR platform, although the rails were left intact.  He then mentions returning to Clifton after hearing that L&YR employees had recently left for the station.  He blamed the Managing Director of the L&YR, Captain Law, and Mr Blackmore, superintendent of the Bolton line, for ordering theline to be blocked with the baulk of timber.  Hacking also mentions an approaching up-train from Bolton, which on encountering the blockage apparently moved across to the down line to bypass it&nbsp;\u2013 in the face of oncoming traffic.  Expressing his shock, he claims to have ordered the ELR's stone train onto the down line, changing the signals accordingly.  Hacking's account ends by claiming that Blackmore ordered the L&YR train to move, effectively resolving the dispute.<ref name=\"Battle\"/>\n\n[[File:Elr approaching summerseat station.jpg|right|thumb|[[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 45407]] approaching Summerseat station on the [[heritage railway|heritage]] [[East Lancashire Railway]]]]\nThe matter was so serious that it was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>{{Citation | title = House Of Commons | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS50626673&dyn=20!zoom_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 17 March 1849 | page = 3 | issue = 20126 | volume = A | work = [[The Times]] | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  It was eventually settled in court, with the ELR thereon making a [[pro rata]] payment according to the distance travelled on each railway.

Another engine was built by Haigh in 1848.<ref name=\"steamindexl&yr\"/>\n\nThe largest ELR class was a series of outside-frame 2-4-0s with {{convert|15|x|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} cylinders and {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} driving wheels.  Some may have originated as 2-2-2s, and some were later rebuilt as 2-4-0 tank engines.  One was rebuilt as a 2-4-0 [[Tank locomotive#Saddle tank|saddle tank engine]].  These were among the last locomotives to be built in Bury.  Other manufacturers to supply the ELR were [[Sharp, Roberts and Company]], [[Stothert, Slaughter and Company]], and [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]].  The ELR livery for passenger locomotives was dark green with red brown frames, and polished domes and safety valves.<!-- Marshall (3 p. 52) --><ref name=\"steamindexl&yr\"/>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n=== Station buildings ===\n[[File:Ormskirk Station.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ormskirk railway station]] in 1915]]\nStation buildings generally followed one of three designs.  The principal stations at Bury and Accrington were based on the same design by a Manchester-based firm of architects.  Most of the other stations were designed by the company's resident engineer. They were stone-built and consisted of a station master's room, adjoining a seated waiting area, a ladies waiting room and the booking office.  The third and cheapest design followed the standard design but utilised brick and timber as materials.  The platform was normally roofed.<ref name=\"Harrisonsale\"/>\n\n=== Signals ===\nTrack signals were based on two designs\u2014station signals on posts, each post with two moveable arms\u2014and portable signals; flags were used by day, and coloured lanterns at night.  The signals on posts were patented [[railway semaphore signal|semaphore]] designs from J Stevens & Son.  Each post had two arms\u2014linked by chain to a foot control at the base\u2014which were used to alert drivers on both the up and down lines.  Each foot control was held in place by a hook on the post.<!-- source unreadable about horizontal arms - can anyone clarify?-->  An arm set at an angle would indicate that the train should approach slowly, before stopping at the station.  The same arm set vertically (and out of sight) would indicate that the train could pass through without stopping.  The posts were also illuminated to allow use at night.  Signals at Accrington station were more complex, linked to the station building with wires, and by default set at 'stop' when released.  The coloured lanterns used as portable signals were painted red on one side (stop), green on another (go slowly), and clear on the third (proceed).<ref name=\"Harrisonsale\"/>\n\n=== Rails ===\nThe line was [[standard gauge]] and most sections used [[Rail tracks|rails]] in {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} lengths, each weighing 75&nbsp;lb/yard (31.1&nbsp;kg/m), fixed to wooden [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] {{convert|9|ft}} long and {{convert|3|ft}} apart.<ref name=\"Harrisonsale\"/>\n\n== Accidents ==\nIn the early history of the railways accidents were not uncommon, and the ELR was no exception.  Several incidents were reported in ''The Times''. During [[Whitsuntide]] 1849, a passenger train was in a rear-end collision with an excursion train near [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]]. Despite efforts to protect the rear of the passenger train, another excursion train was in a rear-end collision with it.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=25}} In January 1850, three people died when a luggage train ran into a passenger train at [[Maghull railway station]].<ref>{{Citation | title = The Late Accident On The East Lancashire  | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS68452904&dyn=31!xrn_20_0_CS68452904&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 8 January 1850 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 4 | issue = 20380 | volume = F | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  A serious accident occurred at Clifton Junction on 19 October 1851 when a passenger train derailed passing the points on the junction, injuring several passengers, some seriously.<ref>{{Citation | title = Serious Accident On The East Lancashire  | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS85099862&dyn=78!xrn_28_0_CS85099862&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 22 October 1851 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 5 | issue = 20939 | volume = D | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  In September 1866 a man died after jumping from the train from Blackburn.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fatal Accident | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS169124646&dyn=56!xrn_57_0_CS169124646&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 6 September 1866 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 10 | issue = 25596 | volume = B | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  A non-fatal collision occurred at [[Lostock Hall railway station]] in November 1876.<ref>{{Citation | title = Railway Collision | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS151959405&dyn=56!xrn_60_0_CS151959405&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 13 November 1876 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 9 | issue = 28785 | volume = F | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nInclement weather was also a problem; in January 1867 trains were delayed for several hours at {{stnlnk|Hoghton}} due to snow on the line,<ref>{{Citation | title = The Late Snow Storm | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS202023978&dyn=56!xrn_58_0_CS202023978&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 10 January 1867 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 12 | issue = 25704 | volume = D | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref> and on 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from [[Preston railway station]].<ref>{{Citation | title = The Gale.

It began as a railway from [[Clifton, Greater Manchester|Clifton]] via [[Bury, Greater Manchester|Bury]] to [[Rawtenstall]], and during its short life grew into a complex network of lines connecting towns and cities including [[Liverpool]], [[Manchester]], [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] and [[Blackburn]].\n\nDuring a period of rapid growth the company acquired several of its competitors, including the [[Blackburn and Preston Railway]], which it purchased to gain access to Preston.  It faced competition from companies such as the [[North Union Railway]], and was involved in a notable stand-off in 1849 with the [[Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway]]. Following several years of discussions, the East Lancashire Railway was in 1859 amalgamated with the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway.  Parts of the network remain in use today, and a section of the original line between Bury and Rawtenstall is now operated as a [[heritage railway]].\n\n== History ==\n=== Manchester and Bolton Railway ===\n{{Main|Manchester and Bolton Railway}}\nIn 1830, the [[Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal|Manchester Bolton & Bury Canal Company]] began to promote the construction of a railway along the line of their canal from [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]], to [[Bolton]] and Bury.<ref name=\"Hadfieldpp256257\">{{Harvnb|Hadfield|1970|pp=256\u2013257.}}</ref>  Following an [[act of parliament]] to enable them to become a railway company,<ref name=\"Hadfieldpp256257\"/><ref>{{Harvnb|Paget-Tomlinson|2006|pp=148\u2013149.}}</ref> they built their line from Manchester to Bolton, although on a slightly different alignment than was first planned.

Their proposed railway offered better facilities than those also proposed by the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] (M&LR), whose planned connection at Bury would be made with their [[Heywood, Greater Manchester|Heywood]] branch line from [[Castleton, Greater Manchester|Castleton]].<ref name=\"Broadbridgepp1819\">{{Harvnb|Broadbridge|2006|pp=18\u201319.}}</ref>  The Manchester, Bury and Rossendale Railway Company (MB&RR) was thus created, its purpose to build a railway from Bury to Clifton, where it would connect to the Manchester and Bolton Railway.

A second BBA&CER act allowed it to lease or sell itself to the MB&RR, and so <!-- on 24 July 1845? -->in 1845 the two companies joined.  The MB&RR later that year changed its name to the East Lancashire Railway (ELR).<ref name=\"Broadbridgepp1819\"/>\n\nThe following year, the ELR acquired the [[Liverpool, Ormskirk and Preston Railway]] (LO&PR),<ref name=\"Scrivenorp13\"/><ref>9 & 10 Vict. c. 381</ref> which gave it direct access to [[Liverpool Docks]].  The LO&PR's line would run from a junction with the [[Liverpool and Bury Railway]] at Walton-on-the-Hill<!-- not the one in Surrey --> to a junction with the B&PR.  The enabling act also allowed the LO&PR to build further branch lines, and the ELR obtained further acts including one which allowed it to build a connection to [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]].<ref name=\"Broadbridgepp1819\"/>  Following the acquisition on 3 August 1846,<ref>{{Harvnb|Greville|Holt|1960a|pp=99\u2013100.}}</ref> a disagreement ensued over traffic priorities and arrangements for the ELR at the NUR's station in Preston.  The ELR proposed a new station and a separate line with a new crossing of the Ribble, but this proved controversial; Preston Corporation petitioned against the proposed line, producing a series of witnesses who attested to the damage they presumed would be caused by the embankment necessary for the scheme to proceed.  Several members of the corporation were also shareholders of the rival [[Fleetwood, Preston and West Riding Junction Railway]], and the petition's proposer was brother-in-law to a director of the rival [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]].  In the end the ELR won its bid, but had to landscape its embankment (which later became the dividing line between [[Avenham Park|Avenham]] and [[Miller Park, Preston|Miller]] Parks), make an ornamental arch for carriages and pedestrians crossing under the railway, and build a footbridge on the river viaduct.<ref>{{Harvnb|Lewis|2001|pp=329\u2013330.}}</ref>\n\nMeanwhile, the former MB&RR line from [[Clifton, Greater Manchester|Clifton]] to [[Rawtenstall]] was inaugurated on Friday 25 September 1846.

Large crowds were gathered along the course of the railway.  In Bury, the train was extended to about 30&nbsp;carriages and three engines, and more passengers were collected before the train finished its journey in Rawtenstall.  Passengers were provided with a large meal in a closed-off section of a power-loom shed owned by John Robinson Kay.

The ELR had become accustomed to running their trains on to the L&YR line and then later declaring of the number of passengers liable for a toll but, in March 1849, the L&YR insisted that ELR trains stop at Clifton so that passenger numbers and tickets could be checked by their own employees.  The ELR accused the L&YR of trying to impede their traffic, particularly as they had recently gained a connection to Bradford, in competition with the L&YR.  They stated that the L&YR had access to their accounts, and to the returns made by their staff.<ref name=\"Extraordinary\">{{Citation | title = Extraordinary Scene At A Railway Junction | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/806/402/60276180w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS136216687&dyn=4!zoom_2?sw_aep=mclib | work = [[The Times]] | date = 15 March 1849 | page = 8 | issue = 20124 | volume = F | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nOn the morning of 12 March 1849, despite the presence of police from Bury and [[Pendleton, Greater Manchester|Pendleton]], the L&YR placed a large baulk of timber across the ELR's line at Clifton Junction, effectively blocking it.  Employees from both companies arrived at the scene, and a large crowd gathered to watch events unfold.  The L&YR also pulled a train past the junction, blocking the [[Railroad directions#United Kingdom|up line]] to the city.  Its engine was pointed south-east toward Manchester, available to any ELR passengers who wished to continue their journey.  An ELR train arrived from Bury, and stopped.  L&YR employees attempted to take tickets from the ELR's passengers, but were refused, as the ELR had already taken tickets at their Ringley Road station.  ELR employees then removed the baulk of timber, and in an effort to push the L&YR train out of the way, drove their train forward.  The L&YR had anticipated this, and moved another engine (taken from a L&YR train from Manchester) to the front of their Manchester-bound train.  The ELR then blocked the L&YR [[Railroad directions#United Kingdom|down line]] with another of their trains, laden with stone, moving it to a position directly abreast of the L&YR train.  The line remained completely blocked until about mid-day, with a queue of trains from both companies, and from the [[Blackburn and Darwen Railway]], building up on each side of the blockage.  The situation was eventually defused when the L&YR withdrew their train.<ref name=\"Extraordinary\"/>\n\nThe General Manager of the ELR, Richard Hacking, wrote to ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper expressing his annoyance at the L&YR's tactics.  He claimed to have received a letter from the company sent on 9 March 1849 informing him of proposed changes to operational procedures resulting from a near-collision at [[Clifton Junction]].  The first change was that ELR trains would at all times give way to L&YR trains on the Manchester and Bolton line; a stop signal was to be placed {{convert|400|yd}} along the ELR line from the junction, to be activated whenever a L&YR train was in sight.  The second change was that \"for the safety of the public\"<ref name=\"Battle\"/> all ELR trains would be required to stop before the [[Railroad switch|points]] at the junction, where all passenger tickets to Manchester would be collected by L&YR employees.  A daily return would be required of all passengers and other freight booked from Salford \"for the purpose of keeping regularly and balancing punctually the accounts of the two companies\".<ref name=\"Battle\"/>  Hacking claimed to have replied stating that the near-collision had occurred because the L&YR's engine driver had ignored a signal at Clifton Junction, and that the ELR would not accept the changes requested by the L&YR. The ELR refused to supply tickets at any point, although they considered it reasonable to supply more information on their traffic using the L&YR line.<ref name=\"Battle\">{{Citation | title = Letters to the Editor - Obstruction of East Lancashire Railway | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS101220463&dyn=12!xrn_34_0_CS101220463&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | last = Hacking | first = Richard | date = 15 March 1849 | volume = F | page = 6 | issue = 20124 | work = [[The Times]] | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Clifton viaduct looking north.jpg|centre|700px|thumb|The disused [[Clifton Viaduct]].

In his letter he concluded that the purpose of the L&YR's demands was to impede the flow of ELR traffic to Manchester and onwards to Yorkshire.<ref name=\"Battle\"/>\n\nHacking's account of the events of 12 March is similar to that reported by ''The Times''.  He claims to have travelled to Clifton to witness an L&YR clerk being prevented from collecting tickets, and to have then continued on another train to Manchester.  On his arrival there, he saw L&YR employees ready to pull up the rails to the ELR platform, although the rails were left intact.  He then mentions returning to Clifton after hearing that L&YR employees had recently left for the station.  He blamed the Managing Director of the L&YR, Captain Law, and Mr Blackmore, superintendent of the Bolton line, for ordering theline to be blocked with the baulk of timber.  Hacking also mentions an approaching up-train from Bolton, which on encountering the blockage apparently moved across to the down line to bypass it&nbsp;\u2013 in the face of oncoming traffic.  Expressing his shock, he claims to have ordered the ELR's stone train onto the down line, changing the signals accordingly.  Hacking's account ends by claiming that Blackmore ordered the L&YR train to move, effectively resolving the dispute.<ref name=\"Battle\"/>\n\n[[File:Elr approaching summerseat station.jpg|right|thumb|[[LMS Stanier Class 5 4-6-0 45407]] approaching Summerseat station on the [[heritage railway|heritage]] [[East Lancashire Railway]]]]\nThe matter was so serious that it was raised in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref>{{Citation | title = House Of Commons | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS50626673&dyn=20!zoom_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 17 March 1849 | page = 3 | issue = 20126 | volume = A | work = [[The Times]] | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  It was eventually settled in court, with the ELR thereon making a [[pro rata]] payment according to the distance travelled on each railway.

The amount of compensation to the L&YR was left at the discretion of both companies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Bennett|Smith|1852|pp=573\u2013574.}}</ref>\n\nRelations between the two companies were, therefore, not entirely amicable.  In 1853 the ELR made further proposals for a new line from Clifton to Salford, roughly parallel to the L&YR line, however in 1854 an agreement between the two companies meant that the Clifton Junction to Salford line was vested jointly in both companies.<ref>{{Harvnb|Townley|Appleton|Smith|Peden|1995|p=25.}}</ref>  Amalgamation had been discussed since the early 1850s and in <!-- 13 May -->1859, by an act of parliament,<ref>{{Harvnb|Rickards|1859|p=293.}}</ref> the ELR was absorbed by the L&YR.<ref name=\"Broadbridgep20\"/>\n\n=== Closure and legacy ===\n[[File:Ringley Road Station.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ringley Road railway station|Ringley Road station]] is on a popular route for pedestrians, cyclists, and horse riders]]\nFollowing the [[Beeching Axe]] parts of the ELR's network were closed.

One of its earliest orders was for twelve [[Long Boiler locomotive|Long Boiler]] [[2-2-2]]s from [[Fenton, Murray and Jackson|Fenton, Craven and Company]] (at least one of these was used on the inauguration of the railway<ref name=\"Prestonchronicle\"/>), but dissatisfied with the locomotives they accepted only four,<!-- (Marshall 3 p. 46) -->.  Four were diverted to the [[Leeds, Dewsbury and Manchester Railway]], and two to the [[Eastern Counties Railway]]. In 1848, the ELR's four 2-2-2s were rebuilt as [[2-4-0]]s by [[R and W Hawthorn]].  In about 1858, they were again rebuilt as [[0-6-0]]s by [[Sylvester Lees]].  Richard Walker, a director of the ELR between 1838 and 1854, was the supplier of about twenty locomotives to the company, including, in the 1850s, four 2-4-0s and several 0-6-0s.<ref name=\"steamindexl&yr\">{{Citation | title = Lancashire & Yorkshire Railway locomotives | url = http://www.steamindex.com/locotype/lyr.htm | publisher = steamindex.com | date = 28 October 2006 | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Walker, Richard & Brother]] supplied four 2-2-2 locomotives, Medusa, Hecate, Diomed and Lynx.  All were later rebuilt as a 2-4-0 [[Tank locomotive|tank engine]].  In 1847, two [[0-4-2]]s were supplied by R and W Hawthorn, rebuilt in 1868 as 2-4-0s.  In 1845 the MB&RR ordered four 0-6-0s from the [[Haigh Foundry]], and a fifth engine from Fenton, Craven and Company.  Another engine was built by Haigh in 1848.<ref name=\"steamindexl&yr\"/>\n\nThe largest ELR class was a series of outside-frame 2-4-0s with {{convert|15|x|20|in|cm|abbr=on}} cylinders and {{convert|5|ft|6|in|m|abbr=on}} driving wheels.  Some may have originated as 2-2-2s, and some were later rebuilt as 2-4-0 tank engines.  One was rebuilt as a 2-4-0 [[Tank locomotive#Saddle tank|saddle tank engine]].  These were among the last locomotives to be built in Bury.  Other manufacturers to supply the ELR were [[Sharp, Roberts and Company]], [[Stothert, Slaughter and Company]], and [[Beyer, Peacock and Company]].  The ELR livery for passenger locomotives was dark green with red brown frames, and polished domes and safety valves.<!-- Marshall (3 p. 52) --><ref name=\"steamindexl&yr\"/>\n\n== Infrastructure ==\n=== Station buildings ===\n[[File:Ormskirk Station.jpg|right|thumb|[[Ormskirk railway station]] in 1915]]\nStation buildings generally followed one of three designs.  The principal stations at Bury and Accrington were based on the same design by a Manchester-based firm of architects.  Most of the other stations were designed by the company's resident engineer. They were stone-built and consisted of a station master's room, adjoining a seated waiting area, a ladies waiting room and the booking office.  The third and cheapest design followed the standard design but utilised brick and timber as materials.  The platform was normally roofed.<ref name=\"Harrisonsale\"/>\n\n=== Signals ===\nTrack signals were based on two designs\u2014station signals on posts, each post with two moveable arms\u2014and portable signals; flags were used by day, and coloured lanterns at night.  The signals on posts were patented [[railway semaphore signal|semaphore]] designs from J Stevens & Son.  Each post had two arms\u2014linked by chain to a foot control at the base\u2014which were used to alert drivers on both the up and down lines.  Each foot control was held in place by a hook on the post.<!-- source unreadable about horizontal arms - can anyone clarify?-->  An arm set at an angle would indicate that the train should approach slowly, before stopping at the station.  The same arm set vertically (and out of sight) would indicate that the train could pass through without stopping.  The posts were also illuminated to allow use at night.  Signals at Accrington station were more complex, linked to the station building with wires, and by default set at 'stop' when released.  The coloured lanterns used as portable signals were painted red on one side (stop), green on another (go slowly), and clear on the third (proceed).<ref name=\"Harrisonsale\"/>\n\n=== Rails ===\nThe line was [[standard gauge]] and most sections used [[Rail tracks|rails]] in {{convert|15|ft|adj=on}} lengths, each weighing 75&nbsp;lb/yard (31.1&nbsp;kg/m), fixed to wooden [[Railroad tie|sleepers]] {{convert|9|ft}} long and {{convert|3|ft}} apart.<ref name=\"Harrisonsale\"/>\n\n== Accidents ==\nIn the early history of the railways accidents were not uncommon, and the ELR was no exception.  Several incidents were reported in ''The Times''. During [[Whitsuntide]] 1849, a passenger train was in a rear-end collision with an excursion train near [[Burnley]], [[Lancashire]]. Despite efforts to protect the rear of the passenger train, another excursion train was in a rear-end collision with it.{{sfn|Hall|1990|p=25}} In January 1850, three people died when a luggage train ran into a passenger train at [[Maghull railway station]].<ref>{{Citation | title = The Late Accident On The East Lancashire  | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS68452904&dyn=31!xrn_20_0_CS68452904&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 8 January 1850 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 4 | issue = 20380 | volume = F | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  A serious accident occurred at Clifton Junction on 19 October 1851 when a passenger train derailed passing the points on the junction, injuring several passengers, some seriously.<ref>{{Citation | title = Serious Accident On The East Lancashire  | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS85099862&dyn=78!xrn_28_0_CS85099862&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 22 October 1851 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 5 | issue = 20939 | volume = D | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  In September 1866 a man died after jumping from the train from Blackburn.<ref>{{Citation | title = Fatal Accident | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS169124646&dyn=56!xrn_57_0_CS169124646&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 6 September 1866 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 10 | issue = 25596 | volume = B | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>  A non-fatal collision occurred at [[Lostock Hall railway station]] in November 1876.<ref>{{Citation | title = Railway Collision | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS151959405&dyn=56!xrn_60_0_CS151959405&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 13 November 1876 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 9 | issue = 28785 | volume = F | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref>\n\nInclement weather was also a problem; in January 1867 trains were delayed for several hours at {{stnlnk|Hoghton}} due to snow on the line,<ref>{{Citation | title = The Late Snow Storm | url = http://infotrac.galegroup.com/itw/infomark/885/935/60236960w16/purl=rc1_TTDA_0_CS202023978&dyn=56!xrn_58_0_CS202023978&hst_1?sw_aep=mclib | date = 10 January 1867 |newspaper=[[The Times]] |page = 12 | issue = 25704 | volume = D | accessdate = 14 April 2009}}</ref> and on 30 January 1877 a heavy storm blew the roof completely away from [[Preston railway station]].<ref>{{Citation | title = The Gale.

The most influential specimen was [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints 1]] from [[La Chapelle-aux-Saints]], France. French palaeontologist [[Marcellin Boule]] authored several publications, among the first to establish palaeontology as a science, detailing the specimen, but reconstructed it as ape-like and only remotely related to modern humans. The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule\u2019s error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|pages=158\u2013164}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

The 1912 'discovery' of [[Piltdown Man]] (a hoax), appearing much more similar to modern humans than Neanderthals, was used as evidence that multiple different and unrelated branches of primitive humans existed, and supported Boule's reconstruction of ''H. neanderthalensis'' as a far distant relative and an [[evolutionary dead-end]].<ref name=boule>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/b22463355|first=M.|last=Boule|authorlink=Marcellin Boule|year=1911|title=L'homme fossile de La Chapelle-aux-Saints|trans-title=Fossil man from La Chapelle-aux-Saints|language=French|publisher=Masson|pages=[https://archive.org/details/b22463355/page/n16 1]\u201362}}</ref><ref name=drell2000/><ref name=Reybrouck2002>{{cite journal|first=D.|last=Van Reybrouck|authorlink=David Van Reybrouck|year=2002|title=Boule\u2019s error: on the social context of scientific knowledge|journal=Antiquity|volume=76|pages=158\u2013164}}</ref><ref name=Langdon2016/> He fueled the popular image of Neanderthals as barbarous, slouching, club-wielding primitives; this image was reproduced for several decades and popularised in [[science fiction]] works, such as the 1911 ''[[The Quest for Fire]]'' by [[J.-H.

Ideas such as Neanderthal behaviour, intelligence, and culture were being discussed, and a more humanlike image of them emerged.

Two-phase argues a single major environmental event\u2014such as the [[Saale glaciation]]\u2014caused European ''H. heidelbergensis'' to rapidly increase body size and robustness, as well as undergo an enlengthenment of the head (phase 1), which then led to other changes in skull anatomy (phase 2).<ref name=\"speciation\"/> However, Neanderthal anatomy may not have been driven entirely by adapting to cold weather.<ref name=stewart2019/> Accretion holds that Neanderthals slowly evolved over time from the ancestral ''H. heidelbergensis'', divided into 4 stages: early-pre-Neanderthals ([[Anglian stage|MIS 12]], [[Elster glaciation]]), pre-Neanderthals ''[[sensu lato]]'' (MIS [[Marine Isotope Stage 11|11]]\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 9|9]], [[Holstein interglacial]]), early Neanderthals (MIS 7\u2013[[Marine Isotope Stage 5|5]], [[Saale glaciation]]\u2013[[Eemian]]), and classic Neanderthals ''[[sensu stricto]]'' (MIS 4\u20133, [[W\u00fcrm glaciation]]).<ref name = \"Dean1998\"/>\n\nNumerous dates for the Neanderthal/human split have been suggested. The date of around 250 kya cites \"''[[Florisbad Skull|H. helmei]]''\" as being the last common ancestor (LCA), and the split is associated with the [[Levallois technique]] of making stone tools. The date of about 400 kya uses ''H. heidelbergensis'' as the LCA. 600 kya says that \"''[[Homo rhodesiensis|H. rhodesiensis]]''\" was the LCA, which split off into modern human lineage and a Neanderthal/''H. heidelbergensis'' lineage.<ref name=endicott/> 800 kya has ''[[Homo antecessor|H. antecessor]]'' as the LCA; however, different variations of this model would push the date back to 1 million years ago.<ref name=endicott/><ref name=meyer2016/> DNA studies have yielded various results on divergence time, such as 592\u2013182 kya,<ref name=stringer/> 553\u2013321 kya,<ref>{{cite journal|first=A.

However, individuals with the 129 variant of the [[PRNP]] gene were naturally immune to the prions. Studying this gene led to the discovery that the 129 variant was widespread among all modern humans, which could indicate widespread cannibalism at some point in human prehistory. Because Neanderthals are known to have practised cannibalism to an extent and to have co-existed with modern humans, British palaeoanthropologist Simon Underdown speculated that modern humans transmitted a kuru-like spongiform disease to Neanderthals, and, because the 129 variant appears to have been absent in Neanderthals, it quickly killed them off.<ref name=underdown2008>{{cite journal|first=S.|last=Underdown|year=2008|title=A potential role for transmissible spongiform encephalopathies in Neanderthal extinction|journal=Medical Hypotheses|volume=71|issue=1|pages=4\u20137|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2007.12.014|pmid=18280671}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1= Bello |first1= S.
