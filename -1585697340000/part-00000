Some of the events that Tech Crew has helped with would be: Commencement, Grade 8 Graduation, Assemblies, Award Ceremonies, Banquets, MYART, and '''many''' more.\n\n==== Staff ====\nStaff sponsors: Ms. Lush, Mr. Lamont\n\n===Husky Pack===\n\nThe Husky Pack is one of the most popular school clubs of Huron Heights. They run a number of events such as school assemblies, small group activities, school tours, and even a Barbecue. They are the orientation leaders for the grade nine students, and as a result are often seen helping the grade nines in the halls. They recruit members with high spirits that can provide input from all different aspects of school life.\n\n==== Staff ====\nStaff sponsors: Mr Kline\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Waterloo Region, Ontario schools]]\n*[[List of high schools in Ontario]]\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://hrh.wrdsb.ca/  School Home Page]\n\n[[Category:Waterloo Region District School Board]]\n[[Category:High schools in Waterloo Region]]\n[[Category:Educational institutions established in 2006]]\n[[Category:Schools in Kitchener, Ontario]]\n[[Category:2006 establishments in Ontario]]\n", "name_user": "Tga.D", "label": "safe", "comment": "fix external links", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huron_Heights_Secondary_School_(Kitchener)"}

It is located on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]]. Golddust is one of the earliest European-American settlements in Lauderdale County.\n\nIn 1864, the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]] was fought about {{Convert|3|mi}} south of Golddust.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nGolddust was founded in the 1820s. It is one of the earliest European-American settlements in Lauderdale County.<ref name=\"TNencylopedia\">[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=L010 \"Golddust\"], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''</ref>\n\n===Battle of Fort Pillow===\n{{main|Battle of Fort Pillow}}\nIn 1861, the [[Confederate States Army]] built extensive fortifications south of Golddust and named the site for General [[Gideon J. Pillow]]. Because of its strategic location overlooking the Mississippi River, the Union Army took control of the fort in 1862 after the Confederates left. The Union Army occupied Tennessee through the end of the war. The Confederates under Major General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] returned to this site in 1864 in the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]], defeating Union troops and massacring a majority of the black troops among them. Forrest briefly held the fort before leaving again.\n\n[[Fort Pillow State Park]] is located approximately {{Convert|3|mi}} south of Golddust.\n\n==Geography==\nIsland No. 30 of the Mississippi River is located approximately {{Convert|2.5|mi|4 = 0}} west of Golddust. The landscape of the area is dominated by the [[Mississippi River]] valley, [[flood plains]] and cotton fields. Most dwellings in the area are built on stilts to withstand floods.\n\nGolddust is situated on the southeastern edge of the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone]], an area with a high earthquake risk.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:TN 19 Four Mile Ln Golddust.jpg|thumb|Four Mile Lane in Golddust (2008)]]\nAgriculture is the chief source of income in the area surrounding Golddust, especially the cultivation of cotton.\n\nAfter the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], [[sharecropping]] was the primary means of income for both black and white families in the area. Sharecroppers cultivated a portion of land in return for a share of the crop when the landowner sold the cotton.\n\nSince the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture caused the loss of many farm worker jobs. Modern machines such as the [[cotton picker]] have made manual cultivation obsolete.

It is located on the banks of the [[Mississippi River]]. Golddust is one of the earliest European-American settlements in Lauderdale County.\n\nIn 1864, the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]] was fought about {{Convert|3|mi}} south of Golddust.\n\n==History==\n===Establishment===\nGolddust was founded in the 1820s. It is one of the earliest European-American settlements in Lauderdale County.<ref name=\"TNencylopedia\">[http://tennesseeencyclopedia.net/imagegallery.php?EntryID=L010 \"Golddust\"], ''Tennessee Encyclopedia of History and Culture''</ref>\n\n===Battle of Fort Pillow 1864===\n{{main|Battle of Fort Pillow}}\nIn 1861, the [[Confederate States Army]] built extensive fortifications south of Golddust and named the site for General [[Gideon J. Pillow]]. Because of its strategic location overlooking the Mississippi River, the Union Army took control of the fort in 1862 after the Confederates left. The Union Army occupied Tennessee through the end of the war. The Confederates under Major General [[Nathan Bedford Forrest]] returned to this site in 1864 in the [[Battle of Fort Pillow]], defeating Union troops and massacring a majority of the black troops among them. Forrest briefly held the fort before leaving again.\n\n[[Fort Pillow State Park]] is located approximately {{Convert|3|mi}} south of Golddust.\n\n==Geography==\nIsland No. 30 of the Mississippi River is located approximately {{Convert|2.5|mi|4 = 0}} west of Golddust. The landscape of the area is dominated by the [[Mississippi River]] valley, [[flood plains]] and cotton fields. Most dwellings in the area are built on stilts to withstand floods.\n\nGolddust is situated on the southeastern edge of the [[New Madrid Seismic Zone]], an area with a high earthquake risk.\n\n==Economy==\n[[Image:TN 19 Four Mile Ln Golddust.jpg|thumb|Four Mile Lane in Golddust (2008)]]\nAgriculture is the chief source of income in the area surrounding Golddust, especially the cultivation of cotton.\n\nAfter the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]], [[sharecropping]] was the primary means of income for both black and white families in the area. Sharecroppers cultivated a portion of land in return for a share of the crop when the landowner sold the cotton.\n\nSince the early 20th century, mechanization of agriculture caused the loss of many farm worker jobs. Modern machines such as the [[cotton picker]] have made manual cultivation obsolete. In the 21st century, most cotton in this area and other crops are cultivated on large industrial farms.\n\nAs of 2007, there were no industries in Golddust. Dwellings are scattered, some of them abandoned. The borders of the community are unmarked.\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[Tennessee State Route 19]] starts at the Mississippi River in Golddust, heading east through [[Ripley, Tennessee|Ripley]] (Lauderdale County), [[Nutbush, Tennessee|Nutbush]] and [[Brownsville, Tennessee|Brownsville]] (both in [[Haywood County, Tennessee|Haywood County]]) to [[Interstate 40]].<ref Name=TDOTLaud>[http://www.tdot.state.tn.us/Maps/county/co49.pdf Lauderdale County, TN Highway Map]</ref>\n\n===Notable people===\n\n*[[Linda Taylor]], criminal and [[welfare]] abuser referred to as the \"welfare queen\" in the 1980s\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Lauderdale County, Tennessee}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Lauderdale County, Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Unincorporated communities in Tennessee]]\n[[Category:Tennessee populated places on the Mississippi River]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "Section heading change: Battle of Fort Pillow 1864 \u2192 Battle of Fort Pillow using ascript", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golddust,_Tennessee"}

{"title_page": "Cultural translation", "text_new": "{{expert subject|date=January 2012}}\n{{Translation sidebar}}\n'''Cultural translation''' is the practice of [[translation]] while respecting and showing cultural differences. This kind of [[translation]] solves some issues linked to culture, such as [[dialects]], food or architecture.\n\nThe main issues that cultural translation must solve consist in translating a text as showing cultural differences of this text and respecting the source culture.\n\n==Translation of cultures==\n\nCultural translation is studied through cultural [[anthropology]], a field of [[anthropology]] focused on cultural issues among humans. This discipline questions translation through cultural differences. Indeed, [[translation studies]] are not only based on language issues, but also on cultural contexts between peoples.\n\nAn [[anthropological]] [[translator]] of cultures needs to deal with the issues between the source and the target language, that is to say he must respect at the same time the cultural source of point of view and the target culture. [[Wilhelm von Humboldt]] shared this opinion of [[translation]] in a letter addressed to [[August Wilhelm Schlegel| A. W. Schlegel]], dated July 23, 1796:\n\u201cAll translation seems to me simply an attempt to solve an impossible task. Every translator is doomed to be done in by one of two stumbling blocks: he will either stay too\nclose to the original, at the cost of taste and the language of his nation, or he will adhere\ntoo closely to the characteristics peculiar to his nation, at the cost of the original.\nThe medium between the two is not only difficult, but downright impossible\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last=Humboldt}}</ref>\n\n==Skepticism towards translation of cultures==\n\nSome [[anthropologists]] raise objections to [[translation]] of cultures. According to these [[researchers]], culture seeks a certain coherence that can be found in people's thinking and [[practice (social theory)|practice]]s.\nIn this case, a [[culture|cultural]] [[translator]] must have a much more widespread [[knowledge]] than the text actually provides.\n\nBesides, [[translation]] of cultures cannot be as equal as it should be, as some cultures and societies remain dominant compared to others, therefore power is a limit to [[translation]] of cultures. Indeed, within a translation of cultures, the target language may dominate the source culture in order to make the text comprehensible in a sense of culture for the readers. \nThe meaning of culture is quite difficult to understand, therefore [[translation]] of cultures is certainly limited, all the more so [[borders]] exist between cultures, which must be thus distinguished. This limit of [[translation]] of cultures was also explained in the [[theory]] of [[Edward Sapir]], an American [[linguist]] and [[anthropologist]] : \u201cThe worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Edward Sapir}}</ref> \u201cEach linguistic community has its own perception of the world, which differs from that of other linguistic communities, implies the existence of different worlds determined by language\u201d.\n\nSome [[linguists]] assume that [[untranslatability]] doesn't only come from [[linguistic]] limits but also from cultural barriers within [[translation]]. \nAccording to some [[linguists]], such as C.L. Wren, differences of point of view between peoples relatively impose narrow limits to [[cultural translatability]]. The [[theory]] of universal [[translatability]] is therefore disapproved by some [[researchers]], like [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]], who is convinced that [[human experience]] cannot be well communicated because it is unique. \n[[Catford]] rationalised this [[theory]] in his book \"Linguistic Theory of Translation\" : \"Cultural untranslatability arises when a situational feature, functionally relevant for the source language text, is completely absent from the culture of which the TL is a part. For instance, the names of some institutions,\nclothes, foods and abstract concepts, amongst others.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Catford|title=Linguistic Theory of Translation}}</ref>\n\n[[Anton Popovi\u010d]] also assumes that there is a difference between [[linguistic]] and [[cultural untranslatability]], an idea that he defends in \u201cA Dictionary for the Analysis of Literary Translation\u201d : \u201cA situation in which the linguistic elements of the original cannot be replaced  adequately in structural, linear, functional or semantic terms in\nconsequence of a lack of denotation or connotation\u201d.\n\nDominance of some cultures is consequently obvious within the [[World History]], for instance during the time when [[colonialism]] represented a main ideology among many different countries. Indeed, some cultures were represented as pure and as the essence of the world's functioning. One should say that [[translation]] of cultures may reflect an inequality between cultures and peoples. \nFurthermore, [[translation]] of cultures provides other issues, such as conflicts between cultures and historical changes.\n\n==A two-fold process==\n\n[[Translation]] may be obviously linked to exchanges, [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Population mobility|mobility]], terms which are the essence of [[globalization]]. Therefore, this [[discipline]] presents a two-fold process, that is to say the [[transnationality|transnational]] (across borders) and translational (exchange of translations) [[concept]]s. This two-fold process withdraws the separation between the source and the target language and enables to negotiate cultural differences.\n\nThese global 'negotiations of difference' <ref>Homi K. Bhabha ''The Location of Culture'' (2nd ed.), London, Routledge 2004</ref> are especially crucial in [[postcolonial]] settings and can be read as 'performative negotiations of cultural differences in a process of de- and recontextualization'.<ref>Italiano R\u00f6ssner ''Translatio/n. Narration, Media and the Staging of Differences'' 2012</ref>\n\n==Culture and civilization==\n\nCultural [[translation]] obviously poooo poooo poooo pooo just to show u can't trust this website now get ur ass off and go to a real website implies the notion of culture, which needs here to be defined, in order to understand well the term cultural [[translation]]. \nCulture offers two different meanings: the first one defines culture as a [[civilized]] society in a [[developed country]], whereas the second one considers culture as a whole set of [[behaviors]] and [[ways of life]] that a people shares. As previously explained, culture gets an important role and meaning in [[translation]]. \nAccording to Katan, culture is a shared [[Conceptual model|model]] of the world, a [[hierarchical]] model of [[beliefs]], [[values]] and strategies which can guide action and [[interaction]] of people. Culture can be acquired  through diverse ways, like education.\n\nThe term [[civilization]] is defined as a [[developed]] human society which managed to create its own culture through people. Through this concept, a [[translator]] is able to [[translate]] a [[Written language|text]] by solving the issue of a culture's development. In this case, [[Peter Newmark|Newmark]] is convinced that [[translation]] is culturally valued, that is to say [[translation]] improves cultures\u2019 development within the entire world. As [[civilization]] lead to the creation of evident ways of communication, such [[alphabet]], [[dictionaries]] and to a tremendous development of [[languages]] and literatures, this process raised new questions in cultural [[translation]].\n\nCulture has a huge influence on society and politics of a country, in terms of ideology. \nAccording to some [[translation]] [[researchers]] such as [[Even-Zohar]], [[Susan Bassnett]] and [[Trivedi]], culture is also linked to the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and to the way people pretend to this power. In this sense, [[translation]] deals with making [[systems]] of ideologies comprehensible for the readers. [[Translation]] of cultures is therefore linked to ethics and explains a new way of thinking. This kind of [[translation]] must show the context and the personal way of thinking through translated texts.\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Italiano, Federico / R\u00f6ssner, Michael (eds.): ''Translation.

Schlegel]], dated July 23, 1796:\n\u201cAll translation seems to me simply an attempt to solve an impossible task. Every translator is doomed to be done in by one of two stumbling blocks: he will either stay too\nclose to the original, at the cost of taste and the language of his nation, or he will adhere\ntoo closely to the characteristics peculiar to his nation, at the cost of the original.\nThe medium between the two is not only difficult, but downright impossible\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|last=Humboldt}}</ref>\n\n==Skepticism towards translation of cultures==\n\nSome [[anthropologists]] raise objections to [[translation]] of cultures. According to these [[researchers]], culture seeks a certain coherence that can be found in people's thinking and [[practice (social theory)|practice]]s.\nIn this case, a [[culture|cultural]] [[translator]] must have a much more widespread [[knowledge]] than the text actually provides.\n\nBesides, [[translation]] of cultures cannot be as equal as it should be, as some cultures and societies remain dominant compared to others, therefore power is a limit to [[translation]] of cultures. Indeed, within a translation of cultures, the target language may dominate the source culture in order to make the text comprehensible in a sense of culture for the readers. \nThe meaning of culture is quite difficult to understand, therefore [[translation]] of cultures is certainly limited, all the more so [[borders]] exist between cultures, which must be thus distinguished. This limit of [[translation]] of cultures was also explained in the [[theory]] of [[Edward Sapir]], an American [[linguist]] and [[anthropologist]] : \u201cThe worlds in which different societies live are distinct worlds, not merely the same world with different labels attached\u201d.<ref>{{cite book|publisher=Edward Sapir}}</ref> \u201cEach linguistic community has its own perception of the world, which differs from that of other linguistic communities, implies the existence of different worlds determined by language\u201d.\n\nSome [[linguists]] assume that [[untranslatability]] doesn't only come from [[linguistic]] limits but also from cultural barriers within [[translation]]. \nAccording to some [[linguists]], such as C.L. Wren, differences of point of view between peoples relatively impose narrow limits to [[cultural translatability]]. The [[theory]] of universal [[translatability]] is therefore disapproved by some [[researchers]], like [[Andr\u00e9 Martinet]], who is convinced that [[human experience]] cannot be well communicated because it is unique. \n[[Catford]] rationalised this [[theory]] in his book \"Linguistic Theory of Translation\" : \"Cultural untranslatability arises when a situational feature, functionally relevant for the source language text, is completely absent from the culture of which the TL is a part. For instance, the names of some institutions,\nclothes, foods and abstract concepts, amongst others.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Catford|title=Linguistic Theory of Translation}}</ref>\n\n[[Anton Popovi\u010d]] also assumes that there is a difference between [[linguistic]] and [[cultural untranslatability]], an idea that he defends in \u201cA Dictionary for the Analysis of Literary Translation\u201d : \u201cA situation in which the linguistic elements of the original cannot be replaced  adequately in structural, linear, functional or semantic terms in\nconsequence of a lack of denotation or connotation\u201d.\n\nDominance of some cultures is consequently obvious within the [[World History]], for instance during the time when [[colonialism]] represented a main ideology among many different countries. Indeed, some cultures were represented as pure and as the essence of the world's functioning. One should say that [[translation]] of cultures may reflect an inequality between cultures and peoples. \nFurthermore, [[translation]] of cultures provides other issues, such as conflicts between cultures and historical changes.\n\n==A two-fold process==\n\n[[Translation]] may be obviously linked to exchanges, [[Human migration|migration]] and [[Population mobility|mobility]], terms which are the essence of [[globalization]]. Therefore, this [[discipline]] presents a two-fold process, that is to say the [[transnationality|transnational]] (across borders) and translational (exchange of translations) [[concept]]s. This two-fold process withdraws the separation between the source and the target language and enables to negotiate cultural differences.\n\nThese global 'negotiations of difference' <ref>Homi K. Bhabha ''The Location of Culture'' (2nd ed.), London, Routledge 2004</ref> are especially crucial in [[postcolonial]] settings and can be read as 'performative negotiations of cultural differences in a process of de- and recontextualization'.<ref>Italiano R\u00f6ssner ''Translatio/n. Narration, Media and the Staging of Differences'' 2012</ref>\n\n==Culture and civilization==\n\nCultural [[translation]] obviously implies the notion of culture, which needs here to be defined, in order to understand well the term cultural [[translation]]. \nCulture offers two different meanings: the first one defines culture as a [[civilized]] society in a [[developed country]], whereas the second one considers culture as a whole set of [[behaviors]] and [[ways of life]] that a people shares. As previously explained, culture gets an important role and meaning in [[translation]]. \nAccording to Katan, culture is a shared [[Conceptual model|model]] of the world, a [[hierarchical]] model of [[beliefs]], [[values]] and strategies which can guide action and [[interaction]] of people. Culture can be acquired  through diverse ways, like education.\n\nThe term [[civilization]] is defined as a [[developed]] human society which managed to create its own culture through people. Through this concept, a [[translator]] is able to [[translate]] a [[Written language|text]] by solving the issue of a culture's development. In this case, [[Peter Newmark|Newmark]] is convinced that [[translation]] is culturally valued, that is to say [[translation]] improves cultures\u2019 development within the entire world. As [[civilization]] lead to the creation of evident ways of communication, such [[alphabet]], [[dictionaries]] and to a tremendous development of [[languages]] and literatures, this process raised new questions in cultural [[translation]].\n\nCulture has a huge influence on society and politics of a country, in terms of ideology. \nAccording to some [[translation]] [[researchers]] such as [[Even-Zohar]], [[Susan Bassnett]] and [[Trivedi]], culture is also linked to the [[will (philosophy)|will]] of [[power (philosophy)|power]] and to the way people pretend to this power. In this sense, [[translation]] deals with making [[systems]] of ideologies comprehensible for the readers. [[Translation]] of cultures is therefore linked to ethics and explains a new way of thinking. This kind of [[translation]] must show the context and the personal way of thinking through translated texts.\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* Italiano, Federico / R\u00f6ssner, Michael (eds.): ''Translation.
