The press release stated \u201c\u2026it is especially appropriate that the leaders addressing this event represent the four main powers of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]], which liberated Europe and the world from the murderous tyranny of Nazi Germany.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/as-holocaust-memorial-set-to-begin-organizers-deny-event-becoming-politicized/|title=As Holocaust memorial begins, organizers deny event becoming politicized|last=Wootliff|first=Raoul|last2=Ahren|first2=Raphael|website=www.timesofisrael.com|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>President Duda viewed the Yad Vashem explanation as invalid and believed Poland\u2019s right to address to the Forum was categorically appropriate for a number of reasons. The attendance of France was seen as problematic because the country quickly surrendered, established the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], rounded up and transported many thousands of its Jews to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and its role in the liberation of Europe was effectively limited to its own borders. By contrast, Polish uniformed forces under Allied command outnumbered those of France and indisputably helped liberate Europe. Polish forces included General Maczek\u2019s 1st Armored Division, General Anders\u2019s 2nd Army Corps, and General Berling\u2019s 1st Polish Army. In addition, Polish RAF squadrons under British command helped defeat Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe in the [[Battle of Britain]] while Poland\u2019s early [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] successes enabled the deciphering of German communications, which helped shorten the war. Poland was also the first to tell the West of Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Polish and European Jews. This information came directly from a Polish intelligence network in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] established by Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], who voluntarily infiltrated Auschwitz by walking into a German roundup and became Auschwitz inmate number 4859.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html|title=\u2018Were We All People?\u2019|date=2012-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nPresident Duda criticized the event\u2019s organizers for making Putin a featured speaker while ignoring the fact that, before the [[Soviet Union]] helped [[Eastern Front (World War II)|liberate Europe in 1945]], Soviet leader Stalin, together with Hitler, attacked Poland in 1939 to destroy the Polish state and annihilate its people on both sides of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line. This was confirmed during Putin\u2019s address to the Forum, which portrayed the Soviet Union\u2019s participation in the war as beginning in 1942 after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded it in 1941]]. The presentation did not show that the Soviet Union had occupied its half of Poland, as was agreed to in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe controversy began after Putin made a number of accusations, one of which was that Poland was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War II because of [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|Poland's participation]] in the annexation of parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Putin\u2019s anger stemmed from a [[European Parliament]] Resolution issued on 19 September 2019 entitled \u201cImportance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\u201d. It blamed the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for [[Timeline of events preceding World War II|starting World War II]], and called for the removal of Soviet war memorials erected after 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |title=The End of Anti-Fascism |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/european-parliament-nazism-communism-russia-viktor-orban |work=Jacobin |date=September 2019}}</ref> The resolution condemns the Soviet Union and Germany for agreeing, via the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to start World War II by first jointly attacking Poland and then dividing Europe between them, all the while engaging in the mass murders of civilians. The Resolution further states that Russian authorities have denied responsibility for the Pact and its horrific consequences, and instead are promoting the view that Poland, the Baltic States, and the West are the true instigators of the war.

The attendance of France was seen as problematic because the country quickly surrendered, established the collaborationist [[Vichy France|Vichy government]], rounded up and transported many thousands of its Jews to the Nazi [[extermination camp]]s, and its role in the liberation of Europe was effectively limited to its own borders. By contrast, Polish uniformed forces under Allied command outnumbered those of France and indisputably helped liberate Europe. Polish forces included General Maczek\u2019s 1st Armored Division, General Anders\u2019s 2nd Army Corps, and General Berling\u2019s 1st Polish Army. In addition, Polish RAF squadrons under British command helped defeat Hitler\u2019s Luftwaffe in the [[Battle of Britain]] while Poland\u2019s early [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] successes enabled the deciphering of German communications, which helped shorten the war. Poland was also the first to tell the West of Hitler\u2019s mass murder of Polish and European Jews. This information came directly from a Polish intelligence network in [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] established by Captain [[Witold Pilecki]], who voluntarily infiltrated Auschwitz by walking into a German roundup and became Auschwitz inmate number 4859.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Snyder|first=Timothy|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/24/books/review/the-auschwitz-volunteer-by-witold-pilecki.html|title=\u2018Were We All People?\u2019|date=2012-06-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-05|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\nPresident Duda criticized the event\u2019s organizers for making Putin a featured speaker while ignoring the fact that, before the [[Soviet Union]] helped [[Eastern Front (World War II)|liberate Europe in 1945]], Soviet leader Stalin, together with Hitler, attacked Poland in 1939 to destroy the Polish state and annihilate its people on both sides of the Molotov-Ribbentrop line. This was confirmed during Putin\u2019s address to the Forum, which portrayed the Soviet Union\u2019s participation in the war as beginning in 1942 after [[Operation Barbarossa|Germany invaded it in 1941]]. The presentation did not show that the Soviet Union had occupied its half of Poland, as was agreed to in the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact.{{Citation needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe controversy began after Putin made a number of accusations, one of which was that Poland was partly responsible for the outbreak of World War II because of [[Polish\u2013Czechoslovak border conflicts|Poland's participation]] in the annexation of parts of [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1938, following the Munich Agreement. Putin\u2019s anger stemmed from a [[European Parliament]] Resolution issued on 19 September 2019 entitled \u201cImportance of European remembrance for the future of Europe\u201d. It blamed the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for [[Timeline of events preceding World War II|starting World War II]], and called for the removal of Soviet war memorials erected after 1945.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |title=The End of Anti-Fascism |url=https://jacobinmag.com/2019/09/european-parliament-nazism-communism-russia-viktor-orban |work=Jacobin |date=September 2019}}</ref> The resolution condemns the Soviet Union and Germany for agreeing, via the secret protocols of the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, to start World War II by first jointly attacking Poland and then dividing Europe between them, all the while engaging in the mass murders of civilians. The Resolution further states that Russian authorities have denied responsibility for the Pact and its horrific consequences, and instead are promoting the view that Poland, the Baltic States, and the West are the true instigators of the war. Putin angrily dismissed the Resolution as \"sheer nonsense\u201d and suggested that Stalin was forced into the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact after other European nations signed nonaggression agreements with Hitler. He further said the 1938 [[Munich Agreement]], which allowed Hitler to annex Czechoslovakia, was an example of western \"collusion\" with Hitler.\n\nPresident [[Gitanas Naus\u0117da|Gitanas Nauseda]] of Lithuania endorsed President's Duda position and also withdrew from the summit.

It was begun in 1909 by the Taylor Land Company for those residents in [[Baltimore]] who wanted a place outside the city limits to perhaps grow a garden or to pursue some other rural activity. Land was cheap, and sales were enhanced by a promotional pamphlet.\n\nHenry Guttenberger built the first general store in Essex in 1910 on the corner of [[Eastern Avenue (Baltimore)|Eastern Avenue]] and Mace Avenue. Between 1911 and 1912, the Taylor Land Company donated the lots for Essex Methodist and St. John's Lutheran churches. They also donated the land where the volunteer fire department built their station. The permanent fire station opened in 1921.\n\nWith the ever-growing population came the need to build schools. The elementary school opened in 1925 with 400 students. Essex Community College, now [[Community College of Baltimore County|CCBC-Essex]], was founded in 1957. Classes were first held at [[Kenwood High School (Maryland)|Kenwood High School]], with fifty part-time and nine full-time students. In 1961, the college moved to Dorsey Avenue, and in 1968 moved to its present location, in [[Rossville, Maryland|Rossville]]. This site was owned by the Mace family, and the family burial plot is maintained and protected by the college.\n\nA fire in August 1957 destroyed an entire block of businesses on Eastern Boulevard, and the business district never fully recovered from that catastrophe. The ten-alarm blaze caused a half million dollars in damages, and, in the time it took to repair the buildings, new shopping centers were built, changing the buying habits of consumers.<!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:essex_fire.jpg|thumb|Essex Fire - 1957]] -->\n\nThe [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] was the single biggest reason for the rapid growth of the area. Employment at the company peaked at more than 53,000 workers during [[World War II]]. In the years following, industry in the area dwindled, and much of the original Glenn L. Martin facility became the property of the State, including [[Martin State Airport]]. The remaining [[aerospace]] business followed a progression of corporate mergers and today is owned and operated by [[Lockheed Martin]].\n\nAnother important company was Eastern Rolling Mill, which opened in 1919. The plant, at the head of the [[Back River (Maryland)|Back River]], produced carbon [[sheet steel]]. In 1944, Eastern merged with Industrial Stainless Steel, Inc. to form Easco. The plant then merged with the British company Avesta-Sheffield in the early 1990s, finally shutting down operations in the late 1990s.\n\nToday, there is interest in revitalizing the Essex area by including it in government-sponsored [[empowerment zone]]s. Many neighborhoods have begun a \"clean-up\" of their areas, hoping to transform Essex into a place that will be ready to move into the twenty-first century.  Improvements include removal of run-down, low-income housing, including the Tall Trees Community and the Riverdale Community; new medians and pavement on Eastern Avenue; a new single family home community called Waterview; and the auctioning of Middle River Station for commercial area.  [[Maryland Route 43|MD 43 Extended]] has opened which connects the old waterfront community and Carroll Island area with the booming [[White Marsh, Maryland|White Marsh]] commercial area.\n\n[[Ballestone Mansion]] was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1975.<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|2008a}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2009, the community of Essex celebrated its 100th birthday with a party at Cox's Point Park on Riverside Drive.

Michael learns that his 11-year-old cousin Tommy Biggs, whom he has not seen since a family reunion several years earlier, will soon be arriving from Montana to visit. Michael casts Tommy aside during his visit, prioritizing his social life and the demands of his girlfriend over his guest.\n\nOn Tommy's last day in California, the family [[housekeeper (domestic worker)|housekeeper]] Arlene makes Michael aware of his mistreatment toward Tommy. Michael decides to take Tommy to [[Disneyland]] to make up for it. However, en route to the theme park, Michael receives a phone call from Gina pleading for him to meet her at a racetrack so she can introduce him to her father. Michael capitulates and leaves Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, then drives to the track for a brief visit. At the race track, Michael charms Gina's father over the course of a couple hours. When Michael realizes how late it is, he hurries back to pick up Tommy, and accidentally collides his [[Porsche Boxster]] with another vehicle. Afterwards upon arriving at the kiddie park, Michael learns Arlene had picked up Tommy several hours earlier. When he comes home, Tommy angrily confronts him about this. They don't tell his parents about it and Michael lies that he got the dent in his car from a [[hit-and-run]].\n\nAfter Tommy returns to Montana and during dinner, Jacy mentions that she got a call from Michael's aunt, Jules, who told her that Tommy didn't get to do much of anything. In turn, she mentions that they are very disappointed in him. Glenn confronts Michael and demands his reasons for him leaving Tommy at an indoor kiddie park, rather than cancel his plans with Gina. He claims that if he canceled on her in meeting her father and took Tommy to Disneyland, she threatened to break up with him. Glenn tells Michael off that was no excuse since Tommy was family and he should've known better. His problems become worse when the police officers come over to the house and inform his parents of the accident between him and Deidre White. This truth further enrages both Glenn and Jacy because earlier Michael claimed he was in a hit-and-run as he was leaving the horse track. The police mentions that while he did the right thing to get Deidre's information and give out his own, she wrote his license plate number on a piece of paper. Now more irritated by his selfish behavior, Glenn decrees that in order for Michael to start acting like an adult and learn responsibility: he needs to go to Montana to work on the Biggs ranch for a month. Michael refuses to go there and tries to negotiate his way out of that trip. However, Glenn makes it clear that it's not negotiable and that he and his mother are fed up with Michael's behavior. He mentions that if he and Jacy get a negative telephone call from the Biggs regarding Michael, they intend to cancel his upcoming trip with Gina to the [[French Riviera]]. Michael arrives at the ranch, where he meets Jules' ranch hands, Twister and Mule, as well as Tommy.\n\nMichael is put to work early the next morning, although every task he is assigned by Tommy is deliberately sabotaged to make his labor harder, as revenge for his earlier neglect. One example is being ordered to load wood onto a ramshackle truck, only for Mule to laugh he has not driven it for years and points out a newer pickup truck. Michael eventually confronts Tommy regarding his behavior, and reveals that he only got along with him at their family reunion years ago because they were the only children at the event. No longer caring if his parents cancel his trip to the French Riviera with Gina, Michael demands Tommy to leave him alone and let him go through the month in peace. He dejectedly agrees and believes that his cousin truly doesn't care for him. The next morning and angered over hearing about Michael's mistreatment over Tommy, Twister reprimands him for his lazy and entitled behavior. He points out that his family are grateful to do hard work and appreciate what they have. Twister mentions that he has seen how much Michael hardly appreciates the life he has and has overheard half of his phone conversations with his girlfriend, complaining about the work on the ranch. During their discussion, he is surprised to learn that the Biggs are suffering financial problems and wonders aloud why no one in his family told him this. Twister reveals that they felt like Michael doesn't care about anyone except himself and tells him to reexamine his attitude.\n\nAfter Twister's confrontation, Michael realizes how selfish he has been and begins adapting to life on the ranch. He mends his relationship with Tommy, who reveals his father was terminally ill, and his medical bills combined with the loss of labor from his death snowballed into financial woes. Michael expresses remorse over not spending time with Tommy more when he learns why Jules really sent him to LA and felt worse in not putting his social life on hold. Later, Michael is upset when Jules tells him that the ranch will be foreclosed soon because her mortgage is past due. The bank plans to auction the family's ranch and personal property at the end of the month.\n\nMichael returns to Los Angeles after a month on the ranch, now a more mature man and finding his old life no longer interesting. A jumping horse scares everyone at the track, but Michael tames it remembering his lessons from Mule. Michael ends his relationship with Gina after realizing that his parents were right and she is a rich snob. When Michael chastises his father for not helping the Biggs, he learns that Glenn had tried to help them out. He mentions to Michael that he offered them financial aid to keep the ranch from being foreclosed. However, Jules was too prideful to accept it to the point that not even Glenn and Jacy could get her to change her mind. Michael sells his Porsche and returns to Montana to present the money from the sale to keep the ranch operational until a permanent solution can be devised. Jules graciously rejects Michael's offer and suggests that it is time for she and Tommy to move on.\n\nOn the day of the auction, Michael recalls a real estate class he took that taught about the concept of a [[land trust]], which, if arranged in conjunction with the bank, would allow the Biggs to remain on the property indefinitely regardless of the debt. Michael successfully negotiates the terms with the bank. Jules agrees to let Michael continue working on the ranch and spend more time with the family. Later, Tommy and Michael finish a tree house that Tommy's father had been working on prior to his illness.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Joey Lawrence|Joseph Lawrence]] as Michael Woods\n* [[Andrew Lawrence (actor)|Andrew Lawrence]] as Tommy Biggs\n* [[Susan Walters]] as Jules Biggs\n* [[M.C.

{"title_page": "Priscillianism", "text_new": "{{for|the Montanist faction|Prisca (prophet)}}\n{{short description|Pre-Islamic Christian sect in Spanish Iberia}}\n'''Priscillianism''' is a [[Christianity|Christian]]-inspired belief system developed in the [[Hispania|Iberian Peninsula under the Roman Empire]] in the 4th century by [[Priscillian]]. It is derived from the [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]]-[[Manichaeism|Manichaean]] doctrines taught by Marcus, an [[\u00c6gyptus|Egyptian]] from [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]]. Priscillianism was later considered a [[heresy]] by both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\n==History==\nMarcus, a native of Memphis in Egypt, came to Spain and taught Gnostic and Manichean theories. Two of his followers, a Spanish lady named Agape and the [[rhetoric]]ian Helpidius, converted Priscillian,<ref name=Wace>[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/wace/biodict.html?term=Priscillianus%20and%20Priscillianism,%20Priscillian Wace, Henry. \"Priscillianus and Priscillianism, Priscillian\", ''A Dictionary of Early Christian Biography'', John Murray, London, 1911]</ref> who was a layman \"of noble birth, of great riches, bold, restless, eloquent, learned through much reading, very ready at debate and discussion\".<ref>Sulpicius Severus, \"Histor. Sac.\", II, 46</ref> Through his oratorical gifts and reputation for extreme [[asceticism]], Priscillian attracted a large following, including a [[rhetoric]]ian named Helpidus and two bishops, Instantius and Salvianus. \n\nThey established a new sect as an oath-bound society, <!-- over what? -->attracting the attention of the bishop [[Hyginus of Cordoba]]. Hyginus made his fears known to Hydatius, Bishop of [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|Emerita]], and Ithacius of [[Faro, Portugal|Ossonoba]].  The bishops of [[Hispania]] and [[Aquitaine]] held a synod at [[Zaragoza]] in 380. Though summoned, the Priscillianists refused to appear. The synod pronounced sentence of excommunication against the four leaders, Instantius, Salvianus, Helpidius and Priscillian.<ref name=Healy/>\n\nIthacius was chosen to enforce the synod's decrees, but he failed to bring the heretics to terms.  In defiance Priscillian was ordained to the priesthood and appointed [[Bishop of Avila]]. Ithacius then appealed to the imperial authorities. The Emperor [[Gratian]] issued a decree which deprived the Priscillianists of their churches and sentenced them to exile. Instantius, Salvianus and Priscillian proceeded to Rome to gain the aid of [[Pope Damasus I]] (also from Iberia) in having this sentence revoked. On their journey they were joined by many supporters from Gaul, including a large number of women mentioned in contemporary sources. Reports of improper behavior by their followers and benefactors- possibly fabricated- were circulated against them.<ref name=Wace/>\n\nDenied an audience by Pope Damasus, they went to Milan to make a similar request of [[St Ambrose]], but with the same result. They then resorted to intrigue and bribery at the Court with such success that they were not only freed from the sentence of exile, but permitted to regain possession of their churches in Hispania, where, under the patronage of the imperial officials, they enjoyed such power as to compel Ithacius to leave the country. He, in turn, appealed to [[Gratian]], but before anything had been accomplished the emperor was murdered in Lyon, and [[Magnus Maximus]] had taken his place.<ref name=Healy/>\n\nMaximus treated the matter not as one of ecclesiastical rivalry, but as one of morality and society.<ref name=Wace/> As he wished to curry favour with the orthodox bishops and to replenish his treasury through confiscations, the Emperor gave orders for a synod, which was held in [[Bordeaux]] in 384. Instantius was first tried and condemned to deposition. Priscillian appealed to the emperor at [[Trier]]. Ithacius acted as his accuser and was so vehement in his denunciations that [[St Martin of Tours]], who was then in Trier, intervened. After expressing his disapproval of bringing an ecclesiastical case before a civil tribunal, he obtained from the emperor a promise not to carry his condemnation to the extent of shedding blood.\n\nAfter St Martin had left the city, the emperor appointed the Prefect Evodius as judge. He found Priscillian and some others guilty of the crime of magic. This decision was reported to the emperor, who ordered the execution of Priscillian and several of his followers. The property of others was confiscated and they were banished. The conduct of Ithacius was severely criticized. St Martin, hearing what had taken place, returned to Trier and compelled the emperor to rescind an order to [[military tribune]]s, who were on their way to Iberia to extirpate the heresy. The Church did not invoke civil authority to punish heretics. The pope censured not only the actions of Ithacius but also that of the emperor. St Ambrose was equally stern in his denunciation of the case. Some of the Gallican bishops, who were in Trier under the leadership of Theognistus, broke off communion with Ithacius. He was subsequently deposed from his see by a synod of Hispanic bishops, and his friend and abettor, Hydatius, was compelled to resign.\n\nAfter the executions of Priscillian and his followers by the emperor, however, the numbers and zeal of the heretics increased. In 400 another synod was held in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] to deal with this problem; many, including bishops Symphonius and Dictinnius, were reconciled to the Church through this synod.  Dictinnius was the author of a book ''Libra'' (Scales), a moral treatise from the Priscillianist viewpoint. The upheaval in the Iberian Peninsula due to the invasion of the [[Vandals]], the [[Alans]] and the [[Suevi]] aided the spread of Priscillianism. [[Paulus Orosius]], a [[Gallaecia]]n priest from northwest Hispania, wrote to [[Augustine of Hippo|St Augustine]] (415CE) to enlist his aid in combating the heresy. [[Pope Leo I]] at a later date took active steps for its repression and at his urgent insistence, councils were held in 446 and 447 at [[Astorga, Spain|Astorga]], [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]], and [[Braga]]. In spite of these efforts, the sect continued to spread during the fifth century. In the following century it began to decline. After the [[First Council of Braga]] (561), which specifically targeted its doctrines, it soon died out.\n\n==Teaching==\n\nThe Priscillianists taught a Gnostic-Manichaean doctrine of [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]], a belief in the existence of two kingdoms, one of Light and one of Darkness. Angels and the souls of men were said to be severed from the substance of the Deity. Human souls were intended to conquer the Kingdom of Darkness, but fell and were imprisoned in material bodies. Thus both kingdoms were represented in man. Their conflict was symbolized on the side of Light by the Twelve Patriarchs, heavenly spirits, who corresponded to certain of man's powers, and on the side of Darkness by the Signs of the [[Zodiac]], the symbols of matter and the lower kingdom. The salvation of man consists in liberation from the domination of matter. The twelve heavenly spirits having failed to accomplish their release, the Saviour came in a heavenly body that appeared to be like that of other men. Through His doctrine and His apparent death, he released the souls of the men from the influence of earthly matter.\n \nThese doctrines could be harmonized with the teaching of Scripture only by a complex system of [[exegesis]], rejecting conventional interpretations and relying on personal inspiration. The Priscillians respected most of the Old Testament but rejected the Creation story.  They believed that several of the apocryphal Scriptures were genuine and inspired. Because the Priscillians believe that matter and nature were evil, they became ascetics and fasted on Sundays and Christmas Day. Because their doctrines were esoteric and exoteric, and because it was believed that men in general could not understand the higher paths, the Priscillianists, or at least those of them who were enlightened, were permitted to tell lies for the sake of a holy end.  [[Saint Augustine|Augustine]] wrote a famous work, \"Contra Mendacium\" (\"Against Lying\") in reaction to this doctrine.\n\n==Writings and rediscovery==\n\nSome writings by Priscillian were accounted Orthodox and were not burned. For instance he divided the Pauline epistles (including the Epistle to the Hebrews) into a series of texts based on their theological points and wrote an introduction to each section. These \"canons\" survived in a form edited by [[Peregrinus (Spanish bishop)|Peregrinus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11664b.htm |title=Peregrinus |website=[[Catholic Encyclopedia]] |accessdate=15 April 2018}}</ref> They contain a strong call to a life of personal piety and asceticism, including [[celibacy]] and [[Christian_vegetarianism|abstinence from meat]] and wine.

Priscillianism was later considered a [[heresy]] by both the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and the [[Roman Catholic Church]].\n\n==History==\nMarcus, a native of Memphis in Egypt, came to Spain and taught Gnostic and Manichean theories.

Sac.\", II, 46</ref> Through his oratorical gifts and reputation for extreme [[asceticism]], Priscillian attracted a large following, including a [[rhetoric]]ian named Helpidus and two bishops, Instantius and Salvianus. \n\nThey established a new sect as an oath-bound society, <!-- over what? -->attracting the attention of the bishop [[Hyginus of Cordoba]]. Hyginus made his fears known to Hydatius, Bishop of [[M\u00e9rida, Spain|Emerita]], and Ithacius of [[Faro, Portugal|Ossonoba]].  The bishops of [[Hispania]] and [[Aquitaine]] held a synod at [[Zaragoza]] in 380. Though summoned, the Priscillianists refused to appear. The synod pronounced sentence of excommunication against the four leaders, Instantius, Salvianus, Helpidius and Priscillian.<ref name=Healy/>\n\nIthacius was chosen to enforce the synod's decrees, but he failed to bring the heretics to terms.  In defiance Priscillian was ordained to the priesthood and appointed [[Bishop of Avila]]. Ithacius then appealed to the imperial authorities. The Emperor [[Gratian]] issued a decree which deprived the Priscillianists of their churches and sentenced them to exile. Instantius, Salvianus and Priscillian proceeded to Rome to gain the aid of [[Pope Damasus I]] (also from Iberia) in having this sentence revoked. On their journey they were joined by many supporters from Gaul, including a large number of women mentioned in contemporary sources. Reports of improper behavior by their followers and benefactors- possibly fabricated- were circulated against them.<ref name=Wace/>\n\nDenied an audience by Pope Damasus, they went to Milan to make a similar request of [[St Ambrose]], but with the same result. They then resorted to intrigue and bribery at the Court with such success that they were not only freed from the sentence of exile, but permitted to regain possession of their churches in Hispania, where, under the patronage of the imperial officials, they enjoyed such power as to compel Ithacius to leave the country. He, in turn, appealed to [[Gratian]], but before anything had been accomplished the emperor was murdered in Lyon, and [[Magnus Maximus]] had taken his place.<ref name=Healy/>\n\nMaximus treated the matter not as one of ecclesiastical rivalry, but as one of morality and society.<ref name=Wace/> As he wished to curry favour with the orthodox bishops and to replenish his treasury through confiscations, the Emperor gave orders for a synod, which was held in [[Bordeaux]] in 384. Instantius was first tried and condemned to deposition. Priscillian appealed to the emperor at [[Trier]]. Ithacius acted as his accuser and was so vehement in his denunciations that [[St Martin of Tours]], who was then in Trier, intervened. After expressing his disapproval of bringing an ecclesiastical case before a civil tribunal, he obtained from the emperor a promise not to carry his condemnation to the extent of shedding blood.\n\nAfter St Martin had left the city, the emperor appointed the Prefect Evodius as judge.

After an unsuccessful stint as a performer in WWE, DeMott retired from in-ring competition and transitioned into the role of a trainer for the company's ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'' program, on which he became known for using a rough, controversial style in handling trainees, as well as WWE's developmental territories [[Deep South Wrestling]], [[Florida Championship Wrestling]], and [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]].\n\n==Early life==\nWilliam Charles DeMott II<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> was born on November 10, 1966,<ref name=\"OWOW\">{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html|title=Bill DeMott|accessdate=2009-03-05|publisher=Online World of Wrestling| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090221053236/http://onlineworldofwrestling.com/profiles/b/bill-demott.html| archivedate= 21 February 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> in [[Ridgewood, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"OWOW\"/> He grew up in [[Paramus, New Jersey]], graduating from [[Paramus High School]] in 1983.<ref>Levine, Cecilia.

DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\"</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131994)===\nDeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20132001)===\n\n====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\n====The Misfits In Action (2000\u20132001)====\n{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132007)===\n\n====The Alliance (2001\u20132002)====\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\n====SmackDown! (2002\u20132004)====\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of ''Velocity'', where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus [[Chris Kanyon]]. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the [[color commentator]] for ''Velocity'',<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31 31]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31}}</ref> beginning on the November 1 episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_5901.shtml|title=10/11 WWE Velocity review: Bill Demott debuts on color commentary}}</ref> and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2004\u20132007)====\nWhen ''[[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|Tough Enough 4]]'' wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''.

DeMott graduated from Paramus High School in 1983, and went on to become a pro wrestler, earning himself the title of world heavyweight champion, and more.\"</ref>\n\n==Professional wrestling career==\n===Early career (1988\u20131994)===\nDeMott was trained by [[Johnny Rodz]] in his [[New York City]] wrestling school beginning in 1988. From there he began working at small independent promotions using the name Big Sweet Williams. In 1992 DeMott began wrestling for the [[American Wrestling Federation]] and started using the [[ring name|name]] Crash the Terminator. Under this name he found some success, first capturing the AWF Heavyweight title from Steve Strong in [[Puerto Rico]], before moving on to the Japanese promotion W*ING and winning their World Tag Team Championship with [[Mr. Pogo]]. In 1993, while competing in W*ING, DeMott won a 16-man tournament to be crowned their World Heavyweight Champion.\n\nWhen DeMott returned to the United States, he wrestled for [[Extreme Championship Wrestling]] for a short time under his Crash the Terminator name. On February 21, 1994 DeMott received a tryout match with the [[World Wrestling Federation]] at a [[Monday Night Raw]] taping at Poughkeepsie, NY. He also had matches over the next two days at taping for [[WWF Superstars of Wrestling]] and [[Wrestling Challenge]].<ref>http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/94.htm</ref> He then went to Pennsylvania Championship Wrestling, where won the latter promotion's World Heavyweight Championship upon winning a [[Battle royal (professional wrestling)|battle royal]].  Crash's final ECW appearance came on May 13, 1994, in a TV victory against AJ Powers, which aired on June 7.\n\n===World Championship Wrestling (1995\u20132001)===\n\n====The Dungeon of Doom and The First Family (1995\u20132000)====\n{{Main|The First Family (professional wrestling)|l1=The First Family}}\nIn 1995, DeMott was signed to a [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) contract at the behest of [[Kevin Sullivan (wrestler)|Kevin Sullivan]] who had been impressed by him. He debuted in [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Dark match|dark match]]es as The Man of Question and The Laughing Man, a strange [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] that saw him wearing a singlet covered in question marks and laughing frequently. He made his television debut as a member of [[The Dungeon of Doom]] as \"The Laughing Man\" Hugh Morrus (a [[pun]] on the word humorous) on the November 18, 1995 episode of WCW Saturday Night in a [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Vignette|vignette]] inside the Dungeon, where Kevin Sullivan told his ([[kayfabe]]) father, [[King Curtis Iaukea|The Master]], that he was giving him something he never had: laughter, and that he was giving him \"the man from the Isle of Nowhere.\"\n\nUpon the dissolution of the Dungeon of Doom, Morrus was relegated to the undercard. He gained the distinction of being the first wrestler to lose a televised match to [[Bill Goldberg]] during the September 22, 1997 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]''. As a part of the growing [[hardcore wrestling]] style in WCW, Morrus joined [[Jimmy Hart]]'s [[The First Family (professional wrestling)|First Family]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Stable|stable]]. Although the Family found success and received a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] following a victory over their rivals [[Revolution (professional wrestling)|The Revolution]], the stable was suddenly disbanded.\n\nAt this time, DeMott took some time off from WCW. He returned in early 2000, utilizing the same name and ring attire, but [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squashing]] a number of wrestlers as an angrier version of himself. The angry Morrus gimmick came to a halt when [[Vince Russo]] and [[Eric Bischoff]] took over and aimed to take WCW in a new direction.\n\n====The Misfits In Action (2000\u20132001)====\n{{Main|The Misfits In Action}}\nAfter getting on Russo's bad side (in [[kayfabe]]), Morrus was fired from his [[The New Blood|New Blood]] stable along with a number of other wrestlers. These ex-New Blood members (including [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.]] and [[Booker T (wrestler)|Booker T]]) formed the comedic [[The Misfits In Action|Misfits In Action]] stable, which saw its members adopt both military-themed names and attires. As the stable's leader, Morrus re-christened himself General Hugh G. Rection, and led the group in a feud against [[The Filthy Animals]].\n\nThe group's comedic nature and the workrate of some of the wrestlers made the group immediate favorites with fans. Upon the introduction of the heel [[Team Canada (WCW)|Team Canada]], the Misfits In Action immediately began feuding with Team Canada, based over the patriotism both stables had for their respective countries. As the leader of the Misfits, Rection feuded with Team Canada's leader and [[WWE United States Championship|United States Heavyweight Champion]] [[Lance Storm]], with the two trading wins until Rection defeated both Storm and a [[turncoat]] [[Jim Duggan|\"Hacksaw\" Jim Duggan]] in a handicap match on October 29 at [[Halloween Havoc (2000)|Halloween Havoc]] to win the title. Rection would soon lose the title back to Storm on the November 13 episode of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'' before defeating Storm to regain the title on November 26 at [[Mayhem (2000)|Mayhem]].\n\nAfter his feud with Storm, the next night on ''Nitro'', DeMott stood in the ring and spoke to the fans. During this segment, the WCW locker room emptied and many wrestlers from backstage stood on the entrance way clapping for DeMott; [[Bill Goldberg]] grabbed the microphone and, fondly recalling his first opponent in WCW, said \"Hey, Goldberg's streak had to start somewhere, my friend.\"\n\nAt [[WCW Sin|Sin]] on January 14, 2001, Rection lost the United States Heavyweight Title to [[Shane Douglas]]. Following the title loss, the Misfits disbanded when Rection announced that they were [[Military discharge#Honorable|honorably discharged]], which led to Rection reverting to his Hugh Morrus name while the now former Misfits briefly feuded amongst each other. DeMott would then resume his pursuit of the United States Heavyweight Title until the [[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) bought out WCW.\n\n===World Wrestling Federation/Entertainment (2001\u20132007)===\n\n====The Alliance (2001\u20132002)====\nWhen WCW was purchased by the WWF, DeMott signed a deal with the WWF and became part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|The Invasion]] angle under his Hugh Morrus ring name as a member of [[The Alliance (professional wrestling)|The Alliance]]. Morrus made his WWF debut on the June 4, 2001 episode of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' by attacking [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]]. Aside from a [[pay-per-view]] match at [[WWF Invasion|Invasion]] on July 22 where he, [[Shawn Stasiak]] and [[Chris Kanyon]] defeated [[Big Show]], [[Billy Gunn]] and [[Matt Bloom|Albert]] and an [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Championship]] match on the August 27 episode of ''Raw'' which he lost to [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] via disqualification, Morrus was relegated to wrestling on the company's secondary shows ''[[WWE Heat|Heat]]'' and ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' much like his fellow WCW alumni. In the September 29 episode of WWE Metal, Morrus made his first appearance at the show, where he takes on Billy Gunn, in a losing effort. When The Invasion ended at [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]] following Team Alliance's loss to Team WWF, Morrus was [[kayfabe]] fired by [[Vince McMahon]]. While off television, Morrus performed at [[house show]]s and worked in company's developmental territory [[Heartland Wrestling Association]] (HWA). During his time in the HWA, he teamed with [[Raven (wrestler)|Raven]] to defeat [[Lance Cade]] and [[Steve Bradley]] to win the [[HWA Tag Team Championship|Tag Team Champions]] on March 12, 2002, which they lost only three days later.\n\n====SmackDown! (2002\u20132004)====\nIn April 2002, Morrus was drafted to the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] [[WWE Brand Extension|brand]]. He made his television return on the April 6 episode of ''[[WWE Jakked/Metal|Jakked]]'' alongside fellow WCW alumnus [[Chavo Guerrero, Jr.|Chavo Guerrero]] and defeated [[Gregory Helms|The Hurricane]] and [[Shoichi Funaki|Funaki]]. Morrus was soon relegated to being a mainstay on ''Jakked'' and later ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]'' until late July 2002, when he was [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Legit|legitimately]] injured in a motorcycle accident and had to take a leave of absence. During his time away, he became a trainer for the third season of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', WWE's [[reality television]] show.\n\nWhen he had sufficiently healed, Morrus made his return on the November 23 episode of ''Velocity'' under his real name. DeMott made his ''SmackDown!'' debut on December 5 as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]], where he defeated Funaki in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match. The victory saw DeMott immediately receive a [[Push (professional wrestling)|push]] that saw him squash several established wrestlers, including Funaki, [[Shannon Moore]], [[Chuck Palumbo]], [[Crash Holly]], and [[Rikishi (wrestler)|Rikishi]] weekly on ''SmackDown!''. However, this came to an end soon and saw DeMott relegated back to ''Velocity'' beginning in February 2003. In May, DeMott made a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Turn|turn]] that also saw him tell [[knock-knock joke]]s as part of the turn. As the [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] failed to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Over|get over]], he remained on ''Velocity'' while continuing to win several squash matches. DeMott wrestled his last televised match on the June 14 episode of ''Velocity'', where he defeated fellow WCW alumnus [[Chris Kanyon]]. Later that month, DeMott retired from in-ring action, citing years of knee injuries. He then moved on to become the [[color commentator]] for ''Velocity'',<ref name=Encyclopedia>{{cite book|title=WWE Encyclopedia|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|page=[https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31 31]|publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley|DK]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-7566-4190-0|url=https://archive.org/details/wweencyclopediad0000shie/page/31}}</ref> beginning on the November 1 episode,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/TV_Reports_9/article_5901.shtml|title=10/11 WWE Velocity review: Bill Demott debuts on color commentary}}</ref> and remained in that position until December 11, 2004.\n\n====Deep South Wrestling (2004\u20132007)====\nWhen ''[[WWE Tough Enough#$1,000,000 Tough Enough (Season 4)|Tough Enough 4]]'' wrapped production, DeMott did not make a return to ''[[WWE Velocity|Velocity]]''. Instead, he became a full-time trainer for WWE and began working in the company's [[Deep South Wrestling]] developmental territory.<ref name=DeMottFCW>{{cite web|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/quicknews/article_62025.shtml|title=DeMott confirms FCW head trainer role}}</ref> DeMott also worked as a booker for DSW, although his direction in the promotion received criticism, most notably by former WWE developmental wrestler [[Kenny Omega]], who soon requested to be released from his developmental contract due to poor treatment.<ref name=DeMottFCW/> DeMott was released from his WWE contract on January 19, 2007,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/3877160223|title=WWE releases Superstars|accessdate=2007-12-23|date=2007-01-19|publisher=WWE| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071212063005/http://www.wwe.com/inside/news/archive/3877160223| archivedate= 12 December 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> with [[Tom Prichard]] taking his place as DSW's head trainer.\n\nIn March 2015, [[Devon Nicholson]] described an incident from 2006 that DeMott was involved with while he was head trainer for the WWE's [[Deep South Wrestling]] developmental territory. Nicholson described an incident where [[Drew Hankinson]] was completely naked in the ring for a long period of time and gave naked [[Professional wrestling attacks#Stink Face|stinkface]]s to [[Zack Ryder]] and [[Melissa Coates]] while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony.

It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious around Dee and self-conscious. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago, where Mama carried her out in her arms as Dee watched the house burn, seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, and does not ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs in to the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama and they get into an argument. Dee feels that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is very physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' - Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name. \n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee(Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War.

[\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.
