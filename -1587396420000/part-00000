He was tonsured and subsequently ordained as a [[hieromonk]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. When Anthony was named Metropolitan of Kiev, he brought the young hieromonk with him and assigned him to the Old Ritualist parish at Nizhnaya Bogdanovka, near [[Lugansk]].\n\n==Conversion to Catholicism==\nBy 1918, Emelianov had become convinced that true Orthodoxy could not be had except through Communion with the [[Holy See]]. After learning that [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] [[Andrey Sheptytsky|Andrei Sheptytsky]] had formed an [[Exarchate]] for Russian Rite Catholics, Emelianov travelled to [[St. Petersburg]] to meet with the Exarch, [[Leonid Feodorov]]. After questioning him closely, Feodorov received Emelianov and his entire parish into the [[Russian Catholic Church]].\n\n==Persecution==\nEmelianov and his parishioners underwent severe harassment and violent persecution from both the Red Guards and the White Army during the [[Russian Civil War]]. On January 27, 1927 he was arrested and on September 12, 1927 was sentenced to 10 years in prison and was sent to [[Solovki prison camp]]. Emelianov was sent to Solovki prison camp with a special purpose, where he was held with other Catholic priests and participated in religious services. In 1929, along with other Catholic priests, he was transferred to a prison camp on [[Solovetsky Islands|Anzer Island]], where he was involved in secret worship. In 1932 he took place in the case of the Catholic clergy, signed on [[Solovki prison camp]]. During the interrogation, said: \"The time I spent in the camp, did not shake my religious beliefs here, I became even more resistant to further Catholic me nothing can shake.\" As a result, the authorities have decided to subject it to special punishment contain the islands separately from other priests until the end of isolation. \nIn November 1933 he was transferred to the station Belbaltlag Nadvoytsy, and then kept at the station Bear Mountain Kirov railway.\n\n==Death==\nOn August 4, 1936 Emelianov was released from the camp (probably because of a serious illness) and sent into exile. He died on August 14, 1936 at the [[Podvoytsy]] station in [[Karelia]]. Emilianov died while building the [[White Sea Canal]].\n\n==Legacy and Beatification==\nEmelianov is greatly venerated among [[Russian Catholic Church|Russian Catholics]].

Andrews]]-designed station was originally named ''Paragon Station'', and together with the adjoining Station Hotel, it opened in 1847 as the new Hull terminus for the growing traffic of the [[York and North Midland Railway|York and North Midland]] (Y&NMR) leased to the [[Hull and Selby Railway]] (H&S).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Angus|title=Hull Paragon Station gets new stonework facelift|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-Paragon-Station-gets-new-stonework-facelift/story-26842598-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 January 2016|work=Hull Daily Mail|date=7 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231836/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-Paragon-Station-gets-new-stonework-facelift/story-26842598-detail/story.html|archivedate=10 August 2015}}</ref> As well as trains to the west, the station was the terminus of the Y&NMR and H&S railway's [[Hull to Scarborough Line]]. From the 1860s the station also became the terminus of the [[Hull and Holderness Railway|Hull and Holderness]] and [[Hull and Hornsea Railway|Hull and Hornsea]] railways.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] (NER) expanded the trainshed and station to the designs of [[William Bell (architect)|William Bell]], installing the present five arched span platform roof. In 1962 a modernist office block Paragon House was installed above the station main entrance, replacing a 1900s iron canopy; the offices were initially used as regional headquarters for [[British Rail]].\n\nA bus station was erected adjacent to the north of the station in the mid 1930s. In the early 2000s plans for an integrated bus and rail station were made, as part of a larger development including a shopping centre; [[St Stephen's Hull|St Stephen's shopping centre]], a hotel, housing, and music and theatre facilities. The new station, named \"Paragon Interchange\" opened in September 2007, integrating the city's railway and bus stations under William Bell's 1900s trainshed.\n\nThe station is currently operated by [[TransPennine Express]], which provides train services along with [[Northern Trains]], [[Hull Trains]] and [[London North Eastern Railway]].\n\n==Paragon railway station==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1840 the [[Hull and Selby Railway]] opened the first railway line into Hull, terminating at a passenger and goods terminal, [[Manor House Street railway station|Manor House Street station]], adjacent to the [[Humber Dock]], near the old town. Subsequently, the Hull and Selby Railway entered into working arrangements with the [[Manchester and Leeds Railway]] and then the [[York and North Midland Railway]]. In 1845 an [[Act of Parliament]] enabled the York and North Midland and/or the Manchester and Leeds to take a lease of the company with an option to buy the line at a later date \u2013 only the York and North Midland was subsequently active. In 1846 the Hull and Selby completed its [[Hull and Selby Railway (Bridlington branch)|Bridlington branch]] which connected from a junction at [[Dairycoates]] near Hull to a line the York and North Midland was building from Bridlington to Seamer, connecting to its [[York to Scarborough Line]], forming a railway route from Hull to [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] on the east coast.<ref>See [[Hull and Selby Railway]], [[Hull to Scarborough Line|Hull to Scarborough Railway]]</ref>\n\n===First railway station, hotel and branches (1848)===\n[[File:Hull Paragon Station original south fascade.jpg|thumb|left|The original southern entrance range (2014)]]\nIn 1846 the York and North Midland and Manchester and Leeds railways began proceedings to create a new terminal station and connecting branch line in Hull.<ref>Sources:\n*{{cite journal|url = https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/20671/page/4970| pages = 4970\u20131| title = York and North Midland and Manchester and Leeds Railways (Hull Station and Branches)|date = 21 November 1846| issue = 20671| journal = The London Gazette}}\n*{{cite journal|url = https://www.thegazette.co.uk/London/issue/20671/page/4971| pages = 4971\u20132| title = York and North Midland (Hull Station and Branches)|date = 21 November 1846| issue = 20671| journal = The London Gazette}}</ref> The \"York and North Midland (Hull Station), 1847\" act was subsequently passed.{{#tag:ref|\"An Act for enabling the ''York and North Midland'' Railway Company to make a Station at ''Hull'', and certain Branch Railways connected with their Railways and the said Station; and for other Purposes.\", (Cap 218, 22 July 1847)<ref>{{cite book| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Rl1FAAAAcAAJ&pg=PR27#v=onepage&q&f=false| title = A Collection of the Public General Statutes passed in the Tenth and Eleventh Year of the Reign of Her Majesty Queen Victoria|year = 1847| page = xxvii}}</ref>|group=\"n\"}}\n\nThe new station had the advantage of being better situated for travellers, and allowed the old station to be used exclusively for freight traffic.

The [[G.T. Andrews]]-designed station was originally named ''Paragon Station'', and together with the adjoining Station Hotel, it opened in 1847 as the new Hull terminus for the growing traffic of the [[York and North Midland Railway|York and North Midland]] (Y&NMR) leased to the [[Hull and Selby Railway]] (H&S).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Angus|title=Hull Paragon Station gets new stonework facelift|url=http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-Paragon-Station-gets-new-stonework-facelift/story-26842598-detail/story.html|accessdate=28 January 2016|work=Hull Daily Mail|date=7 July 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150810231836/http://www.hulldailymail.co.uk/Hull-Paragon-Station-gets-new-stonework-facelift/story-26842598-detail/story.html|archivedate=10 August 2015}}</ref> As well as trains to the west, the station was the terminus of the Y&NMR and H&S railway's [[Hull to Scarborough Line]]. From the 1860s the station also became the terminus of the [[Hull and Holderness Railway|Hull and Holderness]] and [[Hull and Hornsea Railway|Hull and Hornsea]] railways.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th&nbsp;century the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] (NER) expanded the trainshed and station to the designs of [[William Bell (architect)|William Bell]], installing the present five arched span platform roof. In 1962 a modernist office block Paragon House was installed above the station main entrance, replacing a 1900s iron canopy; the offices were initially used as regional headquarters for [[British Rail]].\n\nA bus station was erected adjacent to the north of the station in the mid 1930s. In the early 2000s plans for an integrated bus and rail station were made, as part of a larger development including a shopping centre; [[St Stephen's Hull|St Stephen's shopping centre]], a hotel, housing, and music and theatre facilities. The new station, named \"Paragon Interchange\" opened in September 2007, integrating the city's railway and bus stations under William Bell's 1900s trainshed.\n\nThe station is currently operated by [[TransPennine Express]], which provides train services along with [[Northern Trains]], [[Hull Trains]] and [[London North Eastern Railway]].\n\n==Paragon railway station==\n\n===Background===\nIn 1840 the [[Hull and Selby Railway]] opened the first railway line into Hull, terminating at a passenger and goods terminal, [[Manor House Street railway station|Manor House Street station]], adjacent to the [[Humber Dock]], near the old town.

According to the ministry, mistakes on the map used in the teleplay include that it incorrectly delineated the boundaries of the southern areas of the Tibet autonomous region, the colors for Taiwan and Hainan islands were different from other parts of China; and the dotted line to indicate Chinese islands in the South China Sea was missing. The issue has since been investigated by China's Ministry of Natural Resources.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201908/03/WS5d44e1caa310cf3e35563adb.html|title=Popular TV show retracts inaccurate map of China|date=August 3, 2019|website=China Daily}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/3021514/hit-chinese-tv-show-go-go-squid-investigated-showing-map-without|title=Hit Chinese TV show Go Go Squid! investigated for showing map without Taiwan and Hainan|date=August 5, 2019|website=South China Morning Post}}</ref> On August 12, the production company was fined RMB 100,000 (US$ 14,100) by Shanghai Municipality Planning and Natural Resources Bureau.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.chinanews.com/sh/2019/10-22/8985793.shtml |title=\u56e0\u767b\u8f7d\u4e0d\u5408\u89c4\u5730\u56fe \u300a\u4eb2\u7231\u7684\uff0c\u70ed\u7231\u7684\u300b\u88ab\u7f5a10\u4e07\u5143|accessdate=2019-10-22 |author= \u5b8b\u5b87\u665f|date=2019-10-22  |publisher=China News Service |language= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Eva |first1=Fu |title=Beijing Fines Popular TV Drama for Showing Map That Left Out Taiwan |url=https://www.theepochtimes.com/beijing-fines-popular-tv-drama-for-showing-map-that-left-out-taiwan_3124470.html |accessdate=1 April 2020 |work=www.theepochtimes.com |publisher=The Epoch Times |date=22 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Soundtrack==\n\"The Unknown Generation\" is the theme song of the drama The wind echoes the plot very much. In addition to telling love stories between couples, the TV series also tells a group of young people working hard for seemingly unremarkable dreams, occupations, and hobbies. Compared with national athletes and international superstars, e-sports players may really be \"unknown people\", but this group of young people choose to ignore everyone's colored vision, insist on pursuing their dreams, and win glory for the country. The songs are composed by Tang Hanxiao.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Yuqi |first1=Ye |title=Hearing sweet, high-quality youth \u2500 \"Go Go Squid!\" Soundtrack |url=https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2120588.html |accessdate=April 15, 2020 |work=[[Sin Chew Daily]] |date=September 29, 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20200415085043/https://www.sinchew.com.my/content/content_2120588.html |archivedate=April 15, 2020 |language=zh}}</ref>\n\n<Couldn't Leave> is the only English episode, sung by a Kazakh male singer, Dimaxi. The lyrics are simple, but the love is profound. \"So many times I wish I could leave\", tells that someone in the play wants to give up, but because of a kind of power (in the play is a group of brothers working hard together) to make me persevere. The singer sang freely, which made the audience worried.\n\nSongs expressing love include \"Milk Bread\" and \"happiness walking together\". The lyrics and singing methods are sweet. The pink bubbles are next to you. You can feel the simple and lovely love between the hero and the hero without watching TV.\n\nMilk Bread sung by Yang Zi, peak at 2 on Billboard Billboard China Social Chart\nLi Xian also participated in the soundtrack title ''For the Future (Gei Wei Lai)''. The singing voice is similar to his interpretation of Han Shangyan, which is convergent and low-key, seemingly absent. Even when it comes to the climax in the play or song, it expresses everything with a calm and mature character. What attracted me to this song was the middle part of the child's voice, as if there was a kind of magic power to let each other sing courageously.

The lyrics are simple, but the love is profound. \"So many times I wish I could leave\", tells that someone in the play wants to give up, but because of a kind of power (in the play is a group of brothers working hard together) to make me persevere. The singer sang freely, which made the audience worried.\n\nSongs expressing love include \"Milk Bread\" and \"happiness walking together\". The lyrics and singing methods are sweet. The pink bubbles are next to you. You can feel the simple and lovely love between the hero and the hero without watching TV.\n\nMilk Bread sung by Yang Zi, peak at 2 on Billboard Billboard China Social Chart\nLi Xian also participated in the soundtrack title ''For the Future (Gei Wei Lai)''. The singing voice is similar to his interpretation of Han Shangyan, which is convergent and low-key, seemingly absent.

In February 1589, he was ordered to appear in front of the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]]. Failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel.{{sfn|Balfour Paul|p=574}}\n\nHe engaged with Huntly and Crawford in a rebellion in the north of Scotland, but their forces surrendered at [[Aberdeen]] on the arrival of the king in April; and in July, Erroll gave himself up to James, who leniently refrained from exacting any penalty. Erroll submitted himself to the king's mercy at [[Edzell Castle]] on 5 August 1589.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 132.</ref> In September of the same year he entered into a personal bond with Huntly for mutual assistance; and in 1590 displeased the king by marrying, in spite of his prohibition, Lady [[Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll|Elizabeth Douglas]], daughter of the [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{sfn|Balfour Paul|p=574}} The marriage was arranged at the initiative of the [[Thomas Lyon (of Auldbar)|Master of Glamis]], to form a political faction. On 21 April 1590 the [[John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]] and others at [[Megginch Castle]] tried to persuade him not to marry her, but Erroll argued he could change his wife's friends' alliances.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (1936), p. 281, 285: ''Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 506-7.</ref>\n\nErroll was imprisoned on suspicion of complicity in the attempt made by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]] and [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray]] to surprise the king at [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] in June 1592; and though he obtained his release, he was again proclaimed a rebel on account of the discovery of his signature to two of the ''[[Spanish Blanks]]'', unwritten sheets subscribed with the names of the chief conspirators in a plot for a Spanish invasion of Scotland, to be filled up later with the terms of the projected treaty. After a failure to apprehend him in March 1593, Erroll and his companions were sentenced to abjure Roman Catholicism or leave the kingdom; and on their non-compliance were in 1594 declared traitors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn 3 October they defeated at [[Battle of Glenlivet|Glenlivet]] a force sent against them under the Earl of Argyll; though Erroll himself was severely wounded, and [[Old Slains Castle]], his seat, razed to the ground. The rebel lords left Scotland in 1595, and Erroll, on report of his further conspiracies abroad, was arrested by the states of [[Zeeland]], but was afterwards allowed to escape. He returned to Scotland secretly in 1596. In March 1597 he was lodged in the Canongate of Edinburgh, and was in the especial favour of [[Anne of Denmark]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 493.</ref> On 20 June 1597 he abjured Roman Catholicism and made his peace with the [[Church of Scotland]]. He enjoyed the favour of the king, and in 1602 was appointed a commissioner to negotiate the union with England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis relations with the Kirk, however, were not so amicable. The reality of his conversion was disputed, and on 21 May 1608 he was confined to the city of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] for the better resolution of his doubts, being subsequently declared an obstinate \"[[papist]]\", [[excommunicated]], deprived of his estate, and imprisoned at [[Dumbarton]]; and after some further vacillation was finally released in May 1611.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe dispute which began in his lifetime concerning the hereditary office of [[Lord High Constable of Scotland|Lord High Constable]] between the families of Erroll and of the [[Earl Marischal|Earls Marischal]] was settled finally in favour of the former; thus establishing the [[Order of precedence in Scotland|precedence]] enjoyed by the earls of Erroll next after the royal family over all other subjects in Scotland.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n\nHe married:\n#Mary, daughter of [[John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl]] and [[Margaret Fleming, Countess of Atholl|Margaret Fleming]], in 1587.\n#Margaret, daughter of [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]]\n#Elizabeth, daughter of [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton]]\n\nBy his third wife [[Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll|Elizabeth Douglas]] he had five sons and eight daughters:\n\n#[[William Hay, 10th Earl of Erroll|William]], 10th earl\n#George\n#Francis\n#Thomas\n#Lewis\n#Anne, married [[George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton]]\n#Jean, married [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1585\u20131654)|John Erskine, Earl of Mar]]\n#Mary, married [[Walter Scott, 1st Earl of Buccleuch]]\n#Elizabeth, married [[Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill]]; secondly; [[James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington]]\n#Sophia, married John, Viscount Melgum, son of [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]]\n#Margaret, married Sir John Seton of Barns\n#Isabel, died unmarried\n#Helen (died 1625, aged 10)\n\nThe earl died on 16 July 1631, and was buried in the church of [[Slains]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The poet [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]] composed a poem in Latin for his funeral.<ref name=\"earldoms\">{{cite book|last1=Mackintosh|first1=John|authorlink=John Mackintosh (historian)|title=Historic Earls and Earldoms of Scotland|date=1898|url=https://archive.org/details/historicearlsear00mack}}</ref>\n\n==Descendants of note==\n* [[Earl W.

He was the second eldest son, but his older brother Alexander, who was a [[deaf-mute]], was declared \"insane\" and skipped in the succession. Francis succeeded to the earldom upon the death of his father in 1585.<ref name=\"peerage\">{{cite book|author=[[James Balfour Paul]]|title=[[The Scots Peerage]]: Volume 3|date=1906|publisher=D. Douglas|page=572|ref=Balfour Paul}}</ref>\n\nEarly in his life he converted to [[Roman Catholicism]], and as the associate of [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]] joined in the Spanish conspiracies against the throne of [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} In 1589, he began engaging in treasonous correspondence with King [[Philip II of Spain]], who was also briefly King of England by his marriage to [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]].{{sfn|Balfour Paul|p=574}}\n\nA letter he wrote to King Philip  declaring his allegiance to Spain was intercepted and sent by Elizabeth to [[James VI of Scotland|James VI]]. In February 1589, he was ordered to appear in front of the [[Privy Council of Scotland|Privy Council]]. Failing to appear, he was denounced as a rebel.{{sfn|Balfour Paul|p=574}}\n\nHe engaged with Huntly and Crawford in a rebellion in the north of Scotland, but their forces surrendered at [[Aberdeen]] on the arrival of the king in April; and in July, Erroll gave himself up to James, who leniently refrained from exacting any penalty. Erroll submitted himself to the king's mercy at [[Edzell Castle]] on 5 August 1589.<ref>''Calendar of State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (Edinburgh, 1936), p. 132.</ref> In September of the same year he entered into a personal bond with Huntly for mutual assistance; and in 1590 displeased the king by marrying, in spite of his prohibition, Lady [[Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll|Elizabeth Douglas]], daughter of the [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}{{sfn|Balfour Paul|p=574}} The marriage was arranged at the initiative of the [[Thomas Lyon (of Auldbar)|Master of Glamis]], to form a political faction. On 21 April 1590 the [[John Graham, 3rd Earl of Montrose|Earl of Montrose]] and others at [[Megginch Castle]] tried to persuade him not to marry her, but Erroll argued he could change his wife's friends' alliances.<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 10 (1936), p. 281, 285: ''Register of the Privy Council, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1881), pp. 506-7.</ref>\n\nErroll was imprisoned on suspicion of complicity in the attempt made by [[James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell]] and [[Patrick Gray, 6th Lord Gray]] to surprise the king at [[Falkland, Fife|Falkland]] in June 1592; and though he obtained his release, he was again proclaimed a rebel on account of the discovery of his signature to two of the ''[[Spanish Blanks]]'', unwritten sheets subscribed with the names of the chief conspirators in a plot for a Spanish invasion of Scotland, to be filled up later with the terms of the projected treaty. After a failure to apprehend him in March 1593, Erroll and his companions were sentenced to abjure Roman Catholicism or leave the kingdom; and on their non-compliance were in 1594 declared traitors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nOn 3 October they defeated at [[Battle of Glenlivet|Glenlivet]] a force sent against them under the Earl of Argyll; though Erroll himself was severely wounded, and [[Old Slains Castle]], his seat, razed to the ground. The rebel lords left Scotland in 1595, and Erroll, on report of his further conspiracies abroad, was arrested by the states of [[Zeeland]], but was afterwards allowed to escape. He returned to Scotland secretly in 1596. In March 1597 he was lodged in the Canongate of Edinburgh, and was in the especial favour of [[Anne of Denmark]].<ref>''Calendar State Papers Scotland'', vol. 11 (Edinburgh, 1952), p. 493.</ref> On 20 June 1597 he abjured Roman Catholicism and made his peace with the [[Church of Scotland]]. He enjoyed the favour of the king, and in 1602 was appointed a commissioner to negotiate the union with England.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nHis relations with the Kirk, however, were not so amicable. The reality of his conversion was disputed, and on 21 May 1608 he was confined to the city of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]] for the better resolution of his doubts, being subsequently declared an obstinate \"[[papist]]\", [[excommunicated]], deprived of his estate, and imprisoned at [[Dumbarton]]; and after some further vacillation was finally released in May 1611.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\nThe dispute which began in his lifetime concerning the hereditary office of [[Lord High Constable of Scotland|Lord High Constable]] between the families of Erroll and of the [[Earl Marischal|Earls Marischal]] was settled finally in favour of the former; thus establishing the [[Order of precedence in Scotland|precedence]] enjoyed by the earls of Erroll next after the royal family over all other subjects in Scotland.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}\n\n==Marriage and issue==\n\nHe married:\n#Mary, daughter of [[John Stewart, 4th Earl of Atholl]], in 1587.\n#Margaret, daughter of [[James Stewart, 1st Earl of Moray|James Stewart, Earl of Moray]]\n#Elizabeth, daughter of [[William Douglas, 6th Earl of Morton]]\n\nBy his third wife [[Elizabeth Douglas, Countess of Erroll|Elizabeth Douglas]] he had five sons and eight daughters:\n\n#[[William Hay, 10th Earl of Erroll|William]], 10th earl\n#George\n#Francis\n#Thomas\n#Lewis\n#Anne, married [[George Seton, 3rd Earl of Winton]]\n#Jean, married [[John Erskine, Earl of Mar (1585\u20131654)|John Erskine, Earl of Mar]]\n#Mary, married [[Walter Scott, 1st Earl of Buccleuch]]\n#Elizabeth, married [[Hugh Sempill, 5th Lord Sempill]]; secondly; [[James Douglas, 1st Lord Mordington]]\n#Sophia, married John, Viscount Melgum, son of [[George Gordon, 1st Marquess of Huntly]]\n#Margaret, married Sir John Seton of Barns\n#Isabel, died unmarried\n#Helen (died 1625, aged 10)\n\nThe earl died on 16 July 1631, and was buried in the church of [[Slains]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} The poet [[Arthur Johnston (poet)|Arthur Johnston]] composed a poem in Latin for his funeral.<ref name=\"earldoms\">{{cite book|last1=Mackintosh|first1=John|authorlink=John Mackintosh (historian)|title=Historic Earls and Earldoms of Scotland|date=1898|url=https://archive.org/details/historicearlsear00mack}}</ref>\n\n==Descendants of note==\n* [[Earl W.
