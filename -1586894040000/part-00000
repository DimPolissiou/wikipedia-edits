Along with such monumental [[religious]] edifices as [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago|St. Mary of the Angels]], [[St. Hedwig's in Chicago|St. Hedwig's]], and [[St. Wenceslaus in Chicago|St. Wenceslaus]], it is one of the many monumental Polish churches visible from the [[Kennedy Expressway]].\n\n==History==\n\nFounded in 1894 by [[Resurrectionist Order|Resurrectionsists]] from the city's first [[Poles|Polish]] parish, [[St. Stanislaus Kostka Church (Chicago, Illinois)|St. Stanislaus Kostka]], St. Hyacinth became the center of Chicago's most well-known [[Polish Patch]], [[Avondale, Chicago|Jackowo]].  The parish has been intimately tied in with [[Chicago]]'s [[Poles|Polish]] immigrants, particularly those who arrived in the [[Solidarnosc|Solidarity]] and Post-Solidarity waves of Polish migration to Chicago in the 1980s. On June 26, 2003, [[Pope John Paul II]] granted the designation of [[minor basilica]], the third church in [[Illinois]] to achieve this status.   On November 30, 2003, Cardinal [[Francis George]], O.M.I., officially proclaimed St. Hyacinth Church a basilica of the Archdiocese of Chicago.\n\nNeighboring [[St. Wenceslaus in Chicago|St. Wenceslaus]] parish was founded in 1912 as a [[Poles|Polish]] parish to relieve overcrowding at St. Hyacinth parish.\n\nThe 1999 film ''[[Stir of Echoes]]'', was partly filmed at St. Hyacinth Basilica.\n\n==Architecture==\n\nThe church was designed by the architectural firm of [[Worthmann and Steinbach]] who built many of the magnificent [[Polish Cathedral]]s in [[Chicago]].  The church structure\u2014a red-brick edifice in the [[Classical Revival]] style has an ornate interior of [[Baroque]] influence.  Ground breaking occurred on April 30, 1917 and the [[cornerstone]] was laid on October 21, 1917. Completion of the building was delayed for years by financial and construction difficulties, with the first [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] celebrated in the structure not taking place until August 7, 1921.  Official dedication occurred on October 16, 1921 with Archbishop [[George Mundelein|Cardinal George W. Mundelein]] presiding.\n\nSt. Hyacinth's recognizable three-towered fa\u00e7ade is rarely seen in American [[church architecture]] as well as the Baroque period that its style is modeled on.  The church bells are a product of the McShoe Bell Foundry of Baltimore, Maryland were blessed and placed in the steeples in April 1924.\nSt. Hyacinth's bears a striking similarity to [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago|St. Mary of the Angels]], which was designed by the same architects at about the same time and use the same combination of [[Masonry|stone]], glazed [[terra-cotta]] and [[brick]].  Also like at [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago|St. Mary of the Angels]], much of the church's interior was decorated by [[John Anton Mallin]], who decorated many other churches in [[Illinois]], with two years of planning and another two years to execute the project. St. Hyacinth's is also home to the masterworks of such renowned painters as [[Thaddeus von Zukotynski]] and [[Mary Stanisia]].  Beginning in the mid-1990s, and taking almost a decade, the interior was renewed thoroughly, much of the mural work being performed by [[Conrad Schmitt Studios]], Inc., of [[Wisconsin]].\n\nThe Stained Glass Windows have been identified as prepared by Meyer Co. of Munich, Germany and some by the Zettler Co. of New York were installed in 1921. The Church's organ is a mid-sized [[Kilgen]] organ (of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) with 34 ranks was likewise installed in the church in 1921. The Stations of the Cross were likely assembled in Austria in the 1830s.\n\nA number of statues are found within the basilica's interior. A bas-relief of St. Hyacinth hangs above the main altar, as well as full statues of [[St. Peter]] and [[St. Paul]]. Figures of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] and the Blessed Mother (Immaculate Conception) are found at lesser side altars along with a figure of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] as a [[Piet\u00e0]] in the church's eastern [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]]. Additionally, sculptures of [[St. Joseph]], [[St. Ann]], the [[Infant of Prague]], [[St. Maximilian Kolbe]], [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[St. Anthony of Padua]], [[St. Barbara]] and [[St. Therese of Lisieux]] are spread throughout the sanctuary.\n\nThe large saucer [[dome]] which hangs over the church's crossing has a gigantic [[mural]] covering some {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}} with over 150 figures, depicting saints, clergy and laity.\n\nA large [[icon]] of [[Our Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa]] that was brought in from Poland occupies the shrine in the basilica's western [[transept]]. The icon, which had been blessed by [[Pope John Paul II]] is crowned in keeping with [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, with the [[Virgin Mary]]'s crown measuring nearly a foot long while the [[infant Jesus]]'s crown being slightly smaller in size, each one bookended by [[bas-relief]] sculpted angels. Both crowns were crafted by Adam and Kathy Karbownik who melted down the gold and set the gemstones in them, while the jewelry used in the crowns was donated by thousands of parishioners with the gold alone weighed in at ten pounds\n<ref>\n{{Cite news\n  | last = DeFiglio\n  | first = Pam\n  | author-link =\n  | title = Icon's crown made from jewelry donated by faithful\n  | newspaper = Catholic New World\n  | volume = 116\n  | issue = 19\n  | pages = 56\n  | date = September 14\u201327, 2008\n  \n  | url =\n  | postscript = <!--None--> }}.\n</ref>\n\nThree pairs of monumental [[bronze]] doors were hung along the main entrance at the basilica's northern end by famed [[Poles|Polish]] sculptor Professor [[Czes\u0142aw D\u017awigaj]], well known for also casting the monument of [[Christ the King]] in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] in front of [[St. Mary of Cz\u0119stochowa in Cicero|the church of St. Mary of Cz\u0119stochowa]] as well as the [[Tolerance Monument]] that was recently unveiled in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nMonuments to [[Pope John Paul II]], Father [[Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko]], as well as a memorial to parishioners who served in the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] during World War I can be found in the neighboring 'Garden of Memory'.\n\n==Center of Chicago's Polonia==\n{{main|Chicago's Polish Village}}\n[[File:Rahm Emanuel at St. Hyacinth Church.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rahm Emanuel]] speaking at St. Hyacinth Basilica.]]\nDue to St. Hyacinth's impressive size and history as the center of the neighborhood of first arrival for countless [[Polish Americans]], the Basilica is considered to be the center of ''[[Chicago Polonia|Chicago's Polonia]]'', or Polish community.\n\nThis has brought notable visitors to St. Hyacinth's who come here to reach out to Chicago's Polish community. This has included General '''[[J\u00f3zef Haller de Hallenburg]]''', Prime Minister '''[[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]]''', [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner and former [[Presidents of Poland|President of Poland]] '''[[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]''', former Premier '''[[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]]'''  as well as his deceased twin brother President '''[[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]]''' paid official visits to St. Hyacinth's. Other famous '''[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]''' activists such as [[Anna Walentynowicz]], [[Zbigniew Romaszewski]] and [[Antoni Macierewicz]] have visited the Basilica as well. Famous clergy have also visited, including the [[Servant of God]] [[Jan Cieplak]] as well as the future '''[[Pope John Paul II]]''' who trekked to St. Hyacinth's several times as the Archbishop of Cracow and referred to his gatherings there during his 1979 [[Pastoral trips of Pope John Paul II|pilgrimage to Chicago]].<ref>http://www.nwchicagohistory.org/NWCHS_-_July_2009.pdf</ref>\n\nSt. Hyacinth's also served as the place for local and national political elites to publicly cavort for the support of the [[Polish American]] electorate with politicians, their first stop as they would tour [[Chicago's Polish Village]] along with an obligatory meal at one of the local Polish restaurants. No less a figure than former President '''[[George H. W. Bush]]''' attended mass at St. Hyacinth's twice, first as Vice President in 1985, as well as during his 1988 campaign. Purportedly violence almost broke out as supporters of [[Lyndon LaRouche]] protesting outside the basilica were not looked at very kindly by local Poles, who had a reverence for the candidate they saw as the best hope against the loathed [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist regime in Poland]].<ref>http://www.polishnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1329:avondale-and-chicagos-polish-village&catid=90:polish-tradition&Itemid=322</ref>\n\n==Relics==\nSt. Hyacinth Basilica has an impressive collection of relics of [[Saints of the Roman Catholic Church]]. A total of 121 relics are encased and presented to the faithful on [[All Saints Day]], as well as the memorial day of each saint. Among them are:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n*[[Hyacinth of Poland|St. Hyacinth]]\n*[[St. Stanislaus Kostka]]\n*[[St. Bonaventure]]\n*[[St. Clara]]\n*[[St. Andrew Bobola]]\n*[[St. John Bosco]]\n*[[St. Maria Goretti]]\n*[[St. Bernadette]]\n*[[Julian of Antioch|St. Julian]]\n*[[Pope Gregory I]]\n*[[St. Elizabeth Seton]]\n*[[St. Francis of Rome]]\n*[[St. Vincent De Paul]]\n*[[St. Ann]]\n*[[St. John Cantius]]\n*[[St. John Chrysostom]]\n*[[St. Blaise]]\n*[[St. Philip Neri]]\n*[[St. Francis Xavier]]\n*[[St. John Berchmans]]\n*[[bl.

About 8,000 worshippers attend mass every weekend. In keeping with customs brought to the area by Polish immigrants, the area is also known as \"[[Avondale, Chicago#The Polish Village - Jackowo and Wac.C5.82awowo|Jackowo]]\", as \"Jacek\" is Polish for the proper name \"[[Hyacinth of Poland|Hyacinth]]\". Naming neighborhoods or geographical areas after the local parish church is a widespread habit of Polish Catholics.\n\nSt. Hyacinth once had a thriving elementary school.   In the 60's enrollment was over 2,500 students.  On October 29, 2014, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced the closing of the school after the 2014\u20132015 school year.

Also like at [[St. Mary of the Angels in Chicago|St. Mary of the Angels]], much of the church's interior was decorated by [[John Anton Mallin]], who decorated many other churches in [[Illinois]], with two years of planning and another two years to execute the project. St. Hyacinth's is also home to the masterworks of such renowned painters as [[Thaddeus von Zukotynski]] and [[Mary Stanisia]].  Beginning in the mid-1990s, and taking almost a decade, the interior was renewed thoroughly, much of the mural work being performed by [[Conrad Schmitt Studios]], Inc., of [[Wisconsin]].\n\nThe Stained Glass Windows have been identified as prepared by Meyer Co. of Munich, Germany and some by the Zettler Co. of New York were installed in 1921. The Church's organ is a mid-sized [[Kilgen]] organ (of [[St. Louis, Missouri]]) with 34 ranks was likewise installed in the church in 1921. The Stations of the Cross were likely assembled in Austria in the 1830s.\n\nA number of statues are found within the basilica's interior. A bas-relief of St. Hyacinth hangs above the main altar, as well as full statues of [[St. Peter]] and [[St. Paul]]. Figures of the [[Sacred Heart of Jesus]] and the Blessed Mother (Immaculate Conception) are found at lesser side altars along with a figure of [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] as a [[Piet\u00e0]] in the church's eastern [[alcove (architecture)|alcove]]. Additionally, sculptures of [[St. Joseph]], [[St. Ann]], the [[Infant of Prague]], [[St. Maximilian Kolbe]], [[St. Francis of Assisi]], [[St. Anthony of Padua]], [[St. Barbara]] and [[St. Therese of Lisieux]] are spread throughout the sanctuary.\n\nThe large saucer [[dome]] which hangs over the church's crossing has a gigantic [[mural]] covering some {{convert|3000|sqft|m2}} with over 150 figures, depicting saints, clergy and laity.\n\nA large [[icon]] of [[Our Lady of Cz\u0119stochowa]] that was brought in from Poland occupies the shrine in the basilica's western [[transept]]. The icon, which had been blessed by [[Pope John Paul II]] is crowned in keeping with [[Roman Catholic]] tradition, with the [[Virgin Mary]]'s crown measuring nearly a foot long while the [[infant Jesus]]'s crown being slightly smaller in size, each one bookended by [[bas-relief]] sculpted angels. Both crowns were crafted by Adam and Kathy Karbownik who melted down the gold and set the gemstones in them, while the jewelry used in the crowns was donated by thousands of parishioners with the gold alone weighed in at ten pounds\n<ref>\n{{Cite news\n  | last = DeFiglio\n  | first = Pam\n  | author-link =\n  | title = Icon's crown made from jewelry donated by faithful\n  | newspaper = Catholic New World\n  | volume = 116\n  | issue = 19\n  | pages = 56\n  | date = September 14\u201327, 2008\n  \n  | url =\n  | postscript = <!--None--> }}.\n</ref>\n\nThree pairs of monumental [[bronze]] doors were hung along the main entrance at the basilica's northern end by famed [[Poles|Polish]] sculptor Professor [[Czes\u0142aw D\u017awigaj]], well known for also casting the monument of [[Christ the King]] in [[Cicero, Illinois|Cicero]] in front of [[St. Mary of Cz\u0119stochowa in Cicero|the church of St. Mary of Cz\u0119stochowa]] as well as the [[Tolerance Monument]] that was recently unveiled in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nMonuments to [[Pope John Paul II]], Father [[Jerzy Popie\u0142uszko]], as well as a memorial to parishioners who served in the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] during World War I can be found in the neighboring 'Garden of Memory'.\n\n==Center of Chicago's Polonia==\n{{main|Chicago's Polish Village}}\n[[File:Rahm Emanuel at St. Hyacinth Church.jpg|thumb|right|[[Rahm Emanuel]] speaking at St. Hyacinth Basilica.]]\nDue to St. Hyacinth's impressive size and history as the center of the neighborhood of first arrival for countless [[Polish Americans]], the Basilica is considered to be the center of ''[[Chicago Polonia|Chicago's Polonia]]'', or Polish community.\n\nThis has brought notable visitors to St. Hyacinth's who come here to reach out to Chicago's Polish community. This has included General '''[[J\u00f3zef Haller de Hallenburg]]''', Prime Minister '''[[Stanis\u0142aw Miko\u0142ajczyk]]''', [[Nobel Peace Prize]] winner and former [[Presidents of Poland|President of Poland]] '''[[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]]''', former Premier '''[[Jaros\u0142aw Kaczy\u0144ski]]'''  as well as his deceased twin brother President '''[[Lech Kaczy\u0144ski]]''' paid official visits to St. Hyacinth's. Other famous '''[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]''' activists such as [[Anna Walentynowicz]], [[Zbigniew Romaszewski]] and [[Antoni Macierewicz]] have visited the Basilica as well. Famous clergy have also visited, including the [[Servant of God]] [[Jan Cieplak]] as well as the future '''[[Pope John Paul II]]''' who trekked to St. Hyacinth's several times as the Archbishop of Cracow and referred to his gatherings there during his 1979 [[Pastoral trips of Pope John Paul II|pilgrimage to Chicago]].<ref>http://www.nwchicagohistory.org/NWCHS_-_July_2009.pdf</ref>\n\nSt. Hyacinth's also served as the place for local and national political elites to publicly cavort for the support of the [[Polish American]] electorate with politicians, their first stop as they would tour [[Chicago's Polish Village]] along with an obligatory meal at one of the local Polish restaurants. No less a figure than former President '''[[George H. W. Bush]]''' attended mass at St. Hyacinth's twice, first as Vice President in 1985, as well as during his 1988 campaign. Purportedly violence almost broke out as supporters of [[Lyndon LaRouche]] protesting outside the basilica were not looked at very kindly by local Poles, who had a reverence for the candidate they saw as the best hope against the loathed [[People's Republic of Poland|Communist regime in Poland]].<ref>http://www.polishnews.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1329:avondale-and-chicagos-polish-village&catid=90:polish-tradition&Itemid=322</ref>\n\n==Relics==\nSt. Hyacinth Basilica has an impressive collection of relics of [[Saints of the Roman Catholic Church]]. A total of 121 relics are encased and presented to the faithful on [[All Saints Day]], as well as the memorial day of each saint. Among them are:\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n\n*[[Hyacinth of Poland|St. Hyacinth]]\n*[[St. Stanislaus Kostka]]\n*[[St. Bonaventure]]\n*[[St. Clara]]\n*[[St. Andrew Bobola]]\n*[[St. John Bosco]]\n*[[St. Maria Goretti]]\n*[[St. Bernadette]]\n*[[Julian of Antioch|St. Julian]]\n*[[Pope Gregory I]]\n*[[St. Elizabeth Seton]]\n*[[St. Francis of Rome]]\n*[[St. Vincent De Paul]]\n*[[St. Ann]]\n*[[St. John Cantius]]\n*[[St. John Chrysostom]]\n*[[St. Blaise]]\n*[[St. Philip Neri]]\n*[[St. Francis Xavier]]\n*[[St. John Berchmans]]\n*[[bl.

About 8,000 worshippers attend mass every weekend. In keeping with customs brought to the area by Polish immigrants, the area is also known as \"[[Avondale, Chicago#The Polish Village - Jackowo and Wac.C5.82awowo|Jackowo]]\", as \"Jacek\" is Polish for the proper name \"[[Hyacinth of Poland|Hyacinth]]\". Naming neighborhoods or geographical areas after the local parish church is a widespread habit of Polish Catholics.\n\nSt. Hyacinth once had a thriving elementary school.   In the 60's enrollment was over 2,500 students.  On October 29, 2014, the Archdiocese of Chicago announced the closing of the school after the 2014-2015 school year.

In addition to his ''Sulam'' commentary on the [[Zohar]], his other primary work, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'' is regarded as the central textbook for students of [[Kabbalah]]. Ashlag systematically interpreted the wisdom and promoted its wide dissemination. In line with his directives, many contemporary adherents of Ashlag's teachings strive to spread [[Kabbalah]] to the masses.<ref name = \"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Poland===\n\nAshlag reputedly studied [[Kabbalah]] from the age of seven, hiding pages from the book ''[[Etz Chaim (book)|Etz Chaim]]'' \n\"The Tree of Life\" by [[Isaac Luria]] in the [[Talmud]]ic tractate he was meant to be studying.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> At the age of twelve, he studied the Talmud independently. By nineteen, Ashlag's knowledge of the [[Torah]] was profound enough for the rabbis of Warsaw to confer upon him the title of rabbi.\n\nDuring this period he worked as a judge in the court of the Warsaw rabbis and also gained experience as a teacher for training judges for Jewish courts. Ashlag also studied German while in [[Warsaw]], and read original texts of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nWhile still in Poland, he met an unidentified Warsaw merchant, who revealed himself to Ashlag as a Kabbalist. Ashlag studied with this particular teacher every night for three months, he said, \u201cuntil my arrogance separated us,\u201d and the teacher disappeared. A few months later Ashlag met the teacher again, and after pleading with him, convinced him to reveal an important kabbalistic secret. The next day, the teacher died.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\n===Israel===\n\nIn 1921, at the age of 36, Ashlag made the decision to emigrate to the [[Land of Israel]], a journey that took several months.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> He spent the first few years living anonymously, supporting his family through manual labor by day and writing his commentaries at night. Eventually, he was recognized through his work, and was appointed Rabbi of [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]] in 1924.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nAshlag was friendly with the Kabbalist and [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who recognized Ashlag as a great follower of [[Isaac Luria]]. Ashlag had high hopes of meeting great Kabbalists in [[Jerusalem]] including the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] followers of the great 18th century [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish]] Kabbalist [[Shalom Sharabi]]. However, he was profoundly disappointed by his encounter with them. Their views about Kabbalah ran contrary to Ashlag's experience with the teaching as a means of profound personal transformation and spiritual illumination, by becoming a vessel for divine light.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nIn 1926 Ashlag left for London, and it was there that he wrote his commentary on Isaac Luria's book ''Etz Chaim''. This work is entitled ''Panim Meirot wMasbirot''. It took him one and a half years to complete this work. It was published in 1927, and in 1928 Ashlag returned to Mandatory Palestine.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nIn 1932 Ashlag and his family moved to [[Jaffa]]. During this period, Ashlag also began one of his main works, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'', a commentary on all the writings of Isaac Luria.<ref name = \"Eser\">{{cite book\n | last = Ashlag\n | first = Yehuda\n | authorlink = Yehuda Ashlag \n | title = \u05ea\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, Talmud Eser ha-sefirot\n | origyear = 1943\n | year = 1988\n | publisher = Yeshivat \"Kol Yehudah\" le-limude ha-niglah ve-ha-nistar\n | location = [[Jerusalem]]\n | language = Hebrew\n | quote = [http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/talmud_eser_sefirot/tes_index.htm English translation]\n | lccn = 2006551803\n }}</ref> In this undertaking, he developed a comprehensive explanation of the sequence of the creation of all of the upper worlds (''Olamot Elyonim''), starting with the source of emanation (''Ma'atzil'') and finishing with our world (''Olam HaZeh''). The work is divided into six volumes, containing sixteen parts and over two thousand pages. Some today consider it as the core of the entire teaching of Kabbalah.\n\nIn the 1930s Ashlag, now in his fifties, gathered around him a group of disciples, including Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, his closest student, and studied Kabbalah every night, often from shortly after midnight until dawn. He also composed many articles and letters at this time that openly promoted the study of Kabbalah on a mass scale.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> Ashlag went to great lengths to publish Kabbalistic material, in mediums suitable for disseminating the knowledge he had acquired across the entire nation. He began an independent Kabbalistic newsletter publication, ''HaUma'' \"The Nation\", of which only one issue survived.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its contents present Ashlag's analytical depths of using knowledge he had attained in Kabbalah to illuminate the cause of political and social problems in human egoism; giving reasons why communism was destined to fail, and offering solutions for correcting the property of human egoism through his teaching method of Kabbalah.<ref name = \"HaUma\">{{Cite journal\n  | author = Yehuda Ashlag\n  | title = Ha'Uma\n  | date = May 6, 1940\n}} Editor\u2019s Note: Existence and content of this newsletter has not been verified yet.</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\n[[Image:Jerusalem-kever-baal-sulam-20-10-06 045.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Yehuda Ashlag on [[Har HaMenuchot]]]]\nAshlag differs fundamentally from all Kabbalists of the past, who studied and taught Kabbalah in a concealed manner, in that he felt a great need to reveal and clarify the teaching of Kabbalah to the masses.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> This was because he saw that the evil inclination in people (human egoism) would rise to an altogether new height in this era of humanity, causing an altogether new era of internal suffering felt as a meaningless and confused existence.<ref name = \"Eser\" />{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\n===Writing of the '' Sulam ''===\nIn 1943, Ashlag moved to Tel Aviv, and there began working on his book, ''HaSulam'' (''The Ladder''), a collection of commentaries on ''The Zohar''. During this period, he wrote for eighteen hours a day, and due to a lack of money he was not able to afford a sufficient amount of paper and ink to write more precise explanations. He later said that if it had been within his capabilities, he would have written a full commentary on ''The Zohar'' in two-hundred volumes, but he was unable to begin the work only because of a lack of means.<ref name=\"speech\">Ashlag, Y. \"Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar.\" Bnei Baruch Kabbalah Education and Research Institute.

Rav Ashlag's closest student Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein later finished the work by adding this three volumes called Tikkunei HaZohar \"Maalot Hasulam\". In honor of the completion of the entire work, his students organized a big feast in Meron, where Ashlag gave the speech that is today printed under the title \u201cMaamar LeSiyum HaZohar\u201d (\u201cAn Article for the Completion of the Zohar,\u201d also known as \u201cSpeech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar\u201d).<ref name=\"speech\"/> Yehuda Ashlag died on the day of [[Yom Kippur]] in 1954. He was buried on cemetery [[Har HaMenuchot]] located in [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].\n\n===Rabbi Brandwein===\nRabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein a direct descendant of the famous first Admor of Stretin, Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin, was a foremost disciple of  Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of  Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.\n\nRabbi Brandwein was one of the first Jewish settlers within the Old City of Jerusalem after the Six Day War.\n\nRabbi Yehuda Zvi Brandwein ran a religious school in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Kol Yehudah, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. For a while he also served as the chief rabbi for the Histadrut - the Israeli labor union, using his position to bring many secular Israelis back to Judaism.\n\n==Books==\n\nAshlag wrote and published two major works. The first, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'' is a complete re-editing and commentary to the works of 16th century Kabbalist Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, ''Partzufim'' and ''Sefirot'', in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by Luria.<ref name = \"Eser\" />\n\nAs a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the upper worlds. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text.<ref name = \"Eser\" />\n\nHis other masterwork was his ''Sulam commentary on The Zohar'', which earned him the name \u201cBaal HaSulam\u201d. This monumental work took him ten years to complete, written between the years 1943 and 1953. It includes a translation of ''The Zohar'' from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as well as an extensive interpretation.\n\nRabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein was a foremost disciple of  Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of  Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.\n\nAnother publication is the notebook of Yehuda Ashlag's son and disciple, [[Baruch Ashlag]]. His notebook, entitled  ''Shamati'' (''I Heard'']), contains over two hundred articles which were copied down from lessons and talks with his father. Baruch Ashlag kept this notebook with him in secret, until he was on his deathbed, in 1991. It was later published in Hebrew and has been translated into many different languages. The articles in ''Shamati'' form a unique kabbalistic work in their emotional depth of capturing the inner processes that a Kabbalist goes through on the path of spiritual attainment.\n\n===Works of Interest===\n*''Matan Torah'' (''Gift of the Bible'')\n*''Perush HaSulam'' (''Commentary of the Ladder on the Zohar)''\n*''Talmud Eser haSefirot'' (''Study of the Ten Luminous Emanations'')\n*''Panim Meirot u'Masbirot'' (''Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations'')\n*''Ha\u2019Akadama Le Talmud Eser haSefirot'' (''Introduction to the Ten Luminous Emanations'')\n*''Ha\u2019Akadama Le Sefer HaZohar'' (''Introduction to the Zohar'')\n*''Mavo le Sefer HaZohar'' (''Entrance to the Zohar'')\n*''Pticha le Hokhmat haKabbalah'' (''Opening  to the Wisdom of Kabbalah'')\n*''Sefer haIlan'' (''Book of the Tree'' or ''Book of Illustrations'')\n*''Pticha le Perush haSulam'' (''Opening to the Sulam Commentary'')\n*''Ha\u2019Akadama Le Sefer Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot'' (''Introduction to Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot [Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations]'')\n*''Pticha Kolelet leSefer Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot'' (''Opening to Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot [Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations]'')\n\n==Teachings==\n\nAshlag's commentary offered a systematic interpretation of the legacy of Isaac Luria. This was the first since the 18th century when the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the [[Vilna Gaon]] and Shalom Sharabi offered their interpretation of the Luria's teaching. Ashlag's system focused on the transformation of human [[consciousness]] from the \"desire to receive\" to the \"desire to give,\" i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah.\n\nAshlag stated that the purpose of studying Kabbalah is equal to the purpose of why human beings were created, and that through its study, a person is capable of revealing the entirety of processes and structures that have taken place in the creation of the universe.<ref name = \"Matan1\">{{cite book\n | last = Ashlag\n | first = Yehuda\n | authorlink = Yehuda Ashlag\n | title = \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05ea\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, Sefer Matan Torah\n | origyear = 1932?\n | year = 1980\n | publisher = Ohr HaGanuz\n | chapter = Mahut Hochmat Hakabbala - Essence of the Wisdom of Kabbalah (Translation)\n | chapterurl = http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/matan_torah/essence_of_kabbalah.htm\n | location = [[Jerusalem]]\n | language = Hebrew\n | isbn = 0-943688-30-2\n | lccn = 96827232\n}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\n\"Equivalence of form\" with this source means having the same attributes or qualities as it, and Ashlag defines the qualities of this source as being altruistic, namely the desire to give, or in Ashlag's words, the \"will to bestow\" (''Ratzon LeHashpia'').<ref name = \"Matan\">{{cite book\n | last = Ashlag\n | first = Yehuda\n | authorlink = Yehuda Ashlag\n | script-title = he:\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05ea\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 |trans-title=Sefer Matan Torah\n | origyear = 1932?\n | year = 1980\n | publisher = Ohr HaGanuz\n | location = [[Jerusalem]]\n | language =he\n | lccn = 96827232\n}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\nThrough intensive study of Kabbalah, a person's desire to give to others is developed in relation to this goal.

In addition to his ''Sulam'' commentary on the [[Zohar]], his other primary work, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'' is regarded as the central textbook for students of [[Kabbalah]]. Ashlag systematically interpreted the wisdom and promoted its wide dissemination. In line with his directives, many contemporary adherents of Ashlag\u2019s teachings strive to spread [[Kabbalah]] to the masses.<ref name = \"Haaretz\"/>\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Poland===\n\nAshlag reputedly studied [[Kabbalah]] from the age of seven, hiding pages from the book ''[[Etz Chaim (book)|Etz Chaim]]'' \n\"The Tree of Life\" by [[Isaac Luria]] in the [[Talmud]]ic tractate he was meant to be studying.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> At the age of twelve, he studied the Talmud independently. By nineteen, Ashlag\u2019s knowledge of the [[Torah]] was profound enough for the rabbis of Warsaw to confer upon him the title of rabbi.\n\nDuring this period he worked as a judge in the court of the Warsaw rabbis and also gained experience as a teacher for training judges for Jewish courts. Ashlag also studied German while in [[Warsaw]], and read original texts of [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], [[Karl Marx]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], and [[Arthur Schopenhauer]].<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nWhile still in Poland, he met an unidentified Warsaw merchant, who revealed himself to Ashlag as a Kabbalist. Ashlag studied with this particular teacher every night for three months, he said, \u201cuntil my arrogance separated us,\u201d and the teacher disappeared. A few months later Ashlag met the teacher again, and after pleading with him, convinced him to reveal an important kabbalistic secret. The next day, the teacher died.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\n===Israel===\n\nIn 1921, at the age of 36, Ashlag made the decision to emigrate to the [[Land of Israel]], a journey that took several months.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> He spent the first few years living anonymously, supporting his family through manual labor by day and writing his commentaries at night. Eventually, he was recognized through his work, and was appointed Rabbi of [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]] in 1924.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nAshlag was friendly with the Kabbalist and [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Mandatory Palestine]], [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who recognized Ashlag as a great follower of [[Isaac Luria]]. Ashlag had high hopes of meeting great Kabbalists in [[Jerusalem]] including the [[Sephardi Jews|Sephardi]] followers of the great 18th century [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite Jewish]] Kabbalist [[Shalom Sharabi]]. However, he was profoundly disappointed by his encounter with them. Their views about Kabbalah ran contrary to Ashlag\u2019s experience with the teaching as a means of profound personal transformation and spiritual illumination, by becoming a vessel for divine light.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nIn 1926 Ashlag left for London, and it was there that he wrote his commentary on Isaac Luria's book ''Etz Chaim''. This work is entitled ''Panim Meirot wMasbirot''. It took him one and a half years to complete this work. It was published in 1927, and in 1928 Ashlag returned to Mandatory Palestine.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" />\n\nIn 1932 Ashlag and his family moved to [[Jaffa]]. During this period, Ashlag also began one of his main works, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'', a commentary on all the writings of Isaac Luria.<ref name = \"Eser\">{{cite book\n | last = Ashlag\n | first = Yehuda\n | authorlink = Yehuda Ashlag \n | title = \u05ea\u05dc\u05de\u05d5\u05d3 \u05e2\u05e9\u05e8 \u05d4\u05e1\u05e4\u05d9\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea, Talmud Eser ha-sefirot\n | origyear = 1943\n | year = 1988\n | publisher = Yeshivat \"Kol Yehudah\" le-limude ha-niglah ve-ha-nistar\n | location = [[Jerusalem]]\n | language = Hebrew\n | quote = [http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/talmud_eser_sefirot/tes_index.htm English translation]\n | lccn = 2006551803\n }}</ref> In this undertaking, he developed a comprehensive explanation of the sequence of the creation of all of the upper worlds (''Olamot Elyonim''), starting with the source of emanation (''Ma'atzil'') and finishing with our world (''Olam HaZeh''). The work is divided into six volumes, containing sixteen parts and over two thousand pages. Some today consider it as the core of the entire teaching of Kabbalah.\n\nIn the 1930s Ashlag, now in his fifties, gathered around him a group of disciples, including Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein, his closest student, and studied Kabbalah every night, often from shortly after midnight until dawn. He also composed many articles and letters at this time that openly promoted the study of Kabbalah on a mass scale.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> Ashlag went to great lengths to publish Kabbalistic material, in mediums suitable for disseminating the knowledge he had acquired across the entire nation. He began an independent Kabbalistic newsletter publication, ''HaUma'' \"The Nation\", of which only one issue survived.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} Its contents present Ashlag's analytical depths of using knowledge he had attained in Kabbalah to illuminate the cause of political and social problems in human egoism; giving reasons why communism was destined to fail, and offering solutions for correcting the property of human egoism through his teaching method of Kabbalah.<ref name = \"HaUma\">{{Cite journal\n  | author = Yehuda Ashlag\n  | title = Ha'Uma\n  | date = May 6, 1940\n}} Editor\u2019s Note: Existence and content of this newsletter has not been verified yet.</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\n[[Image:Jerusalem-kever-baal-sulam-20-10-06 045.jpg|thumb|130px|right|[[Ohel (grave)|Ohel]] of Yehuda Ashlag on [[Har HaMenuchot]]]]\nAshlag differs fundamentally from all Kabbalists of the past, who studied and taught Kabbalah in a concealed manner, in that he felt a great need to reveal and clarify the teaching of Kabbalah to the masses.<ref name = \"Haaretz\" /> This was because he saw that the evil inclination in people (human egoism) would rise to an altogether new height in this era of humanity, causing an altogether new era of internal suffering felt as a meaningless and confused existence.<ref name = \"Eser\" />{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\n===Writing of the '' Sulam ''===\nIn 1943, Ashlag moved to Tel Aviv, and there began working on his book, ''HaSulam'' (''The Ladder''), a collection of commentaries on ''The Zohar''. During this period, he wrote for eighteen hours a day, and due to a lack of money he was not able to afford a sufficient amount of paper and ink to write more precise explanations. He later said that if it had been within his capabilities, he would have written a full commentary on ''The Zohar'' in two-hundred volumes, but he was unable to begin the work only because of a lack of means.<ref name=\"speech\">Ashlag, Y. \"Speech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar.\" Bnei Baruch Kabbalah Education and Research Institute.

Israel: Bnei Baruch, pp. 28\u201436.</ref>\n\nHe completed this work in 1953, and later added three more volumes. Rav Ashlag's closest student Rav Yehuda Tzvi Brandwein later finished the work by adding this three volumes called Tikkunei HaZohar \"Maalot Hasulam\". In honor of the completion of the entire work, his students organized a big feast in Meron, where Ashlag gave the speech that is today printed under the title \u201cMaamar LeSiyum HaZohar\u201d (\u201cAn Article for the Completion of the Zohar,\u201d also known as \u201cSpeech in Celebration for the Conclusion of the Zohar\u201d).<ref name=\"speech\"/> Yehuda Ashlag died on the day of [[Yom Kippur]] in 1954. He was buried on cemetery [[Har HaMenuchot]] located in [[Givat Shaul]], [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]].\n\n===Rabbi Brandwein===\nRabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein a direct descendant of the famous first Admor of Stretin, Rabbi Yehudah Tzvi of Stretin, was a foremost disciple of  Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of  Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.\n\nRabbi Brandwein was one of the first Jewish settlers within the Old City of Jerusalem after the Six Day War.\n\nRabbi Yehuda Zvi Brandwein ran a religious school in Jerusalem called Yeshiva Kol Yehudah, founded in 1922 by Rabbi Yehuda Ashlag. For a while he also served as the chief rabbi for the Histadrut - the Israeli labor union, using his position to bring many secular Israelis back to Judaism.\n\n==Books==\n\nAshlag wrote and published two major works. The first, ''Talmud Eser Sefirot'' is a complete re-editing and commentary to the works of 16th century Kabbalist Rabbi [[Isaac Luria]]. This is a comprehensive exposition of the system of the upper worlds, ''Partzufim'' and ''Sefirot'', in the scientific language of Kabbalah which was developed by Luria.<ref name = \"Eser\" />\n\nAs a core Kabbalistic text, it is especially unique in its utmost precision to detail to the structural organization and processes occurring in the upper worlds. It is set out as a comprehensive textbook, complete with commentaries, a section in each chapter dedicated to further reflection upon the commentaries, definitions of terms, tables of questions and answers, an introduction clarifying how to study Kabbalah in the correct manner, and also a summarized preface of the entire text.<ref name = \"Eser\" />\n\nHis other masterwork was his ''Sulam commentary on The Zohar'', which earned him the name \u201cBaal HaSulam\u201d. This monumental work took him ten years to complete, written between the years 1943 and 1953. It includes a translation of ''The Zohar'' from [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as well as an extensive interpretation.\n\nRabbi Yehudah Tzvi Brandwein was a foremost disciple of  Rabbi Yehudah HaLevi Ashlag (Baal HaSulam). His vast knowledge of the Lurianic system of  Kabbalah enabled him to codify and edit the entire writings of the Ari HaKadosh, Rabbi Yitzchak Luria. He continued with a similar style of translation and commentary of Rabbi Yehudah Ashlag known as Maalot HaSulam (Extension of the Ladder) on those works of  Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, which Rabbi Ashlag didn't complete during his lifetime, namely Hashmatot HaZohar (Various other Writings) and Tikkunei HaZohar.\n\nAnother publication is the notebook of Yehuda Ashlag\u2019s son and disciple, [[Baruch Ashlag]]. His notebook, entitled  ''Shamati'' (''I Heard'']), contains over two hundred articles which were copied down from lessons and talks with his father. Baruch Ashlag kept this notebook with him in secret, until he was on his deathbed, in 1991. It was later published in Hebrew and has been translated into many different languages. The articles in ''Shamati'' form a unique kabbalistic work in their emotional depth of capturing the inner processes that a Kabbalist goes through on the path of spiritual attainment.\n\n===Works of Interest===\n*''Matan Torah'' (''Gift of the Bible'')\n*''Perush HaSulam'' (''Commentary of the Ladder on the Zohar)''\n*''Talmud Eser haSefirot'' (''Study of the Ten Luminous Emanations'')\n*''Panim Meirot u'Masbirot'' (''Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations'')\n*''Ha\u2019Akadama Le Talmud Eser haSefirot'' (''Introduction to the Ten Luminous Emanations'')\n*''Ha\u2019Akadama Le Sefer HaZohar'' (''Introduction to the Zohar'')\n*''Mavo le Sefer HaZohar'' (''Entrance to the Zohar'')\n*''Pticha le Hokhmat haKabbalah'' (''Opening  to the Wisdom of Kabbalah'')\n*''Sefer haIlan'' (''Book of the Tree'' or ''Book of Illustrations'')\n*''Pticha le Perush haSulam'' (''Opening to the Sulam Commentary'')\n*''Ha\u2019Akadama Le Sefer Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot'' (''Introduction to Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot [Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations]'')\n*''Pticha Kolelet leSefer Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot'' (''Opening to Panim Meirot u\u2019Masbirot [Welcoming and Illuminating Revelations]'')\n\n==Teachings==\n\nAshlag\u2019s commentary offered a systematic interpretation of the legacy of Isaac Luria. This was the first since the 18th century when the [[Baal Shem Tov]], [[Moshe Chaim Luzzatto]], the [[Vilna Gaon]] and Shalom Sharabi offered their interpretation of the Luria's teaching. Ashlag\u2019s system focused on the transformation of human [[consciousness]] from the \"desire to receive\" to the \"desire to give,\" i.e., from egocentricity to altruism. This path of transformation is described in Lurianic Kabbalah.\n\nAshlag stated that the purpose of studying Kabbalah is equal to the purpose of why human beings were created, and that through its study, a person is capable of revealing the entirety of processes and structures that have taken place in the creation of the universe.<ref name = \"Matan1\">{{cite book\n | last = Ashlag\n | first = Yehuda\n | authorlink = Yehuda Ashlag\n | title = \u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05ea\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4, Sefer Matan Torah\n | origyear = 1932?\n | year = 1980\n | publisher = Ohr HaGanuz\n | chapter = Mahut Hochmat Hakabbala - Essence of the Wisdom of Kabbalah (Translation)\n | chapterurl = http://www.kabbalah.info/engkab/matan_torah/essence_of_kabbalah.htm\n | location = [[Jerusalem]]\n | language = Hebrew\n | isbn = 0-943688-30-2\n | lccn = 96827232\n}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\n\"Equivalence of form\" with this source means having the same attributes or qualities as it, and Ashlag defines the qualities of this source as being altruistic, namely the desire to give, or in Ashlag's words, the \"will to bestow\" (''Ratzon LeHashpia'').<ref name = \"Matan\">{{cite book\n | last = Ashlag\n | first = Yehuda\n | authorlink = Yehuda Ashlag\n | script-title = he:\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 \u05de\u05ea\u05df \u05ea\u05d5\u05e8\u05d4 |trans-title=Sefer Matan Torah\n | origyear = 1932?\n | year = 1980\n | publisher = Ohr HaGanuz\n | location = [[Jerusalem]]\n | language =he\n | lccn = 96827232\n}}</ref>{{Verify source|date=July 2007}}\n\nThrough intensive study of Kabbalah, a person's desire to give to others is developed in relation to this goal.
