He was previously Cabinet Secretary in [[New South Wales]], Australia, under Premier [[Nick Greiner]], during which time he introduced a number of major policy initiatives including the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC).<ref name=griffithbio/>\n\n== Early years ==\nSturgess grew up in [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]], Queensland, a small town approximately 200&nbsp;km inland from [[Brisbane]].  He is the second of four sons of Lindsay and Joy Sturgess. He was educated at local state schools, and graduated in law from the [[University of Queensland]].\n\n== Career ==\nHe commenced his professional career in Brisbane working as an investment analyst for what was then one of Australia's largest mining companies, [[MIM Holdings|MIM Holdings Ltd]]. In 1980, he moved to Sydney to become the legal correspondent for the Australian news magazine ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', where he had a legal and civil liberties round.\n\nIn 1982, he was recruited by [[Jim Carlton]], recently appointed as Federal [[Minister for Health and Aged Care|Minister for Health]], to serve as his private secretary. Following the fall of the [[Fraser Government]] in March 1983, he joined the staff of the newly elected Leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Nick Greiner, as the Director of Research and Policy Development. In addition to policy development, he directed extensive research into corruption in the then NSW Government, contributing to a number of public inquiries and criminal prosecutions. His extensive filing database caused the then Leader of the Opposition and later Premier [[Bob Carr]] to refer to him as \"Lord of the Files\".\n\nUpon the change of government in March 1988, he was appointed as Director-General of the NSW Cabinet Office in the [[1988 New South Wales state election|Liberal-National Coalition Government]] led by Premier Nick Greiner. In the five years he served as Cabinet Secretary, Sturgess personally drove a number of major policy initiatives, including the establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/public-service-a-disappearing-art-says-former-mandarin-gary-sturgess-20140409-36c92.html|title=Public service a 'disappearing art', says former mandarin Gary Sturgess|newspaper=The Canberra Times|first=Phillip|last=Thomson|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2014|archivedate=9 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409124032/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/public-service-a-disappearing-art-says-former-mandarin-gary-sturgess-20140409-36c92.html}}</ref> the corporatisation of government business enterprises, the so-called \"new environmentalism\" (including tradeable air, water and fishing permits), and the creation of electricity markets.\n\nFrom 1990, he was involved in the \"new federalism\" agenda, initiated by Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] and Premier Greiner. He led the team of NSW officials at a series of Special Premiers Conferences that produced new policies such as the [[National Competition Policy (Australia)|National Competition Policy]], the [[National Electricity Market]], mutual recognition of state regulations, and, ultimately, the formation of the [[Council of Australian Governments]].\n\nHe retired from public administration in late 1992, six months after the resignation of Greiner as Premier. From 1993 to 2000, Sturgess chaired a series of government inquiries - into business regulation, the governance of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the financial management of the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the rationalisation of Australia's [[border control]]s, among other issues.\n\nHe also served on a number of public, private and not-for-profit boards, including the Australian Constitutional Centenary Foundation, the NSW Police Board and spent seven years as a non-executive director of the Serco Group PLC, a FTSE-100 public service company operating in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn 2000, Sturgess relocated to London, where he joined Serco as Adviser to the Board and then from January 2003, as Executive Director of the Serco Institute, whose purpose is \"to foster the development of sustainable public service markets through an outward-facing programme of research and communication\". In that capacity, he played a leading role in the establishment of the Public Services Strategy Board, the UK's first industry association representing the public service industry, underneath the umbrella of the Confederation of British Industry. He continued to serve as adviser to the Public Services Strategy Board until 2011.\n\nHe resigned from the Serco Institute in April 2011 and returned to Australia to take up the New South Wales Premier's ANZSOG Chair in Public Service Delivery at the University of New South Wales, a research position based in the government precinct in Sydney and studying the challenges involved in front-line service delivery. In 2014, he was also appointed as Professor of Public Service Innovation at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nIn 2015, he was appointed by the NSW government to chair an inquiry into 'point-to-point transportation', which resulted in the legalisation of ride-sharing and a substantial reconstruction of the regulations governing the taxi industry to enable them to compete. He was appointed to the Heritage Council of New South Wales in 2016.\n\n== Research interests ==\nSince taking up the chair with ANZSOG in 2011, Sturgess has specialised in studying the relationship between policy/funding and delivery, with a particular focus on the discipline of commissioning. As part of that research agenda, he has developed a contestability framework for public services\u2014\"benchmarking with consequences\"\u2014building on the work of the British health economist [[Chris Ham]]. He is actively involved in the application of these principles in the real world, and in 2015, he was appointed by New South Wales Cabinet to chair a Commissioning and Contestability Advisory Board, advising the NSW Minister for Corrections. In 2016, the NSW government established a Commissioning and Contestability Unit in Treasury, based on his work.\n\nSturgess has advised a number of government inquiries on commissioning - the Victorian and Queensland Commissions of Audit (2012 and 2013), the National Commission of Audit (2014), the Harper Review of Competition Policy, the [[New Zealand Productivity Commission]]'s review of social services (2015) and more recently the [[Productivity Commission|Australian Productivity Commission]]'s review of human services (2016). He has also advised numerous central and line departments and agencies in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Canada. He lectured at the UK government's Commissioning Academy from 2013 to 2016, and has taught a three-day Commissioning Academy in Ontario, Canada since 2015, and more recently in Ottawa.\n\nIn March 2017, Sturgess published a study of public service contracting in the UK, for the Business Services Association, entitled 'Just Another Paperclip?'. He was highly critical of the way in which public service contracting has developed in recent years, and laid the primary responsibility on government, arguing that public service markets are not like commodity markets, but rather are government's supply chain.\n\nSince 2000, he has also undertaken detailed primary research into the contractual system used for transporting convicts to Australia in the early years of European settlement, and has delivered a number of academic papers and published articles in peer-reviewed journals on the operation of this system.

Sturgess''', [[Order of Australia|AM]] is an Adjunct Professor with the [[Australia and New Zealand School of Government]] (ANZSOG), based in Sydney, Australia, holding the New South Wales Premier's ANZSOG Chair in Public Service Delivery at the [[Australian School of Business]], [[University of New South Wales]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anzsog.edu.au/profile/6221/gary-sturgess|title=Professor Gary Sturgess|publisher=[[Australia and New Zealand School of Government]]|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref> He is also a Professor of Public Service Innovation with the School of Government and International Relations at [[Griffith University]],<ref name=griffithbio>{{cite web|url=http://www.griffith.edu.au/business-government/centre-governance-public-policy/staff/adjunct-professor-gary-sturgess|title=Gary Sturgess \u2013 Biography|publisher=[[Griffith University]]|accessdate=10 May 2013}}</ref> in [[Brisbane]], Australia.\n\nFrom 2003 to 2011, he was Executive Director of the [[Serco]] Institute, a London-based think tank specialising in the design and management of public service markets. He was previously Cabinet Secretary in [[New South Wales]], Australia, under Premier [[Nick Greiner]], during which time he introduced a number of major policy initiatives including the [[Independent Commission Against Corruption (New South Wales)|Independent Commission Against Corruption]] (ICAC).<ref name=griffithbio/>\n\n== Early years ==\nSturgess grew up in [[Dalby, Queensland|Dalby]], Queensland, a small town approximately 200&nbsp;km inland from [[Brisbane]].  He is the second of four sons of Lindsay and Joy Sturgess. He was educated at local state schools, and graduated in law from the [[University of Queensland]].\n\n== Career ==\nHe commenced his professional career in Brisbane working as an investment analyst for what was then one of Australia's largest mining companies, [[MIM Holdings|MIM Holdings Ltd]]. In 1980, he moved to Sydney to become the legal correspondent for the Australian news magazine ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'', where he had a legal and civil liberties round.\n\nIn 1982, he was recruited by [[Jim Carlton]], recently appointed as Federal [[Minister for Health and Aged Care|Minister for Health]], to serve as his private secretary. Following the fall of the [[Fraser Government]] in March 1983, he joined the staff of the newly elected Leader of the New South Wales Opposition, Nick Greiner, as the Director of Research and Policy Development. In addition to policy development, he directed extensive research into corruption in the then NSW Government, contributing to a number of public inquiries and criminal prosecutions. His extensive filing database caused the then Leader of the Opposition and later Premier [[Bob Carr]] to refer to him as \"Lord of the Files\".\n\nUpon the change of government in March 1988, he was appointed as Director-General of the NSW Cabinet Office in the [[1988 New South Wales state election|Liberal-National Coalition Government]] led by Premier Nick Greiner. In the five years he served as Cabinet Secretary, Sturgess personally drove a number of major policy initiatives, including the establishment of the Independent Commission Against Corruption,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/public-service-a-disappearing-art-says-former-mandarin-gary-sturgess-20140409-36c92.html|title=Public service a 'disappearing art', says former mandarin Gary Sturgess|newspaper=The Canberra Times|first=Phillip|last=Thomson|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=9 April 2014|archivedate=9 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140409124032/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/public-service-a-disappearing-art-says-former-mandarin-gary-sturgess-20140409-36c92.html}}</ref> the corporatisation of government business enterprises, the so-called \"new environmentalism\" (including tradeable air, water and fishing permits), and the creation of electricity markets.\n\nFrom 1990, he was involved in the \"new federalism\" agenda, initiated by Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] and Premier Greiner. He led the team of NSW officials at a series of Special Premiers Conferences that produced new policies such as the [[National Competition Policy (Australia)|National Competition Policy]], the [[National Electricity Market]], mutual recognition of state regulations, and, ultimately, the formation of the [[Council of Australian Governments]].\n\nHe retired from public administration in late 1992, six months after the resignation of Greiner as Premier. From 1993 to 2000, Sturgess chaired a series of government inquiries - into business regulation, the governance of the [[Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority]], the financial management of the [[Australian Federal Police]] and the rationalisation of Australia's [[border control]]s, among other issues.\n\nHe also served on a number of public, private and not-for-profit boards, including the Australian Constitutional Centenary Foundation, the NSW Police Board and spent seven years as a non-executive director of the Serco Group PLC, a FTSE-100 public service company operating in Europe, North America and Asia-Pacific.\n\nIn 2000, Sturgess relocated to London, where he joined Serco as Adviser to the Board and then from January 2003, as Executive Director of the Serco Institute, whose purpose is \"to foster the development of sustainable public service markets through an outward-facing programme of research and communication\". In that capacity, he played a leading role in the establishment of the Public Services Strategy Board, the UK's first industry association representing the public service industry, underneath the umbrella of the Confederation of British Industry. He continued to serve as adviser to the Public Services Strategy Board until 2011.\n\nHe resigned from the Serco Institute in April 2011 and returned to Australia to take up the New South Wales Premier's ANZSOG Chair in Public Service Delivery at the University of New South Wales, a research position based in the government precinct in Sydney and studying the challenges involved in front-line service delivery. In 2014, he was also appointed as Professor of Public Service Innovation at Griffith University in Brisbane, Australia.\n\nIn 2015, he was appointed by the NSW government to chair an inquiry into 'point-to-point transportation', which resulted in the legalisation of ride-sharing and a substantial reconstruction of the regulations governing the taxi industry to enable them to compete. He was appointed to the Heritage Council of New South Wales in 2016.\n\n== Research interests ==\nSince taking up the chair with ANZSOG in 2011, Sturgess has specialised in studying the relationship between policy/funding and delivery, with a particular focus on the discipline of commissioning. As part of that research agenda, he has developed a contestability framework for public services\u2014\"benchmarking with consequences\"\u2014building on the work of the British health economist [[Chris Ham]]. He is actively involved in the application of these principles in the real world, and in 2015, he was appointed by New South Wales Cabinet to chair a Commissioning and Contestability Advisory Board, advising the NSW Minister for Corrections. In 2016, the NSW government established a Commissioning and Contestability Unit in Treasury, based on his work.\n\nSturgess has advised a number of government inquiries on commissioning - the Victorian and Queensland Commissions of Audit (2012 and 2013), the National Commission of Audit (2014), the Harper Review of Competition Policy, the [[New Zealand Productivity Commission]]'s review of social services (2015) and more recently the [[Productivity Commission|Australian Productivity Commission]]'s review of human services (2016). He has also advised numerous central and line departments and agencies in Australia, New Zealand, the UK and Canada. He lectured at the UK government's Commissioning Academy from 2013 to 2016, and has taught a three-day Commissioning Academy in Ontario, Canada since 2015, and more recently in Ottawa.\n\nIn March 2017, Sturgess published a study of public service contracting in the UK, for the Business Services Association, entitled 'Just Another Paperclip?'. He was highly critical of the way in which public service contracting has developed in recent years, and laid the primary responsibility on government, arguing that public service markets are not like commodity markets, but rather are government's supply chain.\n\nSince 2000, he has also undertaken detailed primary research into the contractual system used for transporting convicts to Australia in the early years of European settlement, and has delivered a number of academic papers and published articles in peer-reviewed journals on the operation of this system. In 2012, he started detailed research to identify the site where the founding Governor of Australia, Arthur Phillip, came ashore in Sydney Cove on 26 January 1788 - based on new documents, maps and drawings that had come to light in the more than 50 years since the question was last considered.

''Yesterday in White Plains, a Picture History of a Vanished Era'', Second Edition, Privately Published, 1984. Available from the White Plains, NY Public Library and other sources.</ref> The first non-native settlement came in November 1683, when a party of [[Connecticut]] [[Puritans]] moved westward from an earlier settlement in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]] and bought about {{convert|4400|acre|km2}}, presumably from the Weckquaeskeck.<ref name=wp/> However, John Richbell of [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck]] claimed to have earlier title to much of the territory through his purchase of a far larger plot extending {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} inland, perhaps from a different tribe.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> The matter wasn't settled until 1721, when a [[Land patent|Royal Patent]] for White Plains was granted by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nIn 1758, White Plains became the seat of [[Westchester County]] when the colonial government for the county left West Chester, which was located in what is now the northern part of the borough of the [[Bronx]], in New York City. The unincorporated village remained part of the [[Rye, Westchester County, New York|Town of Rye]] until 1788 when the town of White Plains was created.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nOn July 9, 1776, a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was delivered to the New York Provincial Congress, which was meeting in the county courthouse. The delegates quickly adopted a resolution approving the Declaration, thus declaring both the colony's independence and the formation of the [[State of New York]]. The Declaration itself was first publicly read from the steps of the courthouse on July 11.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nDuring September and October 1776, troops led by [[George Washington]] took up positions in the hills of the village, hotly pursued by the British under General [[Sir William Howe]], who attacked on October 28.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> The [[Battle of White Plains]] took place primarily on Chatterton Hill, (later known as \"Battle Hill,\" and located just west of what was then a swamp but is now the downtown area) and the Bronx River. Howe's force of 4,000\u20136,000 British and [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldiers]] required three attacks before the Continentals, numbering about 1,600 under the command of Generals Alexander McDougall and Israel Putnam, retreated, joining Washington's main force, which did not take part in the battle. Howe's forces had suffered 250 casualties, a severe loss, and he made no attempt to pursue the Continentals, whose casualties were about 125 dead and wounded. Three days after the battle Washington withdrew north of the village, this was then occupied by Howe's forces. But after several inconclusive skirmishes over the next week Howe withdrew on November 5, leaving White Plains to the Continentals.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> Ironically, one of Washington's subordinates, Major John Austin, who was probably drunk after having celebrated the enemy's withdrawal, reentered the village with his detachment and proceeded to burn it down. Although he was court-martialed and convicted for this action, he escaped punishment.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nThe first [[United States Census]], conducted in 1790, listed the White Plains population at 505, of whom 46 were slaves.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> (New York City's population at that time was about 33,000.) By 1800, the population stood at 575 and in 1830, 830.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> By 1870, 26 years after the arrival of the [[New York Central Railroad]], it had swollen to 2,630<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> and by 1890 to 4,508.

Some of these retail locations were the first large-scale suburban stores built in the United States and ushered in the eventual post-war building boom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Construction of nearby parkways and expressways in the 1940s through the 1970s only enhanced White Plains' role as a retail location. With a city opening ceremony, [[Macy's]] launched a grand White Plains store on Main Street across from City Hall in 1949. As the mayor said at the time, this was a significant event in the life of White Plains. Other prestigious stores followed, such as [[B. Altman & Co.]], [[Rogers Peet]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Lord & Taylor]], [[Alexander's]], [[Wallachs (clothiers)|Wallachs]], and a short-lived branch of [[Bergdorf Goodman]], which was converted to sister chain [[Neiman Marcus]] in 1981. White Plains is still a huge retail destination in the area with [[Bloomingdale's]], Neiman Marcus, [[Nordstrom]], [[Nordstrom Rack]], Macy's, [[Burlington Coat Factory]], and over 1000 other small and mid-size stores in four malls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nDuring the late 1960s, the city of White Plains developed an extensive urban renewal plan for residential, commercial and mixed-use redevelopment that effectively called for the demolition of its entire central business district from the [[Bronx River Parkway]] east to Mamaroneck Avenue.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, many major corporations based in New York City relocated operations to White Plains and other suburban locations. These included [[General Foods]], [[PepsiCo]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] USA, [[IBM]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[Snapple]] and [[Heineken USA]]. At the height of the 1980s, at least 50 [[Fortune 500]] corporations called Westchester County and nearby [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], home, but with the corporate mergers and downsizing of the 1990s many of these companies either reduced their operations in White Plains or left the area completely.\n\n[[File:New York Power Authority and Main Street in White Plains.JPG|thumb|left|New York Power Authority and Main Street]]\n\nWhite Plains is also home to the Arts Exchange Building, which serves as the headquarters of the Westchester Arts Council. Since March 1999, visual and performing artists, emerging cultural organizations and new creative businesses have studios and offices in the building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFor a time, White Plains had the dubious distinction of having one of the highest office vacancy rates in the northeastern United States. Consolidation within the retail industry led to the closing of many of downtown's original department and specialty stores as well. After its bankruptcy, the B. Altman store closed in 1989 and was eventually demolished to make way for the massive upscale retail mall, [[The Westchester]], which opened in 1995 with anchors Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. A freestanding branch of Macy's, one of downtown's original retail [[anchor store]]s, was relocated two blocks away to The Galleria mall by its parent company, [[Federated Department Stores]], replacing the location of sister retailer, [[Abraham & Straus]] when these two store divisions were merged in 1995.\n\n[[File: City Center in the City of White Plains.JPG|thumb|City Center on Mamaroneck Avenue]]\n\nOther major projects were completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s that have further altered the urban character of downtown White Plains. A new courthouse for the [[Southern District of New York]] was opened in 1998 and several large-scale office properties in and near downtown, including the former General Foods headquarters building, were retrofitted and leased to accommodate smaller businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0D61031F935A2575AC0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Commercial Real Estate; General Foods' Old Office Is Repackaged for Multiple Tenants | first=David W. | last=Dunlap | date=September 16, 1998}}</ref> The Macy's store on Main Street remained vacant for several years until it was also later demolished to make way for the massive [[City Center at White Plains]] complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainscnr.com/old/frontpage/frontpage-0718.html |title=Front Page |publisher=Whiteplainscnr.com |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> This large mixed-use development features [[Trump Tower (White Plains)|two 35-story apartment and condominium towers]], {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|-4|adj=on}} of retail, restaurant and entertainment space and new parking facilities.

An [[inner suburb]] of [[New York City]], it is the [[county seat]] and commercial hub of Westchester, a densely populated suburban county that is home to approximately one million people. White Plains is located in south-central Westchester, with its downtown (Mamaroneck Avenue) {{convert|25|mi}} north of [[Midtown Manhattan]].\n\nAs of 2018, the city's total population was estimated to be 58,811, up from 56,853 at the 2010 census.<ref name=\"Census 2010\">{{cite web| url=http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3681677| archive-url=https://archive.today/20200212191942/http://factfinder.census.gov/bkmk/table/1.0/en/DEC/10_DP/G001/1600000US3681677| url-status=dead| archive-date=February 12, 2020| title=Geographic Identifiers: 2010 Demographic Profile Data (G001): White Plains city, New York| publisher=U.S. Census Bureau, American Factfinder| accessdate=January 29, 2013}}</ref> According to the city government, the daytime weekday population is estimated at 250,000.<ref>Fernanda Santos, ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/25/nyregion/25plains.html?fta=y Crimes in White Plains Decline to Record Lows], January 25, 2008.</ref> The city was ranked third in the top 10 places to live in New York for 2014, according to national online real estate brokerage Movoto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.movoto.com/blog/top-ten/best-places-in-new-york/|title=The 10 Best Places In New York - statistical analysis by Movoto|work=Movoto Blog|accessdate=October 28, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Early history===\nAt the time of the Dutch settlement of [[Manhattan]] in the early 17th century, the region had been used as farmland by the [[Weckquaeskeck]] tribe, a [[Wappinger]] people, and was called \"Quarropas\".<ref name=wp>[https://www.cityofwhiteplains.com/469/History-of-White-Plains ''A Brief History of White Plains'', City of White Plains]</ref> To early traders it was known as \"the White Plains\", either from the groves of white balsam which are said to have covered it,<ref name=\"Britannica\">''Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica'', Eleventh Edition (1911), Volume XXVIII, p. 607.</ref> or from the heavy mist that local tradition suggests hovered over the swamplands near the [[Bronx River]].<ref name=\"Hoffman\">Hoffman, Redona. ''Yesterday in White Plains, a Picture History of a Vanished Era'', Second Edition, Privately Published, 1984. Available from the White Plains, NY Public Library and other sources.</ref> The first non-native settlement came in November 1683, when a party of [[Connecticut]] [[Puritans]] moved westward from an earlier settlement in [[Rye (city), New York|Rye]] and bought about {{convert|4400|acre|km2}}, presumably from the Weckquaeskeck.<ref name=wp/> However, John Richbell of [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck]] claimed to have earlier title to much of the territory through his purchase of a far larger plot extending {{convert|20|mi|km|0}} inland, perhaps from a different tribe.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> The matter wasn't settled until 1721, when a [[Land patent|Royal Patent]] for White Plains was granted by [[George II of Great Britain|King George II]].<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nIn 1758, White Plains became the seat of [[Westchester County]] when the colonial government for the county left West Chester, which was located in what is now the northern part of the borough of the [[Bronx]], in New York City. The unincorporated village remained part of the [[Rye, Westchester County, New York|Town of Rye]] until 1788 when the town of White Plains was created.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nOn July 9, 1776, a copy of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] was delivered to the New York Provincial Congress, which was meeting in the county courthouse. The delegates quickly adopted a resolution approving the Declaration, thus declaring both the colony's independence and the formation of the [[State of New York]]. The Declaration itself was first publicly read from the steps of the courthouse on July 11.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nDuring September and October 1776, troops led by [[George Washington]] took up positions in the hills of the village, hotly pursued by the British under General [[Sir William Howe]], who attacked on October 28.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> The [[Battle of White Plains]] took place primarily on Chatterton Hill, (later known as \"Battle Hill,\" and located just west of what was then a swamp but is now the downtown area) and the Bronx River. Howe's force of 4,000\u20136,000 British and [[Hessian (soldiers)|Hessian soldiers]] required three attacks before the Continentals, numbering about 1,600 under the command of Generals Alexander McDougall and Israel Putnam, retreated, joining Washington's main force, which did not take part in the battle. Howe's forces had suffered 250 casualties, a severe loss, and he made no attempt to pursue the Continentals, whose casualties were about 125 dead and wounded. Three days after the battle Washington withdrew north of the village, this was then occupied by Howe's forces. But after several inconclusive skirmishes over the next week Howe withdrew on November 5, leaving White Plains to the Continentals.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> Ironically, one of Washington's subordinates, Major John Austin, who was probably drunk after having celebrated the enemy's withdrawal, reentered the village with his detachment and proceeded to burn it down. Although he was court-martialed and convicted for this action, he escaped punishment.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/>\n\nThe first [[United States Census]], conducted in 1790, listed the White Plains population at 505, of whom 46 were slaves.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> (New York City's population at that time was about 33,000.) By 1800, the population stood at 575 and in 1830, 830.<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> By 1870, 26 years after the arrival of the [[New York Central Railroad]], it had swollen to 2,630<ref name=\"Hoffman\"/> and by 1890 to 4,508.

Some of these retail locations were the first large-scale suburban stores built in the United States and ushered in the eventual post-war building boom.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Construction of nearby parkways and expressways in the 1940s through the 1970s only enhanced White Plains' role as a retail location. With a city opening ceremony, [[Macy's]] launched a grand White Plains store on Main Street across from City Hall in 1949. As the mayor said at the time, this was a significant event in the life of White Plains. Other prestigious stores followed, such as [[B. Altman & Co.]], [[Rogers Peet]], [[Saks Fifth Avenue]], [[Lord & Taylor]], [[Alexander's]], [[Wallachs (clothiers)|Wallachs]], and a short-lived branch of [[Bergdorf Goodman]], which was converted to sister chain [[Neiman Marcus]] in 1981. White Plains is still a huge retail destination in the area with [[Bloomingdale's]], Neiman Marcus, [[Nordstrom]], [[Nordstrom Rack]], Macy's, [[Burlington Coat Factory]], and over 1000 other small and mid-size stores in four malls.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}\n\nDuring the late 1960s, the city of White Plains developed an extensive urban renewal plan for residential, commercial and mixed-use redevelopment that effectively called for the demolition of its entire central business district from the [[Bronx River Parkway]] east to Mamaroneck Avenue.\n\nBeginning in the 1950s, many major corporations based in New York City relocated operations to White Plains and other suburban locations. These included [[General Foods]], [[PepsiCo]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.|Hitachi]] USA, [[IBM]], [[Nestl\u00e9]], [[Snapple]] and [[Heineken USA]]. At the height of the 1980s, at least 50 [[Fortune 500]] corporations called Westchester County and nearby [[Fairfield County, Connecticut]], home, but with the corporate mergers and downsizing of the 1990s many of these companies either reduced their operations in White Plains or left the area completely.\n\n[[File:New York Power Authority and Main Street in White Plains.JPG|thumb|left|New York Power Authority and Main Street]]\n\nWhite Plains is also home to the Arts Exchange Building, which serves as the headquarters of the Westchester Arts Council. Since March 1999, visual and performing artists, emerging cultural organizations and new creative businesses have studios and offices in the building. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.\n\nFor a time, White Plains had the dubious distinction of having one of the highest office vacancy rates in the northeastern United States. Consolidation within the retail industry led to the closing of many of downtown's original department and specialty stores as well. After its bankruptcy, the B. Altman store closed in 1989 and was eventually demolished to make way for the massive upscale retail mall, [[The Westchester]], which opened in 1995 with anchors Nordstrom and Neiman Marcus. A freestanding branch of Macy's, one of downtown's original retail [[anchor store]]s, was relocated two blocks away to The Galleria mall by its parent company, [[Federated Department Stores]], replacing the location of sister retailer, [[Abraham & Straus]] when these two store divisions were merged in 1995.\n\n[[File: City Center in the City of White Plains.JPG|thumb|City Center on Mamaroneck Avenue]]\n\nOther major projects were completed in the late 1990s and early 2000s that have further altered the urban character of downtown White Plains. A new courthouse for the [[Southern District of New York]] was opened in 1998 and several large-scale office properties in and near downtown, including the former General Foods headquarters building, were retrofitted and leased to accommodate smaller businesses.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E0D61031F935A2575AC0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=Commercial Real Estate; General Foods' Old Office Is Repackaged for Multiple Tenants | first=David W. | last=Dunlap | date=September 16, 1998}}</ref> The Macy's store on Main Street remained vacant for several years until it was also later demolished to make way for the massive [[City Center at White Plains]] complex.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.whiteplainscnr.com/old/frontpage/frontpage-0718.html |title=Front Page |publisher=Whiteplainscnr.com |date=July 17, 2001 |accessdate=April 4, 2011}}</ref> This large mixed-use development features [[Trump Tower (White Plains)|two 35-story apartment and condominium towers]], {{convert|600000|sqft|m2|-4|adj=on}} of retail, restaurant and entertainment space and new parking facilities.

He has made state visits to Bhutan and Nepal and Japan within the first 100 days of his government followed by visits of Myanmar and Australia and also hosted Asia leaders like Australian Prime Minister [[Tony Abbott]], Chinese President [[Xi Jinping]] and Vietnamese Prime Minister [[Nguy\u1ec5n T\u1ea5n D\u0169ng]] apart from inviting [[SAARC]] leaders in his inauguration ceremony. External Affairs Minister Swaraj has also made official visits to several Asian capitals like [[Dhaka]], Bangladesh, [[Kathmandu]], Nepal, [[Naypidaw]], Myanmar, [[Singapore]], [[Hanoi]], Vietnam, [[Manama]], Bahrain, [[Kabul]], Afghanistan, [[Dushanbe]], Tajikistan, [[Male]], Maldives, [[Abu Dhabi]], United Arab Emirates [[Seoul]], South Korea and [[Beijing]], China.\n\n===South China Sea disputes===\nThough India's exclusive economic zone does not extend into the [[South China Sea]], the region is geopolitically important to India as a high volume of its trade passes through the South China Sea. Modi intends India to act as a stabilizing force in the Indo-Pacific Region as a part of Modi's underlying [[Look East policy (India)|Act East]] foreign policy initiative .<ref>{{citation|title=Trump Is Driving Xi into Modi's Arms|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2018/04/27/trump-is-driving-xi-into-modis-arms/|publisher=[[Foreign Policy]]|date=27 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n==South Asia policy==\n{{Further|South Asian foreign policy of the Narendra Modi government}}\nEven before becoming the Prime Minister [[Narendra Modi]] hinted that his foreign policy will actively focus on improving ties with India's immediate neighbors which is being termed as \"neighborhood first\" policy in the media<ref name=\"articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com\"/><ref name=\"India, Modi and the neighbourhood\"/><ref name=\"The New York Times\"/> and he started well by inviting all heads of state/heads of government of South Asian countries in his inauguration and on the second day on office he held bilateral talks with all of them individually which was dubbed as a [[List of SAARC summits|mini SAARC summit]] by the media.<ref name=\"The mini SAARC summit\"/> Later during a launch event at [[ISRO]] he has asked Indian scientists to take the endeavor to develop a dedicated ''SAARC satellite''<ref name=\"claws.in\"/> to share the fruits of the technology like tele-medicine, e-learning etc. with the people across South Asia to complement the currently operating [[Indian Technical and Economic Cooperation Programme]] program in the region.\n\n==West Asia policy==\n{{Further|Middle Eastern foreign policy of the Narendra Modi government}}\nIndian External Affairs Ministry refers to the region of 'Middle East' as West Asia and not as Middle East which is a more popular attribution, particularly in the western countries. The region plays a vital role in India's economy as it supplies nearly two third of India's total oil import, bilateral trade is also flourishing in recent years particularly with UAE and other Gulf states. Over the years millions of Indians mostly working class have migrated to the gulf looking for jobs and they account for a sizeable share in the total remittances received from abroad.\n\n===Link West policy===\nIn an attempt to strengthen ties with India's western neighbors specially the [[Persian gulf|gulf countries]], Modi proposed this policy to complement his [[Act East policy]] concerning East Asia. Although it is called 'Link West' (West of India) which gives it a bigger geographical connotation, it is most likely to focus on the [[Middle East|middle-east]] and some of India's strategic thinkers are calling it as Modi's middle-east policy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/columns/modi-and-the-middle-east-towards-a-link-west-policy/|title=Modi and the Middle East: Towards a Link West Policy|author=C Raja Mohan|newspaper=[[The Indian Express]]|date=5 October 2014|accessdate=14 February 2015}}</ref> The West Asia Approach of India<ref>[http://www.dnd.com.pk/the-west-asia-approach-of-india-and-its-relations-with-middle-east/103010]</ref> is working successfully and its relations with Middle East are improving since Modi came in power.

Special enclosures for [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[insect]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]], and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as [[lemur]]s, [[marmoset]]s, birds, [[lizard]]s, and [[turtle]]s.

When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures.

Conservation programs can struggle to fight bigger issues like habitat loss and illness. To rebuild degrading habitats takes major funding and a massive amount of time, both of which are scarce in conservation efforts. The current state of conservation programs cannot rely solely on situ (onsite conservation) plans alone, ex-situ (off-site conservation) is often needed. Off-site conservation relies on zoos, national parks, or other care facilities to support the rehabilitation of the animals and their populations. Zoos benefit conservation by providing suitable habitats and care to endangered animals. When properly regulated, they present a safe, clean environment for the animals to diversely repopulate. A study on amphibian conservation and zoos addressed these problems by writing,<blockquote>Whilst addressing in situ threats, particularly habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, is of primary importance; for many amphibian species in situ conservation alone will not be enough, especially in light of current un-mitigatable threats that can impact populations very rapidly such as chytridiomycosis [an infectious fungal disease].

This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions.

A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in.  When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382).  However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50).\n\n=== Moral concerns ===\nSome critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.<ref>Jensen, p. 48.</ref> In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Behavioural restriction ===\nMany modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and [[behavioural enrichment]]s.  This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages.<ref name=Masci2000>{{cite journal|author=Masci, D.|title=Zoos in the 21st century.|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2000|pages=353\u201376|url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Zoos-in-the-21st-Century.html}}</ref>\n\nAnimals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviors in zoo enclosures.

[[Nocturnal]] animals are often housed in buildings with a reversed light-dark cycle, i.e. only dim white or red lights are on during the day so the animals are active during visitor hours, and brighter lights on at night when the animals sleep. Special climate conditions may be created for animals living in extreme environments, such as penguins. Special enclosures for [[bird]]s, [[mammal]]s, [[insect]]s, [[reptile]]s, [[fish]], and other aquatic life forms have also been developed. Some zoos have walk-through exhibits where visitors enter enclosures of non-aggressive species, such as [[lemur]]s, [[marmoset]]s, birds, [[lizard]]s, and [[turtle]]s.

[[Marine mammal park]]s such as [[SeaWorld|Sea World]] and [[Marineland of Florida|Marineland]] are more elaborate [[dolphinarium]]s keeping [[whale]]s, and containing additional entertainment attractions. Another kind of animal theme park contains more entertainment and amusement elements than the classical zoo, such as a stage shows, roller coasters, and mythical creatures. Some examples are [[Busch Gardens Tampa Bay]] in [[Tampa, Florida]], both [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] and [[Gatorland]] in [[Orlando, Florida]], [[Flamingo Land]] in [[North Yorkshire, England]], and [[Six Flags Discovery Kingdom]] in [[Vallejo, California]].\n\n== Sources of animals ==\nBy the year 2000 most animals being displayed in zoos were the offspring of other zoo animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2019}}  This trend, however was and still is somewhat species-specific. When animals are transferred between zoos, they usually spend time in quarantine, and are given time to acclimatize to their new enclosures which are often designed to mimic their natural environment. For example, some species of penguins may require refrigerated enclosures.

Conservation programs can struggle to fight bigger issues like habitat loss and illness. To rebuild degrading habitats takes major funding and a massive amount of time, both of which are scarce in conservation efforts. The current state of conservation programs cannot rely solely on situ (onsite conservation) plans alone, ex-situ (off-site conservation) is often needed. Off-site conservation relies on zoos, national parks, or other care facilities to support the rehabilitation of the animals and their populations. Zoos benefit conservation by providing suitable habitats and care to endangered animals. When properly regulated, they present a safe, clean environment for the animals to diversely repopulate. A study on amphibian conservation and zoos addressed these problems by writing,<blockquote>Whilst addressing in situ threats, particularly habitat loss, degradation and fragmentation, is of primary importance; for many amphibian species in situ conservation alone will not be enough, especially in light of current un-mitigatable threats that can impact populations very rapidly such as chytridiomycosis [an infectious fungal disease].

This is not the case in some less well-regulated zoos, often based in poorer regions.

A zoo can be considered an internment camp due to the insufficient enclosures that the animals have to live in.  When an elephant is placed in a pen that is flat, has no tree, no other elephants and only a few plastic toys to play with; it can lead to boredom and foot problems (Lemonic, McDowel, and Bjerklie 50). Also, animals can have a shorter life span when they are in these types of enclosures. Causes can be human diseases, materials in the cages, and possible escape attempts (Bendow 382).  However, when zoos take time to think about the animal's welfare, zoos can become a place of refuge. There are animals that are injured in the wild and are unable to survive on their own, but in the zoos they can live out the rest of their lives healthy and happy (McGaffin). In recent years, some zoos have chosen to stop showing their larger animals because they are simply unable to provide an adequate enclosure for them (Lemonic, McDowell, and Bjerklie 50).\n\n=== Moral concerns ===\nSome critics and many animal rights activists argue that zoo animals are treated as voyeuristic objects, rather than living creatures, and often suffer due to the transition from being free and wild to captivity.<ref>Jensen, p. 48.</ref> In the last 2 decades, European and North-American zoos, strongly depend on breeding within zoos, while decreasing the number of wild caught animals.{{Clarify|date=September 2015}}\n\n=== Behavioural restriction ===\nMany modern zoos attempt to improve animal welfare by providing more space and [[behavioural enrichment]]s.  This often involves housing the animals in naturalistic enclosures that allow the animals to express some of their natural behaviours, such as roaming and foraging. However, many animals remain in barren concrete enclosures or other minimally enriched cages.<ref name=Masci2000>{{cite journal|author=Masci, D.|title=Zoos in the 21st century.|journal=CQ Researcher|year=2000|pages=353\u201376|url=http://www.cqpress.com/product/Researcher-Zoos-in-the-21st-Century.html}}</ref>\n\nAnimals which naturally range over many km each day, or make seasonal migrations, are unable to perform these behaviors in zoo enclosures.

The population was 190 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],<ref name=\"GR1\" /> down from 203 in 2000. The city is an I\u0121alui\u014bmuit (Fish River tribe) [[Inupiat]] village, with historical influences from and relationships with Qawairaq (Mary's Igloo Inupiat and Golovin and Elim Yup\u2019iks. 86.2% of the population is Alaska Native or part Native. Subsistence activities are prevalent.  White Mountain is the only village on the [[Seward Peninsula]] located inland, not on the ocean.\n\n==History==\nThe area that is present day White Mountain began as the Eskimo fish camp ''Nachirvik'' which means \"mountain look-up point.\"  The bountiful resources of both the [[Niukluk River|Niukluk]] and the [[Fish River (Alaska)|Fish]] rivers supported the Native populations there.  The community grew with the influx of white prospectors during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].  The first non-Native structure was a warehouse built by the miner [[Charles D. Lane]] to store supplies for his claim in the Council District. It was the site of a government-subsidized orphanage, which became an industrial school in 1926. The Covenant Church was built in 1937. A [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was built about 1920 (although no longer utilized, the church log cabin building is still standing). A post office was opened in 1932. The tribal government re-organized under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) in 1939.

The population was 190 at the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]],<ref name=\"GR1\" /> down from 203 in 2000. The city is an I\u0121alui\u014bmuit (Fish River tribe) [[Inupiat]] village, with historical influences from and relationships with Qawairaq (Mary\u2019s Igloo Inupiat and Golovin and Elim Yup\u2019iks. 86.2% of the population is Alaska Native or part Native. Subsistence activities are prevalent.  White Mountain is the only village on the [[Seward Peninsula]] located inland, not on the ocean.\n\n==History==\nThe area that is present day White Mountain began as the Eskimo fish camp ''Nachirvik'' which means \"mountain look-up point.\"  The bountiful resources of both the [[Niukluk River|Niukluk]] and the [[Fish River (Alaska)|Fish]] rivers supported the Native populations there.  The community grew with the influx of white prospectors during the [[Klondike Gold Rush]].  The first non-Native structure was a warehouse built by the miner [[Charles D. Lane]] to store supplies for his claim in the Council District. It was the site of a government-subsidized orphanage, which became an industrial school in 1926. The Covenant Church was built in 1937. A [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was built about 1920 (although no longer utilized, the church log cabin building is still standing). A post office was opened in 1932. The tribal government re-organized under the [[Indian Reorganization Act]] (IRA) in 1939. The city was incorporated in 1969.\n\nToday, White Mountain is most notable as the last of three mandatory rest stops for teams competing in the annual [[Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race|Iditarod]].

The population was 10,255 at the 2010 [[census]]. It is approximately twenty-two miles north of downtown [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. According to the city website a special census was conducted in 2008 that placed the city population at 9,891 residents, with 3,587 households within the city limits. The population was 10,255 at the 2010 census which showed growth of 3,000 people from 2000 to 2010. The 2018 population was 12,506.\n\n==History==\n\n===Settlers===\nThe area that is now White House was purchased around 1828 by Richard Stone Wilks, a settler from Virginia.  A trail running from Kentucky to Nashville, originally created by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], cut through the area.  This trail was originally known as the [[Louisville & Nashville Turnpike]] during the mid-19th century.  In 1928, the trail was renamed US Highway 31W.\n\n===Naming the town===\nIn the mid-19th century, the Carter, Thomas, and Hough [[Stagecoach]] Company traveled the L&N Turnpike carrying passengers. A typical stop along the way was a white, two-story house built by Richard Wilks in 1829. The house was a popular stop for lodging, food, and changing out horses. President [[Andrew Jackson]] was even heard to have stayed here during his travels between his home and the White House.  During this time, houses were rarely painted white, particularly in this underdeveloped area. The stage coach drivers began to call this stop and the surrounding area White House.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=12725|title= Profile for White House, Tennessee, TN|publisher= ePodunk |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Original White House torn down, building replaced===\nThe monument for which the town was named was torn down in 1951 to make way for new development.  However, in 1986, the community erected a replica of the original building.  The reproduction, called the White House Inn Library and Museum, currently sits in the center of town next to the Fire Department.  It contains the library, a museum with artifacts from the area's early years, and the city's Chamber of Commerce. In 2015, the replica White House Inn Library and Museum was turned solely into a museum and Chamber of Commerce after the city built a new library.\n\n===Growth and development===\nWhite House was incorporated in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/White-House-Tennessee.html|title= White House, Tennessee |publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> Currently, the young town is experiencing population growth, economic progress, and community development, with many apartment projects and subdivisions planned for the area. There are over 800 homes planned for the area, and at least 5 apartment subdivisions are planned for the city.

The population was 10,255 at the 2010 [[census]]. It is approximately twenty-two miles north of downtown [[Nashville, Tennessee|Nashville]]. According to the city website a special census was conducted in 2008 that placed the city population at 9,891 residents, with 3,587 households within the city limits. The population was 10,255 at the 2010 census which showed growth of 3,000 people from 2000 to 2010. The 2018 population was 12,506.\n\n==History==\n\n===Settlers===\nThe area that is now White House was purchased around 1828 by Richard Stone Wilks, a settler from Virginia.  A trail running from Kentucky to Nashville, originally created by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]], cut through the area.  This trail was originally known as the [[Louisville & Nashville Turnpike]] during the mid-19th century.  In 1928, the trail was renamed US Highway 31W.\n\n===Naming the town===\nIn the mid-19th century, the Carter, Thomas, and Hough [[Stagecoach]] Company traveled the L&N Turnpike carrying passengers. A typical stop along the way was a white, two-story house built by Richard Wilks in 1829. The house was a popular stop for lodging, food, and changing out horses. President [[Andrew Jackson]] was even heard to have stayed here during his travels between his home and the White House.  During this time, houses were rarely painted white, particularly in this underdeveloped area. The stage coach drivers began to call this stop and the surrounding area White House.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.epodunk.com/cgi-bin/genInfo.php?locIndex=12725|title= Profile for White House, Tennessee, TN|publisher= ePodunk |accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Original White House torn down, building replaced===\nThe monument for which the town was named was torn down in 1951 to make way for new development.  However, in 1986, the community erected a replica of the original building.  The reproduction, called the White House Inn Library and Museum, currently sits in the center of town next to the Fire Department.  It contains the library, a museum with artifacts from the area's early years, and the city's Chamber of Commerce. In 2015, the replica White House Inn Library and Museum was turned solely into a museum and Chamber of Commerce after the city built a new library.\n\n===Growth and development===\nWhite House was incorporated in 1971.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/city/White-House-Tennessee.html|title= White House, Tennessee |publisher=City-Data.com|accessdate=August 18, 2012}}</ref> Currently, the young town is experiencing population growth, economic progress, and community development, with many apartment projects and subdivisions planned for the area.

American writers have delivered differing versions of the legend that explains the origin of the name. In her book ''Indian Legends of Minnesota'', Mrs. Carl T. Thayer writes that \"It is said that a Sioux maiden fell in love with a Chippewa brave. She, the daughter of the Chief, on learning that her father planned war against the Chippewa, ran to her lover and warned him. The brave went alone into the Sioux village to ask for peace and the hand of the maiden. Before the Chief would agree, the Chippewa would have to do a brave deed.\"<ref name=\"Thayer\"/>\n \n\"The lovers usually met on Manitou Island. One day, as the brave approached the Island, anticipating a meeting with his beloved, he saw, to his horror, a great white bear attacking her. He dashed to her rescue. Freed, she ran to get help from her father and the other Sioux. Returning, they saw the brave sink his knife into the bear. But too late, they both fell to the ground dead. Slowly, as they watched, the spirits of the brave and the bear rose from their prone bodies. It is said that even today, as night falls, the spirits of the bear and the brave wander the Island eternally in search of each other.\"<ref name=\"Thayer\">Thayer, Mrs. Carl T. (1883) ''Indian Legends of Minnesota''. J.R. Osgood & Co. pp. 583\u2013593.</ref>\n \nIn [[Mark Twain]]'s memoir ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', he offers a different ending, relaying that \"\u2026 the warrior, with one plunge of the blade of his knife, opened the crimson sluices of death, and the dying bear relaxed his hold. \"That night, there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers, and as the young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead monster, the gallant warrior was presented with another plume, and ere another moon had set he had a living treasure added to his heart. Their children for many years played upon the skin of the white bear \u2013 from which the lake derives its name, and the maiden and the brave remembered long the fearful scene and rescue that made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and Ka-go-ga could never forget their fearful encounter with the huge monster that came so near sending them to the [[happy hunting ground]].\"<ref>Twain, Mark (1883).

The musical told the tale of the two lovers and the white bear after whom the lake is named.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Charles Noyes Cottage 3.JPG|right|thumb|The [[Charles P. Noyes Cottage]] dates back to the days when White Bear Lake was a resort town.]]\nThe railroad was the largest man-made happening in White Bear Lake. On September 10, 1868, the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] officially opened the extension to White Bear Lake. This was a gala occasion. Ten platform cars of 300 men and four passenger cars for 200 ladies made the trip from St. Paul.\n\nBy 1874, Mark Twain had included White Bear Lake as the resort in his \"Life on the Mississippi.\"  The \"American Travelers Journal\" 1881 proclaimed, \"One of the most popular resorts in the magic northlands is White Bear Lake.\"  Barnum's hotel became the Leip House, featuring a ballroom, billiard room, dancing pavilion, bowling alley, and boats. F.C. Williams opened the Williams House on the Murray property on Lake Avenue.  James Waters opened the White Bear House at the depot.  In 1879, the Ramaley Pavilion was opened and described as \"perhaps the finest structure around the lake\" (Breeze 1890). There was Lake Side Cottage on Lake north of 6th and \"Ch\u00e2teau gay.\"  Shady Side, Bachelor's Rest and Hotel Benson were three of the resorts at Bald Eagle Lake.\n \nThe Cottage Park summer residents built a club house in 1881 where they had their meals, entertainment and social life. In 1881, the Manitou Implement Co. developed the Island for cottages with the added important feature of water works. The [[Charles P. Noyes Cottage|\"Fillebrown\" house]] on Lake Avenue was built in 1879 by C.P. Noyes.  It was purchased in 1881 by Judge George Young and in 1905 purchased by the J.

American writers have delivered differing versions of the legend that explains the origin of the name. In her book ''Indian Legends of Minnesota'', Mrs. Carl T. Thayer writes that \"It is said that a Sioux maiden fell in love with a Chippewa brave. She, the daughter of the Chief, on learning that her father planned war against the Chippewa, ran to her lover and warned him. The brave went alone into the Sioux village to ask for peace and the hand of the maiden. Before the Chief would agree, the Chippewa would have to do a brave deed.\"<ref name=\"Thayer\"/>\n \n\"The lovers usually met on Manitou Island. One day, as the brave approached the Island, anticipating a meeting with his beloved, he saw, to his horror, a great white bear attacking her. He dashed to her rescue. Freed, she ran to get help from her father and the other Sioux. Returning, they saw the brave sink his knife into the bear. But too late, they both fell to the ground dead. Slowly, as they watched, the spirits of the brave and the bear rose from their prone bodies. It is said that even today, as night falls, the spirits of the bear and the brave wander the Island eternally in search of each other.\"<ref name=\"Thayer\">Thayer, Mrs. Carl T. (1883) ''Indian Legends of Minnesota''. J.R. Osgood & Co. pp. 583\u2013593.</ref>\n \nIn [[Mark Twain]]'s memoir ''[[Life on the Mississippi]]'', he offers a different ending, relaying that \"\u2026 the warrior, with one plunge of the blade of his knife, opened the crimson sluices of death, and the dying bear relaxed his hold. \"That night, there was no more sleep for the band or the lovers, and as the young and the old danced about the carcass of the dead monster, the gallant warrior was presented with another plume, and ere another moon had set he had a living treasure added to his heart. Their children for many years played upon the skin of the white bear \u2013 from which the lake derives its name, and the maiden and the brave remembered long the fearful scene and rescue that made them one, for Kis-se-me-pa and Ka-go-ga could never forget their fearful encounter with the huge monster that came so near sending them to the [[happy hunting ground]].\"<ref>Twain, Mark (1883).

Noyes Cottage]] dates back to the days when White Bear Lake was a resort town.]]\nThe railroad was the largest man-made happening in White Bear Lake. On September 10, 1868, the [[Lake Superior and Mississippi Railroad]] officially opened the extension to White Bear Lake. This was a gala occasion. Ten platform cars of 300 men and four passenger cars for 200 ladies made the trip from St. Paul.\n\nBy 1874, Mark Twain had included White Bear Lake as the resort in his \"Life on the Mississippi.\"  The \"American Travelers Journal\" 1881 proclaimed, \"One of the most popular resorts in the magic northlands is White Bear Lake.\"  Barnum\u2019s hotel became the Leip House, featuring a ballroom, billiard room, dancing pavilion, bowling alley, and boats. F.C. Williams opened the Williams House on the Murray property on Lake Avenue.  James Waters opened the White Bear House at the depot.  In 1879, the Ramaley Pavilion was opened and described as \"perhaps the finest structure around the lake\" (Breeze 1890). There was Lake Side Cottage on Lake north of 6th and \"Ch\u00e2teau gay.\"  Shady Side, Bachelor\u2019s Rest and Hotel Benson were three of the resorts at Bald Eagle Lake.\n \nThe Cottage Park summer residents built a club house in 1881 where they had their meals, entertainment and social life. In 1881, the Manitou Implement Co. developed the Island for cottages with the added important feature of water works. The [[Charles P. Noyes Cottage|\"Fillebrown\" house]] on Lake Avenue was built in 1879 by C.P. Noyes.  It was purchased in 1881 by Judge George Young and in 1905 purchased by the J. Walter Fillebrown family who donated the house to the White Bear Lake Area Historical Society in the 1970s.\n\nThe City of White Bear Lake was incorporated in 1921.\n\nWhite Bear Lake notably played no role in F. Scott Fitzgerald's 1925 novel [[The Great Gatsby]], despite claims from local simpletons. \n\nIn 1940, [[Nellie G. Best]] painted a tempera mural, ''Early Voyageurs at Portage'', as part of the [[Works Progress Administration|WPA's]] nationwide mural project for the post office in White Bear Lake, Minnesota. The location of this mural is unknown. It may have been removed during a post office remodeling.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kallermeyn|first1=Pat|title=The Canoe: A Vehicle for the Spirit|url=http://www.canoeing.com/canoes/feature/canoespirit.htm|website=Canoeing.com|publisher=Canoeing.com|accessdate=12 May 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604103044/http://www.canoeing.com/canoes/feature/canoespirit.htm|archive-date=2016-06-04|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nWhite Bear Lake High School and Mariner High School merged in 1983 to form [[White Bear Lake Area High School]].
