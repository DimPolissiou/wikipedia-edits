A longtime political opponent of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], Aquino had just landed in his home country after three years of self-imposed [[exile]] in the United States when he was shot in the head while being escorted from an aircraft to a vehicle that was waiting to transport him to prison. Also killed was Rolando Galman, who was later implicated in Aquino's murder.\n\nAquino was elected to the Philippine Senate in 1967 and shortly thereafter began speaking out against Marcos's authoritarian rule. He was imprisoned on [[frameup|trumped up charges]] shortly after Marcos's 1972 declaration of [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]]. In 1980, he suffered an explosive diarrhea in prison and was allowed to leave the country two months later by Marcos's wife, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]]. He spent the next three years in exile near [[Boston]] before deciding to return to the Philippines.\n\nAquino's assassination is credited with transforming the opposition to the Marcos regime from a small, isolated movement into a national crusade. It is also credited with thrusting Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], into the public spotlight and her running for president in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap election]]. Although Marcos was officially declared the winner of the election, widespread allegations of fraud and illegal tampering on Marcos's behalf are credited with sparking the [[People Power Revolution]], which resulted in Marcos fleeing the country and conceding the presidency to Mrs. Aquino.\n\nAlthough many, including the Aquino family, maintain that Marcos ordered Aquino's assassination, this was never definitively proven. An official government investigation ordered by Marcos shortly after the assassination led to murder charges against 25 military personnel and one civilian, all of whom were acquitted by the [[Sandiganbayan]] (special court). After Marcos was ousted, another government investigation under [[Presidency of Corazon Aquino|President Aquino's administration]] led to a retrial and the conviction of 16 military personnel, all of whom were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Since then, one of the convicts was [[pardon]]ed, three died in prison, and the remainder had their sentences [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] at various times; the last convicts were released from prison in 2009.\n\n==Background==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n{{History of the Philippines}}\n[[Benigno Aquino Jr.]] was elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]] in 1967. During his first years as a senator, Aquino began speaking out against the authoritarian rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]; Marcos in turn saw Aquino as the biggest threat to his power.\n\nOn September 23, 1972, Marcos declared [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]] and ordered Aquino and others arrested and imprisoned on [[frameup|trumped up charges]] of murder and subversion. Aquino went on a [[hunger strike]] to protest the injustice of his [[military tribunal|military trial]], but ended the strike after 40 days. The tribunal lasted several years, all while Aquino was still imprisoned, and on November 25, 1977, he was convicted on all charges and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. However, Aquino and others believed that Marcos would not allow him to be executed as Aquino had gained a great deal of support while imprisoned, and such a fate would surely make him a [[martyr]] for his supporters.\n\nIn 1978, while still in prison, Aquino founded his [[political party]], ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]'' (abbreviated \"LABAN\"; English: ''People's Power,'' with the acronym meaning \"fight\" in Tagalog), to run for office in the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (Parliament). All LABAN candidates lost, primarily to candidates of Marcos' party, amid allegations of [[electoral fraud|election fraud]].\n\nIn March 1980, Aquino suffered a [[heart attack]] in prison. He was transported to the [[Philippine Heart Center]], where he suffered a second heart attack. Doctors determined he needed [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]; however, no surgeon wanted to perform the operation out of fear of controversy, and Aquino refused to undergo the procedure in the Philippines out of fear of sabotage by Marcos, indicating that he would either go to the [[United States]] to undergo the procedure or die in his prison cell. On May 8, 1980, [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] arranged for Aquino and his family to leave for the U.S. He underwent a coronary bypass surgery in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and met with Muslim leaders in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], before settling with his family in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Massachusetts]].\n\nAquino spent the next three years in [[exile|self-exile]] in the U.S., wherein he worked on manuscripts for two books and delivered several lectures and speeches critical of the Marcos government across the nation. By 1983, news of the political situation in the Philippines led Aquino to return to the country, fully aware of the danger that awaited him.\n\nFormer [[Lanao del Sur]] congressman [[Rashid Lucman]] helped Aquino circumvent [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]]'s order not to issue passports to the Aquino family, providing him with a passport under the alias \"Marcial Bonifacio\" \u2013 a reference to martial law as well as Aquino's detention at Fort Bonifacio.<ref name=\"CorazonAquino20030821\">{{Cite news |title=The last time I saw Ninoy |last=Aquino |first=Corazon C. |date=21 August 2003 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author-link=Corazon Aquino}}</ref>\n\nAquino, after flying in a circuitous route from the United States to several Asian cities such as [[Singapore]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] to meet Malaysian leaders, and then to [[Hong Kong]], boarded a [[China Airlines]] plane in [[Taipei]] and landed in [[Manila]] on August 21, 1983.\n\n==Assassination==\nPrior to his departure from [[Taipei]], Aquino gave an interview from his room at the [[Grand Hotel (Taipei)|Grand Hotel]] in which he indicated that he would be wearing a [[bulletproof vest]]. He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: \"You have to be ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast. In a matter of three or four minutes it could be all over, and I may not be able to talk to you again after this.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuEPFt-Dd-Q |title=YouTube - Ninoy Aquino: Worth Dying For (the last interview!)

In Manila, a contingent of over 1,000 armed soldiers and police were assigned by the government to provide security for Aquino's arrival.

The soldiers escorted him off the airplane and onto the [[jet bridge]]; however, instead of following the jet bridge to the terminal, they exited the jet bridge down the service staircase onto the [[airport ramp|apron]], where a military vehicle was waiting to bring him to prison.<ref name=sandigan/> As Aquino disembarked the plane, one of the personnel was heard saying \"''Pusila! Pusila! Op! Pusila! Pusila! Pusila!''\" (\"''Pusila''\" is the [[Cebuano language|Visayan]] word for \"[[Shooting|shoot]]\") before the gunshots were heard. It was recorded on the news camera, but the actual shooting of Aquino was not caught on camera due to the [[Exposure (photography)|exposure]] to bright sunlight.<ref name=ninoy01>{{cite news |title=Agosto Beinte-Uno |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QAIldNxQYY |publisher=[[ABS-CBN News and Current Affairs|ABS-CBN News]]|via=[[YouTube]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Benigno Aquino Assassinated - 1983 {{!}} Today In History {{!}} 21 Aug 17 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wex9Q3cWU3Q |work=AP Archive |publisher=YouTube}}</ref>\n\nWhen the firing stopped, Aquino and a man later identified as Rolando Galman lay dead on the apron, both from gunshot wounds. Aquino's body was carried into an [[Aviation Security Command]] (AVSECOM) van by two AVSECOM SWAT soldiers, while another soldier at the bumper of the van continued to fire shots at Galman.

However, there is no solid evidence to substantiate this claim.<ref name=ninoy01/> Several foreign media personnel were with Aquino on the plane.<ref name=ninoy01/>\n\n===Murder weapon===\nAccording to contemporary news reports, the alleged  murder weapon was an American-made handgun, specifically a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[.357 Magnum]] [[revolver]], which the [[Interpol]] traced to a gun store in [[Bangkok]].  It was also reported that the manufacturer had shipped the pistol to the Thai National Trading Co. in Bangkok on 25 September  1970.\n\n==Funeral==\nAquino lay in state for nine days, with no effort made to disguise a bullet wound that had disfigured his face. Aquino's mother, Do\u00f1a Aurora, told the funeral home not to [[embalm]] nor apply makeup on the body, so that the public may see \"what they did to my son\". Thousands of supporters flocked to Aquino's [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], which took place at his house on Times Street in the West Triangle neighbourhood of [[Quezon City]]. Aquino's wife, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], and children Ballsy, Pinky, Viel, [[Noynoy Aquino|Noynoy]], and [[Kris Aquino|Kris]] arrived from Boston the day after the assassination. In a later interview, Aquino's eldest daughter, Ballsy (now Aquino-Cruz), recounted that they learnt of the assassination through a phone call from [[Kyodo News]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The assassination of Benigno Aquino|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBzuQolq93A|publisher=History Channel|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAquino was later transferred to [[Santo Domingo Church]], where his funeral was held on August 31. Following a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at 9&nbsp;a.m., with the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop of Manila]], [[Jaime Sin]] officiating, the funeral procession brought his remains to Manila Memorial Park in [[Para\u00f1aque]]. The flatbed truck that served as his [[hearse]] wound through Metro Manila for 12 hours, finally reaching the memorial park at around 9&nbsp;p.m. More than two million people lined the streets for the procession, which passed  by [[Rizal Park]], where the Philippine flag had been brought to half-staff. Church-sponsored [[Radio Veritas]] was the only station to broadcast the entire ceremony.\n\n[[Jovito Salonga]], then head of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], said about Aquino:\n\n{{quote|Ninoy was getting impatient in Boston, he felt isolated by the flow of events in the Philippines. In early 1983, Marcos was seriously ailing, the Philippine economy was just as rapidly declining, and insurgency was becoming a serious problem.

Theories arose as to who was in charge and who ordered the execution. Some hypothesized that Marcos had a long-standing order for Aquino's murder upon the latter's return.\n\n===Rolando Galman===\nMere hours after the shooting, the government declared that Rolando Galman, a communist [[hitman]] acting on orders from [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Philippine Communist Party]] chairman Rodolfo Salas, was the man who killed Aquino.<ref>''Chronicles of a Revolution: 1995'', p. 27</ref> A government reenactment that aired on television days after the shooting alleged that Galman hid under the service staircase while Aquino and the boarding party descended it, and as Aquino neared the van, Galman emerged from under the staircase and shot Aquino in the back of the head. Several members of the security detail in turn fired several shots at Galman, killing him.\n\nThere were numerous irregularities in this version of events, including the amount of time between Aquino leaving the plane to the sound of gunfire (eight seconds), whereas this scenario would have taken at least 13 seconds, when reenacted, as well as how an alleged lone gunman could have penetrated a security detail of over 1,000 people at the airport without assistance. Politicians and diplomats found evident contradictions between the claim and the photos and videotape footage that documented the time before and after the shooting.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Test of Wills |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926285-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=October 24, 1983 |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |language= |quote= }}</ref> Years later, the official investigation into the assassination concluded that Galman was a [[scapegoating|scapegoat]] in a larger plot to kill Aquino; despite this conclusion, many prominent individuals continue to support the position that Galman was the perpetrator.\n\n===Agrava Board===\nMarcos immediately created a fact-finding commission called the Fernando Commission to investigate Aquino's assassination. It was headed by Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Enrique Fernando]]. Four retired Supreme Court justices were appointed; they resigned after its composition was challenged in court. [[Arturo M. Tolentino]] declined his appointment as board chairman. However, the commission held only two sittings due to intense public criticism.<ref name=sandigan/>\n\nOn October 14, 1983, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1886,<ref>{{cite web|title=Creating a Fact-Finding Board with Plenary Powers to Investigate the Tragedy Which Occurred on August 21, 1983|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno1886.html|work=Presidential Decree No. 1886|publisher=Malacanang Palace|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> creating an independent board of inquiry, called the \"Agrava Commission\" or \"Agrava Board\". The board was composed of former Court of Appeals Justice Corazon J. Agrava<ref name=sandigan/> as chairwoman, with lawyer Luciano E. Salazar, businessman Dante G. Santos, labor leader Ernesto F. Herrera, and educator Amado C. Dizon as members.\n\nThe Agrava Fact-Finding Board convened on November 3, 1983. Before it could start its work, President Marcos accused the communists of the killing of Senator Aquino: the decision to eliminate the former senator, Marcos claimed, was made by none other than the general-secretary of the Philippine Communist Party, Rodolfo Salas. He was referring to his earlier claim that Aquino had befriended and subsequently betrayed his communist comrades.\n\nThe Agrava Board conducted public hearings and requested testimonies from several persons who might shed light on the crimes, including Imelda Marcos, and General [[Fabian Ver]], Chief of Staff of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].\n\nIn the subsequent proceedings, no one actually identified who fired the gun that killed Aquino, but Rebecca Quijano, another passenger, testified that she saw a man behind Aquino (running from the stairs towards Aquino and his escorts) point a gun at the back of his head, after which there was a sound of a gunshot. A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony. More suspicions were aroused when Quijano described the assassin as wearing a military uniform.\n\nAfter a year of thorough investigation\u2014with 20,000 pages of testimony given by 193 witnesses, the Agrava Board submitted two reports to President Marcos\u2014the Majority and Minority Reports. The Minority Report, submitted by Chairman Agrava alone, was submitted on October 23, 1984. It confirmed that the Aquino assassination was a military conspiracy, but it cleared General Ver. Many believed that President Marcos intimidated and pressured the members of the Board to persuade them not to indict Ver, Marcos's first cousin and most trusted general. Excluding Chairman Agrava, the majority of the board submitted a separate report\u2014the Majority Report indicting several members of the Armed Forces including Ver, General Luther Custodio, and General Prospero Olivas, head of the AVSECOM.\n\n===Trials and convictions===\nIn 1985, 25 military personnel (including several generals and colonels) and one civilian were charged for the murders of Benigno Aquino Jr. and Rolando Galman. President Marcos relieved Ver as AFP Chief and appointed his second cousin, [[Fidel Ramos|General Fidel V. Ramos]], as acting AFP Chief. The accused were tried by the [[Sandiganbayan]] (special court). After a brief trial, the Sandiganbayan acquitted all of the accused on December 2, 1985.<ref>''[http://www.interaksyon.com/article/69021/list--10-things-of-interest-about-the-assassination-of-ninoy-aquino 10 things of interest about the assassination of Ninoy Aquino]'', Aquino, Tricia. (20 August 2013), Interaksyon.com</ref> Immediately after the decision, Marcos re-instated Ver.

The middle class got involved, the impoverished majority participated, and business leaders whom Marcos had irked during martial law endorsed the campaign\u2014all with the crucial support of the military and the Catholic Church hierarchy. The assassination showed the increasing incapacity of the Marcos regime\u2014Ferdinand was mortally ill when the crime occurred while his cronies mismanaged the country in his absence. It outraged Aquino's supporters that Marcos, if not masterminding it, allowed the assassination to happen and engineered its cover-up. The mass revolt caused by Aquino's demise attracted worldwide media attention and Marcos's American contacts, as well as the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], began distancing themselves. There was a global media spotlight on the Philippine crisis, and exposes on Imelda's extravagant lifestyle (most infamously, her thousands of pairs of shoes) and \"mining operations\", as well as Ferdinand's excesses, came into focus.\n\nThe assassination thrust Aquino's widow, Corazon, into the public eye. She was the presidential candidate of [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|UNIDO]] opposition party in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap election]], running against Marcos. The official results showed a Marcos victory, but this was universally dismissed as fraudulent. In the subsequent [[People Power Revolution]], Marcos resigned and went into exile, and Corazon Aquino became president.\n\nWhile no Filipino president has ever been assassinated, Benigno Aquino is one of three presidential spouses who had been murdered. Alicia Syquia-Quirino and three of her children was murdered by Imperial Japanese troops along during the [[Battle for the Liberation of Manila|Battle of Manila]] in 1945, while Do\u00f1a [[Aurora Quezon]] was killed along with her daughter and son-in-law in a [[Hukbalahap]] ambush in 1949.\n\n=== Memorials ===\n[[File:Ninoy Aquino International Airport - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Manila International Airport, which was renamed in honor of Aquino]] \nIn 1987, Manila International Airport, where the assassination occurred, was renamed \"[[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]\" in Aquino's honour.

He was imprisoned on [[frameup|trumped up charges]] shortly after Marcos's 1972 declaration of [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]]. In 1980, he suffered a heart attack in prison and was allowed to leave the country two months later by Marcos's wife, [[Imelda Marcos|Imelda]]. He spent the next three years in exile near [[Boston]] before deciding to return to the Philippines.\n\nAquino's assassination is credited with transforming the opposition to the Marcos regime from a small, isolated movement into a national crusade. It is also credited with thrusting Aquino's widow, [[Corazon Aquino]], into the public spotlight and her running for president in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap election]]. Although Marcos was officially declared the winner of the election, widespread allegations of fraud and illegal tampering on Marcos's behalf are credited with sparking the [[People Power Revolution]], which resulted in Marcos fleeing the country and conceding the presidency to Mrs. Aquino.\n\nAlthough many, including the Aquino family, maintain that Marcos ordered Aquino's assassination, this was never definitively proven. An official government investigation ordered by Marcos shortly after the assassination led to murder charges against 25 military personnel and one civilian, all of whom were acquitted by the [[Sandiganbayan]] (special court). After Marcos was ousted, another government investigation under [[Presidency of Corazon Aquino|President Aquino's administration]] led to a retrial and the conviction of 16 military personnel, all of whom were sentenced to [[life imprisonment]]. Since then, one of the convicts was [[pardon]]ed, three died in prison, and the remainder had their sentences [[commutation of sentence|commuted]] at various times; the last convicts were released from prison in 2009.\n\n==Background==\n{{more citations needed section|date=August 2019}}\n{{History of the Philippines}}\n[[Benigno Aquino Jr.]] was elected to the [[Senate of the Philippines|Philippine Senate]] in 1967. During his first years as a senator, Aquino began speaking out against the authoritarian rule of [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]]; Marcos in turn saw Aquino as the biggest threat to his power.\n\nOn September 23, 1972, Marcos declared [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]] and ordered Aquino and others arrested and imprisoned on [[frameup|trumped up charges]] of murder and subversion. Aquino went on a [[hunger strike]] to protest the injustice of his [[military tribunal|military trial]], but ended the strike after 40 days. The tribunal lasted several years, all while Aquino was still imprisoned, and on November 25, 1977, he was convicted on all charges and [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]]. However, Aquino and others believed that Marcos would not allow him to be executed as Aquino had gained a great deal of support while imprisoned, and such a fate would surely make him a [[martyr]] for his supporters.\n\nIn 1978, while still in prison, Aquino founded his [[political party]], ''[[Lakas ng Bayan]]'' (abbreviated \"LABAN\"; English: ''People's Power,'' with the acronym meaning \"fight\" in Tagalog), to run for office in the [[Interim Batasang Pambansa]] (Parliament). All LABAN candidates lost, primarily to candidates of Marcos' party, amid allegations of [[electoral fraud|election fraud]].\n\nIn March 1980, Aquino suffered a [[heart attack]] in prison. He was transported to the [[Philippine Heart Center]], where he suffered a second heart attack. Doctors determined he needed [[coronary artery bypass surgery]]; however, no surgeon wanted to perform the operation out of fear of controversy, and Aquino refused to undergo the procedure in the Philippines out of fear of sabotage by Marcos, indicating that he would either go to the [[United States]] to undergo the procedure or die in his prison cell. On May 8, 1980, [[First Lady of the Philippines|First Lady]] [[Imelda Marcos]] arranged for Aquino and his family to leave for the U.S. He underwent a coronary bypass surgery in [[Dallas]], [[Texas]] and met with Muslim leaders in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], before settling with his family in [[Newton, Massachusetts|Newton]], [[Massachusetts]].\n\nAquino spent the next three years in [[exile|self-exile]] in the U.S., wherein he worked on manuscripts for two books and delivered several lectures and speeches critical of the Marcos government across the nation. By 1983, news of the political situation in the Philippines led Aquino to return to the country, fully aware of the danger that awaited him.\n\nFormer [[Lanao del Sur]] congressman [[Rashid Lucman]] helped Aquino circumvent [[Malaca\u00f1ang Palace]]'s order not to issue passports to the Aquino family, providing him with a passport under the alias \"Marcial Bonifacio\" \u2013 a reference to martial law as well as Aquino's detention at Fort Bonifacio.<ref name=\"CorazonAquino20030821\">{{Cite news |title=The last time I saw Ninoy |last=Aquino |first=Corazon C. |date=21 August 2003 |work=Philippine Daily Inquirer |author-link=Corazon Aquino}}</ref>\n\nAquino, after flying in a circuitous route from the United States to several Asian cities such as [[Singapore]] and [[Kuala Lumpur]] to meet Malaysian leaders, and then to [[Hong Kong]], boarded a [[China Airlines]] plane in [[Taipei]] and landed in [[Manila]] on August 21, 1983.\n\n==Assassination==\nPrior to his departure from [[Taipei]], Aquino gave an interview from his room at the [[Grand Hotel (Taipei)|Grand Hotel]] in which he indicated that he would be wearing a [[bulletproof vest]]. He advised the journalists that would be accompanying him on the flight: \"You have to be ready with your hand camera because this action can become very fast.

Aquino's body was carried into an [[Aviation Security Command]] (AVSECOM) van by two AVSECOM SWAT soldiers, while another soldier at the bumper of the van continued to fire shots at Galman. The AVSECOM van sped away, leaving behind the bullet-riddled body of Galman.

However, there is no solid evidence to substantiate this claim.<ref name=ninoy01/> Several foreign media personnel were with Aquino on the plane.<ref name=ninoy01/>\n\n===Murder weapon===\nAccording to contemporary news reports, the alleged  murder weapon was an American-made handgun, specifically a [[Smith & Wesson]] [[.357 Magnum]] [[revolver]], which the [[Interpol]] traced to a gun store in [[Bangkok]].  It was also reported that the manufacturer had shipped the pistol to the Thai National Trading Co. in Bangkok on 25 September  1970.\n\n==Funeral==\nAquino lay in state for nine days, with no effort made to disguise a bullet wound that had disfigured his face. Aquino's mother, Do\u00f1a Aurora, told the funeral home not to [[embalm]] nor apply makeup on the body, so that the public may see \"what they did to my son\". Thousands of supporters flocked to Aquino's [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]], which took place at his house on Times Street in the West Triangle neighbourhood of [[Quezon City]]. Aquino's wife, [[Corazon Aquino|Corazon]], and children Ballsy, Pinky, Viel, [[Noynoy Aquino|Noynoy]], and [[Kris Aquino|Kris]] arrived from Boston the day after the assassination. In a later interview, Aquino's eldest daughter, Ballsy (now Aquino-Cruz), recounted that they learnt of the assassination through a phone call from [[Kyodo News]].<ref>{{cite web|title=The assassination of Benigno Aquino|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hBzuQolq93A|publisher=History Channel|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref>\n\nAquino was later transferred to [[Santo Domingo Church]], where his funeral was held on August 31. Following a [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] at 9&nbsp;a.m., with the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Archbishop of Manila]], [[Jaime Sin]] officiating, the funeral procession brought his remains to Manila Memorial Park in [[Para\u00f1aque]]. The flatbed truck that served as his [[hearse]] wound through Metro Manila for 12 hours, finally reaching the memorial park at around 9&nbsp;p.m. More than two million people lined the streets for the procession, which passed  by [[Rizal Park]], where the Philippine flag had been brought to half-staff. Church-sponsored [[Radio Veritas]] was the only station to broadcast the entire ceremony.\n\n[[Jovito Salonga]], then head of the [[Liberal Party (Philippines)|Liberal Party]], said about Aquino:\n\n{{quote|Ninoy was getting impatient in Boston, he felt isolated by the flow of events in the Philippines.

Theories arose as to who was in charge and who ordered the execution. Some hypothesized that Marcos had a long-standing order for Aquino's murder upon the latter's return.\n\n===Rolando Galman===\nMere hours after the shooting, the government declared that Rolando Galman, a communist [[hitman]] acting on orders from [[Communist Party of the Philippines|Philippine Communist Party]] chairman Rodolfo Salas, was the man who killed Aquino.<ref>''Chronicles of a Revolution: 1995'', p. 27</ref> A government reenactment that aired on television days after the shooting alleged that Galman hid under the service staircase while Aquino and the boarding party descended it, and as Aquino neared the van, Galman emerged from under the staircase and shot Aquino in the back of the head. Several members of the security detail in turn fired several shots at Galman, killing him.\n\nThere were numerous irregularities in this version of events, including the amount of time between Aquino leaving the plane to the sound of gunfire (eight seconds), whereas this scenario would have taken at least 13 seconds, when reenacted, as well as how an alleged lone gunman could have penetrated a security detail of over 1,000 people at the airport without assistance. Politicians and diplomats found evident contradictions between the claim and the photos and videotape footage that documented the time before and after the shooting.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |author= |coauthors= |title=Test of Wills |url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,926285-1,00.html |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |id= |pages= |page= |date=October 24, 1983 |accessdate=August 21, 2007 |language= |quote= }}</ref> Years later, the official investigation into the assassination concluded that Galman was a [[scapegoating|scapegoat]] in a larger plot to kill Aquino; despite this conclusion, many prominent individuals continue to support the position that Galman was the perpetrator.\n\n===Agrava Board===\nMarcos immediately created a fact-finding commission called the Fernando Commission to investigate Aquino's assassination. It was headed by Supreme Court Chief Justice [[Enrique Fernando]]. Four retired Supreme Court justices were appointed; they resigned after its composition was challenged in court. [[Arturo M. Tolentino]] declined his appointment as board chairman. However, the commission held only two sittings due to intense public criticism.<ref name=sandigan/>\n\nOn October 14, 1983, President Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 1886,<ref>{{cite web|title=Creating a Fact-Finding Board with Plenary Powers to Investigate the Tragedy Which Occurred on August 21, 1983|url=http://www.chanrobles.com/presidentialdecrees/presidentialdecreeno1886.html|work=Presidential Decree No. 1886|publisher=Malacanang Palace|accessdate=30 August 2013}}</ref> creating an independent board of inquiry, called the \"Agrava Commission\" or \"Agrava Board\". The board was composed of former Court of Appeals Justice Corazon J. Agrava<ref name=sandigan/> as chairwoman, with lawyer Luciano E. Salazar, businessman Dante G. Santos, labor leader Ernesto F. Herrera, and educator Amado C. Dizon as members.\n\nThe Agrava Fact-Finding Board convened on November 3, 1983. Before it could start its work, President Marcos accused the communists of the killing of Senator Aquino: the decision to eliminate the former senator, Marcos claimed, was made by none other than the general-secretary of the Philippine Communist Party, Rodolfo Salas. He was referring to his earlier claim that Aquino had befriended and subsequently betrayed his communist comrades.\n\nThe Agrava Board conducted public hearings and requested testimonies from several persons who might shed light on the crimes, including Imelda Marcos, and General [[Fabian Ver]], Chief of Staff of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]].\n\nIn the subsequent proceedings, no one actually identified who fired the gun that killed Aquino, but Rebecca Quijano, another passenger, testified that she saw a man behind Aquino (running from the stairs towards Aquino and his escorts) point a gun at the back of his head, after which there was a sound of a gunshot. A post-mortem analysis disclosed that Aquino was shot in the back of the head at close range with the bullet exiting at the chin at a downward angle, which supported Quijano's testimony. More suspicions were aroused when Quijano described the assassin as wearing a military uniform.\n\nAfter a year of thorough investigation\u2014with 20,000 pages of testimony given by 193 witnesses, the Agrava Board submitted two reports to President Marcos\u2014the Majority and Minority Reports. The Minority Report, submitted by Chairman Agrava alone, was submitted on October 23, 1984. It confirmed that the Aquino assassination was a military conspiracy, but it cleared General Ver. Many believed that President Marcos intimidated and pressured the members of the Board to persuade them not to indict Ver, Marcos's first cousin and most trusted general. Excluding Chairman Agrava, the majority of the board submitted a separate report\u2014the Majority Report indicting several members of the Armed Forces including Ver, General Luther Custodio, and General Prospero Olivas, head of the AVSECOM.\n\n===Trials and convictions===\nIn 1985, 25 military personnel (including several generals and colonels) and one civilian were charged for the murders of Benigno Aquino Jr. and Rolando Galman. President Marcos relieved Ver as AFP Chief and appointed his second cousin, [[Fidel Ramos|General Fidel V. Ramos]], as acting AFP Chief. The accused were tried by the [[Sandiganbayan]] (special court). After a brief trial, the Sandiganbayan acquitted all of the accused on December 2, 1985.<ref>''[http://www.interaksyon.com/article/69021/list--10-things-of-interest-about-the-assassination-of-ninoy-aquino 10 things of interest about the assassination of Ninoy Aquino]'', Aquino, Tricia.

The middle class got involved, the impoverished majority participated, and business leaders whom Marcos had irked during martial law endorsed the campaign\u2014all with the crucial support of the military and the Catholic Church hierarchy. The assassination showed the increasing incapacity of the Marcos regime\u2014Ferdinand was mortally ill when the crime occurred while his cronies mismanaged the country in his absence. It outraged Aquino's supporters that Marcos, if not masterminding it, allowed the assassination to happen and engineered its cover-up. The mass revolt caused by Aquino's demise attracted worldwide media attention and Marcos's American contacts, as well as the [[Presidency of Ronald Reagan|Reagan administration]], began distancing themselves. There was a global media spotlight on the Philippine crisis, and exposes on Imelda's extravagant lifestyle (most infamously, her thousands of pairs of shoes) and \"mining operations\", as well as Ferdinand's excesses, came into focus.\n\nThe assassination thrust Aquino's widow, Corazon, into the public eye. She was the presidential candidate of [[United Nationalist Democratic Organization|UNIDO]] opposition party in the [[1986 Philippine presidential election|1986 snap election]], running against Marcos. The official results showed a Marcos victory, but this was universally dismissed as fraudulent. In the subsequent [[People Power Revolution]], Marcos resigned and went into exile, and Corazon Aquino became president.\n\nWhile no Filipino president has ever been assassinated, Benigno Aquino is one of three presidential spouses who had been murdered. Alicia Syquia-Quirino and three of her children was murdered by Imperial Japanese troops along during the [[Battle for the Liberation of Manila|Battle of Manila]] in 1945, while Do\u00f1a [[Aurora Quezon]] was killed along with her daughter and son-in-law in a [[Hukbalahap]] ambush in 1949.\n\n=== Memorials ===\n[[File:Ninoy Aquino International Airport - panoramio (1).jpg|thumb|Manila International Airport, which was renamed in honor of Aquino]] \nIn 1987, Manila International Airport, where the assassination occurred, was renamed \"[[Ninoy Aquino International Airport]]\" in Aquino's honour.
