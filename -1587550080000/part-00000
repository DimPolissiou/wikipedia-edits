It specialises in the production of lesser known opera from the [[Classical period (music)|Classical period]]. Performances are always sung in English.\n\n==History==\nBampton Classical Opera was founded in 1993 by its current artistic directors, Gilly French and Jeremy Gray, in order to perform classical period opera in English. It works with a variety of conductors and ensembles and does not have a permanent music director. It performs with both modern and period instrument orchestras and has often appeared with the [[London Mozart Players]] and Chroma Ensemble. It particularly aims to provide performances for young singers.\n\nThe company's staged opera productions are performed in a garden setting in Bampton and at [[Westonbirt House]], the premises of [[Westonbirt School]], as well as at [[St John's, Smith Square]], London. From time to time it tours to other UK venues and festivals, which have included the [[Wigmore Hall]] and the [[Purcell Room]] in London, the [[Buxton Festival]], the [[Cheltenham Music Festival]] and others. In addition, occasional concerts are performed including an annual one in [[St Mary\u2019s Church, Bampton]] usually on 21 December, with other concerts in Oxford and London.\n[[Image:Marcos Portugal's Marriage of Figaro, Bampton 2010.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1|John-Colyn Gyeantey (the Count) and Emily Rowley Jones (Susanna) in the UK premi\u00e8re of Marcos Portugal's ''Marriage of Figaro'', Bampton 2010]]\n\n[[Image:Arne Paris Bampton.jpg|right|thumb|upright=1.1|Catherine Backhouse (Pallas Athena), Aoife O'Sullivan (Venus), Barbara Cole Walton (Juno) in the 2016 production of Thomas Arne's ''Judgment of Paris'']]\n\nIn 2002, Bampton Classical Opera performed the [[United Kingdom]] premi\u00e8re of ''The Philosopher's Stone'' (''[[Der Stein der Weisen]]''), a [[singspiel]] by [[Emanuel Schikaneder]] composed in collaboration with [[Mozart]], [[Johann Baptist Henneberg|Henneberg]], [[Benedikt Schack|Schack]], and [[Franz Xaver Gerl|Gerl]].

He was a half-brother of [[Sun Quan]], the founding emperor of the state of [[Eastern Wu]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nSun Lang's misfortune occurred in 222, shortly after Sun Quan's triumph over [[Liu Bei]] at the [[Battle of Xiaoting]]. The emperor of [[Cao Wei]], [[Cao Pi]], launched a multi-pronged invasion against Eastern Wu. One prong was led by [[Cao Xiu]], who led his army to [[Battle of Dongkou|Dongkou]], which was defended by [[L\u00fc Fan]]. Sun Lang was acting in capacity as a guardsman of the palace at the time and thus was under L\u00fc Fan's authority. However, early in the battle, he accidentally set fire to his own camp, destroying a large quantity of supplies in the process. To compound the Wu forces' difficulty, a freak storm struck at L\u00fc Fan's fleet, sending it crashing along the northern shore. Those troops in L\u00fc Fan's fleet who did not drown were then in danger of either being attacked by Cao Xiu's troops or dying of starvation. Luckily for the Wu forces, the general [[Xu Sheng]] arrived, driving back Cao Xiu's forces long enough for L\u00fc Fan to regroup, and in the end, Cao Xiu's fleet was driven back.\n\nDespite the victory, Sun Quan was furious that his half-brother had nearly brought destruction upon the state and he punished Sun Lang heavily. Sun Lang had all his military ranks and appointments stripped off, was disowned from the Sun family and forced to change his name to Ding Lang (\u4e01\u6717). He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.\n\n==In ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''==\nIn some versions of the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', Sun Lang is referred to as \"Sun Ren\" (\u5b6b\u4ec1).

He was a half-brother of [[Sun Quan]], the founding emperor of the state of [[Eastern Wu]] in the [[Three Kingdoms]] period.\n\nSun Lang's misfortune occurred in 222, shortly after Sun Quan's triumph over [[Liu Bei]] at the [[Battle of Xiaoting]]. The emperor of [[Cao Wei]], [[Cao Pi]], launched a multi-pronged invasion against Eastern Wu. One prong was led by [[Cao Xiu]], who led his army to [[Battle of Dongkou|Dongkou]], which was defended by [[L\u00fc Fan]]. Sun Lang was acting in capacity as a guardsman of the palace at the time and thus was under L\u00fc Fan's authority. However, early in the battle, he accidentally set fire to his own camp, destroying a large quantity of supplies in the process. To compound the Wu forces' difficulty, a freak storm struck at L\u00fc Fan's fleet, sending it crashing along the northern shore. Those troops in L\u00fc Fan's fleet who did not drown were then in danger of either being attacked by Cao Xiu's troops or dying of starvation. Luckily for the Wu forces, the general [[Xu Sheng]] arrived, driving back Cao Xiu's forces long enough for L\u00fc Fan to regroup, and in the end, Cao Xiu's fleet was driven back.\n\nDespite the victory, Sun Quan was furious that his half-brother had nearly brought destruction upon the state and he punished Sun Lang heavily. Sun Lang had all his military ranks and appointments stripped off, was disowned from the Sun family and forced to change his name to Ding Lang (\u4e01\u6717). He spent the rest of his life under house arrest.\n\n==In ''Romance of the Three Kingdoms''==\nIn some versions of the 14th-century historical novel ''[[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]]'', Sun Lang is referred to as \"Sun Ren\" (\u5b6b\u4ec1).
