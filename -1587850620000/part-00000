The grounds for the lawsuit extended that the song had been composed by his father, who had copyrighted the song in the United States in 1933.<ref name=PCOLRepublica/> Armando Robles Godoy said that he held no ill will towards Paul Simon for what he considered a \"misunderstanding\" and an \"honest mistake\".<ref name=PCOLElcine>{{cite journal |url=http://www.diariolaprimeraperu.com/online/semana/images/ediciones/pdf/6/6-4.pdf |title=El cine, los libros, la muerte (an interview with Armando Robles Godoy) |language=Spanish |journal=Diario La Primera |author=Juan Carlos Bondy |date=July 6, 2008 |accessdate=2011-07-10 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710123034/http://www.diariolaprimeraperu.com/online/semana/images/ediciones/pdf/6/6-4.pdf |archivedate=July 10, 2011 }}</ref>\n\n\"It was an almost friendly court case because Paul Simon was very respectful of other cultures.

Realism and Nationalism 1852\u20131871. Read Books. p. 118.</ref>\n\nProudhon, who was born in [[Besan\u00e7on]], was a printer who taught himself [[Latin]] in order to better print books in the language. His best-known assertion is that \"[[property is theft!]]\", contained in his first major work, ''[[What Is Property?|What Is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government]]'' (''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement''), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of [[Karl Marx]], who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's ''The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty'' with the provocatively titled ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]''. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxist]] wings of the [[International Working Men's Association]]. Some such as [[Edmund Wilson]] have contended that Marx's attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter's defense of [[Karl Gr\u00fcn]], whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon's work.\n\nProudhon favored [[Workers' council|workers' associations]] or [[co-operatives]] as well as individual worker/peasant possession over private ownership or the [[nationalization]] of land and workplaces. He considered [[social revolution]] to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In ''The Confessions of a Revolutionary'', Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist [[Circle-A|circled-A]] symbol, today \"one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape\".<ref>Marshall, Peter.

His mother Catherine Simonin was from Cordiron.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p1\"/> Claude-Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine had five boys together, two of whom died at a very young age. Proudhon's brothers Jean-Etienne and Claude were born in 1811 and 1816 respectively and both maintained a very close relationship with Proudhon.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p3\"/>\n\nAs a boy, he mostly worked in the family tavern, helped with basic agricultural work and spent time playing outdoors in the countryside. Proudhon received no formal education as a child, but he was taught to read by his mother, who had him spelling words by age three. However, the only books that Proudhon was exposed to until he was 10 were the [[Gospel]]s and the [[The Four Sons of Aymon|Four Aymon Brothers]] and some local [[almanacs]]. In 1820, Proudhon's mother began trying to get him admitted into the city college in Besan\u00e7on. The family was far too poor to afford the tuition, but with the help of one of Claude-Fran\u00e7ois' former employers she managed to gain a bursary which deducted 120 francs a year from the cost. Proudhon was unable to afford books (or even shoes) to attend school which caused him great difficulties and often made him the object of scorn by his wealthier classmates. In spite of this, Proudhon showed a strong will to learn and spent much time in the school library with a pile of books, exploring a variety of subjects in his free time outside of class.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp5-6\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5 5\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5}}</ref>\n\n=== Entrance into the printing trade ===\nIn 1827, Proudhon began an apprenticeship at a printing press in the house of Bellevaux in Battant. On Easter of the following year, he transferred to a press in Besan\u00e7on owned by the family of one of his schoolmates, Antoine Gauthier.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p9\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9}}</ref> Besan\u00e7on was an important center of religious thought at the time and most of the works published at Gauthier were [[ecclesiastical]] works. During the course of his work, Proudhon spent hours every day reading this Christian literature and began to question many of his long held religious beliefs which eventually led him to reject Christianity altogether.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp11-12\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11 11\u201312]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, Proudhon rose to be a corrector for the press, [[proofreading]] their publications. By 1829, he began to become more interested in social issues than religious theory. Of particular importance during this period was his encounter with [[Charles Fourier]], who in 1829 came to Gauthier as a customer seeking to publish his work ''Le Nouveau Monde Industriel et Soci\u00e9taire''. Proudhon supervised the printing of the book, which gave him ample opportunity to talk with Fourier about a variety of social and philosophical issues. These discussions left a strong impression on Proudhon and influenced him throughout his life.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p13\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13}}</ref> It was also during this time that Proudhon formed one of his closest friendships with [[Gustave Fallot]], a scholar from Monteb\u00e9liard who came from a family of wealthy French industrialists. Impressed by Proudhon's corrections of one of his Latin manuscripts, Fallot sought out his friendship and the two were soon regularly spending their evenings together discussing French literature by [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and many other authors to whom Proudhon had not been exposed during his years of theological readings.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp14-15\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14 14\u201315]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14}}</ref>\n\n=== Decision to pursue philosophy and writing ===\nIn September 1830, Proudhon became certified as a [[journeyman]] compositor.

Proudhon began mingling amongst the circle of metropolitan scholars surrounding Fallot, but he felt out of place and uncomfortable amidst people who were both wealthier and more accustomed to scholarly debate.

He applied for the [[Suard Pension]], a bursary that would enable him to study at the Academy of Besan\u00e7on. Proudhon was selected out of several candidates primarily due to the fact that his income was much lower than the others and the judges were extremely impressed by his writing and the level of education he had given himself while working as an artisan.

Many of his ideas on authority, morality and property disturbed the essay judges at the Academy and Proudhon was only awarded the bronze medal (something in which Proudhon took pride because he felt that this was an indicator that his writing made elite academics uncomfortable).<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp39-42\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39 39\u201342]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39}}</ref> In 1840, he published his first work ''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (or ''[[What Is Property]]'').\n\nHis third memoir on property was a letter to the [[Fourierist]] writer [[Consid\u00e9rant]], published in 1842 under the title ''Warning to Proprietors''.<ref>See [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon#Bibliography|bibliography]] below.</ref> Proudhon was tried for it at Besan\u00e7on, but he was acquitted when the jury found that they could not condemn him for a philosophy that they themselves could not understand.<ref name=\"Britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon \"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\"].

Afterwards, he became connected as a kind of manager with a commercial firm in [[Lyon]], France. In 1847, he left this job and finally settled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated as a leader of innovation. In this year, he also became a [[Freemason]].<ref>Henri du Bac. '' The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon ''. New York: Sheed and Ward, 1848. p. 9.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution of 1848 ===\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|Proudhon and his children by Gustave Courbet, 1865]]\nProudhon was surprised by the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France]]. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767\u20131855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Beside Dupont de l'Eure, the provisional government was dominated by [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberals]] such as [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] (Foreign Affairs), [[Alexandre Auguste Ledryeet-Rollin]] (Interior), [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]] (Justice) and [[Auguste Burdeau]] (War) because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. As during the 1830 [[July Revolution]], the Republican-Socialist Party had set up a counter-government in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]], including [[Louis Blanc]], [[Armand Marrast]], [[Ferdinand Flocon]] and [[Alexandre Martin]].\n\nProudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849<!-- which month? -->, ''Solution du probl\u00e8me social'' (''[[Solution of the Social Problem]]''), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\nDuring the [[Second French Republic]] (1848\u20131852), Proudhon had his biggest public effect through journalism. He got involved with four newspapers, namely ''Le Repr\u00e9sentant du Peuple'' (February 1848\u2013August 1848), ''Le Peuple'' (September 1848\u2013June 1849), ''La Voix du Peuple'' (September 1849\u2013May 1850) and ''Le Peuple de 1850'' (June 1850\u2013October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical combative journalism that appealed to many French workers, but alienated others. He repeatedly criticised the government's policies and promoted reformation of credit and exchange. He tried to establish a popular bank (''Banque du peuple'') early in 1849, but despite over 13,000 people signing up (mostly workers) receipts were limited falling short of 18,000FF and the whole enterprise was essentially stillborn.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\nProudhon ran for the [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille. He was successful, in the complementary elections of 4 June 1848 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. However, he was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nIn 1848, the closing of the National Workshops provoked the [[June Days uprising]] and the violence shocked Proudhon. Visiting the barricades personally, he later reflected that his presence at the [[Bastille]] at this time was \"one of the most honorable acts of my life\", but in general during the tumultuous events of 1848 he opposed [[insurrection]] by preaching peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. Proudhon disapproved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May and June 1848, though he was sympathetic to the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionists had been forced to endure.\n\nIn Spain, Ram\u00f3n de la Sagra established the anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in La Coru\u00f1a in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anarchism|title=anarchism &#124; Definition & History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish<ref>[[George Woodcock]].

According to [[George Woodcock]], \"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\".<ref>George Woodcock.

After his release, he remained in exile from 1858 to 1862 in Belgium. Upon the liberalization of the empire in 1863, he returned to France.\n\n=== Death ===\nProudhon died in [[Passy]] on 19 January 1865 and was buried in Paris at the cemetery of [[Montparnasse]].<ref>[https://books.google.ca/books?id=zZYWv4McvfUC&pg=PA60&dq=proudhon+montparnasse+cemetery&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi0xOCR9ZvlAhWSpp4KHaRlBcYQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&q=proudhon%20montparnasse%20cemetery&f=false ''Property is Theft!'']</ref>\n\n== Philosophy ==\n=== Anarchism ===\nProudhon was a social [[Individualist anarchism|individualist anarchist]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.anarchy.no/proudhon.html|title=Pierre Joseph Proudhon's basic ideas|work=International Institute for Organization Research}}</ref> According to [[Mikhail Bakunin]], Proudhon was the first person to refer to himself as an \"anarchist\".<ref>Rod Bush, ''The End of White World Supremacy: Black Internationalism and the Problem of the Color Line'', [[Temple University Press]], 2009, [https://books.google.com/books?id=phnJYxEM5FcC&pg=PA226 p. 226], {{ISBN|1592135749}}, 9781592135745</ref><ref>Roger Eatwell, Anthony Wright, ''Contemporary Political Ideologies: Second Edition'', Continuum International Publishing Group, 1999, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7MQwlPj-kiYC&pg=PA132 p. 132], {{ISBN|082645173X}}, 9780826451736</ref> In ''What Is Property?'', published in 1840, he defined anarchy as \"the absence of a master, of a sovereign\" and wrote: \"As man seeks justice in equality, so society seeks order in anarchy\".<ref>[[Josephus Nelson Larned]], ''The New Larned History for Ready Reference, Reading and Research'', C.A.

In a subchapter called \"What is Government?\", he wrote:\n{{quote|To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished. It is, under pretext of public utility, and in the name of the general interest, to be place[d] under contribution, drilled, fleeced, exploited, monopolized, extorted from, squeezed, hoaxed, robbed; then, at the slightest resistance, the first word of complaint, to be repressed, fined, vilified, harassed, hunted down, abused, clubbed, disarmed, bound, choked, imprisoned, judged, condemned, shot, deported, sacrificed, sold, betrayed; and to crown all, mocked, ridiculed, derided, outraged, dishonored. That is government; that is its justice; that is its morality.<ref>P.-J. Proudhon, \"What Is Government?\", written in ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', translated by John Beverly Robinson (London: [[Freedom Press]], 1923), pp. 293\u201394.</ref>}}\n\n=== Mutualism ===\n{{see also|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\n{{quote|\"Capital\"&nbsp;... in the political field is analogous to \"government\".&nbsp;... The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority, and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them.&nbsp;... What capital does to labour, and the State to liberty, the Church does to the spirit. This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy. The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body, its will and its reason.<ref>P.-J. Proudhon, ''Les confessions d'un r\u00e9volutionnaire'', (Paris: Garnier, 1851), p. 271., quoted by Max Nettlau, ''A Short History of Anarchism'', pp. 43\u201344.</ref>}}\nIn his earliest works, Proudhon analyzed the nature and problems of the capitalist economy. While deeply critical of [[capitalism]], he also objected to those contemporary socialists who advocated centralized hierarchical forms of association or state control of the economy. In a sequence of commentaries from ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), posthumously published in the ''Th\u00e9orie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (''Theory of Property'', 1863\u20131864), he declared in turn that \"property is theft\", \"property is impossible\", \"property is despotism\" and \"property is freedom\". When he said \"property is theft\", he was referring to the landowner or capitalist who he believed \"stole\" the profits from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was \"subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience\".<ref>[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, \u00a7 3 \u00b6 5].</ref>\n\nIn asserting that property is freedom, he was referring not only to the product of an individual's labor, but to the peasant or artisan's home and tools of his trade and the income he received by selling his goods. For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property is labor. What one produces is one's property and anything beyond that is not. He advocated worker self-management and was opposed to the private ownership of the means of production. As he put it in 1848:\n{{quote|Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.&nbsp;... We are socialists&nbsp;... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership.&nbsp;... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations.&nbsp;... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic.<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>}}\n\nProudhon called himself a [[socialist]], but he opposed state ownership of capital goods in favour of ownership by workers themselves in associations. This makes him one of the first theorists of [[libertarian socialism]]. Proudhon was one of the main influences on the theory of [[workers' self-management]] (''autogestion'') in the late 19th and 20th century.\n\nProudhon strenuously rejected the ownership of the products of labor by society or the state, arguing in ''What Is Property?'' that while \"property in product&nbsp;... does not carry with it property in the means of production.<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 109.</ref>&nbsp;... The right to product is exclusive&nbsp;... the right to means is common\" and applied this to the land (\"the land is&nbsp;... a common thing\")<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 92.</ref> and workplaces (\"all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its exclusive proprietor\").<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 120.</ref> He argued that while society owned the means of production or land, users would control and run them (under supervision from society) with the \"organising of regulating societies\" in order to \"regulate the market\".<ref>Proudhon, ''Selected Writings'', p. 70.</ref>\n\n[[File:Proudhon-Grab.JPG|thumb|Proudhon's grave in Paris]]\nThis use-ownership he called \"possession\" and this economic system [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. Proudhon had many arguments against entitlement to land and capital, including reasons based on morality, economics, politics and individual liberty. One such argument was that it enabled profit, which in turn led to social instability and war by creating cycles of debt that eventually overcame the capacity of labor to pay them off. Another was that it produced \"despotism\" and turned workers into wage workers subject to the authority of a boss.\n\nIn ''What Is Property?'', Proudhon wrote:\n{{quote|Property, acting by exclusion and encroachment, while population was increasing, has been the life-principle and definitive cause of all revolutions. Religious wars, and wars of conquest, when they have stopped short of the extermination of races, have been only accidental disturbances, soon repaired by the mathematical progression of the life of nations. The downfall and death of societies are due to the power of accumulation possessed by property.}}\n\nTowards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In ''The Principle of Federation'' (1863), he modified his earlier anti-state position, arguing for \"the balancing of authority by liberty\" and put forward a decentralised \"theory of federal government\". He also defined anarchy differently as \"the government of each by himself\", which meant \"that political functions have been reduced to industrial functions, and that social order arises from nothing but transactions and exchanges\". This work also saw him call his economic system an \"agro-industrial federation\", arguing that it would provide \"specific federal arrangements&nbsp;... to protect the citizens of the federated states from capitalist and financial feudalism, both within them and from the outside\" and so stop the re-introduction of \"wage labour\". This was because \"political right requires to be buttressed by economic right\".\n\nIn the posthumously published ''Theory of Property'', he argued that \"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State\". Hence, \"Proudhon could retain the idea of property as theft, and at the same time offer a new definition of it as liberty. There is the constant possibility of abuse, exploitation, which spells theft. At the same time property is a spontaneous creation of society and a bulwark against the ever-encroaching power of the State\".<ref>Copleston, Frederick. ''Social Philosophy in France'', A History of Philosophy, Volume IX, Image/Doubleday, 1994, p. 67.</ref>\n\nHe continued to oppose both capitalist and state property. In ''Theory of Property'', he maintains: \"Now in 1840, I categorically rejected the notion of property for both the group and the individual\", but then states his new theory of property that \"property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists, with an unequaled capacity for setting itself against authority\" and the \"principal function of private property within the political system will be to act as a counterweight to the power of the State, and by so doing to insure the liberty of the individual\". However, he continued to oppose concentrations of wealth and property, arguing for small-scale property ownership associated with peasants and artisans. He still opposed private property in land: \"What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on\". In addition, he still believed that \"property\" should be more equally distributed and limited in size to that actually used by individuals, families and workers associations.<ref>Proudhon, ''Theory of Property'' in ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon''  pp. 129, 133, 135\u2013136.</ref> He supported the right of inheritance and defended \"as one of the foundations of the family and society\".<ref>Steward Edwards, Introduction to ''Selected Writings of P.J. Proudhon''.</ref> However, he refused to extend this beyond personal possessions, arguing that \"[u]nder the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour\".<ref>In [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] (ed.), ''No Gods, No Masters'', vol. 1, p. 62.</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and communism. He adopted the term [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers. In his vision, self-employed artisans, peasants and cooperatives would trade their products on the market. For Proudhon, factories and other large workplaces would be run by \"labor associations\" operating on directly democratic principles. The state would be abolished and instead society would be organized by a federation of \"free communes\" (a [[Communes of France|commune]] is a local municipality in French). In 1863, Proudhon said: \"All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization\".<ref>Du principe F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif [Principle of Federation] (1863)</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed the charging of interest and rent, but he did not seek to abolish them by law: \"I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose\".<ref>''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem'', Edited by Henry Cohen. [[Vanguard Press]], 1927.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution ===\nProudhon was a revolutionary. However, his revolution did not mean violent upheaval or civil war, but rather the transformation of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was monetary reform, combined with organising a credit bank and workers associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about the organization of society along new lines{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People}}\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nHe made no public criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] or Marxism because in Proudhon's lifetime Marx was relatively unknown. It was only after Proudhon's death that Marxism became a large movement. However, he did criticize [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian socialists]] of his period. This included the [[state socialist]] [[Louis Blanc]], of whom Proudhon said: \"Let me say to M. Blanc: you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must have a God, a religion, a dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy, distinctions, and ranks. For my part, I deny your God, your authority, your sovereignty, your judicial State, and all your representative mystifications\". It was Proudhon's book ''What Is Property?'' that convinced the young Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.\n\nIn one of his first works, ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'', Marx said: \"Not only does Proudhon write in the interest of the [[proletarian]]s, he is himself a proletarian, an ouvrier. His work is a scientific manifesto of the French proletariat\". However, Marx disagreed with Proudhon's anarchism and later published vicious criticisms of Proudhon. Marx wrote ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' as a refutation of Proudhon's ''The Philosophy of Poverty''.\n\nIn their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: \"I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/letters/46_05_17.htm|title=Proudhon to Karl Marx|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Nationalism, militarism and war ===\nProudhon opposed militarism, dictatorship and war, arguing that the \"end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century, under pain of indefinite decadence\"<ref>quoted by George Woodcock, ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 233</ref> and that the \"workers alone are capable of putting an end to war by creating [[economic equilibrium]]. This presupposes a radical revolution in ideas and morals\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 214</ref> As Robert L. Hoffman notes, ''War and Peace'' \"ends by condemning war without reservation\" and its \"conclusion [is] that war is obsolete\".<ref>''Revolutionary Justice'', pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> Marxist philosopher John Ehrenberg summarized Proudhon's position as such:\n<blockquote>If injustice was the cause of war, it followed that conflict could not be eliminated until society was reorganised along egalitarian lines. Proudhon had wanted to prove that the reign of political economy would be the reign of peace, finding it difficult to believe that people really thought he was defending militarism.<ref>''Proudhon and His Age'', p. 145.</ref></blockquote>\n\nProudhon argued that under mutualism \"[t]here will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right\".<ref>''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. 283.</ref>\n\nProudhon also rejected dictatorship, stating in the 1860s that \"what I will always be&nbsp;... a republican, a democrat even, and a socialist into the bargain\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 201.</ref> Henri de Lubac argued that in terms of Proudhon's critique of democracy \"we must not allow all this to hoodwink us. His invectives against democracy were not those of a counter-revolutionary. They were aimed at what he himself called 'the false democracy'.&nbsp;... They attacked an apparently liberal 'pseudo-democracy' which 'was not economic and social'&nbsp;... 'a Jacobinical democracy'\". Proudhon \"did not want to destroy, but complete, the work of 1789\" and while \"he had a grudge against the 'old democracy', the democracy of Robespierre and Marat\", he repeatedly contrasted it \"with a 'young democracy', which was a 'social democracy'\".<ref>''The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian of anarchism [[George Woodcock]], some positions Proudhon took \"sorted oddly with his avowed anarchism\". Woodcock cited for example Proudhon's proposition that each citizen perform one or two years militia service.<ref>George Woodcock ''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A Biography]]'', Black Rose Books, 1987, p. 128.</ref> The proposal appeared in the ''Programme Revolutionaire'', an electoral manifesto issued by Proudhon after he was asked to run for a position in the provisional government. The text reads: \"7\u00b0 'L'arm\u00e9e. \u2013 Abolition imm\u00e9diate de la conscription et des remplacements; obligation pour tout citoyen de faire, pendant un ou deux ans, le service militaire; application de l'arm\u00e9e aux services administratifs et travaux d'utilit\u00e9 publique\" (\"Military service by all citizens is proposed as an alternative to conscription and the practice of \"replacement\", by which those who could avoided such service\"). In the same document, Proudhon also described the \"form of government\" he was proposing as \"a centralization analogous with that of the State, but in which no one obeys, no one is dependent, and everyone is free and sovereign\".<ref>\"Programme r\u00e9volutionnaire.\" ''M\u00e9langes. Tome I''. Paris: Lacroix, 1868. 72, 70.</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn addition to being considered a founding father of anarchism, some have tried to link him to the extreme right. He was first used as a reference in the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', a right-wing association formed in 1911 by [[Georges Valois]] and [[Edouard Berth]]. Both had been brought together by the [[syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]], but they would tend toward a synthesis of [[socialism]] and [[nationalism]], mixing Proudhon's mutualism with [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralist nationalism]]. In 1925, Georges Valois founded the [[Faisceau]], the first fascist league, which took its name from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s ''[[fasci]]''. Historian of [[History of far-right movements in France|fascism, in particular of French fascists]], [[Zeev Sternhell]], has noted this use of Proudhon by the far-right. In ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology'', he states:\n{{quote|[T]he [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]&nbsp;... from its inception regarded the author of ''La philosophie de la mis\u00e8re'' as one of its masters.<ref>Griffiths, Richard. 2005. Continuum International Publishing Group. pp. 23\u201324.</ref> He was given a place of honour in the weekly section of the journal of the movement entitled, precisely, 'Our Masters.' Proudhon owed this place in L'Action fran\u00e7aise to what the Maurrassians saw as his antirepublicanism, his anti-Semitism, his loathing of Rousseau, his disdain for the French Revolution, democracy, and parliamentarianism: and his championship of the nation, the family, tradition, and the monarchy.}}\n\nHowever, K. Steven Vincent states that \"to argue that Proudhon was a proto-fascist suggests that one has never looked seriously at Proudhon's writings\".<ref>''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[J. Salwyn Schapiro]] argued in 1945 that Proudhon was a racist, \"a glorifier of war for its own sake\" and his \"advocacy of personal dictatorship and his laudation of militarism can hardly be equalled in the reactionary writings of his or of our day\".<ref name=\"Schapiro\">{{cite journal|author=[[J. Salwyn Schapiro|Schapiro, J.

Robert Graham states that while Proudhon was personally racist, \"anti-semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme\".<ref>\"Introduction\", ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. xxxvi.</ref>\n\n[[Albert Meltzer]] has said that though Proudhon used the term \"anarchist\", he was not one and that he never engaged in \"anarchist activity or struggle\", but rather in \"parliamentary activity\".<ref>Albert Meltzer. Anarchism: Arguments for and Against, AK Press, 2000, p. 12.</ref>\n\nProudhon also engaged in an exchange of published letters between 1849 and 1850 with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] discussing the legitimacy of interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/FB-PJP-DOI.htm|title=Bastiat-Proudhon Debate on Interest|publisher=Praxeology.net|accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref> As [[Robert Leroux (sociologist)|Robert Leroux]] argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\".<ref>Leroux, Robert. \"Political Economy and Liberalism: The Economic Contribution of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat\", Routledge, 2011, p. 118.</ref> Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat: \"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man\".<ref>Roche, Charles George. \"Frederic Bastiat: A Man Alone\". Arlington House, 1971, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== Antisemitism and sexism ===\nStewart Edwards, the editor of the ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', remarks: \"Proudhon's diaries (Carnets, ed. P. Haubtmann, Marcel Rivi\u00e8re, Paris 1960 to date) reveal that he had almost paranoid feelings of hatred against the Jews. In 1847, he considered publishing an article [[anti-Semitism|against the Jewish race]], which he said he \"hated\". The proposed article would have \"called for the expulsion of the Jews from France\". It would have stated: \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated. [[Heinrich Heine|H. Heine]], A. Weil, and others are simply secret spies; [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]], [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux|Cr\u00e9mieux]], [[Marx]], [[Fould]], evil choleric, envious, bitter men who hate us\". (Carnets, vol. 2, p.&nbsp;337: No VI, 178)\".<ref name=\"marxists\">\"Carnets de P. J. Proudhon. Paris, M. Rivi\u00e8re, 1960\", translated by Mitchell Abido for marxists.org. [http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/1847/jews.htm \"On the Jews\"].</ref> Proudhon differentiated his antisemitism from that of the Middle Ages, presenting it as quasi-scientific: \"What the peoples of the Middle Ages hated by instinct, I hate upon reflection and irrevocably\".<ref>Rubenstein, Richard L. and John K. Roth (1987). ''Approaches to Auschwitz: The Legacy of the Holocaust''. London: SCM. p. 71.</ref>\n\nIn an introduction to Proudhon's works, Iain McKay, author of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' (AK Press, 2007), cautions readers by saying that \"[t]his is not to say that Proudhon was without flaws, for he had many\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128135116/http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|archivedate=28 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html|title=An Anarchist FAQ &#124; Anarchist Writers|website=anarchism.pageabode.com}}</ref> and adding the following:\n{{quote|He was not consistently libertarian in his ideas, tactics and language. His personal bigotries are disgusting and few modern anarchists would tolerate them \u2013 Namely, racism and sexism. He made some bad decisions and occasionally ranted in his private notebooks (where the worst of his anti-Semitism was expressed). While he did place his defence of the patriarchal family at the core of his ideas, they are in direct contradiction to his own libertarian and egalitarian ideas. In terms of racism, he sometimes reflected the less-than-enlightened assumptions and prejudices of the nineteenth century. While this does appear in his public work, such outbursts are both rare and asides (usually an extremely infrequent passing anti-Semitic remark or caricature). In short, \"racism was never the basis of Proudhon's political thinking\" (Gemie, 200-1) and \"anti-Semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme.\" (Robert Graham, \"Introduction\", General Idea of the Revolution, xxxvi) To quote Proudhon: \"There will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right.\" (General Idea of the Revolution, 283)<ref>Iain McKay (2011). ''Property Is Theft! A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology''. AK Press UK: Edinburgh. p. 36.</ref>}}\n\nWhile racism was not overtly part of his political philosophy, Proudhon did express [[sexist]] beliefs. He held patriarchal views on women's nature and their proper role in the family and society at large. In his ''Carnets'' (''Notebooks''), unpublished until the 1960s, Proudhon maintained that a woman's choice was to be \"courtesan or housekeeper\". To a woman, a man is \"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\". His justification for [[patriarchy]] is men's greater physical strength and recommended that men use this greater strength to keep women in their place, saying: \"A woman does not at all hate being used with violence, indeed even being violated\". In her study of [[Gustave Courbet]], who painted the portrait of ''Proudhon and his children'' (1865), art historian Linda Nochlin points out that alongside his early articulations of anarchism Proudhon also wrote and published \"the most consistent [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract of its time, or perhaps, any other\", ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'', which \"raises all the main issues about woman's position in society and her sexuality with a paranoid intensity unmatched in any other text\".<ref>Nochlin, ''Courbet''. Thames & Hudson, 2007. p. 220, note 34).</ref>\n\nProudhon's defenses of patriarchy did not go unchallenged in his lifetime and [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] attacked Proudhon's anti-feminism as a contradiction of anarchist principles. D\u00e9jacque directed Proudhon \"either to 'speak out against man's exploitation of woman' or 'do not describe yourself as an anarchist'\".<ref>Jesse Cohn [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2012_chunk_g978140518464962#citation \"Anarchism and gender\"] in: The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest.

His best-known assertion is that \"[[property is theft!]]\", contained in his first major work, ''[[What Is Property?|What Is Property? Or, an Inquiry into the Principle of Right and Government]]'' (''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9? Recherche sur le principe du droit et du gouvernement''), published in 1840. The book's publication attracted the attention of the French authorities. It also attracted the scrutiny of [[Karl Marx]], who started a correspondence with its author. The two influenced each other and they met in Paris while Marx was exiled there. Their friendship finally ended when Marx responded to Proudhon's ''The System of Economic Contradictions, or The Philosophy of Poverty'' with the provocatively titled ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]''. The dispute became one of the sources of the split between the anarchist and [[Marxism|Marxist]] wings of the [[International Working Men's Association]]. Some such as [[Edmund Wilson]] have contended that Marx's attack on Proudhon had its origin in the latter's defense of [[Karl Gr\u00fcn]], whom Marx bitterly disliked, but who had been preparing translations of Proudhon's work.\n\nProudhon favored [[Workers' council|workers' associations]] or [[co-operatives]] as well as individual worker/peasant possession over private ownership or the [[nationalization]] of land and workplaces. He considered [[social revolution]] to be achievable in a peaceful manner. In ''The Confessions of a Revolutionary'', Proudhon asserted that \"Anarchy is Order Without Power\", the phrase which much later inspired in the view of some the anarchist [[Circle-A|circled-A]] symbol, today \"one of the most common graffiti on the urban landscape\".<ref>Marshall, Peter.

His mother Catherine Simonin was from Cordiron.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p1\"/> Claude-Fran\u00e7ois and Catherine had five boys together, two of whom died at a very young age. Proudhon's brothers Jean-Etienne and Claude were born in 1811 and 1816 respectively and both maintained a very close relationship with Proudhon.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p3\"/>\n\nAs a boy, he mostly worked in the family tavern, helped with basic agricultural work and spent time playing outdoors in the countryside. Proudhon received no formal education as a child, but he was taught to read by his mother, who had him spelling words by age three. However, the only books that Proudhon was exposed to until he was 10 were the [[Gospel]]s and the [[The Four Sons of Aymon|Four Aymon Brothers]] and some local [[almanacs]]. In 1820, Proudhon's mother began trying to get him admitted into the city college in Besan\u00e7on. The family was far too poor to afford the tuition, but with the help of one of Claude-Fran\u00e7ois' former employers she managed to gain a bursary which deducted 120 francs a year from the cost. Proudhon was unable to afford books (or even shoes) to attend school which caused him great difficulties and often made him the object of scorn by his wealthier classmates. In spite of this, Proudhon showed a strong will to learn and spent much time in the school library with a pile of books, exploring a variety of subjects in his free time outside of class.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp5-6\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5 5\u20136]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/5}}</ref>\n\n=== Entrance into the printing trade ===\nIn 1827, Proudhon began an apprenticeship at a printing press in the house of Bellevaux in Battant. On Easter of the following year, he transferred to a press in Besan\u00e7on owned by the family of one of his schoolmates, Antoine Gauthier.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p9\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9 9]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/9}}</ref> Besan\u00e7on was an important center of religious thought at the time and most of the works published at Gauthier were [[ecclesiastical]] works. During the course of his work, Proudhon spent hours every day reading this Christian literature and began to question many of his long held religious beliefs which eventually led him to reject Christianity altogether.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp11-12\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11 11\u201312]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/11}}</ref>\n\nOver the years, Proudhon rose to be a corrector for the press, [[proofreading]] their publications. By 1829, he began to become more interested in social issues than religious theory. Of particular importance during this period was his encounter with [[Charles Fourier]], who in 1829 came to Gauthier as a customer seeking to publish his work ''Le Nouveau Monde Industriel et Soci\u00e9taire''. Proudhon supervised the printing of the book, which gave him ample opportunity to talk with Fourier about a variety of social and philosophical issues. These discussions left a strong impression on Proudhon and influenced him throughout his life.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p13\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13 13]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/13}}</ref> It was also during this time that Proudhon formed one of his closest friendships with [[Gustave Fallot]], a scholar from Monteb\u00e9liard who came from a family of wealthy French industrialists. Impressed by Proudhon's corrections of one of his Latin manuscripts, Fallot sought out his friendship and the two were soon regularly spending their evenings together discussing French literature by [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Rabelais]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Voltaire]], [[Denis Diderot]] and many other authors to whom Proudhon had not been exposed during his years of theological readings.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp14-15\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14 14\u201315]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/14}}</ref>\n\n=== Decision to pursue philosophy and writing ===\nIn September 1830, Proudhon became certified as a [[journeyman]] compositor.

Proudhon began mingling amongst the circle of metropolitan scholars surrounding Fallot, but he felt out of place and uncomfortable amidst people who were both wealthier and more accustomed to scholarly debate. Ultimately, Proudhon found that he preferred to spend the majority of his time studying alone and was not fond of urban life, longing to return home to Besan\u00e7on.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-p17\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|page=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/17 17]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/17}}</ref> The [[cholera]] outbreak in Paris granted him his wish as Fallot was struck with the illness, making him unable to financially support Proudhon any longer.

He applied for the [[Suard Pension]], a bursary that would enable him to study at the Academy of Besan\u00e7on. Proudhon was selected out of several candidates primarily due to the fact that his income was much lower than the others and the judges were extremely impressed by his writing and the level of education he had given himself while working as an artisan. Proudhon arrived in Paris towards the end of autumn in 1838.<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp28-30\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/28 28\u201330]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/28}}</ref>\n\n=== Early writings ===\nIn 1839, the Academy of Besan\u00e7on held an essay competition on the subject of the utility of the celebration of Sunday in regard to hygiene, morality and the relationship of the family and the city. Proudhon's entry, titled ''De la C\u00e9l\u00e9bration du dimanche'', essentially used the essay subject as a pretext for discussing a variety of political and philosophical ideas and in it one can find the seeds of his later revolutionary ideas. Many of his ideas on authority, morality and property disturbed the essay judges at the Academy and Proudhon was only awarded the bronze medal (something in which Proudhon took pride because he felt that this was an indicator that his writing made elite academics uncomfortable).<ref name=\"Woodcock-1972-pp39-42\">{{cite book|author=Woodcock, George|title=Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: His Life and Work|publisher=Schocken Books|year=1972|isbn=0-8052-0372-9|pages=[https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39 39\u201342]|url=https://archive.org/details/pierrejosephprou00wood/page/39}}</ref> In 1840, he published his first work ''Qu'est-ce que la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (or ''[[What Is Property]]'').\n\nHis third memoir on property was a letter to the [[Fourierist]] writer [[Consid\u00e9rant]], published in 1842 under the title ''Warning to Proprietors''.<ref>See [[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon#Bibliography|bibliography]] below.</ref> Proudhon was tried for it at Besan\u00e7on, but he was acquitted when the jury found that they could not condemn him for a philosophy that they themselves could not understand.<ref name=\"Britannica\">[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Pierre-Joseph-Proudhon \"Pierre-Joseph Proudhon\"].

Afterwards, he became connected as a kind of manager with a commercial firm in [[Lyon]], France. In 1847, he left this job and finally settled in Paris, where he was now becoming celebrated as a leader of innovation. In this year, he also became a [[Freemason]].<ref>Henri du Bac. '' The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon ''. New York: Sheed and Ward, 1848. p. 9.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution of 1848 ===\n[[File:Proudhon-children.jpg|thumb|Proudhon and his children by Gustave Courbet, 1865]]\nProudhon was surprised by the [[Revolutions of 1848 in France]]. He participated in the February uprising and the composition of what he termed \"the first republican proclamation\" of the new republic, but he had misgivings about the new provisional government headed by [[Jacques-Charles Dupont de l'Eure]] (1767\u20131855), who since the [[French Revolution]] in 1789 had been a longstanding politician, although often in the opposition. Beside Dupont de l'Eure, the provisional government was dominated by [[Liberalism and radicalism in France|liberals]] such as [[Alphonse de Lamartine]] (Foreign Affairs), [[Alexandre Auguste Ledryeet-Rollin]] (Interior), [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux]] (Justice) and [[Auguste Burdeau]] (War) because it was pursuing political reform at the expense of the socio-economic reform, which Proudhon considered basic. As during the 1830 [[July Revolution]], the Republican-Socialist Party had set up a counter-government in the [[H\u00f4tel de Ville, Paris|Hotel de Ville]], including [[Louis Blanc]], [[Armand Marrast]], [[Ferdinand Flocon]] and [[Alexandre Martin]].\n\nProudhon published his own perspective for reform which was completed in 1849<!-- which month? -->, ''Solution du probl\u00e8me social'' (''[[Solution of the Social Problem]]''), in which he laid out a program of mutual financial cooperation among workers. He believed this would transfer control of economic relations from [[capitalists]] and [[financiers]] to workers. The central part of his plan was the establishment of a bank to provide credit at a very low rate of interest and the issuing of exchange notes that would circulate instead of money based on gold.\n\nDuring the [[Second French Republic]] (1848\u20131852), Proudhon had his biggest public effect through journalism. He got involved with four newspapers, namely ''Le Repr\u00e9sentant du Peuple'' (February 1848\u2013August 1848), ''Le Peuple'' (September 1848\u2013June 1849), ''La Voix du Peuple'' (September 1849\u2013May 1850) and ''Le Peuple de 1850'' (June 1850\u2013October 1850). His polemical writing style, combined with his perception of himself as a political outsider, produced a cynical combative journalism that appealed to many French workers, but alienated others. He repeatedly criticised the government's policies and promoted reformation of credit and exchange. He tried to establish a popular bank (''Banque du peuple'') early in 1849, but despite over 13,000 people signing up (mostly workers) receipts were limited falling short of 18,000FF and the whole enterprise was essentially stillborn.{{clarify|date=November 2012}}\n\nProudhon ran for the [[1848 French Constituent Assembly election|Constituent Assembly]] in April 1848, but he was not elected although his name appeared on the ballots in Paris, Lyon, Besan\u00e7on and Lille. He was successful, in the complementary elections of 4 June 1848 and served as a deputy during the debates over the [[National Workshops]], created by the 25 February 1848 decree passed by Republican [[Louis Blanc]]. The workshops were to give work to the unemployed. Proudhon was never enthusiastic about such workshops, perceiving them to be essentially charitable institutions that did not resolve the problems of the economic system. However, he was against their elimination unless an alternative could be found for the workers who relied on the workshops for subsistence.\n\nIn 1848, the closing of the National Workshops provoked the [[June Days uprising]] and the violence shocked Proudhon. Visiting the barricades personally, he later reflected that his presence at the [[Bastille]] at this time was \"one of the most honorable acts of my life\", but in general during the tumultuous events of 1848 he opposed [[insurrection]] by preaching peaceful conciliation, a stance that was in accord with his lifelong stance against violence. Proudhon disapproved of the revolts and demonstrations of February, May and June 1848, though he was sympathetic to the social and psychological injustices that the insurrectionists had been forced to endure.\n\nIn Spain, Ram\u00f3n de la Sagra established the anarchist journal ''El Porvenir'' in La Coru\u00f1a in 1845 which was inspired by Proudhon's ideas.<ref name=\"britannica.com\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/anarchism|title=anarchism &#124; Definition & History|website=Encyclopedia Britannica}}</ref> Catalan politician [[Francesc Pi i Margall]] became the principal translator of Proudhon's works into Spanish<ref>[[George Woodcock]].

According to [[George Woodcock]], \"[t]hese translations were to have a profound and lasting effect on the development of Spanish anarchism after 1870, but before that time Proudhonian ideas, as interpreted by Pi, already provided much of the inspiration for the federalist movement which sprang up in the early 1860's\".<ref>George Woodcock.

In a subchapter called \"What is Government?\", he wrote:\n{{quote|To be GOVERNED is to be watched, inspected, spied upon, directed, law-driven, numbered, regulated, enrolled, indoctrinated, preached at, controlled, checked, estimated, valued, censured, commanded, by creatures who have neither the right nor the wisdom nor the virtue to do so. To be GOVERNED is to be at every operation, at every transaction noted, registered, counted, taxed, stamped, measured, numbered, assessed, licensed, authorized, admonished, prevented, forbidden, reformed, corrected, punished.

Proudhon, \"What Is Government?\", written in ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', translated by John Beverly Robinson (London: [[Freedom Press]], 1923), pp. 293\u201394.</ref>}}\n\n=== Mutualism ===\n{{see also|Mutualism (economic theory)}}\n{{quote|\"Capital\"&nbsp;... in the political field is analogous to \"government\".&nbsp;... The economic idea of capitalism, the politics of government or of authority, and the theological idea of the Church are three identical ideas, linked in various ways. To attack one of them is equivalent to attacking all of them.&nbsp;... What capital does to labour, and the State to liberty, the Church does to the spirit. This trinity of absolutism is as baneful in practice as it is in philosophy. The most effective means for oppressing the people would be simultaneously to enslave its body, its will and its reason.<ref>P.-J. Proudhon, ''Les confessions d'un r\u00e9volutionnaire'', (Paris: Garnier, 1851), p. 271., quoted by Max Nettlau, ''A Short History of Anarchism'', pp. 43\u201344.</ref>}}\nIn his earliest works, Proudhon analyzed the nature and problems of the capitalist economy. While deeply critical of [[capitalism]], he also objected to those contemporary socialists who advocated centralized hierarchical forms of association or state control of the economy. In a sequence of commentaries from ''[[What Is Property?]]'' (1840), posthumously published in the ''Th\u00e9orie de la propri\u00e9t\u00e9'' (''Theory of Property'', 1863\u20131864), he declared in turn that \"property is theft\", \"property is impossible\", \"property is despotism\" and \"property is freedom\". When he said \"property is theft\", he was referring to the landowner or capitalist who he believed \"stole\" the profits from laborers. For Proudhon, the capitalist's employee was \"subordinated, exploited: his permanent condition is one of obedience\".<ref>[http://fair-use.org/p-j-proudhon/general-idea-of-the-revolution/organization-of-economic-forces#s3p5 ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'' (1851), Sixth Study, \u00a7 3 \u00b6 5].</ref>\n\nIn asserting that property is freedom, he was referring not only to the product of an individual's labor, but to the peasant or artisan's home and tools of his trade and the income he received by selling his goods. For Proudhon, the only legitimate source of property is labor. What one produces is one's property and anything beyond that is not. He advocated worker self-management and was opposed to the private ownership of the means of production. As he put it in 1848:\n{{quote|Under the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour, so cannot become a cause of inequality.&nbsp;... We are socialists&nbsp;... under universal association, ownership of the land and of the instruments of labour is ''social'' ownership.&nbsp;... We want the mines, canals, railways handed over to democratically organised workers' associations.&nbsp;... We want these associations to be models for agriculture, industry and trade, the pioneering core of that vast federation of companies and societies, joined together in the common bond of the democratic and social Republic.<ref>Proudhon, Pierre-Joseph. 'Oeuvres Compl\u00e8tes' (Lacroix edition), volume 17, pp. 188\u2013189.</ref>}}\n\nProudhon called himself a [[socialist]], but he opposed state ownership of capital goods in favour of ownership by workers themselves in associations. This makes him one of the first theorists of [[libertarian socialism]]. Proudhon was one of the main influences on the theory of [[workers' self-management]] (''autogestion'') in the late 19th and 20th century.\n\nProudhon strenuously rejected the ownership of the products of labor by society or the state, arguing in ''What Is Property?'' that while \"property in product&nbsp;... does not carry with it property in the means of production.<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 109.</ref>&nbsp;... The right to product is exclusive&nbsp;... the right to means is common\" and applied this to the land (\"the land is&nbsp;... a common thing\")<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 92.</ref> and workplaces (\"all accumulated capital being social property, no one can be its exclusive proprietor\").<ref>P.-J Proudhon, ''What Is Property?'' (Dover, 1970), p. 120.</ref> He argued that while society owned the means of production or land, users would control and run them (under supervision from society) with the \"organising of regulating societies\" in order to \"regulate the market\".<ref>Proudhon, ''Selected Writings'', p. 70.</ref>\n\n[[File:Proudhon-Grab.JPG|thumb|Proudhon's grave in Paris]]\nThis use-ownership he called \"possession\" and this economic system [[Mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]]. Proudhon had many arguments against entitlement to land and capital, including reasons based on morality, economics, politics and individual liberty. One such argument was that it enabled profit, which in turn led to social instability and war by creating cycles of debt that eventually overcame the capacity of labor to pay them off. Another was that it produced \"despotism\" and turned workers into wage workers subject to the authority of a boss.\n\nIn ''What Is Property?'', Proudhon wrote:\n{{quote|Property, acting by exclusion and encroachment, while population was increasing, has been the life-principle and definitive cause of all revolutions. Religious wars, and wars of conquest, when they have stopped short of the extermination of races, have been only accidental disturbances, soon repaired by the mathematical progression of the life of nations. The downfall and death of societies are due to the power of accumulation possessed by property.}}\n\nTowards the end of his life, Proudhon modified some of his earlier views. In ''The Principle of Federation'' (1863), he modified his earlier anti-state position, arguing for \"the balancing of authority by liberty\" and put forward a decentralised \"theory of federal government\". He also defined anarchy differently as \"the government of each by himself\", which meant \"that political functions have been reduced to industrial functions, and that social order arises from nothing but transactions and exchanges\". This work also saw him call his economic system an \"agro-industrial federation\", arguing that it would provide \"specific federal arrangements&nbsp;... to protect the citizens of the federated states from capitalist and financial feudalism, both within them and from the outside\" and so stop the re-introduction of \"wage labour\". This was because \"political right requires to be buttressed by economic right\".\n\nIn the posthumously published ''Theory of Property'', he argued that \"property is the only power that can act as a counterweight to the State\". Hence, \"Proudhon could retain the idea of property as theft, and at the same time offer a new definition of it as liberty. There is the constant possibility of abuse, exploitation, which spells theft. At the same time property is a spontaneous creation of society and a bulwark against the ever-encroaching power of the State\".<ref>Copleston, Frederick. ''Social Philosophy in France'', A History of Philosophy, Volume IX, Image/Doubleday, 1994, p. 67.</ref>\n\nHe continued to oppose both capitalist and state property. In ''Theory of Property'', he maintains: \"Now in 1840, I categorically rejected the notion of property for both the group and the individual\", but then states his new theory of property that \"property is the greatest revolutionary force which exists, with an unequaled capacity for setting itself against authority\" and the \"principal function of private property within the political system will be to act as a counterweight to the power of the State, and by so doing to insure the liberty of the individual\". However, he continued to oppose concentrations of wealth and property, arguing for small-scale property ownership associated with peasants and artisans. He still opposed private property in land: \"What I cannot accept, regarding land, is that the work put in gives a right to ownership of what has been worked on\". In addition, he still believed that \"property\" should be more equally distributed and limited in size to that actually used by individuals, families and workers associations.<ref>Proudhon, ''Theory of Property'' in ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon''  pp. 129, 133, 135\u2013136.</ref> He supported the right of inheritance and defended \"as one of the foundations of the family and society\".<ref>Steward Edwards, Introduction to ''Selected Writings of P.J. Proudhon''.</ref> However, he refused to extend this beyond personal possessions, arguing that \"[u]nder the law of association, transmission of wealth does not apply to the instruments of labour\".<ref>In [[Daniel Gu\u00e9rin]] (ed.), ''No Gods, No Masters'', vol. 1, p. 62.</ref>\n\nAs a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and communism. He adopted the term [[mutualism (economic theory)|mutualism]] for his brand of anarchism, which involved control of the means of production by the workers. In his vision, self-employed artisans, peasants and cooperatives would trade their products on the market. For Proudhon, factories and other large workplaces would be run by \"labor associations\" operating on directly democratic principles. The state would be abolished and instead society would be organized by a federation of \"free communes\" (a [[Communes of France|commune]] is a local municipality in French). In 1863, Proudhon said: \"All my economic ideas as developed over twenty-five years can be summed up in the words: agricultural-industrial federation. All my political ideas boil down to a similar formula: political federation or decentralization\".<ref>Du principe F\u00e9d\u00e9ratif [Principle of Federation] (1863)</ref>\n\nProudhon opposed the charging of interest and rent, but he did not seek to abolish them by law: \"I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose\".<ref>''Proudhon's Solution of the Social Problem'', Edited by Henry Cohen. [[Vanguard Press]], 1927.</ref>\n\n=== Revolution ===\nProudhon was a revolutionary. However, his revolution did not mean violent upheaval or civil war, but rather the transformation of society. This transformation was essentially moral in nature and demanded the highest ethics from those who sought change. It was monetary reform, combined with organising a credit bank and workers associations, that Proudhon proposed to use as a lever to bring about the organization of society along new lines{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}.\n\n{{Libertarian socialism sidebar|People}}\n\n=== Karl Marx ===\nHe made no public criticisms of [[Karl Marx]] or Marxism because in Proudhon's lifetime Marx was relatively unknown. It was only after Proudhon's death that Marxism became a large movement. However, he did criticize [[Authoritarian socialism|authoritarian socialists]] of his period. This included the [[state socialist]] [[Louis Blanc]], of whom Proudhon said: \"Let me say to M. Blanc: you desire neither Catholicism nor monarchy nor nobility, but you must have a God, a religion, a dictatorship, a censorship, a hierarchy, distinctions, and ranks. For my part, I deny your God, your authority, your sovereignty, your judicial State, and all your representative mystifications\". It was Proudhon's book ''What Is Property?'' that convinced the young Marx that [[private property]] should be abolished.\n\nIn one of his first works, ''[[The Holy Family (book)|The Holy Family]]'', Marx said: \"Not only does Proudhon write in the interest of the [[proletarian]]s, he is himself a proletarian, an ouvrier. His work is a scientific manifesto of the French proletariat\". However, Marx disagreed with Proudhon's anarchism and later published vicious criticisms of Proudhon. Marx wrote ''[[The Poverty of Philosophy]]'' as a refutation of Proudhon's ''The Philosophy of Poverty''.\n\nIn their letters, Proudhon expressed disagreement with Marx's views on revolution: \"I believe we have no need of it in order to succeed; and that consequently we should not put forward revolutionary action as a means of social reform, because that pretended means would simply be an appeal to force, to arbitrariness, in brief, a contradiction\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/economics/proudhon/letters/46_05_17.htm|title=Proudhon to Karl Marx|website=www.marxists.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Nationalism, militarism and war ===\nProudhon opposed militarism, dictatorship and war, arguing that the \"end of militarism is the mission of the nineteenth century, under pain of indefinite decadence\"<ref>quoted by George Woodcock, ''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 233</ref> and that the \"workers alone are capable of putting an end to war by creating [[economic equilibrium]]. This presupposes a radical revolution in ideas and morals\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 214</ref> As Robert L. Hoffman notes, ''War and Peace'' \"ends by condemning war without reservation\" and its \"conclusion [is] that war is obsolete\".<ref>''Revolutionary Justice'', pp. 210\u2013211.</ref> Marxist philosopher John Ehrenberg summarized Proudhon's position as such:\n<blockquote>If injustice was the cause of war, it followed that conflict could not be eliminated until society was reorganised along egalitarian lines. Proudhon had wanted to prove that the reign of political economy would be the reign of peace, finding it difficult to believe that people really thought he was defending militarism.<ref>''Proudhon and His Age'', p. 145.</ref></blockquote>\n\nProudhon argued that under mutualism \"[t]here will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right\".<ref>''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. 283.</ref>\n\nProudhon also rejected dictatorship, stating in the 1860s that \"what I will always be&nbsp;... a republican, a democrat even, and a socialist into the bargain\".<ref>''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', p. 201.</ref> Henri de Lubac argued that in terms of Proudhon's critique of democracy \"we must not allow all this to hoodwink us. His invectives against democracy were not those of a counter-revolutionary. They were aimed at what he himself called 'the false democracy'.&nbsp;... They attacked an apparently liberal 'pseudo-democracy' which 'was not economic and social'&nbsp;... 'a Jacobinical democracy'\". Proudhon \"did not want to destroy, but complete, the work of 1789\" and while \"he had a grudge against the 'old democracy', the democracy of Robespierre and Marat\", he repeatedly contrasted it \"with a 'young democracy', which was a 'social democracy'\".<ref>''The Un-Marxian Socialist: A Study of Proudhon'', pp. 28\u201329.</ref>\n\nAccording to historian of anarchism [[George Woodcock]], some positions Proudhon took \"sorted oddly with his avowed anarchism\". Woodcock cited for example Proudhon's proposition that each citizen perform one or two years militia service.<ref>George Woodcock ''[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon: A Biography]]'', Black Rose Books, 1987, p. 128.</ref> The proposal appeared in the ''Programme Revolutionaire'', an electoral manifesto issued by Proudhon after he was asked to run for a position in the provisional government. The text reads: \"7\u00b0 'L'arm\u00e9e. \u2013 Abolition imm\u00e9diate de la conscription et des remplacements; obligation pour tout citoyen de faire, pendant un ou deux ans, le service militaire; application de l'arm\u00e9e aux services administratifs et travaux d'utilit\u00e9 publique\" (\"Military service by all citizens is proposed as an alternative to conscription and the practice of \"replacement\", by which those who could avoided such service\"). In the same document, Proudhon also described the \"form of government\" he was proposing as \"a centralization analogous with that of the State, but in which no one obeys, no one is dependent, and everyone is free and sovereign\".<ref>\"Programme r\u00e9volutionnaire.\" ''M\u00e9langes. Tome I''. Paris: Lacroix, 1868. 72, 70.</ref>\n\n== Controversy ==\nIn addition to being considered a founding father of anarchism, some have tried to link him to the extreme right. He was first used as a reference in the ''[[Cercle Proudhon]]'', a right-wing association formed in 1911 by [[Georges Valois]] and [[Edouard Berth]]. Both had been brought together by the [[syndicalist]] [[Georges Sorel]], but they would tend toward a synthesis of [[socialism]] and [[nationalism]], mixing Proudhon's mutualism with [[Charles Maurras]]' [[integralist nationalism]]. In 1925, Georges Valois founded the [[Faisceau]], the first fascist league, which took its name from [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]]'s ''[[fasci]]''. Historian of [[History of far-right movements in France|fascism, in particular of French fascists]], [[Zeev Sternhell]], has noted this use of Proudhon by the far-right. In ''The Birth of Fascist Ideology'', he states:\n{{quote|[T]he [[Action Fran\u00e7aise]]&nbsp;... from its inception regarded the author of ''La philosophie de la mis\u00e8re'' as one of its masters.<ref>Griffiths, Richard. 2005. Continuum International Publishing Group. pp. 23\u201324.</ref> He was given a place of honour in the weekly section of the journal of the movement entitled, precisely, 'Our Masters.' Proudhon owed this place in L'Action fran\u00e7aise to what the Maurrassians saw as his antirepublicanism, his anti-Semitism, his loathing of Rousseau, his disdain for the French Revolution, democracy, and parliamentarianism: and his championship of the nation, the family, tradition, and the monarchy.}}\n\nHowever, K. Steven Vincent states that \"to argue that Proudhon was a proto-fascist suggests that one has never looked seriously at Proudhon's writings\".<ref>''Pierre-Joseph Proudhon and the Rise of French Republican Socialism'', p. 234.</ref>\n\n[[J. Salwyn Schapiro]] argued in 1945 that Proudhon was a racist, \"a glorifier of war for its own sake\" and his \"advocacy of personal dictatorship and his laudation of militarism can hardly be equalled in the reactionary writings of his or of our day\".<ref name=\"Schapiro\">{{cite journal|author=[[J.

Robert Graham states that while Proudhon was personally racist, \"anti-semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme\".<ref>\"Introduction\", ''General Idea of the Revolution in the Nineteenth Century'', p. xxxvi.</ref>\n\n[[Albert Meltzer]] has said that though Proudhon used the term \"anarchist\", he was not one and that he never engaged in \"anarchist activity or struggle\", but rather in \"parliamentary activity\".<ref>Albert Meltzer. Anarchism: Arguments for and Against, AK Press, 2000, p. 12.</ref>\n\nProudhon also engaged in an exchange of published letters between 1849 and 1850 with [[Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat]] discussing the legitimacy of interest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://praxeology.net/FB-PJP-DOI.htm|title=Bastiat-Proudhon Debate on Interest|publisher=Praxeology.net|accessdate=2 December 2008}}</ref> As [[Robert Leroux (sociologist)|Robert Leroux]] argued, Bastiat had the conviction that Proudhon's anti-interest doctrine \"was the complete antithesis of any serious approach\".<ref>Leroux, Robert. \"Political Economy and Liberalism: The Economic Contribution of Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Bastiat\", Routledge, 2011, p. 118.</ref> Proudhon famously lost his temper and declared to Bastiat: \"Your intelligence is asleep, or rather it has never been awake. You are a man for whom logic does not exist. You do not hear anything, you do not understand anything. You are without philosophy, without science, without humanity. Your ability to reason, like your ability to pay attention and make comparisons is zero. Scientifically, Mr. Bastiat, you are a dead man\".<ref>Roche, Charles George. \"Frederic Bastiat: A Man Alone\". Arlington House, 1971, p. 153.</ref>\n\n=== Antisemitism and sexism ===\nStewart Edwards, the editor of the ''Selected Writings of Pierre-Joseph Proudhon'', remarks: \"Proudhon's diaries (Carnets, ed. P. Haubtmann, Marcel Rivi\u00e8re, Paris 1960 to date) reveal that he had almost paranoid feelings of hatred against the Jews. In 1847, he considered publishing an article [[anti-Semitism|against the Jewish race]], which he said he \"hated\". The proposed article would have \"called for the expulsion of the Jews from France\". It would have stated: \"The Jew is the enemy of the human race. This race must be sent back to Asia, or exterminated. [[Heinrich Heine|H. Heine]], A. Weil, and others are simply secret spies; [[Rothschild family|Rothschild]], [[Adolphe Cr\u00e9mieux|Cr\u00e9mieux]], [[Marx]], [[Fould]], evil choleric, envious, bitter men who hate us\".

London: SCM. p. 71.</ref>\n\nIn an introduction to Proudhon's works, Iain McKay, author of ''[[An Anarchist FAQ]]'' (AK Press, 2007), cautions readers by saying that \"[t]his is not to say that Proudhon was without flaws, for he had many\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|title=Archived copy|accessdate=30 January 2012|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128135116/http://www.akpress.org/2007/items/ananarchistfaqakpress|archivedate=28 January 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://anarchism.pageabode.com/afaq/index.html|title=An Anarchist FAQ &#124; Anarchist Writers|website=anarchism.pageabode.com}}</ref> and adding the following:\n{{quote|He was not consistently libertarian in his ideas, tactics and language. His personal bigotries are disgusting and few modern anarchists would tolerate them \u2013 Namely, racism and sexism. He made some bad decisions and occasionally ranted in his private notebooks (where the worst of his anti-Semitism was expressed). While he did place his defence of the patriarchal family at the core of his ideas, they are in direct contradiction to his own libertarian and egalitarian ideas. In terms of racism, he sometimes reflected the less-than-enlightened assumptions and prejudices of the nineteenth century. While this does appear in his public work, such outbursts are both rare and asides (usually an extremely infrequent passing anti-Semitic remark or caricature). In short, \"racism was never the basis of Proudhon's political thinking\" (Gemie, 200-1) and \"anti-Semitism formed no part of Proudhon's revolutionary programme.\" (Robert Graham, \"Introduction\", General Idea of the Revolution, xxxvi) To quote Proudhon: \"There will no longer be nationality, no longer fatherland, in the political sense of the words: they will mean only places of birth. Man, of whatever race or colour he may be, is an inhabitant of the universe; citizenship is everywhere an acquired right.\" (General Idea of the Revolution, 283)<ref>Iain McKay (2011). ''Property Is Theft! A Pierre-Joseph Proudhon Anthology''. AK Press UK: Edinburgh. p. 36.</ref>}}\n\nWhile racism was not overtly part of his political philosophy, Proudhon did express [[sexist]] beliefs. He held patriarchal views on women's nature and their proper role in the family and society at large. In his ''Carnets'' (''Notebooks''), unpublished until the 1960s, Proudhon maintained that a woman's choice was to be \"courtesan or housekeeper\". To a woman, a man is \"a father, a chief, a master: above all, a master\". His justification for [[patriarchy]] is men's greater physical strength and recommended that men use this greater strength to keep women in their place, saying: \"A woman does not at all hate being used with violence, indeed even being violated\". In her study of [[Gustave Courbet]], who painted the portrait of ''Proudhon and his children'' (1865), art historian Linda Nochlin points out that alongside his early articulations of anarchism Proudhon also wrote and published \"the most consistent [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]] tract of its time, or perhaps, any other\", ''La Pornocratie ou les femmes dans les temps modernes'', which \"raises all the main issues about woman's position in society and her sexuality with a paranoid intensity unmatched in any other text\".<ref>Nochlin, ''Courbet''. Thames & Hudson, 2007. p. 220, note 34).</ref>\n\nProudhon's defenses of patriarchy did not go unchallenged in his lifetime and [[Joseph D\u00e9jacque]] attacked Proudhon's anti-feminism as a contradiction of anarchist principles. D\u00e9jacque directed Proudhon \"either to 'speak out against man's exploitation of woman' or 'do not describe yourself as an anarchist'\".<ref>Jesse Cohn [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405184649_yr2012_chunk_g978140518464962#citation \"Anarchism and gender\"] in: The International Encyclopedia of Revolution and Protest.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

In 1863 and 1864 it was temporarily known as the Mounted Infantry, 123rd Regiment as part of Wilder's Lightning Brigade.\n\n==Service==\nThis regiment was organized at Camp Terry, [[Mattoon, Illinois|Mattoon]], [[Coles County]], [[Illinois]], by Colonel James Monroe, who at the time was major of the [[7th Illinois Volunteer Regiment|7th Illinois Infantry]].<ref name=\"Reece\">Reece</ref> Companies A, C, D, H, I and K were from Coles County; B from [[Cumberland County, Illinois|Cumberland]]; E from [[Clark County, Illinois|Clark]]; F and G from Clark and [[Crawford County, Illinois|Crawford]]. As a colonel in 1861, [[Ulysses S. Grant]] organized his first command, the [[21st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment]], in Mattoon.\n\nIt was mustered into service on September 6, 1862, with James Monroe as Colonel, Jonathan Biggs, of Westfield, Clark County, as Lieutenant Colonel, and James A. Connolly, of [[Charleston, Illinois]], as Major. On 19 September 1862, the Regiment was loaded into freight cars at Mattoon, and transported to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], where it was at once put to work, under Major General [[William \"Bull\" Nelson]], to fortify the city against Confederate General [[Braxton Bragg]], who was then advancing on it in pursuit of Union General [[Don Carlos Buell]].\n\nOn October 1, having been assigned to the Thirty-third Brigade (General [[William R. Terrill]]), Fourth Division (General [[James S. Jackson]]), in [[Alexander McDowell McCook|McCook's Corps]], the regiment started on the march under Buell, southward through Kentucky, after Bragg, who had turned back, and up to this time the regiment never had battalion drill, and hardly an attempt at company drill, as all the officers, except the colonel, were \"raw recruits\".\n\nJust 19 days after leaving Mattoon, the regiment engaged in the [[Battle of Perryville]], where 36 men were killed in action and 180 wounded.<ref name=\"Jared\">Jared </ref> Generals Terrill and Jackson were both killed immediately behind and within twenty feet of the line of the regiment. Among the wounded were Captain Coblentz of Company E, First Lieutenant S. M. Shepard of Company A and Adjutant Leander H. Hamlin. Following the devastating bloodshed the 123rd was assigned to protect the railroad bridge across the Green River at [[Munfordville]], [[Kentucky]], in November and December 1862. It has become known as the \"Battle for the Bridge,\" which began when the Union garrison led by [[John T. Wilder]], prior to his assuming command of the 123rd, surrendered during the [[Battle of Munfordville]].\n\nThe 123rd was initially assigned to the [[Army of the Ohio]] from September 1862 to November 1862, and then to the [[Army of the Cumberland]] from November 1862 to June 1865. The commanding general of the Army of the Cumberland was [[William Rosecrans]]. The regiment was in the 1st Brigade with Colonel Albert S. Hall, which was part of the 5th Division commanded by Brigadier General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]], reporting to Major General [[George Henry Thomas]]. \n\nIn February and March 1863, it was converted to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois' brigade became known as \"Wilder's [[Lightning Brigade (US Army of the Cumberland 1863)|Lightning Brigade]]\" commanded by [[John T. Wilder|Wilder]]. The brigade remained the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division, XIV Army Corps after its conversion. During this conversion, [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s, invented by [[Christopher Spencer]], were adopted as the command's primary weapon.<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer carbine at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref> The 123rd first used its new rifles in the [[Battle of Hoover's Gap]].<ref name=\"Repeaters\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>\n\n[[Image:Spencer-rifle transparent.png|thumb|left|300px|As part of the \"Wilder Lightning Brigade\" the 123rd was among the first units fighting in the Civil War to receive the [[Spencer repeating rifle]].]]\n\nThe new increase in firepower that the Spencer gave, allowed the 123rd and its brigade mates to maul numerically superior Confederate infantry and cavalry in several engagements. The regiment served quite well through the remainder of the [[Tullahoma campaign|Tullahoma Campaign]] and as part of the Lightning Brigade, was one of the few positive notes in the calamitous [[Chickamauga Campaign]]. \n\nDuring the [[Siege of Chattanooga]], the Lightning Brigade disbanded, and four of its regiments shifted to the Cavalry Corps where they served for the remainder of the war. The 123rd and the 72nd Indiana were sent to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division.\n\nDuring the [[Battle of Selma]], First Lieutenant O. J. McManus, Sergeants J. S. Mullen and Henry E. Cross, Corporal McMurry and Privates Daniel Cook, John Bowman, Marion White and Henry Woodruff were killed, with 50 wounded, including Lieutenant Colonel Biggs, Adjutant L. B. Bane, Captains W. E. Adams and Owen Wiley, Lieutenants Alex. McNutt and J. R. Harding.\n\nLate in the war, the regiment pursued Confederate General [[John Bell Hood]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |title=Battle Near Rome, Georgia, October 12, 1864 |access-date=2018-11-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707060209/http://www.16thconfederatecavalry.com/timelinebattles/rome.html |archive-date=2011-07-07 |url-status=dead }}</ref> The unit was instrumental in the capture of former Confederate capital [[Montgomery, Alabama]].\n\nIn June 1865 new recruits and some veterans were transferred to the [[61st Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|61st Regiment]] as the 123rd prepared to disband.<ref name=\"ILNG\">GlobalSecurity.org 1st Battalion, 123d Infantry</ref> Those who remained were mustered out June 27, 1865, by Captain L.

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and performed as a solo piece by McCartney. When discussing the song, McCartney has said that the lyrics were inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] in [[Rishikesh|Rishikesh, India]], and alternatively by the unfortunate state of [[race relations]] in the United States in the 1960s.\n\n==Origins==\n{{listen|filename=Johann Sebastian Bach - Suite BWV 996, E Minor - V Bourr\u00e9e.ogg|title= Lute Suite No. 1 \u2013 BWV 996, E Minor \u2013 V Bourr\u00e9e|description=Performed on a [[lautenwerck]] by [[Martha Goldstein]]|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=left}}\nMcCartney explained on ''[[Chaos and Creation at Abbey Road]]'', aired in 2005, that the guitar accompaniment for \"Blackbird\" was inspired by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]]'', a well-known lute piece, often played on the classical guitar. As teenagers, he and [[George Harrison]] tried to learn ''Bourr\u00e9e'' as a \"show off\" piece. The ''Bourr\u00e9e'' is distinguished by melody and bass notes played simultaneously on the upper and lower strings. McCartney adapted a segment of the ''Bourr\u00e9e'' (reharmonised into the original's [[relative major]] key of [[G major|G]]) as the opening of \"Blackbird\", and carried the musical idea throughout the song.\n\nThe first night his future wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] stayed at his home, McCartney played \"Blackbird\" for the fans camped outside his house.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} The [[fingerpicking]] technique that McCartney uses in the song was taught to him by folk singer [[Donovan]].\n\n==Meaning and interpretation==\nSince composing \"Blackbird\" in 1968, McCartney has given various statements regarding both his inspiration for the song and its meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/115751-re-meet-the-beatles-the-records-day-four-1968-1969/P1/ |title=The Records, Day Four: 1968\u20131969|date=11 November 2009|first=James|last=Flemming|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref> In one of these scenarios, he has said he was inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] one morning when the Beatles were studying [[Transcendental Meditation]] in [[The Beatles in India|Rishikesh, India]].{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} In another, he recalls writing it in Scotland as a response to racial tensions escalating in the United States during the spring of 1968.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=190}}\n\nIn May 2002, following a show in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], McCartney discussed the song with [[KCRW]] DJ [[Chris Douridas]], saying:\n\n<blockquote>I had been doing some [poetry readings] in the last year or so because I've got a poetry book out called ''Blackbird Singing'', and when I would read \"Blackbird\", I would always try and think of some explanation to tell the people \u2026 So, I was doing explanations, and I actually just remembered why I'd written \"Blackbird\", you know, that I'd been, I was in Scotland playing on my guitar, and I remembered this whole idea of \"you were only waiting for this moment to arise\" was about, you know, the black people's struggle in the southern states, and I was using the symbolism of a blackbird. It's not really about a blackbird whose wings are broken, you know, it's a bit more symbolic.<ref>Paul McCartney, Interview with KCRW's Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 episode of New Ground (17:50\u201319:00)</ref><ref>KCRW, \"New Ground\" with Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 (17:50\u201319:00), [http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/gz/gz020525paul_mccartney \"KCRW Archive\"], [http://www.kcrw.com/media-player/mediaPlayer2.html?type=audio&id=gz020525paul_mccartney \"Audio\"]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2018, McCartney further elaborated on the song's meaning, explaining that \"blackbird\" should be interpreted as \"black girl\",<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97_inloBmY Paul McCartney, Interview with GQ, Sept 2018 (16:35\u201317:17)]</ref> in the context of the civil rights troubles in southern 1960s US.\n\nA third scenario came from the recollection of his stepmother, Angie McCartney.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} She said that McCartney wrote it for her elderly mother, Edith Stopforth, who was staying at [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]]'s house while recovering from a long illness. Angie recalled that McCartney visited the house and sat at Edith's bedside, where Edith told him that she would listen to a bird singing at night.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}}\n\nThe lyrics have invited similarly varied interpretations \u2013 as a nature song, a message in support of the [[Black Power movement]], or a love song.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=317}} Writing in the 1990s, [[Ian MacDonald]] dismissed the idea that \"Blackbird\" was intended as \"a metaphor for the black civil rights struggle\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} Noting instead the composition's romantic qualities, MacDonald said that the early-morning bird song \"translates \u2026 into a succinct metaphor for awakening on a deeper level\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=256, 256fn}} However, during an informal rehearsal at EMI Studios on 22 November 1968, before he and Donovan took part in a [[Mary Hopkin]] recording session, McCartney played \"Blackbird\", telling Donovan that he wrote it after having \"read something in the paper about the riots\" and that he meant the black \"bird\" to symbolise a black woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VrcsjDUfGw#|title=Paul McCartney & Donovan \u2013 Postcard Sessions 1968|date=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlong with McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\", \"Blackbird\" was one of several White Album songs that [[Charles Manson]] interpreted as the Beatles' prophecy of an apocalyptic race war that would lead to him and his \"[[Manson Family|Family]]\" of followers ruling the US on countercultural principles. Manson interpreted the lyrics' repetition of the word \"rise\" as a call to black Americans to wage war on their white counterparts, and instructed his followers to commit a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969 to trigger such a conflict.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=489\u201390}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe song was recorded on 11 June 1968 at [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=255}} with [[George Martin]] as the [[record producer|producer]] and [[Geoff Emerick]] as the [[audio engineer]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}} It is a solo performance with McCartney playing a [[C. F. Martin & Company|Martin]] D 28 acoustic guitar. The track includes recordings of a male [[Common blackbird]] singing in the background.{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}}<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/lists/100-greatest-beatles-songs-20110919/blackbird-19691231|title=Blackbird|work=Rolling Stone}}</ref>\n\nOnly three sounds were recorded: McCartney's voice, his Martin D-28 acoustic guitar, and a tapping that keeps time on the left channel.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.songfacts.com/facts/the-beatles/blackbird|title=Blackbird by The Beatles - Songfacts|website=www.songfacts.com}}</ref> This tapping \"has been incorrectly identified as a [[metronome]] in the past\", according to engineer Geoff Emerick, who says it is actually the sound of Paul tapping his foot.

It was written by [[Paul McCartney]] and credited to [[Lennon\u2013McCartney]], and performed as a solo piece by McCartney. When discussing the song, McCartney has said that the lyrics were inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] in [[Rishikesh|Rishikesh, India]], and alternatively by the unfortunate state of [[race relations]] in the United States in the 1960s.\n\n==Origins==\n{{listen|filename=Johann Sebastian Bach - Suite BWV 996, E Minor - V Bourr\u00e9e.ogg|title= Lute Suite No. 1 \u2013 BWV 996, E Minor \u2013 V Bourr\u00e9e|description=Performed on a [[lautenwerck]] by [[Martha Goldstein]]|format=[[Ogg]]|pos=left}}\nMcCartney explained on ''[[Chaos and Creation at Abbey Road]]'', aired in 2005, that the guitar accompaniment for \"Blackbird\" was inspired by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]]'s ''[[Bourr\u00e9e in E minor]]'', a well-known lute piece, often played on the classical guitar. As teenagers, he and [[George Harrison]] tried to learn ''Bourr\u00e9e'' as a \"show off\" piece. The ''Bourr\u00e9e'' is distinguished by melody and bass notes played simultaneously on the upper and lower strings. McCartney adapted a segment of the ''Bourr\u00e9e'' (reharmonised into the original's [[relative major]] key of [[G major|G]]) as the opening of \"Blackbird\", and carried the musical idea throughout the song.\n\nThe first night his future wife [[Linda McCartney|Linda Eastman]] stayed at his home, McCartney played \"Blackbird\" for the fans camped outside his house.{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} The [[fingerpicking]] technique that McCartney uses in the song was taught to him by folk singer [[Donovan]].\n\n==Meaning and interpretation==\nSince composing \"Blackbird\" in 1968, McCartney has given various statements regarding both his inspiration for the song and its meaning.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.popmatters.com/feature/115751-re-meet-the-beatles-the-records-day-four-1968-1969/P1/ |title=The Records, Day Four: 1968\u20131969|date=11 November 2009|first=James|last=Flemming|publisher=[[PopMatters]]|accessdate=21 December 2015}}</ref> In one of these scenarios, he has said he was inspired by hearing the call of a [[Common blackbird|blackbird]] one morning when the Beatles were studying [[Transcendental Meditation]] in [[The Beatles in India|Rishikesh, India]].{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} In another, he recalls writing it in Scotland as a response to racial tensions escalating in the United States during the spring of 1968.{{sfn|Everett|1999|p=190}}\n\nIn May 2002, following a show in [[Dallas|Dallas, Texas]], McCartney discussed the song with [[KCRW]] DJ [[Chris Douridas]], saying:\n\n<blockquote>I had been doing some [poetry readings] in the last year or so because I've got a poetry book out called ''Blackbird Singing'', and when I would read \"Blackbird\", I would always try and think of some explanation to tell the people \u2026 So, I was doing explanations, and I actually just remembered why I'd written \"Blackbird\", you know, that I'd been, I was in Scotland playing on my guitar, and I remembered this whole idea of \"you were only waiting for this moment to arise\" was about, you know, the black people's struggle in the southern states, and I was using the symbolism of a blackbird. It's not really about a blackbird whose wings are broken, you know, it's a bit more symbolic.<ref>Paul McCartney, Interview with KCRW's Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 episode of New Ground (17:50\u201319:00)</ref><ref>KCRW, \"New Ground\" with Chris Douridas, 25 May 2002 (17:50\u201319:00), [http://www.kcrw.com/music/programs/gz/gz020525paul_mccartney \"KCRW Archive\"], [http://www.kcrw.com/media-player/mediaPlayer2.html?type=audio&id=gz020525paul_mccartney \"Audio\"]</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn 2018, McCartney further elaborated on the song's meaning, explaining that \"blackbird\" should be interpreted as \"black girl\",<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u97_inloBmY Paul McCartney, Interview with GQ, Sept 2018 (16:35\u201317:17)]</ref> in the context of the civil rights troubles in southern 1960s US.\n\nA third scenario came from the recollection of his stepmother, Angie McCartney.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}} She said that McCartney wrote it for her elderly mother, Edith Stopforth, who was staying at [[Jim and Mary McCartney|Jim McCartney]]'s house while recovering from a long illness. Angie recalled that McCartney visited the house and sat at Edith's bedside, where Edith told him that she would listen to a bird singing at night.{{sfn|Turner|1999|p=160}}\n\nThe lyrics have invited similarly varied interpretations \u2013 as a nature song, a message in support of the [[Black Power movement]], or a love song.{{sfn|Miles|2001|p=317}} Writing in the 1990s, [[Ian MacDonald]] dismissed the idea that \"Blackbird\" was intended as \"a metaphor for the black civil rights struggle\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=256fn}} Noting instead the composition's romantic qualities, MacDonald said that the early-morning bird song \"translates \u2026 into a succinct metaphor for awakening on a deeper level\".{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|pp=256, 256fn}} However, during an informal rehearsal at EMI Studios on 22 November 1968, before he and Donovan took part in a [[Mary Hopkin]] recording session, McCartney played \"Blackbird\", telling Donovan that he wrote it after having \"read something in the paper about the riots\" and that he meant the black \"bird\" to symbolise a black woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9VrcsjDUfGw#|title=Paul McCartney & Donovan \u2013 Postcard Sessions 1968|date=13 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAlong with McCartney's \"[[Helter Skelter (song)|Helter Skelter]]\", \"Blackbird\" was one of several White Album songs that [[Charles Manson]] interpreted as the Beatles' prophecy of an apocalyptic race war that would lead to him and his \"[[Manson Family|Family]]\" of followers ruling the US on countercultural principles. Manson interpreted the lyrics' repetition of the word \"rise\" as a call to black Americans to wage war on their white counterparts, and instructed his followers to commit a series of murders in Los Angeles in August 1969 to trigger such a conflict.{{sfn|Miles|1997|pp=489\u201390}}\n\n==Composition and recording==\nThe song was recorded on 11 June 1968 at [[EMI]]'s [[Abbey Road Studios]] in London,{{sfn|MacDonald|1998|p=255}} with [[George Martin]] as the [[record producer|producer]] and [[Geoff Emerick]] as the [[audio engineer]].{{sfn|Lewisohn|1988|p=137}} It is a solo performance with McCartney playing a [[C.

''Californium'' was developed as a tribute to science-fiction author [[Philip K. Dick]] on the 30th anniversary of his death. The player controls Elvin Green, a struggling writer dealing with family matters, as he discovers the means to manipulate reality, and explores several surreal landscapes.\n\n==Gameplay==\nAs an exploration game, the player can move Green around the current level, but has no direct means to interact with it. Several non-playable characters can be approached to initiate a one-side dialog with them. Through each level are several [[cathode-ray tube]] monitors that once discovered will present a Roman numeral value to the player. This represents the number of reality-warping points that must be found in the nearby area. These points are marked with a glowing \u0398 (Theta) glyph, but may require the player to look upon the point from a specific vantage point, to turn to look at the point from a specific direction, or to look near the point to eliminate objects in front of it to make it appear. When the glyph is hidden, objects nearby will flicker in and out of reality, allowing the player to recognize the glyph is nearby.<ref name=\"eurogamer review\"/> Once the glyph is found, the player interacts with their controllers to activate it. This causes a spherical bubble of a new reality to replace what had previously been there. Once all the glyphs for a section are found, the player is given some narrative for the game, and other sections of the level may be made available. Once all sections are completed in the same manner, the player must then find the right vantage point on the level to active a final large glyph that spans across many difference surfaces.<ref name=\"rps review\"/>\n\n==Plot==\nElvin Green is a struggling writer living in [[Berkeley, California]] in 1967. Following the death of his daughter Alice, and the departure of his wife Thea Trauberg, Green is struggling [[writer's block]], unable to come up with new material for a book; his publisher threatens to drop him, he's in danger of being evicted from his apartment, and his drug addiction is escalating, manifesting in short seizures. Green suddenly hears a voice in his head coming from the static on his television, telling him to seek out images of the Theta. In finding these, Green is able to alter his reality and slip into a new one.\n\nIn this next reality, Green is revered as the Patriot Writer, the most important writer of his generation - however, California is now the [[California Republic]], an authoritarian police state, and Green's wife Thea, an anti-state revolutionary has been captured and is planned to be executed; characters in this new reality, who are versions of their original selves, all suggest Green to collaborate with the state and bear witness against Thea. The voice, meanwhile, taunts Green that his success in this reality has come with a price, as Green explores and finds yet another reality.\n\nIn the third reality takes place on Mars, where Green is a Commander of a colony of [[cyborg]]s; Green was responsible for creating sentient [[android (robot)|android]]s, who eventually enslaved the remaining humanity as workforce. As he prepares for the opening of the museum in his name, colonists let Green know that his wife Thea, a human rebel, is planning to assassinate him at the museum's opening. Green's AI companion, Alice, in the meantime, encounters a technological anomaly, and becomes sentient, which terrifies her. The voice at this point begins to caution Green of exploring more realities, implying that venturing deeper may cause him to lose grip on his reality, but Green does so anyway.\n\nThe final reality Green finds is a scattered chaotic mash of the previous three realities; the voice at this point actively dissuades Green from venturing further, and there's a faint background sound of paramedics trying to revive a man - it is implied that Green is in fact encountering a drug-related emergency in the real world. Once Green reaches the top of the chaotic world and finds a giant Theta sigil, he appears in a dark void with a single desk and a typewriter. He then awakens in his original apartment and experiences another seizure, as he sits down in front of the static on the television again.\n\n==Development==\n''Californium'' was borne out of an idea between the development teams Darjeeling and Nova Productions in 2011 as the 30th anniversary of Dick's death was approaching. Darjeeling digital producer Noam Roubah noted that many of the themes that Dick had written about have since come to pass in the 21st century, such as the Internet and the dehumanization of human communications.<ref name=\"arstech\">{{Cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/11/californium-the-many-surrealities-of-philip-k-dick/ | title = Californium: A game about the many (sur)realities of Philip K.

The club have competed in the top division for the majority of their existence having only been relegated twice in their history, Castleford has won the [[Challenge Cup]] four times. Their most recent major trophy was the 1985\u201386 [[Challenge Cup]].\nCastleford have a rivalry with neighbours [[Featherstone Rovers]] and [[Wakefield Trinity]]. The club has been based at [[Wheldon Road]] since 1927, after moving from the Sandy Desert in Lock Lane. The club's current home colours are black and amber.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1896\u20131906: First Castleford club ===\n[[File:Castleford Tigers display Castleford Forum Museum.jpg|thumb|170px|Castleford Tigers memorabilia at the Castleford Forum Museum]]\n[[Castleford RFC (1896)|Castleford RFC]] joined the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] for the [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896\u201397 season]], its second and remained in the ranks of the semi-professionals until the end of the [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306 season]]. Not much is known about the original Castleford club, except that they have no connection with the present Castleford Tigers RLFC.\n\n=== 1926\u20131950s: Establishment of second club ===\nCastleford joined the league for the [[1926\u201327 Northern Rugby Football League season|1926\u201327 season]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19260218/004/0002 |title=Castleford's promotion |newspaper=[[Hull Daily Mail]] |date=18 February 1926 |page=2 |issue=12,597 |url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref> Many official records state that they were founded at this time but they had played successfully in the lower [[RFL Yorkshire Cup|Yorkshire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] for several years before this date. They actually joined the League \"code\" around 1920 and played in these early years at the Sandy Desert ground, which is now used by amateur club [[Castleford Lock Lane]] youth and junior teams. The club went professional in 1926 and moved to their current home ground on [[Wheldon Road]] in 1927.\n\nThe club soon started to make a mark on northern rugby, winning their first major trophy when they topped the [[Rugby league county leagues|Yorkshire League]] in 1932, followed by victory in the [[Challenge Cup]] in 1935. In 1938, they made it to the Championship finals, but failed to take the cup. The [[Second World War]] meant the league was suspended soon after, and Castleford officially abstained from league competition until the 1944\u201345 season.\n\n=== 1960\u20131972: Success ===\nCastleford finished fourth in the national league in the 1962/63 season. The following season they lost 7\u20135 to [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] in the Challenge Cup semi-final replay at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], [[Wakefield]] in front of a 28,700 crowd after drawing at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] in the first meeting of the two clubs. Under the direction of coach [[George Clinton (rugby league)|George Clinton]], Castleford won many fans in the '60s by playing an open and free-flowing style of rugby, earning them the nicknames \"Classy Cas\" and \"High Speed Cas\", the latter playing off the slogan for [[British Gas]] in use at the time.\n\nCastleford picked up where they left off when they were again beaten in the Championship finals in 1969, this time conceding defeat to arch-rivals Leeds. However, this loss seemed to spur the team on, and 1969 ([[Salford Red Devils|v. Salford]]) and 1970 ([[Wigan Warriors|v. Wigan]]) saw Castleford win the [[Challenge Cup]] for two consecutive years, with clubs legends [[Alan Hardisty]] and [[Keith Hepworth]] leading the team.\n\n=== 1973\u20131995: Consistency ===\n[[John Sheridan (rugby league)|John Sheridan]] was appointed head coach in 1973 for a spell. Castleford's finished a respectable ninth in a one-division table but Sheridan stepped down following criticism from fans. During the late 1970s Castleford edged up the league, and in 1985 they made it to the Premiership final, where they were beat by [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. A Yorkshire Cup defeat by at the beginning of the following season to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] was bettered with a 15-14 triumph at Wembley again with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] being the opponents . They finished consistently high over the next few years, and finished in the top four clubs in the Championship for four years during 1990\u20131995.\n\n[[Darryl van der Velde]] took Castleford to the Challenge Cup final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in 1992 where they were defeated by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. A year later, Darryl van der Velde left to become chief executive of the [[South Queensland Crushers]], he was succeeded by his assistant [[John Joyner]].\n\nThrough the Darryl van der Velde and early Joyner years Castleford were lauded for their style and were labelled 'Classy Cas'. This enjoyable playing style was to come to fruition most spectacularly in 1994, when Castleford were dominating the league. As well as defeating a legendary [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] team to take the [[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]] 33\u20132, they were also semi-finalists in the [[Challenge Cup]] and were also narrowly defeated in the Premiership final. That season John Joyner, was named Coach-of-the-Year by the RFL. [[St John Ellis]] scored a then club record 40 league tries over the 1993\u201394 season.\n\n=== 1996\u20132004: Super League era ===\nWhen a [[Super League]] was suggested, Castleford resisted a merger with [[Wakefield Trinity]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]], and became a founder member of the [[Super League]] in 1996. The team performed weakly at the start of the season causing the resignation of coach [[John Joyner]], the team avoided relegation by a whisker in 1997 following the appointment of [[Stuart Raper]].\n\nThe next season, they managed to frustrate the bleak predictions of pundits to move up the league, finishing sixth at the end of the season, after putting in some good performances and pleasing their fans with a sprinkling of victories.\n\nIn 1999, they continued on this upward trajectory, finishing fifth, as well as making the semi-finals of both the [[Challenge Cup]] and the Grand Final play-offs. This became one of the most famous seasons in the clubs recent past, with fans still remembering it with reverence. The team included many home grown players such as current assistant [[Danny Orr]], and included that years [[Man of Steel Award|Man of Steel]] winner [[Adrian Vowles]]. In 2000, the rise seemed to stall, as they repeated their fifth-place ranking and made the play-offs for a consecutive season. Raper left Castleford midway through the 2001 campaign to take charge of Wigan, his assistant [[Graham Steadman]] took over the reins as head coach.\n\nCastleford made the semi-final of the [[Challenge Cup]] in 2002, however the team was to fall down the table over the years to come. [[Gary Mercer]] guided Castleford to five wins in their last 10 games after replacing Graham Steadman in 2004 but it was too little to save them from the drop as Castleford were relegated for the first time in the club's history. From the introduction of two divisions for the [[1973\u201374 Northern Rugby Football League season]] Castleford had spent 32 years in the top flight of British rugby league. Gary Mercer left the club following their relegation from Super League.\n\n=== 2005\u20132007: Life in the second tier of Rugby League ===\n[[Dave Woods (rugby league coach)|Dave Woods]] was appointed head coach and Castleford finished second in the [[Rugby League Championships|Co-Operative Championship]] in 2005 and were back in the [[Super League]] via play-offs following victory in the playoff final, as well as competing in the [[Northern Rail Cup]] final, where they lost to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]].\n\n[[Terry Matterson]] joined Castleford in November 2005 in replacement of Woods. Castleford were celebrated for playing a good brand of Rugby League however it was not good enough to stop them from contesting a relegation dog fight which was to culminate in a historic match at Wakefield Trinity's [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], dubbed 'The Battle of Belle Vue'. It was a fight to stay in the league, and when Castleford lost to [[Wakefield Trinity]], it confirmed their relegation. Many Castleford fans do not accept this relegation and it became a grave point of contention with the governing body. Castleford were relegated from second bottom in front of the newly inducted French side, [[Catalans Dragons]], who had been given immunity from relegation that season, and behind Wigan who had been found guilty of a breach of the salary cap rules.\n\nIn 2007 Castleford again made a quick return to [[Super League]] as they finished top of the Championship with only one loss all season and defeated [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 42 \u2013 10 in the [[Rugby League Championships|Co-Operative Championship]] play-off final. Castleford finished bottom of Super League in 2008, but were not relegated due to the newly in place franchise rules.\n\n=== 2009\u20132012: Re-establishment in Super League ===\nIn 2009 Castleford saw a brief return to success by reaching the Grand Final play-offs for the first time since [[Super League VII]] and made the semi-final of the [[Challenge Cup]] in 2011 before being knocked out by [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] in an 8\u201310 defeat after extra time.\n\nTerry Matterson stepped down at the end of the 2010/11 season to take up a coaching role in Australia and was replaced by former [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] coach [[Ian Millward]]. Millward released by mutual consent on 9 April 2013 after a poor run of results with 1 win in 18 games and with the team at the bottom of the Super League table. [[Daryl Powell]] was appointed coach in May 2013 taking over from assistant coach [[Danny Orr]], who had been in temporary charge of the club.\n\n=== 2013\u2013present: Daryl Powell era ===\nUnder Daryl Powell and Danny Orr, the club has again started to see success on and off the field. The 2014 side were again lauded as Classy Cas for their fast-paced and exciting style, with home grown players such as club captain [[Michael Shenton]], [[Daryl Clark]], Adam Milner, Oliver Holmes, Craig Huby and [[Andy Lynch (rugby league)|Andy Lynch]], who was returning to the club. The side reached the Challenge Cup final in August 2014, losing to local rivals Leeds 23\u201310, watched by a crowd of 77,914 at [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/28884420|title=Challenge Cup final: Castleford Tigers 10-23 Leeds Rhinos|date=23 August 2014|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref> The side would eventually finish 4th in Super League and qualify for the play-offs.

They were beaten 14 \u2013 30 and therefore knocked out of the play-offs.

They went into the Super 8's having already secured a top four playoff spot by the end of the Super 8's and winning the League Leaders' Shield in the process. In the semifinal against St Helens, [[Luke Gale]]\u2014just days after undergoing an emergency [[appendectomy]]\u2014kicked a drop-goal in extra time to send Cas to their first Grand Final with a 23-22 win. Sadly they didn't carry on the form they had shown all season and were deservedly beaten by Leeds Rhinos 24-6 with a late consolation score coming in the last minute to spare Castleford being the first team to fail to score in a Grand Final. Gale was voted [[Man of Steel Awards|Steve Prescott Man of Steel]], while Powell picked up the Coach of the Year award for the second time having previously won in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Castleford finished top of the table for the first time in their 91-year history and won the league leaders shield.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/17/castleford-wakefield-super-8s-super-league-match-report|title=Castleford secure first league title after overpowering Wakefield|date=17 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>  On 7 October, Castleford played in their first grand final since 1969 against The [[Leeds Rhinos]].

The club have competed in the top division for the majority of their existence having only been relegated twice in their history, Castleford has won the [[Challenge Cup]] four times. Their most recent major trophy was the 1985\u201386 [[Challenge Cup]].\nCastleford have a rivalry with neighbours [[Featherstone Rovers]] and [[Wakefield Trinity]]. The club has been based at [[Wheldon Road]] since 1927, after moving from the Sandy Desert in Lock Lane. The club's current home colours are black and amber.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== 1896\u20131906: First Castleford club ===\n[[File:Castleford Tigers display Castleford Forum Museum.jpg|thumb|170px|Castleford Tigers memorabilia at the Castleford Forum Museum]]\n[[Castleford RFC (1896)|Castleford RFC]] joined the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] for the [[1896\u201397 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1896\u201397 season]], its second and remained in the ranks of the semi-professionals until the end of the [[1905\u201306 Northern Rugby Football Union season|1905\u201306 season]]. Not much is known about the original Castleford club, except that they have no connection with the present Castleford Tigers RLFC.\n\n=== 1926\u20131950s: Establishment of second club ===\nCastleford joined the league for the [[1926\u201327 Northern Rugby Football League season|1926\u201327 season]].<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000324/19260218/004/0002 |title=Castleford's promotion |newspaper=[[Hull Daily Mail]] |date=18 February 1926 |page=2 |issue=12,597 |url-access=subscription |via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}</ref> Many official records state that they were founded at this time but they had played successfully in the lower [[RFL Yorkshire Cup|Yorkshire]] [[Rugby league county cups|County Cup]] for several years before this date. They actually joined the League \"code\" around 1920 and played in these early years at the Sandy Desert ground, which is now used by amateur club [[Castleford Lock Lane]] youth and junior teams. The club went professional in 1926 and moved to their current home ground on [[Wheldon Road]] in 1927.\n\nThe club soon started to make a mark on northern rugby, winning their first major trophy when they topped the [[Rugby league county leagues|Yorkshire League]] in 1932, followed by victory in the [[Challenge Cup]] in 1935. In 1938, they made it to the Championship finals, but failed to take the cup. The [[Second World War]] meant the league was suspended soon after, and Castleford officially abstained from league competition until the 1944\u201345 season.\n\n=== 1960\u20131972: Success ===\nCastleford finished fourth in the national league in the 1962/63 season. The following season they lost 7\u20135 to [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] in the Challenge Cup semi-final replay at [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], [[Wakefield]] in front of a 28,700 crowd after drawing at [[Station Road, Swinton|Station Road]], [[Swinton, Greater Manchester|Swinton]] in the first meeting of the two clubs. Under the direction of coach [[George Clinton (rugby league)|George Clinton]], Castleford won many fans in the '60s by playing an open and free-flowing style of rugby, earning them the nicknames \"Classy Cas\" and \"High Speed Cas\", the latter playing off the slogan for [[British Gas]] in use at the time.\n\nCastleford picked up where they left off when they were again beaten in the Championship finals in 1969, this time conceding defeat to arch-rivals Leeds. However, this loss seemed to spur the team on, and 1969 ([[Salford Red Devils|v. Salford]]) and 1970 ([[Wigan Warriors|v. Wigan]]) saw Castleford win the [[Challenge Cup]] for two consecutive years, with clubs legends [[Alan Hardisty]] and [[Keith Hepworth]] leading the team.\n\n=== 1973\u20131995: Consistency ===\n[[John Sheridan (rugby league)|John Sheridan]] was appointed head coach in 1973 for a spell. Castleford's finished a respectable ninth in a one-division table but Sheridan stepped down following criticism from fans. During the late 1970s Castleford edged up the league, and in 1985 they made it to the Premiership final, where they were beat by [[Hull Kingston Rovers]]. A Yorkshire Cup defeat by at the beginning of the following season to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] was bettered with a 15-14 triumph at Wembley again with [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] being the opponents . They finished consistently high over the next few years, and finished in the top four clubs in the Championship for four years during 1990\u20131995.\n\n[[Darryl van der Velde]] took Castleford to the Challenge Cup final at [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley]] in 1992 where they were defeated by [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]]. A year later, Darryl van der Velde left to become chief executive of the [[South Queensland Crushers]], he was succeeded by his assistant [[John Joyner]].\n\nThrough the Darryl van der Velde and early Joyner years Castleford were lauded for their style and were labelled 'Classy Cas'. This enjoyable playing style was to come to fruition most spectacularly in 1994, when Castleford were dominating the league. As well as defeating a legendary [[Wigan Warriors|Wigan]] team to take the [[League Cup (rugby league)|Regal Trophy]] 33\u20132, they were also semi-finalists in the [[Challenge Cup]] and were also narrowly defeated in the Premiership final. That season John Joyner, was named Coach-of-the-Year by the RFL. [[St John Ellis]] scored a then club record 40 league tries over the 1993\u201394 season.\n\n=== 1996\u20132004: Super League era ===\nWhen a [[Super League]] was suggested, Castleford resisted a merger with [[Wakefield Trinity]] and [[Featherstone Rovers]], and became a founder member of the [[Super League]] in 1996. The team performed weakly at the start of the season causing the resignation of coach [[John Joyner]], the team avoided relegation by a whisker in 1997 following the appointment of [[Stuart Raper]].\n\nThe next season, they managed to frustrate the bleak predictions of pundits to move up the league, finishing sixth at the end of the season, after putting in some good performances and pleasing their fans with a sprinkling of victories.\n\nIn 1999, they continued on this upward trajectory, finishing fifth, as well as making the semi-finals of both the [[Challenge Cup]] and the Grand Final play-offs. This became one of the most famous seasons in the clubs recent past, with fans still remembering it with reverence. The team included many home grown players such as current assistant [[Danny Orr]], and included that years [[Man of Steel Award|Man of Steel]] winner [[Adrian Vowles]]. In 2000, the rise seemed to stall, as they repeated their fifth-place ranking and made the play-offs for a consecutive season. Raper left Castleford midway through the 2001 campaign to take charge of Wigan, his assistant [[Graham Steadman]] took over the reins as head coach.\n\nCastleford made the semi-final of the [[Challenge Cup]] in 2002, however the team was to fall down the table over the years to come. [[Gary Mercer]] guided Castleford to five wins in their last 10 games after replacing Graham Steadman in 2004 but it was too little to save them from the drop as Castleford were relegated for the first time in the club's history. From the introduction of two divisions for the [[1973\u201374 Northern Rugby Football League season]] Castleford had spent 32 years in the top flight of British rugby league. Gary Mercer left the club following their relegation from Super League.\n\n=== 2005\u20132007: Life in the second tier of Rugby League ===\n[[Dave Woods (rugby league coach)|Dave Woods]] was appointed head coach and Castleford finished second in the [[Rugby League Championships|Co-Operative Championship]] in 2005 and were back in the [[Super League]] via play-offs following victory in the playoff final, as well as competing in the [[Northern Rail Cup]] final, where they lost to [[Hull Kingston Rovers]].\n\n[[Terry Matterson]] joined Castleford in November 2005 in replacement of Woods. Castleford were celebrated for playing a good brand of Rugby League however it was not good enough to stop them from contesting a relegation dog fight which was to culminate in a historic match at Wakefield Trinity's [[Belle Vue (Wakefield)|Belle Vue]], dubbed 'The Battle of Belle Vue'. It was a fight to stay in the league, and when Castleford lost to [[Wakefield Trinity]], it confirmed their relegation. Many Castleford fans do not accept this relegation and it became a grave point of contention with the governing body. Castleford were relegated from second bottom in front of the newly inducted French side, [[Catalans Dragons]], who had been given immunity from relegation that season, and behind Wigan who had been found guilty of a breach of the salary cap rules.\n\nIn 2007 Castleford again made a quick return to [[Super League]] as they finished top of the Championship with only one loss all season and defeated [[Widnes Vikings|Widnes]] 42 \u2013 10 in the [[Rugby League Championships|Co-Operative Championship]] play-off final. Castleford finished bottom of Super League in 2008, but were not relegated due to the newly in place franchise rules.\n\n=== 2009\u20132012: Re-establishment in Super League ===\nIn 2009 Castleford saw a brief return to success by reaching the Grand Final play-offs for the first time since [[Super League VII]] and made the semi-final of the [[Challenge Cup]] in 2011 before being knocked out by [[Leeds Rhinos|Leeds]] in an 8\u201310 defeat after extra time.\n\nTerry Matterson stepped down at the end of the 2010/11 season to take up a coaching role in Australia and was replaced by former [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] coach [[Ian Millward]]. Millward released by mutual consent on 9 April 2013 after a poor run of results with 1 win in 18 games and with the team at the bottom of the Super League table. [[Daryl Powell]] was appointed coach in May 2013 taking over from assistant coach [[Danny Orr]], who had been in temporary charge of the club.\n\n=== 2013\u2013present: Daryl Powell era ===\nUnder Daryl Powell and Danny Orr, the club has again started to see success on and off the field. The 2014 side were again lauded as Classy Cas for their fast-paced and exciting style, with home grown players such as club captain [[Michael Shenton]], [[Daryl Clark]], Adam Milner, Oliver Holmes, Craig Huby and [[Andy Lynch (rugby league)|Andy Lynch]], who was returning to the club. The side reached the Challenge Cup final in August 2014, losing to local rivals Leeds 23\u201310, watched by a crowd of 77,914 at [[Wembley Stadium]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/rugby-league/28884420|title=Challenge Cup final: Castleford Tigers 10-23 Leeds Rhinos|date=23 August 2014|work=BBC Sport|accessdate=29 July 2017}}</ref> The side would eventually finish 4th in Super League and qualify for the play-offs.

They were beaten 14 \u2013 30 and therefore knocked out of the play-offs.

They went into the Super 8's having already secured a top four playoff spot by the end of the Super 8's and winning the League Leaders' Shield in the process. In the semifinal against St Helens, [[Luke Gale]]\u2014just days after undergoing an emergency [[appendectomy]]\u2014kicked a drop-goal in extra time to send Cas to their first Grand Final with a 23-22 win. Sadly they didn't carry on the form they had shown all season and were deservedly beaten by Leeds Rhinos 24-6 with a late consolation score coming in the last minute to spare Castleford being the first team to fail to score in a Grand Final. Gale was voted [[Man of Steel Awards|Steve Prescott Man of Steel]], while Powell picked up the Coach of the Year award for the second time having previously won in 2014.\n\nIn 2017, Castleford finished top of the table for the first time in their 91-year history and won the league leaders shield.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2017/aug/17/castleford-wakefield-super-8s-super-league-match-report|title=Castleford secure first league title after overpowering Wakefield|date=17 August 2017|newspaper=The Guardian}}</ref>  On 7 October, Castleford played in their first grand final since 1969 against The [[Leeds Rhinos]].
