It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time.\n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011).

Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter, and spring.

The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-[[monsoon]] in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of {{convert|649.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> In winter temperature averages between {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> [[Snowfall]] is rare, and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005<ref name=\"chap2\" /> and 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gangtok sees snowfall after 15 years \u00bb Northeast Today |url=https://www.northeasttoday.in/gangtok-sees-snowfall-after-15-years/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |work=Northeast Today |date=7 January 2020}}</ref> Temperatures below [[freezing point|freezing]] are also rare.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours.

state of [[Sikkim]]. It also is the headquarters of the [[East Sikkim]] district. Gangtok is in the eastern [[Himalayas|Himalayan]] range, at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}. The town's population of 100,000 are from different ethnicities such as [[Bhutia]], [[Lepcha people|Lepchas]] and [[Indian Gorkha]]s. Within the higher peaks of the Himalaya and with a year-round mild [[temperate]] climate, Gangtok is at the centre of Sikkim's tourism industry.\n\nGangtok rose to prominence as a popular [[Buddhist pilgrimage]] site after the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840. In 1894, the ruling Sikkimese [[Chogyal]], [[Thutob Namgyal]], transferred the capital to Gangtok. In the early 20th century, Gangtok became a major stopover on the [[trade route]] between [[Lhasa]] in [[Tibet]] and cities such as [[Kolkata]] (then Calcutta) in [[British India]]. After India won its independence from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] in 1947, Sikkim chose to remain an independent monarchy, with Gangtok as its capital. In 1975, after the integration with the union of India, Gangtok was made India's 22nd state capital.\n\n==Etymology==\n\nThe precise meaning of the name \"Gangtok\" is unclear, though the most popular meaning is \"hill cut\".<ref name=\"telegang\" />\n\n== History ==\n{{See also|History of Sikkim}}\nLike the rest of Sikkim, not much is known about the early history of Gangtok.<ref name=\"TT20031006\" /> The earliest records date from the construction of the [[hermit]]ic Gangtok monastery in 1716.<ref name=\"bernier1\" /> Gangtok remained a small hamlet until the construction of the [[Enchey Monastery]] in 1840 made it a pilgrimage center. It became the capital of what was left of Sikkim after an English conquest in the mid-19th century in response to a hostage crisis. After the [[History of Tibet|defeat of the Tibetans]] by the British, Gangtok became a major stopover in the trade between Tibet and British India at the end of the 19th century.<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /> Most of the roads and the [[telegraph]] in the area were built during this time.\n\nIn 1894, [[Thutob Namgyal]], the Sikkimese monarch under British rule, shifted the capital from [[Tumlong]] to Gangtok, increasing the city's importance. A new grand palace along with other state buildings was built in the new capital. Following [[Indian independence movement|India's independence]] in 1947, Sikkim became a [[nation-state]] with Gangtok as its capital. Sikkim came under the [[suzerainty]] of India, with the condition that it would retain its independence, by the treaty signed between the [[Chogyal]] and the then [[Prime Minister of India|Indian Prime Minister]] [[Jawaharlal Nehru]].<ref name=\"HISTORY OF SIKKIM\" /> This pact gave the Indians control of external affairs on behalf of Sikkimese. Trade between India and Tibet continued to flourish through the [[Nathula]] and [[Jelepla Pass|Jelepla passes]], offshoots of the ancient [[Silk Road]] near Gangtok. These border passes were sealed after the [[Sino-Indian War]] in 1962, which deprived Gangtok of its trading business.<ref name=\"nathuladown\" /> The Nathula pass was finally opened for limited trade in 2006, fuelling hopes of economic boom.<ref name=\"bbc-1\" /><ref>Forbes, Andrew ; Henley, David (2011). ''China's Ancient Tea Horse Road''. Chiang Mai: Cognoscenti Books. ASIN: B005DQV7Q2</ref>\n\nIn 1975, after years of political uncertainty and struggle, including riots, the monarchy was abrogated and Sikkim became India's twenty-second state, with Gangtok as its capital after a referendum.<!---Nest&Wings pg-21-24|NaW---> Gangtok has witnessed annual landslides, resulting in loss of life and damage to property. The largest disaster occurred in June 1997, when 38 were killed and hundreds of buildings were destroyed.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\n== Geography ==\n{{multiple image|perrow=2|total_width=350|caption_align=center\n| align    = left\n| title = [[Kangchenjunga]]\n| image1 = Kangch-Goechala.jpg\n| image2 = Kangchenjunga East Face from Zemu Glacier.jpg\n| footer   = <center>[[Kangchenjunga]], visible from Gangtok, the third [[List of highest mountains|highest mountain in the world]], near the [[Zemu Glacier]].</center> \n}}\nGangtok is located at {{Coord|27.3325|N|88.6140|E|}} (coordinates of Gangtok head post office).<ref name=\"FallinGrain\" /> It is situated in the lower [[Himalaya]]s at an elevation of {{convert|1650|m|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"metgang\" /> The town lies on one side of a hill, with \"The Ridge\",<ref name=\"nslepcha\" /><ref name=\"discoveringbook\" /> a promenade housing the [[Raj Bhavan (Sikkim)|Raj Bhawan]], the [[governor]]'s residence, at one end and the palace, situated at an altitude of about {{convert|1800|m|abbr=on}}, at the other. The city is flanked on east and west by two streams, namely [[Roro Chu]] and [[Ranikhola]], respectively.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> These two rivers divide the natural drainage into two parts, the eastern and western parts. Both the streams meet the Ranipul and flow south as the main Ranikhola before it joins the [[Teesta River|Teesta]] at [[Singtam]].<ref name=\"chap4\" /> Most of the roads are steep, with the buildings built on compacted ground alongside them.<ref name=\"mapsindiagang\" />\n\n[[File:Ban Jhakri Falls - Gangtok.jpg|thumb|right|Banjhakri Falls - Gangtok]]\nMost of [[Sikkim]], including Gangtok, is underlain by [[Precambrian]] rocks which contains [[Foliation (geology)|foliated]] [[phyllite]]s and [[schists]]; slopes are therefore prone to frequent landslides.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> Surface runoff of water by natural streams (''jhora'') and man-made drains has contributed to the risk of landslides.<ref name=\"chap4\" /> According to the [[Bureau of Indian Standards]], the town falls under [[Earthquake hazard zoning of India|seismic zone-IV]] (on a scale of I to V, in order of increasing seismic activity), near the [[convergent boundary]] of the [[India Plate|Indian]] and the [[Eurasian Plate|Eurasian]] [[tectonic plate]]s and is subject to frequent earthquakes. The hills are nestled within higher peaks and the snow-clad Himalayan ranges tower over the town from the distance. Mount [[Kanchenjunga]] (8,598&nbsp;m or 28,208&nbsp;ft)\u2014the world's third-highest peak\u2014is visible to the west of the city. The existence of steep slopes, vulnerability to landslides, large forest cover and inadequate access to most areas have been a major impediment to the natural and balanced growth of the city.<ref name=\"chap4\" />\n\nThere are densely forested regions around Gangtok, consisting of temperate, [[deciduous]] forests of [[Populus|poplar]], [[birch]], [[oak]], and [[elm]], as well as [[evergreen]], [[coniferous]] trees of the [[alpine climate|wet alpine]] zone.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> [[Orchids]] are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. [[Bamboo]]s are also abundant.

Because of its elevation and sheltered environment, Gangtok enjoys a mild, [[temperate]] climate all year round. Like most Himalayan towns, Gangtok has five seasons: summer, [[monsoon]]s, autumn, winter, and spring. Temperatures range from an average maximum of {{convert|22|C|F|lk=on|abbr=on|0}} in summer to an average minimum of {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} in winter.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> Summers (lasting from late April to June) are mild, with maximum temperatures rarely crossing {{convert|25|C|F|abbr=on|lk=on|0}}. The monsoon season from June to September is characterised by intense torrential rains often causing landslides that block Gangtok's land access to the rest of the country. Rainfall starts to rise from pre-[[monsoon]] in May, and peaks during the monsoon, with July recording the highest monthly average of {{convert|649.6|mm|in|abbr=on|1}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> In winter temperature averages between {{convert|4|C|F|abbr=on|0}} and {{convert|7|C|F|abbr=on|0}}.<ref name=\"weatherchart\" /> [[Snowfall]] is rare, and in recent times, Gangtok has received snow only in 1990, 2004, 2005<ref name=\"chap2\" /> and 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Gangtok sees snowfall after 15 years \u00bb Northeast Today |url=https://www.northeasttoday.in/gangtok-sees-snowfall-after-15-years/ |accessdate=9 January 2020 |work=Northeast Today |date=7 January 2020}}</ref> Temperatures below [[freezing point|freezing]] are also rare.<ref name=\"chap2\" /> During this season the weather can be unstable, and change abruptly from bright sunshine and clear skies to heavy rain within a couple of hours.

{"title_page": "Real gross domestic product", "text_new": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{Refimprove|date=August 2012}}\n{{Expert needed|economics|date=February 2011}}\n}}\n\n'''Real gross domestic product''' ('''real GDP''' for short) is a [[macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] measure of the value of economic [[output (economics)|output]] adjusted for price changes (i.e. [[inflation (economics)|inflation]] or [[deflation]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/realgdp.asp|title=Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP)|first=Will|last=Kenton|website=Investopedia.com|accessdate=2 April 2019}}</ref> This adjustment transforms the money-value measure, [[Gross domestic product#Nominal GDP and adjustments to GDP|nominal GDP]], into an [[Index (economics)|index]] for quantity of total output. Although GDP is total output, it is primarily useful because it closely approximates the total spending: the sum of consumer spending, investment made by industry, excess of exports over imports, and government spending.  Due to inflation, GDP increases and does not actually reflect the true growth in an economy.
