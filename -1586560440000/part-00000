{"title_page": "Mating preferences", "text_new": "<!-- EDIT BELOW THIS LINE -->\n'''Mate preferences''' in humans refers to why one human chooses or chooses not to mate with another human and their reasoning why ([[Evolutionary Psychology#Mating|see: Evolutionary Psychology, mating]]).  Men and women have been observed having different criteria as what makes a good or ideal mate (gender differences).  A potential mate's socioeconomic status has also been seen as having a noticeable effect, especially in developing areas where social status is more emphasized.<ref>Stone, Shackelford, & Buss (2008) Socioeconomic Development and Shifts in Mate Preferences. ''Evolutionary Psychology Vol. 6''</ref>\n\n==Female mate preferences==\n\nSubduce humans, when choosing a mate of the opposite sex, females place high preference for a mate that is physically attractive.<ref>Buss, D. M., & Barnes, M. (1986). Preferences in human mate selection.Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50(3), 559.</ref> This ties in with the idea that women discriminate between men on hypothesized fitness cues. The more physically attractive a man is, the higher his fitness, and the better his genes will be.  Women are attracted to more masculine traits (e.g. strong jawline, a more muscular body). Indeed, men who are more masculine tend to have a higher number of sexual partners.<ref>Frederick, D. A., & Haselton, M. G. (2007). Why is muscularity sexy? Tests of the fitness indicator hypothesis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.</ref>\n\n=== Male physical attractiveness ===\n\n==== The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis ====\n\nThis hypothesis suggests that secondary sexual characteristics such as a low waist-to-chest ratio or masculine facial features (e.g. strong jawline, larger brow ridge, more muscular) are reliable indicators of mate quality as the hormones that cause their development (i.e. testosterone) suppress the immune system of an individual.<ref>Rantala, M. J., Vainikka, A., & Kortet, R. (2003). The role of juvenile hormone in immune function and pheromone production trade-offs: A test of the immunocompetence handicap principle. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 270, 2257-2261.</ref> With immunosuppression a male would be more susceptible to diseases or pathogens. However if a male is in good enough condition to weather these negative effects, it would be indicative to women, who selected these men as mates, that they have good genes.\n\n==== Waist-to-chest ratio ====\nLike men, who have a preference for a lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a measure linked to female bodily attractiveness,<ref>Singh, D.( 1993). Adaptive significance of female physical attractiveness: role of waist-to-hip ratio. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 59, 1191\u20131201.</ref> women tend to be more attracted to men who have broader shoulders and relatively narrow waists (the waist-to-chest ratio; WCR).<ref>Horvath, T. (1981). Physical attractiveness: The influence of selected torso parameters. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 10(1), 21-24.</ref> The ratio, changed by the distribution of android fat in the torso, makes the characteristic V-shape and is related to levels of testosterone in males,<ref>Braun, M. F., & Bryan, A. (2006). Female waist-to-hip and male waist-to-shoulder ratios as determinants of romantic partner desirability. Journal of Social and Personal Relationships, 23(5), 805-819.</ref> also correlated with higher perceived dominance of males.<ref>Dijkstra, P., & Buunk, B. P. (2001). Sex differences in the jealousy-evoking nature of a rival\u2019s body build. Evolution and Human Behavior, 22(5), 335\u2013341.</ref>\n\nCross-culturally however the waist-to-chest ratio significance differs. A cross-cultural study across urban and rural settings in Britain and Malaysia found that BMI and waist-to-hip ratio also play roles in rating male physical attractiveness. In urban settings, participants would place a larger importance on WCR, minor importance on BMI and no significant importance on WHR. In rural settings BMI was however found to be the most important factor in deciding physical attractiveness.<ref>Swami, V., & Tov\u00e9e, M. J. (2005). Male physical attractiveness in Britain and Malaysia: A cross-cultural study. Body Image, 2(4), 383-393.</ref>\n\n===Fluctuating Asymmetry===\n\nFluctuating Asymmetry (FA) is the deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry in an organism. The more symmetrical an organism is, the better they are at handling developmental stress arising from environmental stress, genetic problems and developmental instability.<ref>Valen, Leigh Van (June 1962). \"A Study of Fluctuating Asymmetry\". Evolution 16 (2): 125\u2013142</ref> Along with developmental stability, FA indicates the genetic fitness of an individual and will therefore affect sexual selection. Men with high facial symmetry are rated as more attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy than their counterparts.<ref>Grammer, K., & Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology, 108(3), 233.</ref> Low FA males report more sexual partners across a lifetime, an earlier age of first sexual intercourse, and have more offspring than high FA men.<ref>Thornhill, R., & Gangestad, S. W. (1994). Human fluctuating asymmetry and sexual behavior. Psychological Science, 5(5), 297-302.</ref> Additionally, low FA men's partners report more orgasms than those whose partners have high FA.<ref>Thornhill, R., Gangestad, S. W., & Comer, R. (1995). Human female orgasm and mate fluctuating asymmetry. Animal Behaviour, 50(6), 1601-1615</ref> With other results showing that women find low FA men's voice <ref>Hughes, Susan M.; Harrison, Marissa A.; Gallup, Gordon G. Jr. (May 2002). \"The sound of symmetry: Voice as a marker of developmental instability\" Evolution and Human Behavior 23: 173\u2013180</ref> and scent more attractive,<ref>Thornhill, Randy; Gangestad, Steven, W. (May 1999). \"The scent of symmetry: A human sex pheromone that signals fitness?\". Evolution and Human Behavior 20 (3): 175\u2013201</ref> it is clear that mating preference is affected by FA.\n\n=== Resources ===\nMales with the '''ability and willingness to provide resources''' are highly desirable to females. In our evolutionary past, this would have been demonstrated through the ability to provide food, shelter, and protection. In modern day humans, cues to high resource acquisition are presented in different ways. Cross-culturally, females show an increased preference for economic resources than do males, and those males who marry at a certain age tend to earn significantly more than males of the same age who do not marry.<ref>Buss, D. M. (1999). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref><ref>Trivers, R. (1985). Social evolution. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\"/> As females often choose mates young, the amount of resources that they actually possess may be small. Therefore, females seek traits indicative of potential resource acquisition ability such as a good education, ambition, and career potential. If a male becomes unemployed or lazy, the female is far more likely to discontinue the relationship with them.<ref>Betzig, L. (1989). Causes of conjugal dissolution: A cross-cultural study.

Studies have consistently found that females tend to select mates that are roughly 4 years older than themselves, and this even applies cross-culturally.<ref>Buss, D. M. (1989).

(1993). Body shape and women's attractiveness: The critical role of waist-to-hip ratio. Human Nature, 4(3), 297-321.</ref> It was also found that women with a WHR of 0.7 were rated the most attractive, youthful, fertile and healthy, when compared to other WHR's. Furthermore, the current research also found that those women with a WHR of 0.7 and of normal weight were rated the most attractive, and whereas those with a WHR of 0.7 but whom were underweight were rated as more youthful but not as attractive. An extension of WHR research <ref>Singh, D., & Young, R. K. (1995). Body weight, waist-to-hip ratio, breasts, and hips: Role in judgments of female attractiveness and desirability for relationships. Ethology and Sociobiology, 16(6), 483-507.</ref> showed that there is an impact of breast and hip size upon attractiveness; Women with large breasts, and small hips were rated more attractive than women with small breasts and small hips, as well as finding that women with large hips were rated less attractive irrespective of breast size.\n\n=== Skin condition ===\nSkin condition<ref>Lucky, A. W. (1995). Hormonal correlates of acne and hirsutism. The American journal of medicine, 98(1), S89-S94.</ref> has been found to be an honest indicator of sex hormones which may indicate levels of fertility. The study directly examines the relationship between an individual having acne and the levels of hormones that could potentially indicate low fertility, therefore guiding attractiveness for mate preference. This skin condition, attractiveness  link has been corroborated by research that  <ref>Etcoff, N. (1999). Survival of the prettiest. The Science of Beauty. London: Little, Brown And Company.</ref>  found that '''skin colour, skin homogeneity''' and '''facial adiposity''' (how fat is deposited around the face) all predict female attractiveness and therefore, mate preference. Skin tone has also been found to be an honest indicator of youthfulness and fertility;<ref>Fink, B., Grammer, K., & Thornhill, R. (2001). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness in relation to skin texture and color. Journal of Comparative Psychology, 115(1), 92.</ref> as well as research showing  the first links between  estradiol and female '''facial redness''', in which as a woman reaches the peak of her ovulatory cycle her facial redness increases. This research would suggest that male mate preference would be guided by the individuals skin tone, looking for women with redder facial skin tones they indicate peak fertility and optimal opportunity for reproductive success.\n\n=== Neoteny ===\nMales show a preference for [[Neoteny|neotenous]] or youthful looking features in women, such as; big eyes,<ref>Jones, D., & Hill, K. (1993). Criteria of facial attractiveness in five populations. Human Nature, 4(3), 271-296.</ref> a small nose, and full lips.<ref>Jones, D., Brace, C. L., Jankowiak, W., Laland, K. N., Musselman, L.

As a result of evolution these features are deemed as highly attractive as they would indicate a higher chance of successful reproduction. This male mate preference for neoteny has been shown in research <ref>Johnston, V.S., & Franklin, M. (1993).  Is beauty in the eye of the beholder? Ethology and Sociobiology 14: 183\u2013199.</ref> in which men were asked to morph images of female faces until an ideal face was achieved.\n\n=== Chastity ===\n[[Chastity]] is deemed highly desirable across cultures however the extent of its importance shows some variation.<ref name=\":0\">Buss, D. M., & Schmitt, D. P. (1993). [https://www.academia.edu/download/1616706/sexual_strategies_theory_1993.pdf Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating].

M. (1989). Sex differences in human mate preferences: Evolutionary hypotheses tested in 37 cultures. ''Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', ''12''</ref>\n\n== Parental investment ==\nThe idea of '''[[parental investment]]''' is common both in humans and in the animal kingdom and derives from the fact that across most species there is an imbalance in the amount of time each parent invests in their offspring. Parental investment acts as a determinant of offspring survival, and accessing this investment is important for the sex that doesn\u2019t provide as much PI. This theory states that the sex that invests the most time in raising its offspring is the limiting sex: it is more selective when choosing a mate. The other sex thus invests most of their time in competing for and courting mates.<ref>Trivers, R.L. (1972). Parental investment and sexual selection. In B. Campbell (Ed.), Sexual selection and the descent of man, 1871-1971 (pp. 136\u2013179). Chicago, IL: Aldine</ref> Sexual selection by the limiting sex is stronger the larger the disparity between PI between the sexes. Whilst parental investment is relatively equal in humans, females are the selective sex because males are able to impregnate a number of females, whilst one male may only impregnate a female and they must invest a lot of time initially into the pregnancy. However, the investment by males does mean that males are also selective, and thus females ornaments have evolved to address this. According to [[evolutionary psychology]], PI explains why females tend to focus on traits indicating a superior resource acquisition ability, whilst males tend to focus on signals of fertility: females are selective of their mate; males are selective over when they invest.\n\n==Gender differences==\nMating preferences are not only confined to long-term relationships. Men and women have developed separate sexual strategies that are used for both short-term and long-term mate gain. Psychological adaptations such as mate guarding and sexual jealousy, and biological adaptations such as men\u2019s testes size indicate that polygamy was present in evolutionary history,<ref>Kirkpatrick, L.

Short term mating forms a larger part of the male sexual strategy, largely due to PI, with men more willing to engage in intercourse sooner and preferring a larger number of partners than women.<ref>Buss, D. M., & Schmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: an evolutionary perspective on human mating. ''Psychological Review, 100'', 204-232.</ref> Yet mate preference changes depending on the strategy being used: when searching for a long-term mate, women often tend to emphasise resources, but in the short term, a potential mate's physical attractiveness is weighed more heavily because it is a good indicator of desirable genes.<ref>Li, Valentine, & Patel (2010) Mate preferences in the US and Singapore: A cross-cultural test of the mate preference priority model.

The survey was given to over 9,800 people from 37 different cultures across 6 continents and 5 islands. The four dimensions are:\n\n*Love vs. Status/Resources\u2014trade-off between a loving relationship and a partner with adequate resources and status\n*Dependable/Stable vs. Good Looks/Health\u2014trade-off between choosing an emotionally stable partner and one that is physically attractive\n*Education/Intelligence vs. Desire for Home/Children\u2014trade-off between educational factors and a range of family matters like wanting of kids and chastity[[File:You may now kiss the bride.jpg|thumb|Long term relationship success has been found to have four important factors]]\n*Sociability vs. Similar Religion\u2014tradeoff between a partner who is sociable and a partner that is religiously similar or compatible.\n\nThe four dimensions found imply individuals considering a relationship weigh the importance of the two sides of each dimension for a long term relationship.  For example, the higher a person scores on the Love vs. Status/Resources scale, the more that person is extroverted and the more emphasis they place on Love.  A person scoring lower would be an introvert and place more emphasis on Status/Resources.  Analogous reasoning applies to the other three dimensions, too, the first named concept being the higher valued end of the continuum and the second-named being the lower end.  Negative scores indicate direction but not value of the concept.\n\nThere were several gender differences observed in the study.  For instance, men seemed to rate Love vs Status/Resources higher in importance in relation to women, meaning men place more of an emphasis on mutual love while women place more of an emphasis on Status/Resources.<ref name=\"Shackelford\"/> Women rated the other three dimensions higher in importance.  A majority of cases saw women rate Dependable/Stable vs. Good Looks/Health higher, implying a stable personality is more desirable to women than a physically attractive mate.<ref name=\"Shackelford\"/> Education/Intelligence vs. Desire for Home/Children was also rated higher, showing that similar educational background and political views are more important than home life, and a small number of cases had women rank Sociability vs. Similar Religion higher (a pleasing disposition is more important than sharing religious beliefs).<ref name=\"Shackelford\"/>\n\nIn sum, men appear to value physical attractiveness, health, and a want for home life and children in their long-term mates, whereas women appear to value maturity, dependability, education, social status, and financial stability.\n\n==Mate preference priorities==\nResearch has attempted to assess which mate preferences men and women prioritize when selecting mates. Such studies typically involve an element of forced choice, such as asking participants to \"design\" their ideal partner using a fixed budget. When budgets are small, participants tend to prioritise those characteristics historically necessary for successful reproduction and relationship functioning - including physical attractiveness, social status, and kindness.<ref>Li, N.

Men and women have been observed having different criteria as what makes a good or ideal mate (gender differences).  A potential mate's socioeconomic status has also been seen as having a noticeable effect, especially in developing areas where social status is more emphasized.<ref>Stone, Shackelford, & Buss (2008) Socioeconomic Development and Shifts in Mate Preferences. ''Evolutionary Psychology Vol. 6''</ref>\n\n==Female mate preferences==\n\nIn humans, when choosing a mate of the opposite sex, females place high preference for a mate that is physically attractive.<ref>Buss, D. M., & Barnes, M. (1986). Preferences in human mate selection.Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, 50(3), 559.</ref> This ties in with the idea that women discriminate between men on hypothesized fitness cues. The more physically attractive a man is, the higher his fitness, and the better his genes will be.  Women are attracted to more masculine traits (e.g. strong jawline, a more muscular body). Indeed, men who are more masculine tend to have a higher number of sexual partners.<ref>Frederick, D. A., & Haselton, M. G. (2007). Why is muscularity sexy? Tests of the fitness indicator hypothesis. Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin.</ref>\n\n=== Male physical attractiveness ===\n\n==== The Immunocompetence Handicap Hypothesis ====\n\nThis hypothesis suggests that secondary sexual characteristics such as a low waist-to-chest ratio or masculine facial features (e.g. strong jawline, larger brow ridge, more muscular) are reliable indicators of mate quality as the hormones that cause their development (i.e. testosterone) suppress the immune system of an individual.<ref>Rantala, M. J., Vainikka, A., & Kortet, R. (2003). The role of juvenile hormone in immune function and pheromone production trade-offs: A test of the immunocompetence handicap principle. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 270, 2257-2261.</ref> With immunosuppression a male would be more susceptible to diseases or pathogens. However if a male is in good enough condition to weather these negative effects, it would be indicative to women, who selected these men as mates, that they have good genes.\n\n==== Waist-to-chest ratio ====\nLike men, who have a preference for a lower waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), a measure linked to female bodily attractiveness,<ref>Singh, D.( 1993). Adaptive significance of female physical attractiveness: role of waist-to-hip ratio. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 59, 1191\u20131201.</ref> women tend to be more attracted to men who have broader shoulders and relatively narrow waists (the waist-to-chest ratio; WCR).<ref>Horvath, T. (1981). Physical attractiveness: The influence of selected torso parameters. Archives of Sexual Behavior, 10(1), 21-24.</ref> The ratio, changed by the distribution of android fat in the torso, makes the characteristic V-shape and is related to levels of testosterone in males,<ref>Braun, M. F., & Bryan, A. (2006). Female waist-to-hip and male waist-to-shoulder ratios as determinants of romantic partner desirability.

Evolution and Human Behavior, 22(5), 335\u2013341.</ref>\n\nCross-culturally however the waist-to-chest ratio significance differs. A cross-cultural study across urban and rural settings in Britain and Malaysia found that BMI and waist-to-hip ratio also play roles in rating male physical attractiveness. In urban settings, participants would place a larger importance on WCR, minor importance on BMI and no significant importance on WHR. In rural settings BMI was however found to be the most important factor in deciding physical attractiveness.<ref>Swami, V., & Tov\u00e9e, M. J. (2005). Male physical attractiveness in Britain and Malaysia: A cross-cultural study. Body Image, 2(4), 383-393.</ref>\n\n===Fluctuating Asymmetry===\n\nFluctuating Asymmetry (FA) is the deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry in an organism. The more symmetrical an organism is, the better they are at handling developmental stress arising from environmental stress, genetic problems and developmental instability.<ref>Valen, Leigh Van (June 1962). \"A Study of Fluctuating Asymmetry\". Evolution 16 (2): 125\u2013142</ref> Along with developmental stability, FA indicates the genetic fitness of an individual and will therefore affect sexual selection. Men with high facial symmetry are rated as more attractive, dominant, sexy, and healthy than their counterparts.<ref>Grammer, K., & Thornhill, R. (1994). Human (Homo sapiens) facial attractiveness and sexual selection: the role of symmetry and averageness. Journal of comparative psychology, 108(3), 233.</ref> Low FA males report more sexual partners across a lifetime, an earlier age of first sexual intercourse, and have more offspring than high FA men.<ref>Thornhill, R., & Gangestad, S. W. (1994). Human fluctuating asymmetry and sexual behavior. Psychological Science, 5(5), 297-302.</ref> Additionally, low FA men's partners report more orgasms than those whose partners have high FA.<ref>Thornhill, R., Gangestad, S. W., & Comer, R. (1995). Human female orgasm and mate fluctuating asymmetry. Animal Behaviour, 50(6), 1601-1615</ref> With other results showing that women find low FA men's voice <ref>Hughes, Susan M.; Harrison, Marissa A.; Gallup, Gordon G. Jr. (May 2002). \"The sound of symmetry: Voice as a marker of developmental instability\" Evolution and Human Behavior 23: 173\u2013180</ref> and scent more attractive,<ref>Thornhill, Randy; Gangestad, Steven, W. (May 1999). \"The scent of symmetry: A human sex pheromone that signals fitness?\". Evolution and Human Behavior 20 (3): 175\u2013201</ref> it is clear that mating preference is affected by FA.\n\n=== Resources ===\nMales with the '''ability and willingness to provide resources''' are highly desirable to females. In our evolutionary past, this would have been demonstrated through the ability to provide food, shelter, and protection. In modern day humans, cues to high resource acquisition are presented in different ways. Cross-culturally, females show an increased preference for economic resources than do males, and those males who marry at a certain age tend to earn significantly more than males of the same age who do not marry.<ref>Buss, D. M. (1999). Evolutionary psychology: The new science of the mind. Needham Heights, MA: Allyn & Bacon.</ref><ref>Trivers, R. (1985). Social evolution. Menlo Park, CA: Benjamin/Cummings.</ref><ref name=\"Thomas\"/> As females often choose mates young, the amount of resources that they actually possess may be small. Therefore, females seek traits indicative of potential resource acquisition ability such as a good education, ambition, and career potential. If a male becomes unemployed or lazy, the female is far more likely to discontinue the relationship with them.<ref>Betzig, L. (1989). Causes of conjugal dissolution: A cross-cultural study. Current Anthropology, 30, 654- 76.</ref> In fact, even clothing can act as a cue for sexual selection, with females being more willing to engage in relationships with men wearing high status clothing.<ref>Townsend, J.

The four dimensions are:\n\n*Love vs. Status/Resources\u2014trade-off between a loving relationship and a partner with adequate resources and status\n*Dependable/Stable vs. Good Looks/Health\u2014trade-off between choosing an emotionally stable partner and one that is physically attractive\n*Education/Intelligence vs. Desire for Home/Children\u2014trade-off between educational factors and a range of family matters like wanting of kids and chastity[[File:You may now kiss the bride.jpg|thumb|Long term relationship success has been found to have four important factors]]\n*Sociability vs. Similar Religion\u2014tradeoff between a partner who is sociable and a partner that is religiously similar or compatible.\n\nThe four dimensions found imply individuals considering a relationship weigh the importance of the two sides of each dimension for a long term relationship.  For example, the higher a person scores on the Love vs. Status/Resources scale, the more that person is extroverted and the more emphasis they place on Love.  A person scoring lower would be an introvert and place more emphasis on Status/Resources.  Analogous reasoning applies to the other three dimensions, too, the first named concept being the higher valued end of the continuum and the second-named being the lower end.  Negative scores indicate direction but not value of the concept.\n\nThere were several gender differences observed in the study.  For instance, men seemed to rate Love vs Status/Resources higher in importance in relation to women, meaning men place more of an emphasis on mutual love while women place more of an emphasis on Status/Resources.<ref name=\"Shackelford\"/> Women rated the other three dimensions higher in importance.  A majority of cases saw women rate Dependable/Stable vs. Good Looks/Health higher, implying a stable personality is more desirable to women than a physically attractive mate.<ref name=\"Shackelford\"/> Education/Intelligence vs. Desire for Home/Children was also rated higher, showing that similar educational background and political views are more important than home life, and a small number of cases had women rank Sociability vs. Similar Religion higher (a pleasing disposition is more important than sharing religious beliefs).<ref name=\"Shackelford\"/>\n\nIn sum, men appear to value physical attractiveness, health, and a want for home life and children in their long-term mates, whereas women appear to value maturity, dependability, education, social status, and financial stability.\n\n==Mate preference priorities==\nResearch has attempted to assess which mate preferences men and women prioritize when selecting mates. Such studies typically involve an element of forced choice, such as asking participants to \"design\" their ideal partner using a fixed budget. When budgets are small, participants tend to prioritise those characteristics historically necessary for successful reproduction and relationship functioning - including physical attractiveness, social status, and kindness.<ref>Li, N.

The title [[allusion|alludes]] to one of [[Zeno's paradoxes|Zeno's paradoxes of motion]], in which Achilles could never overtake the tortoise in a race. In Carroll's dialogue, the tortoise challenges Achilles to use the force of logic to make him accept the conclusion of a simple deductive argument. Ultimately, Achilles fails, because the clever tortoise leads him into an [[infinite regression]].\n\n==Summary of the dialogue==\nThe discussion begins by considering the following logical argument:\n* ''A'': \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\" ([[Euclidean relation]], a weakened form of the [[transitive property]])\n* ''B'': \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* Therefore, ''Z'': \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nThe Tortoise asks Achilles whether the conclusion logically follows from the premises, and Achilles grants that it obviously does. The Tortoise then asks Achilles whether there might be a reader of [[Euclid]] who grants that the argument is ''logically valid'', as a ''sequence'', while denying that ''A'' and ''B'' are true. Achilles accepts that such a reader might exist, and that he would hold that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true, while not yet accepting that ''A'' and ''B'' are true (that is, a reader who denies the premises).\n\nThe Tortoise then asks Achilles whether a second kind of reader might exist, who accepts that ''A'' and ''B'' are true, but who does ''not'' yet accept the principle that ''if'' ''A'' and ''B'' are both true, ''then'' ''Z'' must be true. Achilles grants the Tortoise that this second kind of reader might also exist. The Tortoise, then, asks Achilles to treat the Tortoise as a reader of this second kind. Achilles must now logically compel the Tortoise to accept that ''Z'' must be true. (The tortoise is a reader who denies the argument form itself; the [[syllogism]]'s conclusion, structure, or validity.)\n\nAfter writing down ''A'', ''B'', and ''Z'' in his notebook, Achilles asks the Tortoise to accept the hypothetical:\n* ''C'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n\nThe Tortoise agrees to accept ''C'', if Achilles will write down what it has to accept in his notebook, making the new argument:\n* ''A'': \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* ''B'': \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* ''C'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n* Therefore, ''Z'': \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nBut now that the Tortoise accepts premise ''C'', it still refuses to accept the expanded argument. When Achilles demands that \"If you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'', you must accept ''Z'',\" the Tortoise remarks that that's ''another'' hypothetical proposition, and suggests even if it accepts ''C'', it could still fail to conclude ''Z'' if it did not see the truth of:\n* ''D'': \"If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' are true, ''Z'' must be true\"\n\nThe Tortoise continues to accept each hypothetical premise once Achilles writes it down, but denies that the conclusion necessarily follows, since each time it denies the hypothetical that if all the premises written down so far are true, ''Z'' must be true:\n{{quote|\"And at last we've got to the end of this ideal racecourse! Now that you accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', ''of course'' you accept ''Z''.\"\n\n\"Do I?\" said the Tortoise innocently. \"Let's make that quite clear. I accept ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D''. Suppose I ''still'' refused to accept ''Z''?\"\n\n\"Then Logic would take you by the throat, and ''force'' you to do it!\" Achilles triumphantly replied. \"Logic would tell you, 'You can't help yourself. Now that you've accepted ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'', you must accept ''Z''!' So you've no choice, you see.\"\n\n\"Whatever Logic is good enough to tell me is worth ''writing down'',\" said the Tortoise. \"So enter it in your notebook, please. We will call it\n{{block indent|(''E'') If ''A'' and ''B'' and ''C'' and ''D'' are true, ''Z'' must be true.}}\n\nUntil I've granted that, of course I needn't grant ''Z''. So it's quite a necessary step, you see?\"\n\n\"I see,\" said Achilles; and there was a touch of sadness in his tone.}}\n\nThus, the list of premises continues to grow without end, leaving the argument always in the form:\n* (1): \"Things that are equal to the same are equal to each other\"\n* (2): \"The two sides of this triangle are things that are equal to the same\"\n* (3): (1) and (2) \u21d2 (Z)\n* (4): (1) and (2) and (3) \u21d2 (Z)\n* ...\n* (''n''): (1) and (2) and (3) and (4) and ... and (''n'' \u2212 1) \u21d2 (''Z'')\n* Therefore, (''Z''): \"The two sides of this triangle are equal to each other\"\n\nAt each step, the Tortoise argues that even though he accepts all the premises that have been written down, there is some further premise (that if all of (1)&ndash;(''n'') are true, then (''Z'') must be true) that it still needs to accept before it is compelled to accept that (''Z'') is true.\n\n==Explanation==\nLewis Carroll was showing that there is a regressive problem that arises from ''[[modus ponens]]'' deductions. \n:<math>\\frac{P \\to Q,\\; P}{\\therefore Q}</math>\nOr, in words: proposition ''P'' (is true) implies ''Q'' (is true), and given ''P'', therefore ''Q''.\n\nThe regress problem arises because a prior principle is required to explain logical principles, here modus ponens, and once ''that'' principle is explained, ''another'' principle is required to explain ''that'' principle. Thus, if the causal chain is to continue, the argument falls into infinite regress. However, if a formal system is introduced where modus ponens is simply a [[rule of inference]] defined within the system, then it can be abided by simply by reasoning within the system. In analogy, chess is played according to a particular set of rules, and when a person plays chess, he cannot question or beg to differ from the given rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very framework of the game. That is not to say that the chess player agrees with these rules (consider for example, rule changes such as ''[[en passant]]''). Likewise, a formal system of logic consists of inference rules that are to be followed by the user of the system, and when a person reasons according to this formal system, he cannot question or differ from these inference rules, but must instead abide by them because they form the very constituents of the system. That is not to say that the user reasoning according to this formal system agrees with these rules (consider for example, the constructivist's rejection of the [[Law of the Excluded Middle]] and the dialethist's rejection of the [[Law of noncontradiction]]). In this way, formalising logic as a system can be considered as a response to the problem of infinite regress: ''modus ponens'' is placed as a rule within the system, the validity of ''modus ponens'' is eschewed to without the system.\n\nIn propositional logic the logical implication is defined as follows:\n\nP implies Q  if and only if the proposition ''not P or Q'' is a [[Tautology (logic)|tautology]].\n\nHence de modo ponente, [P \u2227 (P \u2192 Q)] \u21d2 Q, is a valid logical conclusion according to the definition of logical implication just stated. Demonstrating the logical implication simply translates into verifying that the compound truth table produces a tautology. But the tortoise does not accept on faith the rules of propositional logic that this explanation is founded upon. He asks that these rules, too, be subject to logical proof. The Tortoise and Achilles do not agree on any definition of logical implication.\n\nIn addition, the story hints at problems with the propositional solution. Within the system of propositional logic, no proposition or variable carries any semantic content. The moment any proposition or variable takes on semantic content, the problem arises again because semantic content runs outside the system. Thus, if the solution is to be said to work, then it is to be said to work solely within the given formal system, and not otherwise.\n\nSome logicians (Kenneth Ross, Charles Wright) draw a firm distinction between the [[material conditional|conditional connective]] and the [[Logical consequence|implication relation]]. These logicians use the phrase ''not p or q'' for the conditional connective and the term ''implies'' for an asserted implication relation.\n\n==Discussion==\nSeveral philosophers have tried to resolve Carroll's paradox. [[Bertrand Russell]] discussed the paradox briefly in [http://fair-use.org/bertrand-russell/the-principles-of-mathematics/s.38 \u00a7 38 of ''The Principles of Mathematics''] (1903), distinguishing between ''implication'' (associated with the form \"if ''p'', then ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''unasserted'' propositions, and ''inference'' (associated with the form \"''p'', therefore ''q''\"), which he held to be a relation between ''asserted'' propositions; having made this distinction, Russell could deny that the Tortoise's attempt to treat ''inferring'' ''Z'' from ''A'' and ''B'' as equivalent to, or dependent on, agreeing to the ''hypothetical'' \"If ''A'' and ''B'' are true, then ''Z'' is true.\"\n\nThe [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] philosopher [[Peter Winch]] discussed the paradox in ''The Idea of a Social Science and its Relation to Philosophy'' (1958), where he argued that the paradox showed that \"the actual process of drawing an inference, which is after all at the heart of logic, is something which cannot be represented as a logical formula ... Learning to infer is not just a matter of being taught about explicit logical relations between propositions; it is learning ''to do'' something\" (p.&nbsp;57). Winch goes on to suggest that the moral of the dialogue is a particular case of a general lesson, to the effect that the proper ''application'' of rules governing a form of human activity cannot itself be summed up with a set of ''further'' rules, and so that \"a form of human activity can never be summed up in a set of explicit precepts\" (p.&nbsp;53).\n\nCarroll's dialogue is apparently the first description of an obstacle to [[conventionalism]] about logical truth,<ref name=\"Maddy\">{{cite journal | title=The Philosophy of Logic | author=[[Penelope Maddy|Maddy, P.]] | journal=Bulletin of Symbolic Logic |date=December 2012  | volume=18 | issue=4 | pages=481\u2013504 | doi=10.2178/bsl.1804010 | jstor=23316289}}</ref> later reworked in more sober philosophical terms by [[Willard Van Orman Quine|W.V.O.

He further states that it is the inconceivability of (i.e. an observer\u2019s inability to consider) how inconsistency could exist within points of space that is the origin and basis for the truth of logic and the force which compels observers to accept logical truth. This inconceivability is thought to act as a counter-force to the force of an observer\u2019s continued consideration, containing them within a valid argument and forcing them to accept the truth of logical inference. A valid logical argument, according to Primus, is one whose propositions, either implicitly could or explicitly do, represent points of physical space, and which do not describe or require an inconsistency within said space for them to be true.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Primus|first=|date=2019|title=The inconceivability of inconsistency within space as the basis of logic.|url=|journal=Dialogue|volume=62(1)|pages=1-26|issn=0012-2246|via=}}</ref> \u00a0\n\n==See also==\n*{{annotated link|Deduction theorem}}\n*{{annotated link|Homunculus argument}}\n*{{annotated link|M\u00fcnchhausen trilemma}}\n*{{annotated link|Paradox}}\n*{{annotated link|Regress argument}}\n*{{annotated link|Rule of inference}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite journal|last1=Carroll|first1=Lewis|title=What the Tortoise Said to Achilles|journal=Mind|date=1895|volume=104|issue=416|pages=691\u2013693|jstor=2254477|doi=10.1093/mind/104.416.691}}  Reprinted in ''The Penguin Complete Lewis Carroll'' (Harmondsworth, Penguin, 1982), pp 1104\u20131108.\n* [[Douglas Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Douglas]].

In 1999, Sir [[Andrew Motion]], [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], listed it as the greatest song lyric ever written.\n\nDylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965, under the working title of \"Freeze Out\", but was dissatisfied with the results. When the ''Blonde on Blonde'' recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966, Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians, and decided to release this performance. All of the alternate versions of the song have been officially released, but some only on a limited edition collectors set: many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio [[outtakes]], and two others are live performances from his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 world tour]].\n\nNumerous artists have recorded [[cover version]]s of the song, including the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\n==Recording==\n[[Clinton Heylin]] places the writing of \"Visions of Johanna\" in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] with his pregnant wife [[Sara Dylan|Sara]]. Heylin notes that \"in this d\u00e9class\u00e9 hotel\u2026the heat pipes ''still'' cough\", referring to a line from the song.<ref name = \"Heylin273\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=273\u2013279}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Visions of Johanna (Bobdylan.com)}}</ref> [[Greil Marcus]] reports that when the song was first released, \"the story was that the song had been written during the great [[Northeast blackout of 1965|east coast blackout of November 9, 1965]].\"<ref name = \"Marcus\">{{harvnb|Marcus|2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Dylan performs with [[The Band]] on their [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|1974 tour]]. Dylan's first attempt to record \"Visions of Johanna\" in 1965 was backed by members of this group, known in their earlier incarnation as The Hawks.]]\nDylan first recorded this song, backed by [[The Band#With Bob Dylan|The Hawks]], in the CBS New York recording studio, on November 30, 1965, announcing his new composition with the words: \"This is called 'Freeze Out'.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=110\u2013113}}</ref> Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the \"air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched...full of whispering and muttering.\"<ref name=\"Gill97\">{{harvnb|Gill|1998|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> According to Marcus, Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words, \"Seems like a freeze-out.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\nSome of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line \"He examines the nightingale's code\". Historian [[Sean Wilentz]], for his book ''Dylan In America'', listened closely to full studio tapes of the ''Blonde on Blonde'' sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted \"Visions of Johanna\" played. At one point, Dylan says: \"It's not [[hard rock]], The only thing in it that's hard is [[Robbie Robertson|Robbie]].\" Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan \"quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on ''Blonde on Blonde''\u2014and it is still not right.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/>  Several complete takes of the song<ref name = \"Heylin277\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=277}}</ref> were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorodetsky|2005}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Visions_Of_Johanna.ogg|title=Visions of Johanna|description=Describing \"Visions of Johanna\" as \"Dylan's most haunting and complex love song and his finest poem\", [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] suggests that Dylan \"constantly seeks to transcend the physical world, to reach the ideal where the visions of Johanna become real\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\">{{harvnb|Shelton|2011|p=225}}</ref>}}\"Visions of Johanna\" fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer, [[Bob Johnston]], to move the recording sessions to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio, on February 14, 1966, the ''Blonde on Blonde'' version of the song was recorded. In an interview with Andy Gill, [[Al Kooper]] has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan's vocal.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Kooper added that \"it's very important what [[Joe South|Joe South's]] bass is doing in that\"; Kooper described it as \"this throbbing...rhythmically amazing bass part\".<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Other backing musicians were [[Charlie McCoy]], guitar, [[Wayne Moss]], guitar, and [[Kenneth Buttrey]] on drums.<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner|2011}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances and studio outtakes==\n[[File:Ginsberg-dylan.jpg|thumb|250px|Dylan plays a song to Allen Ginsberg during the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] of 1975. Ginsberg's poetic technique has been cited as an influence on Dylan at the time he wrote \"Visions of Johanna\".]]\nDylan first performed \"Visions of Johanna\" in public on December 4, 1965, at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]]. Present at this concert was [[Joan Baez]], who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, \"He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and [[Bobby Neuwirth|Neuwirth]] told him I was there that night and he performed it.\"<ref name = \"Heylin275\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=275}}</ref> Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was [[Allen Ginsberg]], who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg to be an important influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the [[Beat Generation|Beat poet]].<ref name = \"Heylin275\"/>\n\nAll live versions of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. Dylan's performance of the song at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]] on May 26, 1966, appeared on ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', released in 1985. Asked by [[Cameron Crowe]], for the liner notes for ''Biograph'', how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, \"I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual.\"<ref name = \"Crowe\">{{harvnb|Crowe|1985}}</ref> A performance of the song recorded at the [[Manchester]] [[Free Trade Hall]] on May 17, 1966, was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{harvnb|Glover|1998}}</ref>  In addition, a May 6, 1966, performance of the song, recorded in Belfast, was included on ''Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections'', released in 2018.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, [[Legacy Recordings]] released a 36-CD boxed set, ''[[The 1966 Live Recordings]]'', which comprises every known recording of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1966 concert tour.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-bob-dylan-1966-live-recordings-20160927-snap-story.html| title = All of Bob Dylan's 1966 live shows in 36-CD box set due Nov. 11| author = Lewis, Randy| date = September 27, 2016| accessdate = September 28, 2016| work = Los Angeles Times}}</ref> The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains, New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert in London on May 27.

Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/>\n\nClinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song. Written around the time of Dylan's marriage to Sara Lownds, Heylin describes it as \"one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/> Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover, Heylin speculates that \"it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse\" who, in the song, is \"not here\". For Heylin, the triumph of the song lies in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/>\n\nDylan critic [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] also praises the subtlety of the song. Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is \"about\", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up \"abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2000|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nRobert Shelton called \"Visions of Johanna\" one of Dylan's major works. He writes that Dylan's technique of throwing out \"skittering images\" evokes \"a mind floating downstream\"; these \"non-sequential visions\" are the record of a fractured consciousness.<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/> Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal, the visions of Johanna, and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless. He suggests that the same paradox is explored by [[John Keats|Keats]] in his \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/>\n\n[[Mike Marqusee]] situates the song in New York City, \"a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape\".<ref name=marqusee206-207>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is \"too concise and too clear\". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet hungry for an authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. \"It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point.\"<ref name=marqusee206-207/>\n\nGuitarist and critic [[Bill Janovitz]] also emphasizes the urban, unreal quality of \"Visions of Johanna\", calling it a \"sprawling epic\". \"The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, as well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'.\" For Janovitz, this  could \"possibly be a swipe at a critic\".<ref name=\"AllMusicJanovitz\">{{harvnb|Janovitz||}}</ref>\n\nLiterary critic [[Christopher Ricks]], in his study of Dylan's work, pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines:\n\n::::''He\u2019s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all''\n::::''Muttering small talk at the wall while I\u2019m in the hall''\n\nRicks writes that the phrase \"and all\" turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of \"aggression and baffled anger\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ricks|2003|pp=487\u2013488}}</ref>\n\nTrying to unravel the mystery of the song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions, rather than external ones: \"Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent\u2014isn't it obvious that whoever wrote \"Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?\" already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you? What are you doing here?\" Evoking the drugged, urban milieu of the song, Marcus writes of \"People wandering from one corner of a loft to another, doped, drunk, half-awake, fast asleep, no point to the next breath, let alone the next step.\" For Marcus, \"'Visions of Johanna' makes a narrative solely out of atmosphere.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe song has been described by several critics as a masterpiece.<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/><ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/><ref name=\"Gill97\"/> In 2004, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine placed the song at No.&nbsp;404 on their list of [[the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time]],<ref>{{harvnb|500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2004): 401\u2013500}}</ref> commenting that Dylan \"never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966.\" (When ''Rolling Stone'' updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.&nbsp;413.)<ref>{{harvnb|500 Greatest Songs of All Time (2010): #413 \"Visions of Johanna\"}}</ref> In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, [[Andrew Motion]], chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written.

In 1999, Sir [[Andrew Motion]], [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]], listed it as the greatest song lyric ever written.\n\nDylan first recorded the song in New York City in November 1965, under the working title of \"Freeze Out\", but was dissatisfied with the results. When the ''Blonde on Blonde'' recording sessions moved to Nashville in February 1966, Dylan attempted the composition again with different musicians, and decided to release this performance. All of the alternate versions of the song have been officially released, but some only on a limited edition collectors set: many of them are November 1965 or later 1966 studio [[outtakes]], and two others are live performances from his [[Bob Dylan World Tour 1966|1966 world tour]].\n\nNumerous artists have recorded [[cover version]]s of the song, including the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Marianne Faithfull]] and [[Robyn Hitchcock]].\n\n==Recording==\n[[Clinton Heylin]] places the writing of \"Visions of Johanna\" in the fall of 1965, when Dylan was living in the [[Hotel Chelsea|Chelsea Hotel]] with his pregnant wife [[Sara Dylan|Sara]]. Heylin notes that \"in this d\u00e9class\u00e9 hotel\u2026the heat pipes ''still'' cough\", referring to a line from the song.<ref name = \"Heylin273\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|pp=273\u2013279}}</ref><ref>{{harvnb|Visions of Johanna (Bobdylan.com)}}</ref> [[Greil Marcus]] reports that when the song was first released, \"the story was that the song had been written during the great [[Northeast blackout of 1965|east coast blackout of November 9, 1965]].\"<ref name = \"Marcus\">{{harvnb|Marcus|2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Dylan and The Band - 1974.jpg|thumb|left|Dylan performs with [[The Band]] on their [[Bob Dylan and The Band 1974 Tour|1974 tour]]. Dylan's first attempt to record \"Visions of Johanna\" in 1965 was backed by members of this group, known in their earlier incarnation as The Hawks.]]\nDylan first recorded this song, backed by [[The Band#With Bob Dylan|The Hawks]], in the CBS New York recording studio, on November 30, 1965, announcing his new composition with the words: \"This is called 'Freeze Out'.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\">{{harvnb|Wilentz|2009|pp=110\u2013113}}</ref> Andy Gill notes that this working title captures the \"air of nocturnal suspension in which the verse tableaux are sketched...full of whispering and muttering.\"<ref name=\"Gill97\">{{harvnb|Gill|1998|pp=97\u201399}}</ref> According to Marcus, Dylan introduced the song in live performances in 1966 with the words, \"Seems like a freeze-out.\"<ref name = \"Marcus\"/>\n\nSome of the New York recordings were uptempo and contain in the fifth verse the additional line \"He examines the nightingale's code\". Historian [[Sean Wilentz]], for his book ''Dylan In America'', listened closely to full studio tapes of the ''Blonde on Blonde'' sessions, and describes how Dylan guided the New York backing musicians through fourteen takes, trying to explain how he wanted \"Visions of Johanna\" played. At one point, Dylan says: \"It's not [[hard rock]], The only thing in it that's hard is [[Robbie Robertson|Robbie]].\" Analyzing the evolution of the song in the New York recording session, Wilentz writes that Dylan \"quiets things down, inching closer to what will eventually appear on ''Blonde on Blonde''\u2014and it is still not right.\"<ref name=\"Wilentz110\"/>  Several complete takes of the song<ref name = \"Heylin277\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=277}}</ref> were recorded on November 30, including one with an uptempo rock beat, containing harpsichord accompaniment, and another with a march-like tempo, which was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 7: No Direction Home: The Soundtrack]]'' in 2005.<ref>{{harvnb|Gorodetsky|2005}}</ref>\n\n{{Listen|filename=Visions_Of_Johanna.ogg|title=Visions of Johanna|description=Describing \"Visions of Johanna\" as \"Dylan's most haunting and complex love song and his finest poem\", [[Robert Shelton (critic)|Robert Shelton]] suggests that Dylan \"constantly seeks to transcend the physical world, to reach the ideal where the visions of Johanna become real\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\">{{harvnb|Shelton|2011|p=225}}</ref>}}\"Visions of Johanna\" fell into place when Dylan was persuaded by his producer, [[Bob Johnston]], to move the recording sessions to [[Nashville, Tennessee]]. During his first day in the CBS Nashville studio, on February 14, 1966, the ''Blonde on Blonde'' version of the song was recorded. In an interview with Andy Gill, [[Al Kooper]] has said that he and guitarist Robbie Robertson became sensitive to the nuances of Dylan's vocal.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Kooper added that \"it's very important what [[Joe South|Joe South's]] bass is doing in that\"; Kooper described it as \"this throbbing...rhythmically amazing bass part\".<ref name=\"Gill97\"/> Other backing musicians were [[Charlie McCoy]], guitar, [[Wayne Moss]], guitar, and [[Kenneth Buttrey]] on drums.<ref>{{harvnb|Bj\u00f6rner|2011}}</ref>\n\n==Live performances and studio outtakes==\n[[File:Ginsberg-dylan.jpg|thumb|250px|Dylan plays a song to Allen Ginsberg during the [[Rolling Thunder Revue]] of 1975. Ginsberg's poetic technique has been cited as an influence on Dylan at the time he wrote \"Visions of Johanna\".]]\nDylan first performed \"Visions of Johanna\" in public on December 4, 1965, at the [[Berkeley Community Theatre]]. Present at this concert was [[Joan Baez]], who believed the lyrics referred to her. She said, \"He'd just written 'Visions of Johanna', which sounded very suspicious to me...he'd never performed it before and [[Bobby Neuwirth|Neuwirth]] told him I was there that night and he performed it.\"<ref name = \"Heylin275\">{{harvnb|Heylin|2009|p=275}}</ref> Heylin suggests that if Dylan performed it for anyone that night it was [[Allen Ginsberg]], who was also present. Heylin argues Dylan considered Ginsberg to be an important influence on his songwriting at this juncture, and was keen to showcase the song for the [[Beat Generation|Beat poet]].<ref name = \"Heylin275\"/>\n\nAll live versions of the song recorded during Dylan's 1966 tour of England have been released. Dylan's performance of the song at [[London]]'s [[Royal Albert Hall]] on May 26, 1966, appeared on ''[[Biograph (album)|Biograph]]'', released in 1985. Asked by [[Cameron Crowe]], for the liner notes for ''Biograph'', how he could remember the words of such a complex song in live performance, Dylan responded, \"I could remember a song without writing it down because it was so visual.\"<ref name = \"Crowe\">{{harvnb|Crowe|1985}}</ref> A performance of the song recorded at the [[Manchester]] [[Free Trade Hall]] on May 17, 1966, was released on ''[[The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966, The \"Royal Albert Hall\" Concert|The Bootleg Series Vol. 4: Bob Dylan Live 1966]]'' in 1998.<ref>{{harvnb|Glover|1998}}</ref>  In addition, a May 6, 1966, performance of the song, recorded in Belfast, was included on ''Live 1962-1966: Rare Performances From The Copyright Collections'', released in 2018.\n\nOn November 11, 2016, [[Legacy Recordings]] released a 36-CD boxed set, ''[[The 1966 Live Recordings]]'', which comprises every known recording of Bob Dylan\u2019s 1966 concert tour.<ref>{{cite web| url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-bob-dylan-1966-live-recordings-20160927-snap-story.html| title = All of Bob Dylan's 1966 live shows in 36-CD box set due Nov. 11| author = Lewis, Randy| date = September 27, 2016| accessdate = September 28, 2016| work = Los Angeles Times}}</ref> The recordings commence with the concert in White Plains, New York on February 5, 1966, and end with the [[Royal Albert Hall]] concert in London on May 27.

Ultimately, for Gill, the song seeks to convey how the artist is compelled to keep striving to pursue some elusive vision of perfection.<ref name=\"Gill97\"/>\n\nClinton Heylin has described what he construes as the strange circumstances surrounding the song. Written around the time of Dylan's marriage to Sara Lownds, Heylin describes it as \"one of the oddest songs ever written by a man who has just tied the knot and is enjoying a brief honeymoon in the city\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/> Noting that the song is an elegy for a past lover, Heylin speculates that \"it is awfully tempting to see Johanna as his muse\" who, in the song, is \"not here\". For Heylin, the triumph of the song lies in \"the way Dylan manages to write about the most inchoate feelings in such a vivid, immediate way\".<ref name = \"Heylin273\"/>\n\nDylan critic [[Michael Gray (author)|Michael Gray]] also praises the subtlety of the song. Gray acknowledges that it is difficult to say what this song is \"about\", since it is at once indefinable and precise. For Gray, its principal achievement lies in the way it confuses categories, using language to be simultaneously serious and flippant, delicate and coarse, and mixing up \"abstract neo-philosophy and figurative phraseology\".<ref>{{harvnb|Gray|2000|pp=154\u2013155}}</ref>\n\nRobert Shelton called \"Visions of Johanna\" one of Dylan's major works. He writes that Dylan's technique of throwing out \"skittering images\" evokes \"a mind floating downstream\"; these \"non-sequential visions\" are the record of a fractured consciousness.<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/> Shelton argues that the song explores a hopeless quest to reach an ideal, the visions of Johanna, and yet without this quest life becomes meaningless. He suggests that the same paradox is explored by [[John Keats|Keats]] in his \"[[Ode on a Grecian Urn]]\".<ref name=\"Shelton225\"/>\n\n[[Mike Marqusee]] situates the song in New York City, \"a flickering, electric, ghostly, cityscape\".<ref name=marqusee206-207>{{harvnb|Marqusee|2005|pp=206\u2013207}}</ref> Dylan describes himself stranded in a fog of detachment which provides a haven, and at the same time is pained by a piercing clarity: an unmediated response that is \"too concise and too clear\". For Marqusee, Dylan describes his predicament, suspended between freedom and slavery, yet hungry for an authentic experience. Johanna and Louise are objects of desire and yearning. \"It is their elusiveness and unreality that's the point.\"<ref name=marqusee206-207/>\n\nGuitarist and critic [[Bill Janovitz]] also emphasizes the urban, unreal quality of \"Visions of Johanna\", calling it a \"sprawling epic\". \"The journey takes Dylan through lofts, the D train, a museum, empty lots, and through snippets of overheard conversation, as well as a discussion with some 'little boy lost', who 'takes himself so seriously', and who is 'so useless and all/muttering small talk at the wall'.\" For Janovitz, this  could \"possibly be a swipe at a critic\".<ref name=\"AllMusicJanovitz\">{{harvnb|Janovitz||}}</ref>\n\nLiterary critic [[Christopher Ricks]], in his study of Dylan's work, pinpoints the emotional effect of these same lines:\n\n::::''He\u2019s sure got a lotta gall to be so useless and all''\n::::''Muttering small talk at the wall while I\u2019m in the hall''\n\nRicks writes that the phrase \"and all\" turns a mood of helplessness into a sense of \"aggression and baffled anger\".<ref>{{harvnb|Ricks|2003|pp=487\u2013488}}</ref>\n\nTrying to unravel the mystery of the song, Greil Marcus writes that the song is concerned with internal questions, rather than external ones: \"Line by line, 'Blowin' in the Wind' is pious, or falsely innocent\u2014isn't it obvious that whoever wrote \"Yes, 'n' how many seas must a white dove sail / Before she sleeps in the sand?\" already knows the answer, assuming he, or anyone, can actually bring themselves to care about such a precious question? But 'Visions of Johanna' is asking different sorts of questions. Such as: Where are you? Who are you?

Thus, one's own mate value can influence trait and mate preferences, it has been shown that an individual will show preference for another who has a similar mate value, to avoid rejection.<ref>{{cite journal|authors=Tadinac, M., & Hromatko, I. |year=2007 |title=Own mate value and relative importance of a potential mate's qualities |journal=Studia Psychologica |volume=49 |issue=3) |pages=251\u2013264 |url=http://search.proquest.com/openview/b8ef8e3aec42f12da219e90c47138f73/1?}}</ref> Specifically, one could infer that one's own mate value has a direct impact upon partner choice through the biological market theory.

Natural selection has accentuated these preferences, leading to the evolution of mate values in relation to what females find desirable in their male counterparts.\n\n== Cross cultural differences ==\nCross-cultural influences in regards to mate value is another factor that have been studied extensively. When looking at body attributes of women such as waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), there has been research looking into the variation in preference. Douglas and Shepard (1998)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Douglas | first1 = W. Y. | last2 = Shepard | first2 = G.

However, one common feature across all the cultures is that women are always depicted with a lower WHR than men. Another study, by Buss et al. (1990),<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.

While there is some evidence for the importance of WHR and other physical attractiveness, Wetsman and Marlowe (1999)<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Wetsman | first1 = A. | last2 = Marlowe | first2 = F. | year = 1999 | title = How universal are preferences for female waist-to-hip ratios?

Various studies have been conducted to determine what these are, and the extent to which they exist. Researchers have found that men place a much bigger emphasis on the reproductive capacity of a mate in order to ensure they are able to produce offspring.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D. M. | last2 = Barnes | first2 = M. | year = 1986 | title = Preferences in human mate selection | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 50 | issue = 3| page = 559 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.50.3.559}}</ref> This reproductive capacity may be determined by focusing on the youth and attractiveness of a female.<ref name=\"Buss 1989\"/> The same study also found that females place a greater importance on financial prospects, status and other qualities that are needed for the long-term survival of the offspring when selecting a mate.\n\nBen Hamida, Mineka and Bailey (1998)<ref name=\"Ben Hamida et al 1998\">{{cite journal|last1=Ben Hamida|first1=S|last2=Mineka|first2=S|last3=Bailey|first3=J.

It seems that men tend to select traits such as attractiveness, youth and body shape and size, suggesting a preference for uncontrollable qualities. This however differs from what females focus on, which are traits that can be controlled, such as status, ambition, job prospects and physical strength.\n\nThese findings suggest that females are choosier when selecting a partner. Trivers (1972)<ref name=\"Trivers, R. 1972\">{{cite book|last1=Trivers|first1=R|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection |editor=B. Campbell|title=Sexual selection and the descent of man: 1871 - 1971|date=1972|publisher=Aldine|location=Chicago|pages=136\u2013179|chapter-url=http://aerg.canberra.edu.au/library/sex_general/1972_Trivers_parental_investment_and_sexual_selection.pdf}}</ref> suggested that this was the case due to [[parental investment]]. Parental investment refers to how many resources, physical and emotional, that a parent expends on their offspring. As females carry the offspring throughout pregnancy as well as physically giving birth to them, they invest more in the offspring than males do. Consequently, they require a mate with attributes that means they will be able to support and provide for the offspring once it has been born. Females are also choosier as they aim to select mates that they believe will stay present throughout the upbringing of the offspring.\n\nAlthough there are differences in mate values between males and females; Buss (1989) also found that traits such as intelligence and health are rated equally in terms of importance by both men and women.<ref name=\"Buss 1989\"/> This suggests that although there are obvious differences, there are also inherent similarities between the two.\n\n== Attractiveness ==\nWhen looking at what affects mate value, attractiveness and body features seem to be a consistent indicator with certain characteristics predicting an increased mate value.<ref>Singh, D. (2002). Female mate value at a glance: Relationship of waist-to-hip ratio to health, fecundity and attractiveness.

When males look for a long-term partner, they are looking for a healthy female with good reproductive value, and WHR is a good measure of both.<ref name=\"Little, A. C. 2001\"/> There is also a strong preference for bigger breasts, as well as a low WHR when considering both short and long-term partners.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Singh | first1 = D. | last2 = Young | first2 = R.

It seems that averageness and texture of the face play an important part in attractiveness of men. When looking at short-term mates, male attractiveness is rated higher than when looking for long-term mates, where other factors such as resources and financial prospects are more highly valued.<ref>Thornhill, R., & Gangestad, S.

Strategies such as mate guarding are often implemented to ensure investment and interest of mate is continued.\n\nFurthermore, short-term mating is a suggested technique in order to access a potential partner's mate value; a strategy implemented by the younger population prior to producing offspring.<ref name=\"Buss, D. M. 1993\"/> However, a change in strategy from short-term to long-term will occur when a potential partner has a desirable mate value.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David M. |year=1998 |title=Sexual strategies theory: Historical origins and current status |journal=Journal of Sex Research |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=19\u201331 |doi=10.1080/00224499809551914 |jstor=3813162|citeseerx=10.1.1.387.5277 }}</ref>\n\n==Mate guarding==\nMate value is also closely linked to [[Mate guarding in humans|mate guarding]]. Since physical attractiveness is an important component of mate value, there is a clear association between greater physical attractiveness, therefore high mate value, and high mate guarding. Buss (2002)<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buss|first1=David M. |year=2002 |title=Human mate guarding |journal=Neuroendocrinology Letters |volume=23 |issue=Suppl 4 |pages=23\u201329 |citeseerx=10.1.1.387.4420 |pmid=12496732 }}</ref> explains that if a partner's mate value is higher than one's own, there is a greater likelihood that competitors will be interested in their partner. This increased perception of threat from others, will consequently cause more intense mate guarding. A study by Holden et al. (2014),<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Holden|first1=C. J.|last2=Shackelford|first2=T. K.|last3=Zeigler-Hill|first3=V.|last4=Miner|first4=E. J.|last5=Kaighobadi|first5=F.|last6=Starratt|first6=V. G.|last7=Jeffery|first7=A. J.|last8=Buss|first8=D.

These researchers revealed that husbands who are held in lower esteem by their wives, will exhibit mate guarding behaviours. Therefore, it is clear to see that mate guarding occurs when one's own perceived mate value is low and one's partner's is high. The fear and threat of rivals and the possibility of infidelity causes individuals to guard their mates more closely and consequently maintaining their relationship.\n\n== Self-esteem ==\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, research states that self-esteem (SE) is a tool which individuals use to calculate their own mate value for long-term relationships.<ref name=\"Leary, M.

Supporting the [[Sociometer]] model of self-esteem, Leary et al. (1995),<ref name=\"Leary, M. R. 1995\"/> concluded that social inclusion or exclusion corresponded to the participants' level of self-esteem. For example, those who are rejected will experience a lower self-esteem.

Various studies have been conducted to determine what these are, and the extent to which they exist. Researchers have found that men place a much bigger emphasis on the reproductive capacity of a mate in order to ensure they are able to produce offspring.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">{{cite journal | last1 = Buss | first1 = D.

It seems that men tend to select traits such as attractiveness, youth and body shape and size, suggesting a preference for uncontrollable qualities. This however differs from what females focus on, which are traits that can be controlled, such as status, ambition, job prospects and physical strength.\n\nThese findings suggest that females are choosier when selecting a partner. Trivers (1972)<ref name=\"Trivers, R. 1972\">{{cite book|last1=Trivers|first1=R|chapter=Parental investment and sexual selection |editor=B.

Parental investment refers to how many resources, physical and emotional, that a parent expends on their offspring. As females carry the offspring throughout pregnancy as well as physically giving birth to them, they invest more in the offspring than males do. Consequently, they require a mate with attributes that means they will be able to support and provide for the offspring once it has been born. Females are also choosier as they aim to select mates that they believe will stay present throughout the upbringing of the offspring.\n\nAlthough there are differences in mate values between males and females; Buss (1989) also found that traits such as intelligence and health are rated equally in terms of importance by both men and women.<ref name=\"Buss 1989\"/> This suggests that although there are obvious differences, there are also inherent similarities between the two.\n\n== Attractiveness ==\nWhen looking at what affects mate value, attractiveness and body features seem to be a consistent indicator with certain characteristics predicting an increased mate value.<ref>Singh, D.

When males look for a long-term partner, they are looking for a healthy female with good reproductive value, and WHR is a good measure of both.<ref name=\"Little, A.

These researchers revealed that husbands who are held in lower esteem by their wives, will exhibit mate guarding behaviours. Therefore, it is clear to see that mate guarding occurs when one's own perceived mate value is low and one's partner's is high. The fear and threat of rivals and the possibility of infidelity causes individuals to guard their mates more closely and consequently maintaining their relationship.\n\n== Self-esteem ==\n\nFrom an evolutionary perspective, research states that self-esteem (SE) is a tool which individuals use to calculate their own mate value for long-term relationships.<ref name=\"Leary, M.

Having been exluded in the entire ''[[Reise, Reise]]'' tour, \"Engel\" returned to the setlists as the closing song of the ''[[Liebe ist f\u00fcr alle da]]'' tour, taking place during 2009 and 2011. This time around, vocalist Till Lindemann sang the chorus instead of Bobo's pre-recorded lines. For the [[pyrotechnics]], Lindemann wears a set of angel wings that shoot flames from the tips and have sparks go off along them.<ref>{{cite web |author1=nasbootlegs |title=RAMMSTEIN - Engel + Final live London 2010 Wembley Arena |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M9YkX7pBRm8 |website=YouTube |accessdate=6 December 2014}}</ref> Engel was the penultimate song on the setlist during the [[Made in Germany 1995\u20132011 (tour)|''Made in Germany 1995-2011'' tour]], and the [[Rammstein Tour 2016|tour]] in 2016.\n[[File:Till-ENGEL2.jpg|thumb|Engel in the LIFAD Tour]]\n[[File:Rammstein in Minsk, 2010.jpg|thumb|Rammstein playing \"Engel\" in [[Minsk]], Belarus]]\n\n==In other media==\nThe song was used during the end credits of the 1997 film, [[Mortal Kombat: Annihilation]], and also appears on its soundtrack.\n\n==Track listings==\n===Single===\n# Engel - 4:23\n# Sehnsucht - 4:02\n# Rammstein ([[Eskimos and Egypt|Eskimos & Egypt]] [[Radio edit|Radio Edit]]) - 3:40\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt [[Instrumental]] Edit) - 3:32\n# Rammstein (Original) - 4:25\n\n===Fan-Edition===\nA second single called '''''Engel (Fan-Edition)''''' was released on 23 May 1997.<ref>https://www.discogs.com/de/Rammstein-Engel-Fan-Edition/release/234361</ref> It includes different track listing from the original and a different artwork, showing singer Till Lindemann.\n# Engel (Extended Version) - 4:34\n# Feuerr\u00e4der (Live Demo Version 1994) - 4:47\n# Wilder Wein (Demo Version 1994) - 5:41\n# Rammstein (Eskimos & Egypt Instrumental) - 3:27\n\n==Charts==\n{{col-start}}\n{{col-2}}\n\n===Weekly charts===\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This was the first [[Volkswagen Group]] model to use the \"PQ34\" or \"A4\" [[Automobile platform|platform]], bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]], which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars.\n\nThe A3 was initially available only with a three-door [[hatchback]] body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both [[front-wheel drive|front]] and [[four-wheel drive]]. The [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] engines were [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]]. The Audi A3 was the eighth model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder.\n\nThe United Kingdom market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]] with [[unit injector]] \"Pumpe D\u00fcse\" (PD) technology and [[variable geometry turbocharger]]. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] used either the {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine, and the same [[Haldex Traction]]-based four-wheel-drive system as the [[Audi S3]] and the [[Audi TT]]. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body.\n\nIn late 2000, the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, on the {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.8 Turbo and the new {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.9 TDI.\n\nAudi's [[electronic stability control]], traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries.\n\nAlthough the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006.\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Front.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Rear.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1999-2000 Audi A3 (8L) 1.8 5-door hatchback 01.jpg|Audi A3 5-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:Audi A3 1.8 T (8L, Facelift) \u2013 Heckansicht, 29.

Originally launched only as a three-door [[hatchback]] with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new [[automobile platform]] (the [[Volkswagen A platform#PQ35|PQ35]] platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new [[petrol engine]]s with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6).\n\nIn mid-2003, the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 3.2&nbsp;L [[VR6 engine]] (for the first time) with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] on-demand four-wheel drive, and the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-auto gearbox]] were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2005, the \"S line\" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 quattro following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The A3 Sportback is {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370&nbsp;litres). It also received the new \"single frame\" front grille originally introduced in the [[Audi A8|A8 W12]], which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.\n\n====S3 (2006\u20132013)====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Audi s3 front.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3 door hatchback]]\n[[File:Audi s3 back white.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3-door hatchback]]\n\nIn August 2006, Audi announced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation\u2014''Typ'' 8P\u2014S3 is powered by a modified and uprated [[Volkswagen Group]]-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged [[gasoline direct injection|FSI]] [[petrol engine]], with a maximum output of {{convert|195|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. As with all [[Audi S and RS models|Audi S models]], the design was done in-house by [[quattro GmbH]]. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size ([[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] K04) and larger [[intercooler]]. The most powerful form of this engine, and [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive, makes for a {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 5.5&nbsp;seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] automatic transmissions with the S3.\n\nThe spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a \"quattro\" model, the S3 does not employ a [[Torsen]] centre differential (as in other common quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish [[Haldex Traction]] system in its on-demand [[four-wheel drive]] transmission, due to the [[transverse engine]] layout.\n\n====Safety====\n{{Euro NCAP |year=2003 |description=Audi A3, RHD 3-dr hatchback |reference=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a3_2003/176.aspx |reference_name=Euro NCAP test 2 |adult_stars=4 |adult_score=29 |child_stars=3 |child_score=35 |pedestrian_stars=1 |pedestrian_score=8 |align=left}}\nEuro NCAP tested a second generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, [[seatbelt pretensioner]]s and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. \"A poor result for a new car\" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.{{clear}}\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n| File:Audi A3 silver vl.jpg|2003\u20132005 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II front.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II rear.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:2008 Audi A3 Sport TDi 1.9 Rear.jpg|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 Sportback\n}}\n\n===2008 facelift===\nAudi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008.

The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were in-line with the automaker's new design philosophy.

This was the first [[Volkswagen Group]] model to use the \"PQ34\" or \"A4\" [[Automobile platform|platform]], bearing a close resemblance to the contemporary [[Volkswagen Golf Mk4]], which arrived a year later. Within three years, this platform was used for total of seven cars.\n\nThe A3 was initially available only with a three-door [[hatchback]] body, to present a more sporty image than the Golf, in both [[front-wheel drive|front]] and [[four-wheel drive]]. The [[inline-four engine|inline four-cylinder]] engines were [[transverse engine|transversely mounted]]. The Audi A3 was the eighth model in the Audi lineup to use five valves per cylinder.\n\nThe United Kingdom market first received the Audi A3 in November 1996.\n\nIn 1999, Audi expanded the range with the introduction of more powerful versions: a 1.8 turbo rated {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 1.9 [[Turbocharged Direct Injection|TDI]] [[diesel engine]] with [[unit injector]] \"Pumpe D\u00fcse\" (PD) technology and [[variable geometry turbocharger]]. The four-wheel-drive A3 1.8T [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] used either the {{convert|150|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} or {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} engine, and the same [[Haldex Traction]]-based four-wheel-drive system as the [[Audi S3]] and the [[Audi TT]]. Also in 1999, Audi also introduced a five-door body.\n\nIn late 2000, the A3 range was revised with new headlights and rear lamps, other minor cosmetic changes, an improved interior, and the introduction of a six-speed [[manual transmission|manual]] gearbox, on the {{convert|180|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.8 Turbo and the new {{convert|130|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} 1.9 TDI.\n\nAudi's [[electronic stability control]], traction-control, and brake force distribution computer became standard equipment in some countries.\n\nAlthough the first-generation Audi A3 was replaced in Europe in 2003, the first generation model continued to be sold in some markets. Production of the first generation model stopped in Brazil in 2006.\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Front.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1997 Audi A3 1.6 Rear.jpg|Audi A3 3-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:1999-2000 Audi A3 (8L) 1.8 5-door hatchback 01.jpg|Audi A3 5-door (pre-facelift)\n|File:Audi A3 1.8 T (8L, Facelift) \u2013 Heckansicht, 29.

Originally launched only as a three-door [[hatchback]] with four-cylinder engines, it featured a new [[automobile platform]] (the [[Volkswagen A platform#PQ35|PQ35]] platform), a redesigned and more spacious interior, new [[petrol engine]]s with [[gasoline direct injection|Fuel Stratified Injection]] (FSI), and standard six-speed manual gearboxes (except on the base 1.6).\n\nIn mid-2003, the line was updated with two sports-oriented models, a 2.0 Turbo-FSI version rated {{convert|200|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, and a 3.2&nbsp;L [[VR6 engine]] (for the first time) with {{convert|250|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. [[Haldex Traction]]-based [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] on-demand four-wheel drive, and the [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-auto gearbox]] were introduced as options (quattro is standard on the VR6) on models with engines over {{convert|140|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2005, the \"S line\" trim level, offering new decorative elements, became available and the three-door A3 received the same front end styling features as the Sportback model. For the first time, the A3 became available in the North American market, exclusively with the Sportback body, with the base 2.0 [[inline-four engine|inline-four]] FSI introduced in 2005 as a 2006 model, and the 3.2 VR6 quattro following.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The A3 Sportback is {{convert|80|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} longer than the base three-door body, and includes improved rear cabin space and a larger luggage compartment (370&nbsp;litres). It also received the new \"single frame\" front grille originally introduced in the [[Audi A8|A8 W12]], which was later adopted across the whole A3 range.\n\n====S3 (2006\u20132013)====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2018}}\n[[File:Audi s3 front.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3 door hatchback]]\n[[File:Audi s3 back white.jpg|thumb|left|Audi S3 3-door hatchback]]\n\nIn August 2006, Audi announced the second generation S3. Offered in three- and five-door body styles, the second generation\u2014''Typ'' 8P\u2014S3 is powered by a modified and uprated [[Volkswagen Group]]-sourced 2.0-litre turbocharged [[gasoline direct injection|FSI]] [[petrol engine]], with a maximum output of {{convert|195|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}. As with all [[Audi S and RS models|Audi S models]], the design was done in-house by [[quattro GmbH]]. The engine features uprated high-performance pistons, revised boost/fuel mapping, increased turbocharger size ([[K\u00fchnle, Kopp & Kausch|KKK]] K04) and larger [[intercooler]]. The most powerful form of this engine, and [[quattro (four-wheel-drive system)|quattro]] four-wheel drive, makes for a {{convert|0|-|100|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 5.5&nbsp;seconds, and an electronically limited top speed of {{convert|250|km/h|0|abbr=on}}. Audi offers both six-speed manual and six-speed [[Direct-Shift Gearbox|S-Tronic]] automatic transmissions with the S3.\n\nThe spring ratings and dampers were revised, along with the body kit. Like its predecessor, although badged a \"quattro\" model, the S3 does not employ a [[Torsen]] centre differential (as in other common quattro models), but instead uses the Swedish [[Haldex Traction]] system in its on-demand [[four-wheel drive]] transmission, due to the [[transverse engine]] layout.\n\n====Safety====\n{{Euro NCAP |year=2003 |description=Audi A3, RHD 3-dr hatchback |reference=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/audi_a3_2003/176.aspx |reference_name=Euro NCAP test 2 |adult_stars=4 |adult_score=29 |child_stars=3 |child_score=35 |pedestrian_stars=1 |pedestrian_score=8 |align=left}}\nEuro NCAP tested a second generation Audi A3 with front airbags, side airbags, [[seatbelt pretensioner]]s and load limiters as standard. Despite Audi increasing the protection inside the car for the driver and passengers, pedestrian safety actually got 33% worse compared to the first generation and Euro NCAP gave criticism for the car offering virtually no protection at all on the front end and scoring just one star from a possible four. \"A poor result for a new car\" was the verdict given for pedestrian safety after the test.{{clear}}\n\n{{gallery\n| width = 160\n| height = 100\n| File:Audi A3 silver vl.jpg|2003\u20132005 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II front.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:Audi A3 II rear.JPG|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 3-door\n| File:2008 Audi A3 Sport TDi 1.9 Rear.jpg|2005\u20132008 Audi A3 Sportback\n}}\n\n===2008 facelift===\nAudi introduced a number of changes to the A3 and S3 in 2008.

The facelifted model was first unveiled through a set of official images in April 2016. The new A3 sedan was given significant cosmetic updates, which were in-line with the automaker's new design philosophy. As a result, the 2017 Audi A3 sedan featured the Matrix LED headlamps that were earlier seen in the A8 flagship sedan and the R8 supercar. The front grille was also given a refreshed treatment that made the new A3 look like its elder siblings. Changes on the sides and rear were minimal, with only the taillights getting new LED treatment. There were multiple updates on the interiors as well, with a fully digital 12.3-inch instrument cluster screen placed behind the steering wheel available as an optional upgrade.

It is characterized by a \u201cselective response by animals to particular stimuli\u201d which can be observed as behavior.<ref name=\"Mate Choice, Bateson\">Bateson, Paul Patrick Gordon. \u201cMate Choice.\u201d Mate Choice, Cambridge University Press, 1985</ref> In other words, before an animal engages with a potential mate, they first evaluate various aspects of that mate which are indicative of quality\u2014such as the resources or phenotypes they have\u2014and evaluate whether or not those particular trait(s) are somehow beneficial to them. The evaluation will then incur a response of some sort.<ref name=\"Mate Choice, Bateson\" />\n\nThese mechanisms are a part of evolutionary change because they operate in a way that causes the qualities that are desired in a mate to be more frequently passed on to each generation over time. For example, if female peacocks desire mates who have a colourful plumage, then this trait will increase in frequency over time as male peacocks with a colourful plumage will have more [[reproductive success]].<ref>{{Cite journal |doi=10.1016/s0003-3472(05)80484-1 |title=Peahens prefer peacocks with elaborate trains |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=323\u2013331 |year=1991 |last1=Petrie |first1=Marion |last2=Halliday  |first2=Tim |authorlink2=Tim Halliday |last3=Sanders |first3=Carolyn  }}</ref> Further investigation of this concept, has found that it is in fact the specific trait of blue and green colour near the eyespot that seems to increase the females likelihood of mating with a specific peacock.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1093/beheco/art045 |title=Eye for an eyespot: How iridescent plumage ocelli influence peacock mating success |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=24 |issue=5 |pages=1048\u20131057 |year=2013 |last1=Dakin |first1=Roslyn |last2=Montgomerie |first2=Robert }}</ref>\n\nMate choice is one of two components of [[sexual selection]], the other being [[Sexual selection|intrasexual selection]]. Ideas on sexual selection were first introduced in 1871, by [[Charles Darwin]], then expanded on by [[Ronald Fisher]] in 1915. At present, there are five sub mechanisms that explain how mate choice has evolved over time. These are direct phenotypic benefits, sensory bias, the [[Fisherian runaway]] hypothesis, indicator traits and [[Genetics|genetic]] compatibility.\n\nIn the majority of systems where mate choice exists, one sex tends to be competitive with their same-sex members<ref name=Andersson1994>{{Cite book|title=Sexual Selection|last=Andersson|first=Malte|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=1994|isbn=|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}{{page needed|date=December 2018}}</ref> and the other sex is choosy (meaning they are selective when it comes to picking individuals to mate with).

It is preferable for an individual to choose a compatible mate of the same species, in order to maintain reproductive success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halliday |first=T.

He was perplexed by the elaborate ornamentation that males of some species have, because such features appeared to be detrimental to survival and to have negative consequences for reproductive success. Darwin proposed two explanations for the existence of such traits: these traits are useful in male-male combat or they are preferred by females.<ref>Darwin, C. (1871). ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex''. John Murray, London.</ref> This article focuses on the latter. Darwin treated natural selection and sexual selection as two different topics, although in the 1930s biologists defined sexual selection as being a part of natural selection.<ref>[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Miller, Geoffrey]] (2000). ''The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature'', London, Heineman, {{ISBN|0-434-00741-2}} (also Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-49516-1}}) p. 8</ref>\n\nIn 1915, [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote a paper on the evolution of female preference and [[secondary sexual characteristics]].<ref name=\"Fisher 1915\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = R.A. | year = 1915 | title = The evolution of sexual preference | url = | journal = Eugenic Review | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 184\u2013192 |pmc=2987134 | pmid=21259607}}</ref> Fifteen years later, he expanded this theory in a book called ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. There he described a scenario where feedback between mate preference and a trait results in elaborate characters such as the long tail of the male peacock (see [[Fisherian runaway]]).\n\nIn 1948, using ''[[Drosophila]]'' as a model, [[Angus John Bateman]] presented experimental evidence that male [[reproductive success]] is limited by the number of mates obtained, while female reproductive success is limited by the number of pregnancies that she can have in her lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bateman | first1 = A. | year = 1948 | title = Intra-sexual selection in ''Drosophila'' | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 2 | issue = Pt. 3| pages = 349\u2013368 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1948.21 | pmid = 18103134 }}</ref> Thus a female must be selective when choosing a mate because the quality of her offspring depends on it. Males must fight, in the form of intra-sexual competition, for the opportunity to mate because not all males will be chosen by females. This became known as [[Bateman's principle]], and although this was a major finding that added to the work of Darwin and Fisher, it was overlooked until [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] emphasised its importance in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Williams, G.C. (1966). ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''.

Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ{{page needed|date=December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, soon after Williams' revival of the subject, [[Robert L. Trivers]] presented his [[parental investment]] theory. Trivers defined parental investment as any investment made by the parent that benefits his or her current offspring at the cost of investment in future offspring. These investments include the costs of producing gametes as well as any other care or efforts that parents provide after birth or hatching. Reformulating Bateman's ideas, Trivers argued that the sex which exhibits less parental investment (not necessarily the male) will have to compete for mating opportunities with the sex that invests more. The differences in levels of parental investment create the condition that favours mating biases.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert L. |year=1972 |chapter=Parental Investment and Sexual Selection |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexualselection00camp/page/136 136\u2013179] |citeseerx=10.1.1.100.4543 |editor1-first=Bernard Grant |editor1-last=Campbell |title=Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, 1871\u20131971 |isbn=978-0-202-02005-1 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sexualselection00camp/page/136 }}</ref>\n\n== Direct and indirect benefits ==\nThe act of being choosy was likely selected for as a way to assess whether or not a potential partner\u2019s contribution(s) would be capable of producing and/or maintaining the viability of an offspring. Utilizing these behaviors usually results in two types of benefits to the individual who is being choosy:\n\n*  Direct benefits increase the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the choosy sex through direct material advantages or resources.

Traits perceived as attractive must reliably indicate broad genetic quality in order for selection to favor them and for preference to evolve. This is an example of indirect genetic benefits received by the choosy sex, because mating with such individuals will result in high-quality offspring. The indicator traits hypothesis is split into three highly related subtopics: the handicap theory of sexual selection, the good genes hypothesis, and the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis.\n\nPeople rate the importance of certain traits differently when referring to their own or to others' ideal long-term partners. Research suggests that women consider traits indicating genetic fitness as more important for their own partner, while prioritising traits that provide benefits to others for their sister's ideal partner.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/ebs0000060 |title=Sisterly love: Within-generation differences in ideal partner for sister and self |journal= Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences|volume=10 |pages=29\u201342 |year=2016 |last1=Biegler |first1=Robert |last2=Kennair |first2=Leif Edward Ottesen }}</ref>\n\nIndicator traits are condition-dependent and have associated costs. Therefore, individuals which can handle these costs well (''cf.'' \"I can do X [here, survive] with one hand tied behind my back\") should be desired by the choosy sex for their superior genetic quality. This is known as the '''handicap theory''' of sexual selection.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3 |pmid=1195756 |title=Mate selection \u2013 A selection for a handicap |journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology |volume=53 |issue=1 |pages=205\u2013214 |year=1975 |last1=Zahavi |first1=Amotz |citeseerx=10.1.1.586.3819 }}</ref>\n\nThe '''good genes hypothesis''' states that the choosy sex will mate with individuals who possess traits that signify overall genetic quality.

This patch varies in brightness among individuals because the pigments that produce the red color (carotenoids) are limited in the environment. Thus, males who have a high-quality diet will have brighter red plumage. In a manipulation experiment, female house finches were shown to prefer males with brighter red patches. Also, males with naturally brighter patches proved better fathers and exhibited higher offspring-feeding rates than duller males.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This study is heavily cited in the literature and it provides solid support for the indicator-traits hypothesis that is associated with direct benefits.\n\n=== Genetic compatibility ===\nGenetic compatibility refers to how well the genes of two parents function together in their offspring. Choosing genetically compatible mates could result in optimally fit offspring and notably affect reproductive fitness. However, the genetic compatibility model is limited to specific traits due to complex genetic interactions (e.g. [[major histocompatibility complex]] in humans and mice). The choosy sex must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.005 |pmid=16701361 |title=Genetic compatibility and sexual selection |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=157\u2013158 |year=2005 |last1=Puurtinen |first1=M. |last2=Ketola |first2=T. |last3=Kotiaho |first3=J. }}</ref> This makes testing components of genetic compatibility difficult and controversial.\n\n==== Role of major histocompatibility complex ====\n{{main|Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection}}\nA controversial but well-known experiment suggests that human females use body odor as an indicator of genetic compatibility. In this study, males were given a plain T-shirt to sleep in for two nights in order to provide a scent sample. College women were then asked to rate odors from several men, some with similar MHC (major histocompatibility complex) genes to their own and others with dissimilar genes. MHC genes code for receptors that identify foreign pathogens in the body so that the immune system may respond and destroy them. Since each different gene in the MHC codes for a different type of receptor, it is expected that females will benefit from mating with males who have more dissimilar MHC genes. This will ensure better resistance to parasites and disease in offspring. Researchers found that women tended to rate the odors higher if the male's genes were more dissimilar to their own. They concluded that the odors are influenced by the MHC and that they have consequences for mate choice in human populations today.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087 |pmid=7630893 |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

However, there are some examples of sex role reversals where females must compete with each other for mating opportunities with males. Species that exhibit parental care after the birth of their offspring have the potential to overcome the sex differences in parental investment (the amount of energy that each parent contributes per offspring) and lead to a reversal in sex roles.<ref name=Andersson1994/> The following are examples of male mate choice (sex role reversal) across several taxa.\n*[[Fish]]: Male fish typically display high levels of parental care (see [[pipefish]], [[scissortail sergeant]], and [[seahorses]]). This is because females will deposit their eggs in a special brooding pouch that the male possesses. She doesn't participate in parental care after this event. The male then has the burden of raising the offspring on his own which requires energy and time. Thus, males in these species must choose among competitive females for mating opportunities. Surveys across multiple species of pipefish suggest that the sex differences in the level of parental care may not be the only reason for the reversal. Mating systems (e. i. monogamy and polygamy) might also heavily influence the appearance of male mate choice.<ref>{{cite journal |last2=Anhesjo|first2=I. |last3=Berglund|first3=A. |last4=Rosenqvist |first4=G.|year=1992 |title=Pipefish and seahorses: Are they all sex role reversed? |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=7 |issue=7|pages=237\u2013241 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(92)90052-D |pmid=21236017|last1=Vincent|first1=A.}}</ref>\n*[[Amphibia]]n: Male [[Green and Black Poison Dart Frog|poison-arrow frogs]] (''Dendrobates auratus'') take on a very active parenting role.

(1942). ''Systematics and Origin of Species'', Belknap Press</ref> Mate choice behaviours are thought to be important forces that can result in speciation events because the strength of selection for attractive traits is often very strong. Speciation by this method occurs when a preference for some sexual trait shifts and produces a pre-zygotic barrier (preventing fertilisation). These processes have been difficult to test until recently with advances in genetic modelling.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.38.091206.095733 | title=Sexual Selection and Speciation | year=2007 | last1=Ritchie | first1=Michael G. | journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume=38 | pages=79\u2013102 }}</ref> Speciation by sexual selection is gaining popularity in the literature with increasing theoretical and empirical studies.\n\nThere is evidence of early speciation through mate preference in [[guppy|guppies]].

In contrast, southern males respond equally to both local and non-local songs. The fact that northern males exhibit differential recognition indicates that northern females tend not to mate with \"heterospecific\" males from the south; thus it is not necessary for the northern males to respond strongly to the song from a southern challenger. A barrier to gene flow exists from South to North as a result of the female choice, which can eventually lead to speciation.\n\n== Mate choice in humans ==\nIn humans, males and females differ in their strategies to acquire mates and focus on certain qualities. There are two main categories of strategies that both sexes utilize: short-term and long-term. Human mate choice depends on a variety of factors, such as ecology, demography, access to resources, rank/social standing, [[gene]]s, and [[Parasite-stress theory|parasite stress]].\n\nWhile there are a few common mating systems seen among humans, the amount of variation in mating strategies is relatively large. This is due to how humans evolved in diverse niches that were geographically and ecologically expansive. This diversity, as well as cultural practices and human consciousness, have all led to a large amount of variation in mating systems. Below are some of the overarching trends of female mate choice.\n\n=== Female mate choice ===\nAlthough, in humans, both males and females are selective in terms of whom they decide to mate with, as is seen in nature, females exhibit even more mate choice selection than males. However, relative to most other animals, female and male mating strategies are found to be more similar to one another than they are different. According to Bateman's principle of Lifespan Reproductive Success (LRS), human females display the least variance of the two sexes in their LRS due to their high obligatory [[parental investment]], that is a nine-month [[gestation]]al period, as well as [[lactation]] following birth in order to feed offspring so that their brain can grow to the required size.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Human Evolutionary Psychology|last=Barrett|first=Louise|last2=Dunbar|first2=Robin|last3=Lycett|first3=John|publisher=Palgrave|year=2002|isbn=978-0-333-72558-0|location=Hampshire|pages=|quote=|via=}}{{page needed|date=December 2018}}</ref>\n\nHuman female sexual selection can be examined by looking at ways in which males and females are sexually dimorphic, especially in traits that serve little other evolutionary purpose. For example, male traits such as the presence of beards, overall lower voice pitch, and average greater height are thought to be sexually selected traits as they confer benefits to either the women selecting for them, or to their offspring. Experimentally, women have reported a preference for men with beards and lower voices.<ref name=pmid11124875>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1523 |pmid=11124875 |title=Men's voices and women's choices |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=773\u2013780 |year=2000 |last1=Collins |first1=Sarah A. |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/714eecb01773b5e28e63a3f8ee572b0a2d411558 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00068-2 |title=The evolutionary psychology of physical attractiveness: Sexual selection and human morphology |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=395\u2013424 |year=1995 |last1=Barber |first1=Nigel }}</ref>\n\nFemale mate choice hinges on many different coinciding male traits, and the trade-off between many of these traits must be assessed. The ultimate traits most salient to female human mate choice, however, are parental investment, resource provision and the provision of good genes to offspring. Many phenotypic traits are thought to be selected for as they act as an indication of one of these three major traits. The relative importance of these traits when considering mate selection differ depending on the type of mating arrangement females engage in. Human women typically employ long-term mating strategies when choosing a mate, however they also engage in short-term mating arrangements, so their mate choice preferences change depending on the function of the type of arrangement.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n\n\n==== Short-term mating strategies ====\nWomen do not always seek out and engage in long-term mating arrangements. This is evidenced by factors such as the evolved male tendency to seek out multiple sexual partners\u2014a trait that could not have evolved if women were not also historically engaging in short-term arrangements<ref>B. A.

These resources may be food, protection for the woman and her children from aggressive men who may capture or sexually coerce them, or status, by providing the woman with a higher social standing. Women may also benefit from having several short-term mating arrangements through paternity confusion\u2014if the paternity of her offspring is not certain, she may be able to accrue resources from several men as a result of this uncertainty.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Genetic benefit hypothesis: Women may choose to engage in short-term mating arrangements in order to aid conception if her long-term partner is infertile, to gain superior genes to those of her long-term partner, or to acquire different genes to those of her partner and increase the genetic diversity of her offspring. This relates to what is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis]]; if a woman acquires genes from a high quality male, her offspring will likely have higher mate value, resulting in their increased reproductive success.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Mate expulsion and mate switching: Women may engage in a short-term mating arrangement in order to cause her long-term partner to end their relationship; in other words, to facilitate a break-up. Women may also use short-term mating if their current partner has depreciated in value, and they wish to 'trade-up' and find a partner that they believe has higher value.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Short-term for long-term goals: Women may use short-term sexual relationships in order to assess a mate's value as a long-term partner, or in the hopes that the short-term arrangement will result in one that is long-term.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Long-term mating strategies ====\nWhile there has been evidence and research to support the existence of short term mating in women, it has nevertheless been shown that women prefer long term partners over short term mates. This preference is due to women's tendency to invest and require more energy for parental care. In long-term mating arrangements, women typically look for males who will provide a high level of parental investment, and who can provide resources to the woman or to her offspring.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The provision of economic resources, or the potential to acquire many economic resources is the most obvious cue towards the ability of a man to provide resources, and women in the United States have been shown experimentally to rate the importance of their partner's financial status more highly than men.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, many other traits exist that may act as cues towards a man's ability to provide resources that have been sexually selected for in women's evolutionary history. These include older age\u2014older males have had more time to accrue resources\u2014industriousness, dependability and stability\u2014if a woman's long-term partner is not emotionally stable or is not dependable then their provision of resources to her and her offspring are likely to be inconsistent. Additionally, the costs associated with an emotionally unstable partner such as jealousy and manipulation may outweigh the benefits associated with the resources they are able to provide.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWomen's mate choice is not as straightforward as selecting a mate that displays all of her desired qualities. Often, potential mates will possess some qualities that are desirable and some that are not, so women must assess the relative costs and benefits of their potential partners' traits and 'trade off'. Women's mate choices will also be constrained by the context in which they are making them, resulting in conditional mate choices.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some of the conditions that may influence female mate choice include the woman's own perceived attractiveness, the woman's personal resources, mate copying and parasite stress.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Male mate choice ===\nGenerally, it is unusual for males within a [[species]] to be the choosy sex. There are many reasons for this. In humans, following [[sexual reproduction]], the female is obliged to endure a nine-month pregnancy and childbirth.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary Psychology, The New Science of Mind|last=Buss|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99212-6|location=New York|pages=103\u2013104|quote=|via=}}</ref> This means that females naturally provide a greater [[parental investment]] to offspring, than males.<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\":10\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2011.07.012 |pmid=21890230 |title=The evolution and significance of male mate choice |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |volume=26 |issue=12 |pages=647\u2013654 |year=2011 |last1=Edward |first1=Dominic A. |last2=Chapman |first2=Tracey }}</ref> Human males have a larger quantity of [[gamete]]s than females, which are replenished at a rate of approximately 12 million per hour. Conversely, female humans are born with a fixed amount of egg cells which are not restocked over the lifespan.<ref name=\":3\" /> This provides males with a greater window of opportunity to mate and reproduce than females, hence females are usually more choosy.\n\nDespite not being the typically choosy gender, human males can be influenced by certain traits of females when making decisions about a potential mate:<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n==== Short-term mating strategies ====\n\nWhen finding a short-term mate, males highly value women with sexual experience and physical attractiveness.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary Psychology, The New Science of Mind|last=Buss|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99212-6|location=New York|pages=163\u2013176|quote=|via=}}</ref> Men seeking short-term sexual relationships are likely to avoid women who are interested in commitment or require investment.\n\nExamples of short-term mating strategies in males:\n* Multiple sexual partners: When looking for short-term sexual relationships, men may wish for there to be as little time as possible between each partner.<ref name=\":4\" /> When engaging in sexual intercourse with multiple partners, it is important to be aware that the risk of contracting a sexually transmitted disease may increase if [[Birth control|contraception]] is not used. \n* Physical attractiveness: Men who are interested in a short-term sexual relationship are more likely to prioritise information about the body of potential partners, rather than their faces.<ref name=\":4\" /> When finding a female for a short-term relationship, compared with a long-term relationship, males are less likely to prioritise factors such as commitment.\n* Relaxation of standards: It has been reported that men are more likely to engage in a sexual relationship with women who have lower levels of intelligence, independence, honesty, generosity, athleticism, responsibility and cooperativeness, when this relationship is short-term.<ref name=\":4\" /> Men may be more accepting of lower standards, than what they usually prefer, because they are not entering a long-term relationship with this person. \n* Sexual experience: Many men assume that women who have engaged in sexual experiences beforehand are likely to have a higher sex drive than women who haven't.<ref name=\":4\" /> These women may also be more accessible and require less courtship.\n\n==== Long-term mating strategies ====\n\nAlthough from an evolutionary perspective women are usually the choosy sex,  if a human male has the desire to reproduce he may seek certain qualities in a potential mate who could be the mother of his offspring. Humans have the ability to rely on [[Honest signals|biological signals]] of reproductive success and non-biological signals, such as the female's willingness to marry.<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|title=Evolutionary Psychology, The New Science of Mind|last=Buss|first=David|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=978-0-205-99212-6|location=New York|pages=133\u2013162|quote=|via=}}</ref> Unlike many animals, humans are not able to consciously display physical changes to their body when they are ready to mate, so they have to rely on other forms of communication before engaging in a consensual relationship.\n\nMales may look for:\n* Commitment and marriage: A human male may be interested in mating with a female who seeks marriage.<ref name=\":5\" /> This is because he has exclusive sexual access to the female, so any offspring produced in the relationship will be genetically related to him (unless the female has sexual intercourse with another male outside of the marriage). This increases the likelihood of [[Cuckold|paternity certainty]]. With two married parents investing in the offspring, their chance of survival may increase; therefore the male's [[DNA]] will be passed on to the children of his offspring. Also, a male who is interested in committing to a female may be more attractive to potential mates. A male who can promise resources and future parental investment is likely to be more appealing to women than a male who is unwilling to commit to her. \n* [[Facial symmetry]]: Symmetrical faces have been judged to signal good general health and the ability for a woman to withstand adverse environmental factors, such as illness.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* [[Femininity]]: A feminine face can be a signal of youth, which in turn signals strong reproductive value.<ref name=\":5\" /> As a woman gets older, her facial features become less feminine due to ageing. Femininity can also be linked to disease-resistance and high [[estrogen]] levels, which are factors that suggest reproductive value to a potential mate.\n* Physical beauty: Observable characteristics of a woman can indicate good health and the ability to reproduce, qualities which are likely to be desired by a male. This may include smooth skin, absence of lesions, muscle tone, long hair and high energy levels.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* Resources: Men who are looking for a long-term partner may strive to achieve a high status or resources, such as their own home or a job promotion.<ref name=\":5\" /> This may increase their chance of attracting a desirable mate.\n* [[Waist\u2013hip ratio|Waist-to-hip ratio]]: A waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is an indicator of fertility, lower long-term health risks and suggests that the woman isn't already pregnant.<ref name=\":5\" /> A male is likely to desire these qualities in a mate, as it will increase the chance of survival of any offspring the couple have together.\n* [[Breasts]]: Men typically prefer women who have larger breasts because it is a sign of being 20\u201324 years of age. A woman in this age range is perceived to be more fertile, sexually mature, and reproductively healthy. Larger breasts are also an indicator of having a higher body fat percentage which secures more energy to provide nutrients to the fetus during gestation as well as increase the productivity of lactation. Although breast size is of importance to male attraction because it is very prominent, [[areola]] pigment is also found to be significant. As women age and take part in more pregnancies, their areolae become darker in pigment. Therefore, darker areolae are seen to be more attractive as they indicate that the woman is capable of successfully birthing healthy children. This is however only seen to be attractive in women with larger breasts. If a woman has breasts that are small or medium sized, a lighter areola is preferred by men because the areola lightens as a woman goes through puberty. This way, she is still seen to be fertile, she just may not be assumed to be as sexually mature and reproductively healthy as a woman with larger breasts and darker areolae.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-015-0516-2 |pmid=25828990 |title=The Role of Breast Size and Areolar Pigmentation in Perceptions of Women's Sexual Attractiveness, Reproductive Health, Sexual Maturity, Maternal Nurturing Abilities, and Age |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=1685\u20131695 |year=2015 |last1=Dixson |first1=Barnaby J. |last2=Duncan |first2=Melanie |last3=Dixson |first3=Alan F. |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e98a0be54c931642c11e8512015d7d971d07e6e8 }}</ref>\n* Youth: Both young and old men are attracted to women in their twenties.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |year=2017 |title=Age Limits: Men's and Women's Youngest and Oldest Considered and Actual Sex Partners |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=147470491769040 |doi=10.1177/1474704917690401|pmid=28127998 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.09.003 |title=Women's and men's sexual preferences and activities with respect to the partner's age: Evidence for female choice |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=36 |pages=73\u201379 |year=2015 |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Salo |first2=Benny |last3=Alanko |first3=Katarina |last4=Bergen |first4=Emilia |last5=Corander |first5=Jukka |last6=Sandnabba |first6=N.

In societies with a high prevalence of parasites or [[pathogens]] greater evolutionary advantage is derived from selecting for physical attractiveness/good looks of their potential mates, by the members of that society, compared to members of societies with a lower prevalence of parasites or diseases who put less emphasis on physical attractiveness. It indicates that physical attractiveness serves as a method by which humans can determine resistance to parasites, as it's believed that parasites and diseases would lower the ability to portray attractive traits of those who are suffering or have suffered from a disease, and would also limit the number of high-quality pathogen-resistant mates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fincher |first1=Corey |last2=Thornhill |first2=Randy |last3=Murray |first3=Damian |last4=Schaller |first4=Mark |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2018 |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279\u20131285 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmid=18302996 |pmc=2602680 }}</ref>\n\n=== Hamilton\u2013Zuk hypothesis ===\n\nThe Hamilton\u2013Zuk hypothesis<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=William |last2=Zuk |first2=Marlene |title=Heritable True Fitness and Bright Birds: A Role for Parasites? |journal=Science |volume=218 |issue=4570 |pages=384\u2013387 |jstor=1688879 |year=1982 |doi=10.1126/science.7123238 |pmid=7123238 |bibcode=1982Sci...218..384H }}</ref> (see [[#Indicator traits|Indicator traits]]) has greatly influenced research regarding human mate choice.

There are direct and indirect benefits of being the selective individual.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\" /><ref name=\":8\" /> In most species, females are the choosy sex which discriminates among competitive males,<ref name=Andersson1994/> but there are several examples of reversed roles (see below). It is preferable for an individual to choose a compatible mate of the same species, in order to maintain reproductive success.<ref>{{cite book |last=Halliday |first=T.

He was perplexed by the elaborate ornamentation that males of some species have, because such features appeared to be detrimental to survival and to have negative consequences for reproductive success. Darwin proposed two explanations for the existence of such traits: these traits are useful in male-male combat or they are preferred by females.<ref>Darwin, C. (1871). ''The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex''. John Murray, London.</ref> This article focuses on the latter. Darwin treated natural selection and sexual selection as two different topics, although in the 1930s biologists defined sexual selection as being a part of natural selection.<ref>[[Geoffrey Miller (psychologist)|Miller, Geoffrey]] (2000). ''The mating mind: how sexual choice shaped the evolution of human nature'', London, Heineman, {{ISBN|0-434-00741-2}} (also Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-49516-1}}) p. 8</ref>\n\nIn 1915, [[Ronald Fisher]] wrote a paper on the evolution of female preference and [[secondary sexual characteristics]].<ref name=\"Fisher 1915\">{{cite journal | last1 = Fisher | first1 = R.A. | year = 1915 | title = The evolution of sexual preference | url = | journal = Eugenic Review | volume = 7 | issue = 3| pages = 184\u2013192 |pmc=2987134 | pmid=21259607}}</ref> Fifteen years later, he expanded this theory in a book called ''[[The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection]]''. There he described a scenario where feedback between mate preference and a trait results in elaborate characters such as the long tail of the male peacock (see [[Fisherian runaway]]).\n\nIn 1948, using ''[[Drosophila]]'' as a model, [[Angus John Bateman]] presented experimental evidence that male [[reproductive success]] is limited by the number of mates obtained, while female reproductive success is limited by the number of pregnancies that she can have in her lifetime.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bateman | first1 = A. | year = 1948 | title = Intra-sexual selection in ''Drosophila'' | url = | journal = Heredity | volume = 2 | issue = Pt. 3| pages = 349\u2013368 | doi = 10.1038/hdy.1948.21 | pmid = 18103134 }}</ref> Thus a female must be selective when choosing a mate because the quality of her offspring depends on it. Males must fight, in the form of intra-sexual competition, for the opportunity to mate because not all males will be chosen by females. This became known as [[Bateman's principle]], and although this was a major finding that added to the work of Darwin and Fisher, it was overlooked until [[George C. Williams (biologist)|George C. Williams]] emphasised its importance in the 1960s and 1970s.<ref>Williams, G.C. (1966). ''Adaptation and Natural Selection''.

Trivers]] presented his [[parental investment]] theory. Trivers defined parental investment as any investment made by the parent that benefits his or her current offspring at the cost of investment in future offspring. These investments include the costs of producing gametes as well as any other care or efforts that parents provide after birth or hatching. Reformulating Bateman's ideas, Trivers argued that the sex which exhibits less parental investment (not necessarily the male) will have to compete for mating opportunities with the sex that invests more. The differences in levels of parental investment create the condition that favours mating biases.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Trivers |first1=Robert L. |year=1972 |chapter=Parental Investment and Sexual Selection |pages=[https://archive.org/details/sexualselection00camp/page/136 136\u2013179] |citeseerx=10.1.1.100.4543 |editor1-first=Bernard Grant |editor1-last=Campbell |title=Sexual Selection and the Descent of Man, 1871\u20131971 |isbn=978-0-202-02005-1 |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/sexualselection00camp/page/136 }}</ref>\n\n== Direct and indirect benefits ==\nThe act of being choosy was likely selected for as a way to assess whether or not a potential partner\u2019s contribution(s) would be capable of producing and/or maintaining the viability of an offspring. Utilizing these behaviors usually results in two types of benefits to the individual who is being choosy:\n\n*  Direct benefits increase the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of the choosy sex through direct material advantages or resources.

Hence peacocks' extravagant feathers, or any number of [[lek mating]] displays. This model does not predict a genetic benefit; rather, the reward is more mates.\n\nIn a study done on [[great reed warbler]]s, models based on the polygyny threshold and sexy-son hypotheses predict that females should gain evolutionary advantage in either short-term or long-term in this mating system. Although the importance of female choice was demonstrated, the study did not support the hypotheses.{{citation needed|date= April 2015}} Other studies, such as those conducted on [[long-tailed widowbird]]s, have demonstrated the existence of female choice.{{citation needed|date= April 2015}}  Here, females chose males with long tails, and even preferred those males with experimentally lengthened tails over shortened tails and those of naturally occurring length. Such a process shows how female choice could give rise to exaggerated sexual traits through Fisherian runaway selection.\n\n=== Indicator traits ===\n{{more citations needed section|date=January 2017}}\n\nIndicator traits signal good overall quality of the individual. Traits perceived as attractive must reliably indicate broad genetic quality in order for selection to favor them and for preference to evolve. This is an example of indirect genetic benefits received by the choosy sex, because mating with such individuals will result in high-quality offspring. The indicator traits hypothesis is split into three highly related subtopics: the handicap theory of sexual selection, the good genes hypothesis, and the Hamilton-Zuk hypothesis.\n\nPeople rate the importance of certain traits differently when referring to their own or to others' ideal long-term partners. Research suggests that women consider traits indicating genetic fitness as more important for their own partner, while prioritising traits that provide benefits to others for their sister's ideal partner.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/ebs0000060 |title=Sisterly love: Within-generation differences in ideal partner for sister and self |journal= Evolutionary Behavioral Sciences|volume=10 |pages=29\u201342 |year=2016 |last1=Biegler |first1=Robert |last2=Kennair |first2=Leif Edward Ottesen }}</ref>\n\nIndicator traits are condition-dependent and have associated costs.

This patch varies in brightness among individuals because the pigments that produce the red color (carotenoids) are limited in the environment.

Also, males with naturally brighter patches proved better fathers and exhibited higher offspring-feeding rates than duller males.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> This study is heavily cited in the literature and it provides solid support for the indicator-traits hypothesis that is associated with direct benefits.\n\n=== Genetic compatibility ===\nGenetic compatibility refers to how well the genes of two parents function together in their offspring. Choosing genetically compatible mates could result in optimally fit offspring and notably affect reproductive fitness. However, the genetic compatibility model is limited to specific traits due to complex genetic interactions (e.g. [[major histocompatibility complex]] in humans and mice). The choosy sex must know their own genotype as well as the genotypes of potential mates in order to select the appropriate partner.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.tree.2005.02.005 |pmid=16701361 |title=Genetic compatibility and sexual selection |journal=Trends in Ecology & Evolution |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=157\u2013158 |year=2005 |last1=Puurtinen |first1=M. |last2=Ketola |first2=T. |last3=Kotiaho |first3=J. }}</ref> This makes testing components of genetic compatibility difficult and controversial.\n\n==== Role of major histocompatibility complex ====\n{{main|Major histocompatibility complex and sexual selection}}\nA controversial but well-known experiment suggests that human females use body odor as an indicator of genetic compatibility. In this study, males were given a plain T-shirt to sleep in for two nights in order to provide a scent sample. College women were then asked to rate odors from several men, some with similar MHC (major histocompatibility complex) genes to their own and others with dissimilar genes. MHC genes code for receptors that identify foreign pathogens in the body so that the immune system may respond and destroy them. Since each different gene in the MHC codes for a different type of receptor, it is expected that females will benefit from mating with males who have more dissimilar MHC genes. This will ensure better resistance to parasites and disease in offspring. Researchers found that women tended to rate the odors higher if the male's genes were more dissimilar to their own. They concluded that the odors are influenced by the MHC and that they have consequences for mate choice in human populations today.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1098/rspb.1995.0087 |pmid=7630893 |title=MHC-dependent mate preferences in humans |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society of London.

However, there are some examples of sex role reversals where females must compete with each other for mating opportunities with males. Species that exhibit parental care after the birth of their offspring have the potential to overcome the sex differences in parental investment (the amount of energy that each parent contributes per offspring) and lead to a reversal in sex roles.<ref name=Andersson1994/> The following are examples of male mate choice (sex role reversal) across several taxa.\n*[[Fish]]: Male fish typically display high levels of parental care (see [[pipefish]], [[scissortail sergeant]], and [[seahorses]]). This is because females will deposit their eggs in a special brooding pouch that the male possesses. She doesn't participate in parental care after this event. The male then has the burden of raising the offspring on his own which requires energy and time. Thus, males in these species must choose among competitive females for mating opportunities. Surveys across multiple species of pipefish suggest that the sex differences in the level of parental care may not be the only reason for the reversal. Mating systems (e. i. monogamy and polygamy) might also heavily influence the appearance of male mate choice.<ref>{{cite journal |last2=Anhesjo|first2=I. |last3=Berglund|first3=A. |last4=Rosenqvist |first4=G.|year=1992 |title=Pipefish and seahorses: Are they all sex role reversed? |journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution|volume=7 |issue=7|pages=237\u2013241 |doi=10.1016/0169-5347(92)90052-D |pmid=21236017|last1=Vincent|first1=A.}}</ref>\n*[[Amphibia]]n: Male [[Green and Black Poison Dart Frog|poison-arrow frogs]] (''Dendrobates auratus'') take on a very active parenting role.

(1942). ''Systematics and Origin of Species'', Belknap Press</ref> Mate choice behaviours are thought to be important forces that can result in speciation events because the strength of selection for attractive traits is often very strong. Speciation by this method occurs when a preference for some sexual trait shifts and produces a pre-zygotic barrier (preventing fertilisation). These processes have been difficult to test until recently with advances in genetic modelling.<ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.38.091206.095733 | title=Sexual Selection and Speciation | year=2007 | last1=Ritchie | first1=Michael G. | journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume=38 | pages=79\u2013102 }}</ref> Speciation by sexual selection is gaining popularity in the literature with increasing theoretical and empirical studies.\n\nThere is evidence of early speciation through mate preference in [[guppy|guppies]].

In contrast, southern males respond equally to both local and non-local songs. The fact that northern males exhibit differential recognition indicates that northern females tend not to mate with \"heterospecific\" males from the south; thus it is not necessary for the northern males to respond strongly to the song from a southern challenger. A barrier to gene flow exists from South to North as a result of the female choice, which can eventually lead to speciation.\n\n== Mate choice in humans ==\nIn humans, males and females differ in their strategies to acquire mates and focus on certain qualities. There are two main categories of strategies that both sexes utilize: short-term and long-term. Human mate choice depends on a variety of factors, such as ecology, demography, access to resources, rank/social standing, [[gene]]s, and [[Parasite-stress theory|parasite stress]].\n\nWhile there are a few common mating systems seen among humans, the amount of variation in mating strategies is relatively large. This is due to how humans evolved in diverse niches that were geographically and ecologically expansive. This diversity, as well as cultural practices and human consciousness, have all led to a large amount of variation in mating systems. Below are some of the overarching trends of female mate choice.\n\n=== Female mate choice ===\nAlthough, in humans, both males and females are selective in terms of whom they decide to mate with, as is seen in nature, females exhibit even more mate choice selection than males. However, relative to most other animals, female and male mating strategies are found to be more similar to one another than they are different. According to Bateman's principle of Lifespan Reproductive Success (LRS), human females display the least variance of the two sexes in their LRS due to their high obligatory [[parental investment]], that is a nine-month [[gestation]]al period, as well as [[lactation]] following birth in order to feed offspring so that their brain can grow to the required size.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|title=Human Evolutionary Psychology|last=Barrett|first=Louise|last2=Dunbar|first2=Robin|last3=Lycett|first3=John|publisher=Palgrave|year=2002|isbn=978-0-333-72558-0|location=Hampshire|pages=|quote=|via=}}{{page needed|date=December 2018}}</ref>\n\nHuman female sexual selection can be examined by looking at ways in which males and females are sexually dimorphic, especially in traits that serve little other evolutionary purpose. For example, male traits such as the presence of beards, overall lower voice pitch, and average greater height are thought to be sexually selected traits as they confer benefits to either the women selecting for them, or to their offspring. Experimentally, women have reported a preference for men with beards and lower voices.<ref name=pmid11124875>{{cite journal |doi=10.1006/anbe.2000.1523 |pmid=11124875 |title=Men's voices and women's choices |journal=Animal Behaviour |volume=60 |issue=6 |pages=773\u2013780 |year=2000 |last1=Collins |first1=Sarah A. |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/714eecb01773b5e28e63a3f8ee572b0a2d411558 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0162-3095(95)00068-2 |title=The evolutionary psychology of physical attractiveness: Sexual selection and human morphology |journal=Ethology and Sociobiology |volume=16 |issue=5 |pages=395\u2013424 |year=1995 |last1=Barber |first1=Nigel }}</ref>\n\nFemale mate choice hinges on many different coinciding male traits, and the trade-off between many of these traits must be assessed. The ultimate traits most salient to female human mate choice, however, are parental investment, resource provision and the provision of good genes to offspring. Many phenotypic traits are thought to be selected for as they act as an indication of one of these three major traits. The relative importance of these traits when considering mate selection differ depending on the type of mating arrangement females engage in. Human women typically employ long-term mating strategies when choosing a mate, however they also engage in short-term mating arrangements, so their mate choice preferences change depending on the function of the type of arrangement.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n\n\n==== Short-term mating strategies ====\nWomen do not always seek out and engage in long-term mating arrangements. This is evidenced by factors such as the evolved male tendency to seek out multiple sexual partners\u2014a trait that could not have evolved if women were not also historically engaging in short-term arrangements<ref>B. A. Scelza, \"Choosy But Not Chaste: Multiple Mating in Human Females\".''2013''</ref>\u2014and by the tendency of some women to pursue affairs outside of their long-term couple pairings.\n\n[[David Buss]] outlines several hypotheses as to the function of women's short-term mate choices:\n* Resource hypothesis: Women may engage in short-term mating in order to gain resources that they may not be able to gain from a long-term partner, or that a long-term partner may not be able to provide consistently. These resources may be food, protection for the woman and her children from aggressive men who may capture or sexually coerce them, or status, by providing the woman with a higher social standing. Women may also benefit from having several short-term mating arrangements through paternity confusion\u2014if the paternity of her offspring is not certain, she may be able to accrue resources from several men as a result of this uncertainty.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Genetic benefit hypothesis: Women may choose to engage in short-term mating arrangements in order to aid conception if her long-term partner is infertile, to gain superior genes to those of her long-term partner, or to acquire different genes to those of her partner and increase the genetic diversity of her offspring. This relates to what is known as the [[sexy son hypothesis]]; if a woman acquires genes from a high quality male, her offspring will likely have higher mate value, resulting in their increased reproductive success.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Mate expulsion and mate switching: Women may engage in a short-term mating arrangement in order to cause her long-term partner to end their relationship; in other words, to facilitate a break-up. Women may also use short-term mating if their current partner has depreciated in value, and they wish to 'trade-up' and find a partner that they believe has higher value.<ref name=\":3\" />\n* Short-term for long-term goals: Women may use short-term sexual relationships in order to assess a mate's value as a long-term partner, or in the hopes that the short-term arrangement will result in one that is long-term.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n==== Long-term mating strategies ====\nWhile there has been evidence and research to support the existence of short term mating in women, it has nevertheless been shown that women prefer long term partners over short term mates. This preference is due to women's tendency to invest and require more energy for parental care. In long-term mating arrangements, women typically look for males who will provide a high level of parental investment, and who can provide resources to the woman or to her offspring.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} The provision of economic resources, or the potential to acquire many economic resources is the most obvious cue towards the ability of a man to provide resources, and women in the United States have been shown experimentally to rate the importance of their partner's financial status more highly than men.<ref name=\":3\" /> However, many other traits exist that may act as cues towards a man's ability to provide resources that have been sexually selected for in women's evolutionary history. These include older age\u2014older males have had more time to accrue resources\u2014industriousness, dependability and stability\u2014if a woman's long-term partner is not emotionally stable or is not dependable then their provision of resources to her and her offspring are likely to be inconsistent. Additionally, the costs associated with an emotionally unstable partner such as jealousy and manipulation may outweigh the benefits associated with the resources they are able to provide.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\nWomen's mate choice is not as straightforward as selecting a mate that displays all of her desired qualities. Often, potential mates will possess some qualities that are desirable and some that are not, so women must assess the relative costs and benefits of their potential partners' traits and 'trade off'. Women's mate choices will also be constrained by the context in which they are making them, resulting in conditional mate choices.<ref name=\":1\" /> Some of the conditions that may influence female mate choice include the woman's own perceived attractiveness, the woman's personal resources, mate copying and parasite stress.<ref name=\":3\" />\n\n=== Male mate choice ===\nGenerally, it is unusual for males within a [[species]] to be the choosy sex.

With two married parents investing in the offspring, their chance of survival may increase; therefore the male's [[DNA]] will be passed on to the children of his offspring. Also, a male who is interested in committing to a female may be more attractive to potential mates. A male who can promise resources and future parental investment is likely to be more appealing to women than a male who is unwilling to commit to her. \n* [[Facial symmetry]]: Symmetrical faces have been judged to signal good general health and the ability for a woman to withstand adverse environmental factors, such as illness.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* [[Femininity]]: A feminine face can be a signal of youth, which in turn signals strong reproductive value.<ref name=\":5\" /> As a woman gets older, her facial features become less feminine due to ageing. Femininity can also be linked to disease-resistance and high [[estrogen]] levels, which are factors that suggest reproductive value to a potential mate.\n* Physical beauty: Observable characteristics of a woman can indicate good health and the ability to reproduce, qualities which are likely to be desired by a male. This may include smooth skin, absence of lesions, muscle tone, long hair and high energy levels.<ref name=\":5\" /> \n* Resources: Men who are looking for a long-term partner may strive to achieve a high status or resources, such as their own home or a job promotion.<ref name=\":5\" /> This may increase their chance of attracting a desirable mate.\n* [[Waist\u2013hip ratio|Waist-to-hip ratio]]: A waist-to-hip ratio of 0.7 is an indicator of fertility, lower long-term health risks and suggests that the woman isn't already pregnant.<ref name=\":5\" /> A male is likely to desire these qualities in a mate, as it will increase the chance of survival of any offspring the couple have together.\n* [[Breasts]]: Men typically prefer women who have larger breasts because it is a sign of being 20\u201324 years of age. A woman in this age range is perceived to be more fertile, sexually mature, and reproductively healthy. Larger breasts are also an indicator of having a higher body fat percentage which secures more energy to provide nutrients to the fetus during gestation as well as increase the productivity of lactation. Although breast size is of importance to male attraction because it is very prominent, [[areola]] pigment is also found to be significant. As women age and take part in more pregnancies, their areolae become darker in pigment. Therefore, darker areolae are seen to be more attractive as they indicate that the woman is capable of successfully birthing healthy children. This is however only seen to be attractive in women with larger breasts. If a woman has breasts that are small or medium sized, a lighter areola is preferred by men because the areola lightens as a woman goes through puberty. This way, she is still seen to be fertile, she just may not be assumed to be as sexually mature and reproductively healthy as a woman with larger breasts and darker areolae.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10508-015-0516-2 |pmid=25828990 |title=The Role of Breast Size and Areolar Pigmentation in Perceptions of Women's Sexual Attractiveness, Reproductive Health, Sexual Maturity, Maternal Nurturing Abilities, and Age |journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior |volume=44 |issue=6 |pages=1685\u20131695 |year=2015 |last1=Dixson |first1=Barnaby J. |last2=Duncan |first2=Melanie |last3=Dixson |first3=Alan F. |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/e98a0be54c931642c11e8512015d7d971d07e6e8 }}</ref>\n* Youth: Both young and old men are attracted to women in their twenties.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |year=2017 |title=Age Limits: Men's and Women's Youngest and Oldest Considered and Actual Sex Partners |journal=Evolutionary Psychology |volume=15 |issue=1 |pages=147470491769040 |doi=10.1177/1474704917690401|pmid=28127998 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2014.09.003 |title=Women's and men's sexual preferences and activities with respect to the partner's age: Evidence for female choice |journal=Evolution and Human Behavior |volume=36 |pages=73\u201379 |year=2015 |last1=Antfolk |first1=Jan |last2=Salo |first2=Benny |last3=Alanko |first3=Katarina |last4=Bergen |first4=Emilia |last5=Corander |first5=Jukka |last6=Sandnabba |first6=N.

In societies with a high prevalence of parasites or [[pathogens]] greater evolutionary advantage is derived from selecting for physical attractiveness/good looks of their potential mates, by the members of that society, compared to members of societies with a lower prevalence of parasites or diseases who put less emphasis on physical attractiveness. It indicates that physical attractiveness serves as a method by which humans can determine resistance to parasites, as it's believed that parasites and diseases would lower the ability to portray attractive traits of those who are suffering or have suffered from a disease, and would also limit the number of high-quality pathogen-resistant mates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Fincher |first1=Corey |last2=Thornhill |first2=Randy |last3=Murray |first3=Damian |last4=Schaller |first4=Mark |title=Pathogen prevalence predicts human cross-cultural variability in individualism/collectivism |journal= Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2018 |volume=275 |issue=1640 |pages=1279\u20131285 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2008.0094 |pmid=18302996 |pmc=2602680 }}</ref>\n\n=== Hamilton\u2013Zuk hypothesis ===\n\nThe Hamilton\u2013Zuk hypothesis<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hamilton |first1=William |last2=Zuk |first2=Marlene |title=Heritable True Fitness and Bright Birds: A Role for Parasites? |journal=Science |volume=218 |issue=4570 |pages=384\u2013387 |jstor=1688879 |year=1982 |doi=10.1126/science.7123238 |pmid=7123238 |bibcode=1982Sci...218..384H }}</ref> (see [[#Indicator traits|Indicator traits]]) has greatly influenced research regarding human mate choice.

All four singles charted in the UK, but \"Love Like Blood\" was an international hit and charted in [[Germany]], [[Ireland]], [[Netherlands]] and New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.popmatters.com/pm/feature/fun-games-killing-joke-in-the-mid-80s ''Fun & Games: Killing Joke in the mid-\u201880s''] by Adrien Begrand, [[PopMatters.com]].</ref> The album itself peaked at number 11 in the UK, 8 in Netherlands, and 50 in [[Sweden]].<ref name=\"Hightower-Volume_30\" /><ref name=\"chartstats\" /> In 1986, Killing Joke released their sixth studio album, ''[[Brighter than a Thousand Suns (album)|Brighter than a Thousand Suns]]'', and two singles, \"Adorations\" and \"Sanity\". The album charted in the UK and in the U.S., and both singles only in the UK.<ref name=\"Hightower-Volume_30\" /><ref name=\"chartstats\" /><ref name=\"USSCharts\" /> ''[[Outside the Gate]]'', their seventh studio album, was released in 1988. While it was not promoted, the album and two singles from it, \"America\" and \"My Love of This Land\", charted in the UK.<ref name=\"chartstats\" /> Coleman and Walker temporarily decided to disband the band. ''[[The Courtauld Talks]]'', released in 1989, was essentially a [[spoken word]] album. Killing Joke's eighth album, ''[[Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions]]'', was released in 1990. It included two singles, \"[[The Beautiful Dead]]\" and \"[[Money Is Not Our God]]\". A Killing Joke anthology, ''[[Laugh? I Nearly Bought One!]]'', and two singles featuring \"[[Change_(Killing_Joke_song)#Change:_The_Spiral_Tribe_Mix.2FThe_Youth_Mixes|Change]]\" and \"Wardance\" in several new versions remixed by Youth, were released in 1992. ''[[Pandemonium (Killing Joke album)|Pandemonium]]'', released 1994, and ''[[Democracy (album)|Democracy]]'', in 1996, resulted in five singles: \"[[Exorcism (song)|Exorcism]]\", \"Millenium\" (a UK Top 40 hit), \"[[Pandemonium (song)|Pandemonium]]\" (a UK Top 30 hit), \"Jana\" and \"Democracy\" (a UK Top 40 hit).<ref name=\"Hightower-Volume_30\" /><ref name=\"chartstats\" />\n\nAfter the ''Democracy'' tour, the band went on an extended hiatus until 2002, when Coleman, Geordie and Youth reformed Killing Joke. Their [[Killing Joke 2003 (album)|second self-titled album]] was released in 2003. The album reached the UK Top 40, and produced two singles, \"Loose Cannon\" (a UK Top 25 hit)<ref name=\"chartstats\" /> and \"Seeing Red\". In February 2005, Killing Joke played two consecutive shows to commemorate their 25th anniversary. DVD and CD recordings from these concerts were released in the fall of 2005 as ''XXV Gathering: The Band that Preys Together Stays Together''. In June, remastered and expanded editions of their two 1990s [[Butterfly Recordings]] albums, ''Pandemonium'' and ''Democracy'', were released by [[Cooking Vinyl]]. These were followed in July by their first four albums (from ''Killing Joke'' to ''Ha!'') on [[EMI]]. ''[[Hosannas from the Basements of Hell]]'' was released in April 2006 on Cooking Vinyl. The album made the UK Top 75. Early in 2007, Killing Joke released three archival collections via [[Candlelight Records]]: ''Inside Extremities'', ''Bootleg Vinyl Archive Volumes 1 & 2'' and, in October, ''Extremities, Dirt & Various Repressed Emotions''. On 28 January 2008, the albums ''Fire Dances'', ''Night Time'', ''Brighter than a Thousand Suns'' and ''Outside the Gate'' were reissued in remastered form with bonus tracks by EMI. Each of these carried the message: \u0093''Dedicated to our brother Paul Vincent Raven 1961\u20132007''\u0094.\n\nIn 2008, Killing Joke released ''Duende - The Spanish Sessions'' and an album of radio session recordings, ''The Peel Sessions 1979-1981''. The EP ''In Excelsis'' was released in 2010, and the following studio album, ''[[Absolute Dissent]]'', was released in September 2010. On 2 April 2012, Killing Joke released their 15th studio album, ''[[MMXII (album)|MMXII]]'' on [[Spinefarm Records]]/Universal. It reached number 44 on the UK albums chart upon its first week of release,<ref name=\"chartstats\" /> and number 9 on the Finnish albums chart.<ref name=\"finnishcharts\" />\n\nOn 23 October 2015, the band released their 16th studio album, ''[[Pylon (album)|Pylon]]''.\n\n== Albums ==\n\n=== Studio albums ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Year\n! rowspan=\"2\"| Album\n! colspan=\"7\"| Peak chart positions\n! rowspan=\"2\"| [[Music recording sales certification|Certifications]]<br /><small>([[List of music recording sales certifications|sales thresholds]])</small>\n|-\n! width=\"25px\"| <small>[[UK Albums Chart|UK]]</small><br /><ref name=\"chartstats\">[https://www.officialcharts.com/artists/ Chart Stats - Killing Joke].
