Rama is due to become king after his father's retirement, but his stepmother, [[Kaikeyi]] wants her son [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to take the throne.\n\nAs King [[Dashratha]] had earlier promised to fulfill any two wishes for her, Kaikeyi demands that Rama should be banished to the forest for fourteen years and that Bharat should be crowned as king. Dasharatha keeps his word and with a heavy heart asks Rama to leave for the forest. Rama accepts the exile and is accompanied by his wife [[Mata Sita]] and younger brother [[Lakshmana]]. When Bharat learns that his mother is responsible for Rama's exile he renounces her and beseeches Rama to return to Ayodhya. Rama declines, whereupon Bharat places Rama's ''[[paduka]]'' on the throne as a symbol that Rama is the true king.\n\nBharat served [[Ayodhya]] for the next fourteen years keeping [[Paduka|charan paduka]] of Rama on the throne. [[Ravan]], the evil King of [[Lanka]], abducts Mata Sita, prompting Rama, [[Lakshmana]], [[Hanuman]] and his army of apes, the ''[[Vanara Sena]] '', to rescue her and Rama to kill Ravan.\n\nSeason 2 focuses on Ram-Sita's life after returning from exile, the birth of Luv-Kush and their reunion with the royal family and final departure of Sita and Ram from the earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Portrayed By !!

Rama is due to become king after his father's retirement, but his stepmother, [[Kaikeyi]] wants her son [[Bharata (Ramayana)|Bharata]] to take the throne.\n\nAs King [[Dashratha]] had earlier promised to fulfill any two wishes for her, Kaikeyi demands that Rama should be banished to the forest for fourteen years and that Bharat should be crowned as king. Dasharatha keeps his word and with a heavy heart asks Rama to leave for the forest. Rama accepts the exile and is accompanied by his wife [[Mata Sita]] and younger brother [[Lakshmana]]. When Bharat learns that his mother is responsible for Rama's exile he renounces her and beseeches Rama to return to Ayodhya. Rama declines, whereupon Bharat places Rama's ''[[paduka]]'' on the throne as a symbol that Rama is the true king.\n\nBharat served [[Ayodhya]] for the next fourteen years keeping [[Paduka|charan paduka]] of Rama on the throne. [[Ravan]], the evil King of [[Lanka]], abducts Mata Sita, prompting Rama, [[Lakshmana]], [[Hanuman]] and his army of apes, the ''[[Vanara Sena]] '', to rescue her and Rama to kill Ravan.\n\nSeason 2 focuses on Ram-Sita's life after returning from exile, the birth of Luv-Kush and their reunion with the royal family and final departure of Sita and Ram from the earth.\n\n==Cast==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!Portrayed By !!

His research focuses on the interaction between formal and vernacular rhetorics in the [[public sphere]]. He has authored several books and numerous articles on the subject and his writings have helped shaped the field of [[modern rhetoric]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nHauser was born in Buffalo, New York on May 20, 1943 to Albert Clement (a police officer) and Ann John Michalakes. He went to Canisius College, where he earned a B.A. in English in 1965. He then attended the University of Wisconsin Madison where he earned both his M.A. in 1966 and his Ph.D. in 1970.<ref>Gerard A. Hauser. (2008). In Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale</ref>\n\n==Career==\nHauser began teaching at [[Pennsylvania State University]], University Park, as a professor of speech communication where he worked from 1969 to 1993 While at Penn State he was director of university scholars program from 1987 to 1993. In 1993 he accepted a position at the University of Colorado at Boulder as professor of communication and department chair. He has since retired and is now [[professor emeritus]] of Communication and College Professor Emeritus of Distinction in Rhetoric.<ref>Gerard A. Hauser. (2002). In Directory of American Scholars. Gale.</ref>\n\n==Awards==\nHauser received the Marie Hochmuth Nicholas Book Award from the National Communication Association in 2000 for ''Vernacular Voices: The Rhetoric of Publics and Public Spheres''.  He also received the George E. Yoos Distinguished Service Award from the Rhetoric Society of America in 2004 and was named distinguished scholar by National Communication Association in 2005 and named college professor of distinction 2007.<ref>Gerard A. Hauser. (2008). In Contemporary Authors Online. Detroit: Gale.</ref> The Rhetoric Society of America gives an award in his honor to graduate students at their biennial conference.<ref>Gerard Hauser Award retrieved from http://associationdatabase.com/aws/RSA/pt/sp/awards_hauser</ref>\n\n==Major Publications==\nHauser has written several books and articles on the topic of vernacular rhetoric, including ''Introduction to Rhetorical Theory'' (1986), ''Vernacular Voices: The Rhetoric of Publics and Public Spheres'' (1999), and ''Prisoners of Conscience: Moral Vernaculars of Political Agency'' (2012).\n\nIn ''Vernacular Voices'', Hauser focuses  his work on the notion of public opinion and his belief in the concept of public opinion and how it is rendered in terms of rhetorical interactions rather than numerical aggregates. He seeks to reconfigure not merely the notion of public opinion but the very notion of the public sphere delineated by [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]. His critique of Habermas is respectful and novel. In the book, Hauser problematizes the notion of a single idealized public sphere populated by rational, disinterested individuals discussing common issues. Instead, Hauser imagines the public sphere as a web-like structure providing for interaction between numerous vernacular publics. This interaction, in turn, provides for both a common sense of the world and shared judgments. The overriding norm of consensus is abandoned in favor of common social referents.<ref>Phillips, K. R. (2001). Vernacular Voices: The Rhetoric of Publics and Public Spheres. (Book Reviews). Argumentation and Advocacy, 38(1), 56</ref> As Hauser puts it, \"A public's emergence is not dependent on consensus but on the sharing of a common world, even when understood and lived differently by different segments of society.\" <ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.69.</ref>\n\n==Hauser's Concept of Vernacular Discourse in the Public Sphere==\nAccording to Hauser, a public is \u201cthe interdependent members of society who hold different opinions about a mutual problem and who seek to influence its resolution through discourse\u201d.<ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.32.</ref>  A public sphere is \u201ca discursive space in which individuals and groups associate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment about them. It is the locus of emergence for rhetorically salient meanings\u201d.<ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.61.</ref> There are multiple publics and multiple public spheres. They are reticulated, discourse based, and emerge when two or more individuals come together to discuss a matter in the public interest. Hauser\u2019s public spheres are based firmly in rhetoric because it \u201cestablishes our interpretations of experience\u201d.<ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.62.</ref>  Public discourse is vernacular discourse. It is informal and occurs among those discursive practices engaged by individuals.  These vernacular conversations are then linked, by shared concerns and subjects, to strangers in a lattice that are extrapolated to larger webs. They are formed by opinions, which are judgments based on evidence. Vernacular publics are not things but a process that takes a variety of forms based on time and place. Under Hauser\u2019s model then, vernacular rhetoric is active, not very formal, and can be at times, messy and chaotic.  It is based on the lived experiences of all of us and how we conduct our lives in the public sphere.  It is here where Hauser diverges from Habermas the most. Where Habermas idealized the salon and tearoom, Hauser privileges street corners, bars, and bowling alleys.<ref>Spoel, P., Harris, R., & Henwood, F. (2014).

He seeks to reconfigure not merely the notion of public opinion but the very notion of the public sphere delineated by [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]]. His critique of Habermas is respectful and novel. In the book, Hauser problematizes the notion of a single idealized public sphere populated by rational, disinterested individuals discussing common issues. Instead, Hauser imagines the public sphere as a web-like structure providing for interaction between numerous vernacular publics. This interaction, in turn, provides for both a common sense of the world and shared judgments. The overriding norm of consensus is abandoned in favor of common social referents.<ref>Phillips, K. R. (2001). Vernacular Voices: The Rhetoric of Publics and Public Spheres. (Book Reviews). Argumentation and Advocacy, 38(1), 56</ref> As Hauser puts it, \"A public's emergence is not dependent on consensus but on the sharing of a common world, even when understood and lived differently by different segments of society.\" <ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.69.</ref>\n\n==Hauser's Concept of Vernacular Discourse in the Public Sphere==\nAccording to Hauser, a public is \u201cthe interdependent members of society who hold different opinions about a mutual problem and who seek to influence its resolution through discourse\u201d.<ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.32.</ref>  A public sphere is \u201ca discursive space in which individuals and groups associate to discuss matters of mutual interest and, where possible, to reach a common judgment about them. It is the locus of emergence for rhetorically salient meanings\u201d.<ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.61.</ref> There are multiple publics and multiple public spheres. They are reticulated, discourse based, and emerge when two or more individuals come together to discuss a matter in the public interest. Hauser\u2019s public spheres are based firmly in rhetoric because it \u201cestablishes our interpretations of experience\u201d.<ref>Hauser, G. A. (1999). Vernacular voices : the rhetoric of publics and public spheres. Columbia, S.C. : University of South Carolina Press, p.62.</ref>  Public discourse is vernacular discourse. It is informal and occurs among those discursive practices engaged by individuals.  These vernacular conversations are then linked, by shared concerns and subjects, to strangers in a lattice that are extrapolated to larger webs. They are formed by opinions, which are judgments based on evidence. Vernacular publics are not things but a process that takes a variety of forms based on time and place. Under Hauser\u2019s model then, vernacular rhetoric is active, not very formal, and can be at times, messy and chaotic.  It is based on the lived experiences of all of us and how we conduct our lives in the public sphere.  It is here where Hauser diverges from Habermas the most. Where Habermas idealized the salon and tearoom, Hauser privileges street corners, bars, and bowling alleys.<ref>Spoel, P., Harris, R., & Henwood, F. (2014).

Many of these towns were survivors of earlier [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], Umbrian and Roman towns which had existed within the Roman Empire. The republican institutions of Rome had also survived. Some [[feudal lord]]s existed with a servile labour force and huge tracts of land, but by the 11th century, many cities, including [[Venice]], [[Milan]], [[Florence]], [[Genoa]], [[Pisa]], [[Lucca]], [[Cremona]], [[Siena]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Perugia]], and many others, had become large trading metropoles, able to obtain independence from their formal sovereigns.\n\n[[File:FirenzeIMG0281 bordercropped.jpg|thumbnail|right|[[Florence]] was one of the most important city-states in [[Italy]]]]\n\n==Early Italian city-states==\nAmong the earliest city-states of Italy was the [[Duchy of Naples]], [[Duchy of Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Gaeta|Gaeta]] and [[Republic of Venice|Venice]]<ref>Naples from 661, Amalfi and Gaeta from 839, Venice about from 840 (''[[Pactum Lotharii]]'').

Other city-states were associated to these ''\"commune\"'' cities, like [[Genoa]], [[Turin]] and, in central Italy, the city states of [[Florence]], [[Pisa]], [[Lucca]], [[Siena]], [[Ancona]], [[Citt\u00e0 di Castello]], [[Perugia]], [[Assisi]] among others.\n\n===Duchies===\nSouth of [[Rome]] and the [[Papal States]] were the duchies of [[Duchy of Salerno|Salerno]], [[Duchy of Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[Duchy of Naples]] and [[Duchy of Gaeta]]. Other independent cities were [[Bari]] and [[Trani]], which in 1130 were united in the newly created Norman [[Kingdom of Sicily]].<ref>Franco Cardini & Marina Montesano. ''Storia Medievale''. Le Monnier Universit\u00e0. Florence, 2006</ref>.\n\n===Maritime republics===\nAmalfi, Gaeta and Venice in the 11th century were already autonomous maritime republics. Around 1100, [[republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]] and [[Republic of Ancona|Ancona]] emerged as independent [[maritime republics]] too: trade, shipbuilding and banking helped support their powerful navies in the [[Mediterranean]] in those medieval centuries.<ref>G.

For them \u2013 nominally \u2013 the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] was sovereign.\n\n==Difference from northern Europe==\nBetween the 12th and 13th centuries, Italy was vastly different from feudal [[Europe]] north of the [[Alps]]. The Peninsula was a [[wikt:melange|melange]] of political and cultural elements, not a unified state.\n\n[[Marc Bloch]] and [[Fernand Braudel]] have argued that geography determined the history of the region; other scholars emphasize the absence of central political structures. The very mountainous nature of Italy's landscape was a barrier to effective inter-city communication. The [[Po plain]], however, was an exception: it was the only large contiguous area, and most city states that fell to invasion were located there. Those that survived the longest were in the more rugged regions, such as Florence or Venice, which was protected by its lagoon. The rugged terrain of the Alps prevented the Holy Roman Emperors or various German princes and lords from attacking the northern part of Italy, safeguarding the country from permanent German political control. Largely for these reasons, no strong [[monarchy|monarchies]] emerged as they did in the rest of Europe: authority of the Holy Roman Empire over northern Italian territory, especially after the year 1177, was ''de facto'' only nominal; instead there emerged the autonomous (sometime ''de facto'' independent) [[city-state]]s.\n[[File:Venezianische Kolonien.png|thumbnail|The Most Serene [[Republic of Venice]] used to be a city-state, but then expanded and conquered several territories in mainland [[Italy]]\n (''[[Domini di Terraferma]]'') and abroad (''[[Stato da M\u00e0r]]'')]]\nWhile those Roman, urban, republican sensibilities persisted, there were many movements and changes afoot. Italy first felt the changes in Europe from the 11th to the 13th centuries. Typically there was:\n* a rise in population\u2015the population doubled in this period (the demographic explosion)\n* an emergence of huge cities (Venice, Florence and Milan had over 100,000 inhabitants by the 13th century in addition to many others such as [[Genoa]], [[Bologna]] and [[Verona]], which had over 50,000 inhabitants)\n* the rebuilding of the great cathedrals\n* substantial migration from country to city (in Italy the rate of urbanization reached 20%, making it the most urbanized society in the world at that time)\n* an agrarian revolution\n* the development of commerce\n\nIn recent writing on the city states, American scholar [[Rodney Stark]] emphasizes that they married responsive government, Christianity and the birth of capitalism.<ref>Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason'', New York, Random House, 2005</ref>  He argues that these states were mostly republics, unlike the great European monarchies of France and Spain, where absolute power was vested in rulers who could and did stifle commerce.  Keeping both direct Church control and imperial power at arm's length, the independent city republics prospered bird box chicken hat through commerce based on early capitalist principles, ultimately creating the conditions for the artistic and intellectual changes produced by the [[Renaissance]].\n\nCambridge University historian and political philosopher Quentin Skinner<ref>Skinner, Quentin, ''The Foundations of Modern Political Thought'', vol I: ''The Renaissance''; vol II: ''The Age of Reformation'', Cambridge University Press, p. 69</ref> has pointed out how [[Otto of Freising]], a German bishop who visited central Italy during the 12th century, commented that Italian towns had appeared to have exited from feudalism, so that their society was based on merchants and commerce. Even northern cities and states were also notable for their [[merchant republics]], especially the [[Republic of Venice]].<ref>Martin, J. and Romano, D., Venice Reconsidered, Baltimore, Johns Hopkins University, 2000</ref>  Compared to absolutist monarchies or other more centrally controlled states, the Italian communes and commercial republics enjoyed relative political freedom conducive to academic and artistic advancement. Geographically, and because of trade, Italian cities such as Venice became international trading and banking hubs and intellectual crossroads.\n\nHarvard historian [[Niall Ferguson]]<ref>Ferguson, Niall, ''The Ascent of Money: The Financial History of the World''.  Penguin, 2008</ref> points out that Florence and Venice, as well as several other Italian city-states, played a crucial innovative role in world financial developments, devising the main instruments and practices of banking and the emergence of new forms of social and economic organization.\n\n==Income==\n\nIt is estimated that the per capita income of northern Italy nearly tripled from the 11th century to the 15th century. This was a highly mobile, demographically expanding society, fueled by rapidly expanding commerce.\n\nIn the 14th century, just as the Italian Renaissance was beginning, Italy was the economic capital of Western [[Europe]]: the Italian States were the top manufacturers of finished woolen products. However, with the [[Bubonic Plague]] in 1348, the birth of the English woolen industry, and general warfare, Italy temporarily lost its economic advantage. However, by the late 15th century Italy was again in control of trade along the Mediterranean Sea. It found a new niche in luxury items like ceramics, glassware, lace and silk as well as experiencing a temporary rebirth in the woolen industry.\n\nStill, Italy would never regain its strong hold on textiles. And though it was the birthplace of banking, by the 16th century German and Dutch banks began taking away business. Discovery of the [[Americas]] as well as new trade routes to [[Africa]] and [[India]] by the Portuguese (which made [[Portugal]] the leading trading power) brought about the shift of economic power from Italy<ref>Matthews and Platt. ''The Western Humanities''. Volume I: \"Beginnings through the Renaissance\". Mountain View: Mayfield Publishing Co., 1992</ref> to Portugal in the 16th century, from Portugal to the Netherlands in the 17th century, and from the Netherlands to the United Kingdom in the 18th century.\n\n==Literacy and numeracy==\nBy the 13th century, northern and central Italy had become the most literate society in the world. More than one-third of the male population could read in the vernacular (an unprecedented rate since the decline of the [[Western Roman Empire]]), as could a small but significant proportion of women.\n\nThe Italian city states were also highly numerate, given the importance of the new forms of [[bookkeeping]] that were essential to the trading and mercantile basis of society. Some of the most widely circulating books, such as the ''Liber Abaci'' by [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] of Pisa, included applications of mathematics and arithmetic to business practice<ref>Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason''. Random House, New York: 2005</ref> or were business manuals based on sophisticated numeracy. \n\nIndeed, [[Luca Pacioli]] helped create the banking system of the Italian city-states with [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]].<ref>Carruthers, Bruce G., & Espeland, Wendy Nelson, \"Accounting for Rationality: Double-Entry Bookkeeping and the Rhetoric of Economic Rationality\", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 97, No. 1, July 1991, pp. 37</ref> His 27-page treatise on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic, and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping (of Genoese merchants) as it is practised today.<ref>Sangster, Alan: \"The printing of Pacioli's Summa in 1494: How Many Copies Were Printed?\" ''Accounting Historians Journal'', John Carroll University, Cleveland, Ohio, June 2007.</ref>\n\n==Communes==\n\nDuring the 11th century in northern Italy a new political and social structure emerged: the city-state or [[medieval commune|commune]]. The civic culture which arose from this ''[[urbs]]'' was remarkable. In some places where communes arose (e.g. Britain and France), they were absorbed by the monarchical state as it emerged.  They survived in northern and central Italy as in a handful of other regions throughout Europe to become independent and powerful city-states. In Italy the breakaway from their feudal overlords occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the Pope and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]: [[Milan]] led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence ([[battle of Legnano|battles of Legnano]], 1176, and [[battle of Parma|Parma]], 1248; see [[Lombard League]]).\n\nSimilar town revolts led to the foundation of city-states throughout medieval Europe, such as in Russia ([[Novgorod Republic]], 12th century), in Flanders ([[Battle of Golden Spurs]], 14th century) in Switzerland (the towns of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], 14th century), in Germany (the [[Hanseatic League]], 14th\u201315th century), and in Prussia ([[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]], 15th century).\n\n\nSome Italian city-states became great military powers very early on. Venice and Genoa acquired vast naval empires in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, some of which threatened those of the growing Ottoman Empire.  During the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204), Venice conquered three-eights of the Byzantine Empire.\n[[Image:Italy 1494 shepherd.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Italian Peninsula in 1494, after the [[Peace of Lodi]]]]\n\nThe [[Maritime Republics]] were one of the main products of this new civic and social culture based on commerce and exchange of knowledge with other areas of the world outside western Europe. The [[Republic of Ragusa]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], for example, had important trade communications with the Muslim and Hindu world and this helped the initial development of the Italian [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the late 12th century, a new and remarkable society had emerged in Northern Italy; rich, mobile, expanding, with a mixed aristocracy and urban ''borghese'' ([[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]) class, interested in urban institutions and republican government. But many of the new city-states also housed violent factions based on family, confraternity and brotherhood, which undermined their cohesion (for instance the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]).\n\n==Princely states==\n\nBy 1300, most of these republics had become princely states dominated by a [[Signore]]. The exceptions were [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], and a few others, which remained republics in the face of an increasingly monarchic Europe. In many cases by 1400 the Signori were able to found a stable dynasty over their dominated city (or group of regional cities), obtaining also a nobility title of sovereignty by their formal superior, for example in 1395 [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] bought for 100,000 gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] the title of [[Duke of Milan]] from the emperor [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]].\n\n==Regional states==\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Florence]] were able to conquer other city-states, creating regional states. The 1454 [[Peace of Lodi]] ended their struggle for hegemony in Italy, attaining a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] (see [[Italian Renaissance]]).\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, apart from some minor city-states like [[Lucca]] or [[San Marino]], only the republican Venice was able to preserve its independence and to match the European monarchies of [[France]] and [[Spain]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Italian Wars]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Italy]]\n* [[Medieval commune]]\n* [[Repubbliche Marinare]]\n* [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n* [[Italian Renaissance]]\n* [[San Marino]]\n* [[Vatican City]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References and sources==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070603124424/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/REN/BACK.HTM \"Background to the Italian Renaissance\"], [[Washington State University]]\n* [http://www.arcaini.com/ITALY/ItalyHistory/ItalianCityStates.htm \"The Rise of the Italian City-States\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130722051231/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/c-states.html \"Italy's City-States\"], ''End of Europe's Middle Ages'', [[University of Calgary]]\n* [http://www.wga.hu/tours/gothic/history/city-sta.html \"City-states in Italy\"], [[Web Gallery of Art]]\n\n{{Italy topics}}\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Italian City-States}}\n[[Category:Italian city-states| ]]\n\n[[it:Citt\u00e0-stato italiane]]\n", "text_old": "{{History of Italy}}\n{{Original research|date=June 2019}}\nThe '''Italian city-states''' were a political phenomenon of small independent states mostly in the central and northern [[Italian Peninsula]] between the 9th and the 15th centuries.\n\nAfter the [[fall of the Western Roman Empire]], urban settlements in Italy generally enjoyed a greater continuity than in the rest of western [[Europe]].

Some of the most widely circulating books, such as the ''Liber Abaci'' by [[Fibonacci|Leonardo Fibonacci]] of Pisa, included applications of mathematics and arithmetic to business practice<ref>Stark, Rodney, ''The Victory of Reason''. Random House, New York: 2005</ref> or were business manuals based on sophisticated numeracy. \n\nIndeed, [[Luca Pacioli]] helped create the banking system of the Italian city-states with [[Double-entry bookkeeping system|double-entry bookkeeping]].<ref>Carruthers, Bruce G., & Espeland, Wendy Nelson, \"Accounting for Rationality: Double-Entry Bookkeeping and the Rhetoric of Economic Rationality\", ''American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 97, No. 1, July 1991, pp. 37</ref> His 27-page treatise on bookkeeping contained the first known published work on that topic, and is said to have laid the foundation for double-entry bookkeeping (of Genoese merchants) as it is practised today.<ref>Sangster, Alan: \"The printing of Pacioli's Summa in 1494: How Many Copies Were Printed?\" ''Accounting Historians Journal'', John Carroll University, Cleveland, Ohio, June 2007.</ref>\n\n==Communes==\n\nDuring the 11th century in northern Italy a new political and social structure emerged: the city-state or [[medieval commune|commune]]. The civic culture which arose from this ''[[urbs]]'' was remarkable. In some places where communes arose (e.g. Britain and France), they were absorbed by the monarchical state as it emerged.  They survived in northern and central Italy as in a handful of other regions throughout Europe to become independent and powerful city-states. In Italy the breakaway from their feudal overlords occurred in the late 12th century and 13th century, during the [[Investiture Controversy]] between the Pope and the [[Holy Roman Emperor]]: [[Milan]] led the Lombard cities against the Holy Roman Emperors and defeated them, gaining independence ([[battle of Legnano|battles of Legnano]], 1176, and [[battle of Parma|Parma]], 1248; see [[Lombard League]]).\n\nSimilar town revolts led to the foundation of city-states throughout medieval Europe, such as in Russia ([[Novgorod Republic]], 12th century), in Flanders ([[Battle of Golden Spurs]], 14th century) in Switzerland (the towns of the [[Old Swiss Confederacy]], 14th century), in Germany (the [[Hanseatic League]], 14th\u201315th century), and in Prussia ([[Thirteen Years' War (1454\u201366)|Thirteen Years' War]], 15th century).\n\n\nSome Italian city-states became great military powers very early on. Venice and Genoa acquired vast naval empires in the Mediterranean and Black Seas, some of which threatened those of the growing Ottoman Empire.  During the [[Fourth Crusade]] (1204), Venice conquered three-eights of the Byzantine Empire.\n[[Image:Italy 1494 shepherd.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Italian Peninsula in 1494, after the [[Peace of Lodi]]]]\n\nThe [[Maritime Republics]] were one of the main products of this new civic and social culture based on commerce and exchange of knowledge with other areas of the world outside western Europe. The [[Republic of Ragusa]] and the [[Republic of Venice]], for example, had important trade communications with the Muslim and Hindu world and this helped the initial development of the Italian [[Renaissance]].\n\nBy the late 12th century, a new and remarkable society had emerged in Northern Italy; rich, mobile, expanding, with a mixed aristocracy and urban ''borghese'' ([[:wikt:burgher|burgher]]) class, interested in urban institutions and republican government. But many of the new city-states also housed violent factions based on family, confraternity and brotherhood, which undermined their cohesion (for instance the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]).\n\n==Princely states==\n\nBy 1300, most of these republics had become princely states dominated by a [[Signore]]. The exceptions were [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], [[Florence]], [[Lucca]], and a few others, which remained republics in the face of an increasingly monarchic Europe. In many cases by 1400 the Signori were able to found a stable dynasty over their dominated city (or group of regional cities), obtaining also a nobility title of sovereignty by their formal superior, for example in 1395 [[Gian Galeazzo Visconti]] bought for 100,000 gold [[Florin (Italian coin)|florins]] the title of [[Duke of Milan]] from the emperor [[Wenceslaus, King of the Romans|Wenceslaus]].\n\n==Regional states==\nIn the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, [[Milan]], [[Venice]], and [[Florence]] were able to conquer other city-states, creating regional states. The 1454 [[Peace of Lodi]] ended their struggle for hegemony in Italy, attaining a [[balance of power in international relations|balance of power]] (see [[Italian Renaissance]]).\n\nAt the beginning of the 16th century, apart from some minor city-states like [[Lucca]] or [[San Marino]], only the republican Venice was able to preserve its independence and to match the European monarchies of [[France]] and [[Spain]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]] (see [[Italian Wars]]).\n\n==See also==\n* [[History of Italy]]\n* [[Medieval commune]]\n* [[Repubbliche Marinare]]\n* [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]]\n* [[Italian Renaissance]]\n* [[San Marino]]\n* [[Vatican City]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references />\n\n==References and sources==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070603124424/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~dee/REN/BACK.HTM \"Background to the Italian Renaissance\"], [[Washington State University]]\n* [http://www.arcaini.com/ITALY/ItalyHistory/ItalianCityStates.htm \"The Rise of the Italian City-States\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20130722051231/http://www.ucalgary.ca/applied_history/tutor/endmiddle/c-states.html \"Italy's City-States\"], ''End of Europe's Middle Ages'', [[University of Calgary]]\n* [http://www.wga.hu/tours/gothic/history/city-sta.html \"City-states in Italy\"], [[Web Gallery of Art]]\n\n{{Italy topics}}\n{{coord missing|Italy}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Italian City-States}}\n[[Category:Italian city-states| ]]\n\n[[it:Citt\u00e0-stato italiane]]\n", "name_user": "47.232.221.13", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eDifference from northern Europe)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_city-states"}
