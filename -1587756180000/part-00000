SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

SpongeBob is portrayed as a [[na\u00efvety|na\u00efve]] and goofy [[sponge]] who works as a [[chef|fry cook]] at the [[Krusty Krab]], a [[fast food restaurant]] known for its signature burger, the [[Krabby Patty]]. He is characterized by his optimism and childlike attitude, and influenced by other comedic characters, including [[Stan Laurel]] and [[Pee-Wee Herman]]. He is voiced by actor and comedian [[Tom Kenny]].\n\nSpongeBob was created and designed by cartoonist and educator [[Stephen Hillenburg]]. The character's name is derived from \"Bob the Sponge\", the host of Hillenburg's comic strip ''The Intertidal Zone''. He originally drew it while teaching marine biology to visitors of the [[Ocean Institute]] during the 1980s. He began developing a show based on the premise shortly after the cancellation in 1996 of ''[[Rocko's Modern Life]]'', which he directed. The character's first appearance was in the pilot, \"[[Help Wanted (SpongeBob SquarePants)|Help Wanted]]\", which premiered on May&nbsp;1, 1999.\n\nSpongeBob SquarePants has garnered a positive response from media critics and achieved popularity with both children and adults and is frequently named as one of the greatest cartoon characters of all time. He has, however, been involved in controversy with some conservative social groups for allegedly promoting [[homosexuality]], although Hillenburg has described the character as \"asexual\".<ref name=accuse />\n\n==Role in ''SpongeBob SquarePants''==\nSpongeBob is a good-natured, naive, and enthusiastic [[Aplysina fistularis|yellow tube sponge]].<ref>{{Cite AV media |title=[[The SpongeBob Musical]] |date=June 7, 2016 |last=[[Kyle Jarrow]] |type=Broadway musical |language=English |publisher=[[Tina Landau]] |quote=French Narrator: This fruit is home to one of the most fascinating sea creatures of all\u2014''[[Aplysina fistularis]]'', the yellow sponge.}}</ref> He resides in the undersea city of Bikini Bottom with other [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] aquatic creatures.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, it was incorporated after it had obtained from then, the Town of Cornwall, a franchise to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

It links to the Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec Trans\u00c9nergie grid at the Les C\u00e8dres substation in Quebec. It also links to the National Grid Dennison substation in [[New York (state)|New York]] state.  The line was rebuilt in 2003 and currently operates at 120-kV.  It is capable of operating at 230-kV with a capacity of 1,000 megawatts.  The transmission line is operated by the Cedars Rapids Transmission Company Limited, a subsidiary of the [[State-owned enterprise|crown corporation]] [[Hydro-Qu\u00e9bec]].\n\n== History ==\nIn 1887, the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' was formed to supply electricity to Cornwall.  Almost a decade later in 1896, it was incorporated after it had obtained from then the Town of Cornwall, a franchise to operate a streetcar service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|title=Transit History of Cornwall, Ontario|last=|first=|date=|website=home.cc.umanitoba.ca|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209180906/https://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~wyatt/alltime/cornwall-on.html|archive-date=2019-12-19|access-date=2020-04-04}}</ref>  The service began on 1 July 1896 using an electric locomotive pulling four cars traveling on what was approximately three miles of track.  In 1897, an additional two cars were purchased.  A year later, to generate additional revenues, the company started a freight service.  That service would move freight from the [[Grand Trunk Railway]] yards, and from the [[New York and Ottawa Railway]] to the Toronto Paper Company, Canadian Coloured Cottons, and other local businesses, including the town's local post office.\n\n[[File:Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10, G.T.R. & Water Street, Ontario Voiture no 10 de la Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company, Grand Trunk Railway et rue Water (Ontario) (36520200630).jpg|left|thumb|Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company car No. 10]]In 1898, the [[Sun Life Assurance Company of Canada]] became a [[bondholder]] of ''Cornwall Electric Street Railway Company''.  In 1902, the company which was facing financial difficulties with its freight service operations defaulted on its debt, giving Sun Life full ownership.  In 1905, Sun Life now itself struggling with the railway business, purchased the ''Stormont Electric Light & Power Company'' and would amalgamate both companies into a new one called ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited.''  With the combined operations, it could now provide the distribution of electricity to power its passenger and freight switching service, and distribute electricity to power lights and heat.  The company would later provide its customers with hot water by selling hot water heaters, powered using its electricity paid for by its customers using a [[flat rate]] billing system. The flat rate system was later discontinued and the sale of hot water heaters abandoned.  In 1957, the City of Cornwall formed a committee which was appointed to do what would be its first look at purchasing the utility.  Forty years later in 1977, [[city council]] under the leadership of Mayor Gerald Parisien decided to purchase the company from Sun Life for CA$4.8 million.<ref name=\":0\" /> Later that year, the City of Cornwall appointed members to its first board of directors.  They were Gerald Parisien, Gordon Fairweather, Albert Bergeron, Fred Bradley, Neil Burke, and Doug Fawthrop.  Ten years later in 1987, ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'', operating as ''Cornwall Electric'', expanded and acquired the ''St. Lawrence Power Company'' also located in Cornwall for CA$13.5 million.\n\n=== Privatization ===\nIn 1997, and only twenty years after purchasing the utility that some would refer to as the city's \"crown jewel\", city council voted 10-1 to accept an offer from [[Consumer's Gas Company|Consumer's Gas Company Ltd.]] to purchase ''Cornwall Street Railway Light and Power Company Limited'' for CA$68 million.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.standard-freeholder.com/news/local-news/a-look-at-the-history-of-the-privatization-of-cornwall-electric-21-years-later|title=A look at the history of the privatization of Cornwall Electric, 21 years later|last=September 26|first=Alan S.

During the prolonged ice storm, much of Eastern Ontario and [[Western Quebec]] was without electricity.  Although the City of Cornwall straddles the banks of the [[Saint Lawrence River|Saint-Lawrence River]] which supplies water to the neighboring  [[R. H. Saunders Station|R.H. Saunders Power Generating Station]], no electricity ever flowed from it to the city.  Existing wires connecting the [[Moses-Saunders Power Dam]] to the city were for the first time energized with electricity generated by the local power plant.  Two of the three wires were weighted down with ice and dangerously close.  A Cornwall Electric employee who was also an archer, used a [[bow and arrow]] to throw a line over the arcing wires.  It allowed workers to bounce the wires, causing the ice to fall off and the lines to separate from each other.  This allowed Cornwall residents, to have enough power to meet seventy-five percent of its electricity needs during the ice storm.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Progress Fund ===\nAfter paying off the city's debt with the sale of Cornwall Electric, the City of Cornwall created the Progress Fund with the remaining proceeds.  In 2014, it protected the fund by passing a [[by-law]] equipped with a funding mechanism requiring the fund to always maintain a minimum balance of CA$25 million.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|title=City put $25M Progress Fund in jeopardy: auditor \u2013 Cornwall Newswatch|last=|first=|date=May 7, 2019|website=www.cornwallnewswatch.com|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190707033751/https://www.cornwallnewswatch.com/2019/05/07/city-put-25m-progress-fund-in-jeopardy-auditor/|archive-date=2019-07-07|access-date=2020-04-05}}</ref>  Originally, it would only fund quality of life projects in the city of Cornwall.

However, Heller ran up enough of a margin in the rest of the district to win. \n\nIn response to her defeat Derby said \"I got into this race to take Congress back, to restore the checks and balances that have been absent in our government, and get our country back on track to a brighter future. All that got accomplished in this election. We lost our battle but we won the war.\"\n\n==Democratic Chairwoman==\nOn March 31, 2007 Nevada Democrats elected Derby as the state chairwoman of the Democratic party. Derby led the party during Nevada's historic early presidential caucus on Jan. 19, 2008, which resulted in a statewide shift of voter registration leading to a Democratic majority in Nevada for the first time in decades. She stepped down on February 19, 2008 to run for Congress.\n\n==2008 Congressional Campaign==\nOn February 20, 2008 Derby announced a second run for Nevada's 2nd congressional district against her previous opponent, freshman congressman [[Dean Heller]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006]]\n*[[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008]]\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==External links==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20061011185257/http://www.jillderby.com/ Jill Derby for Congress] ''official campaign site''\n* {{CongLinks | congbio= | votesmart=66889 | fec=H6NV02180 | congress= }}\n*{{dmoz|Regional/North_America/United_States/Nevada/Society_and_Culture/Politics/Candidates_and_Campaigns/US_House/Congressional_District_2/Jill_Derby_%5bD%5d}}\n*[http://dewey.library.unr.edu/xtf/view?docId=ead/93-45-ead.xml A Guide to the Jill Derby Papers, 93-45].

Adopted by David at age 6, he followed David's engineering footsteps completing his first 5 nationally published games before the age of 20.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHe attended [[Moorpark College]] where he majored in Business Administration, but left college early to pursue more opportunities in the video game industry.\n\n==Career==\nAt age 13, Troy Lyndon developed and sold his first video game professionally, titled Space Voyager for the [[Radio Shack]] TRS-80. Encouraged by his childhood friend, David Jennings,<ref>{{cite web | title = David Jennings Interview | publisher = [[Director Online]] | date = 2008-08-06 | url = http://www.director-online.com/buildArticle.php?id=112 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100102081146/http://director-online.com/buildArticle.php?id=112 | archive-date = 2010-01-02 | url-status = dead }}</ref> he followed with two additional games titled Great Wave, Space Quest and Conqueror also for the TRS-80.\n\nHe co-authored [[Atari]] to [[Commodore 64]] game conversions of Time Runner, Snokie and Flak with co-developers Scott Maxwell and Yves Lempereur. He left to pursue video game development full-time.\n\nWorking under contract for [[Datasoft]], Lyndon completed development of the [[Commodore 64]] of Lost Tomb and developed from scratch the Commodore 64 version of Mr. Do!, consumer versions of coin-op arcade games.\n\nHired by [[GameStar]], which was acquired by [[Activision]], Lyndon started by developing simulated sprite drivers for the Macintosh version of Star League Baseball. Programming for GameStar continued even after the Activision acquisition while Lyndon went on to develop Star Rank Boxing, [[Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing]], GBA 2-on-2 Basketball and portions of GFL 3D Football. He also produced the game version of [[Howard the Duck]].\n\nBranching out on his own, Lyndon signed a 15 title deal with Capcom to bring numerous coin-op games to the Commodore 64 and new IBM PC platforms. Games included Street Fighter, Sarge, Speed Rumbler, Hat Trick, 1942, Bionic Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Side Arms, and Tiger Road. Lyndon became the co-founder of Pacific Dataworks International with Christopher T. Riggs.\n\nLyndon then started creating original games with co-developer, Michael Knox. They signed an agreement with [[DataEast]] to develop ABC's Monday Night Football and Dream Team Basketball for the PC. Monday Night Football was recognized as one of the best sports games of the year by nomination from the Software Publishers' Association, and it featured several technical innovations: it supported every current graphics card (Hercules Monochrome, CGA, EGA, VGA and 256 color VGA color modes), and included digitized audio played through the PC's internal speaker.\n\n===Madden Football===\nDue to the success of Monday Night Football on the PC, [[Electronic Arts]] sought out Lyndon and his partner Knox to develop a football game which became the first 3D Madden Football game ever developed. Lyndon originally opposed the idea of a 3D game by his lead programmer, Jim Simmons (a friend of Lyndon's who had never developed a professional software product before), but empowered him to create the display engine if he could meet certain timeline deadlines, while Steve Quinn developed graphics. Lyndon and Knox embedded everything they had learned in developing two previous football games into Madden with countless hours with programmer Simmons describing how to make computer animated objects appear as though they were as smart as humans in determining how to play each of the different positions played by football players in real life. Lyndon credits Electronic Arts' producer Richard Hilleman for his countless hours spent with Simmons bug-testing and refining the game which was developed on the new Sega Genesis platform in record time; 6 months in-time for the product launch.\n\nAfter Madden Football's success, Lyndon and Knox with programmer Jim Simmons went on to create the first NHL Hockey video game for the Sega Genesis platform. Utilizing green-screen video capturing equipment, Lyndon and his developers went on to create technologies to rotoscope real-life imagery of NHL characters directly into characters which appeared in video games. As a result, Lyndon built the video game industry's first dedicated filming studio (sound stage).\n\nOver 5 years, Knox and Lyndon grew their development company, Park Place Productions, to 130 employees with several separate divisions, including Game Development, Publishing and Testing, servicing at peak 14 publishers while making 45 games at once.\n\nLyndon left the video games industry for a brief stint to develop CD-ROM productivity products for [[Computer Associates]] including Simply House, Stanley's Complete Book of Home Repair and Improvement and Simply Vacation, the first database driven travel-agent custom vacation software product ever developed. Both products were also innovative in terms of content size. They were also two of the first 10 CD-ROM titles ever to include Intel's Indeo full-screen video playback technology.\n\nReturning to work exclusively under contract with [[Corel Corporation]], Lyndon built a second generation filming studio (sound stage) for the game industry. The first game was Where in the World is Madison Jaxx, an education game on five CD-ROMs intended to teach geography to teenagers and adults. Secondly, Lyndon produced a motion picture; \"Arthur, the King, the Sword, the Legend\", which included more than 5 hours of film featuring more than 60 actors and actresses and a first-time green-screen implementation of horse motion (from a polo field) into a video game. As a results of Corel's departure from the video game industry, other interactive motion pictures included Sinbad, Sargasso: Sea of Fear, Atlantis and Mind Traveler were never finished or released.\n\n===Christian Media projects===\n\nAfter reading a book by [[Bob Buford]] called Half Time, Lyndon left the video games industry for a few years to serve with the Jesus Film Project, the largest missionary organization of [[Campus Crusade for Christ]]. Originally starting by fixing computers, Lyndon was quickly moved into multimedia development by completing improvements to the Jesus Film DVD Internet Game. Shortly thereafter, Lyndon started Jesus Technologies where he completed numerous projects for Campus Crusade and other ministries, including a new version of the Missions Atlas Project, [[The Jesus Film]] CD-ROM in Arabic, the Jesus: Fact or Fiction DVD, [[the Jesus Film]] Kiosk, the Outreach CD Project, an [[InTouch Ministries]] CD-ROM and the Evangelism Toolbox CD-ROM for [[Campus Crusade for Christ]], in association with the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]].\n\niLumina is the first digitally animated Bible and encyclopedia suite ever created.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = iLumina: The World's First Digitally Animated Bible and Encyclopedia Suite | publisher = [[Tyndale House Publishers]] | date = 2002-09-01 | url = https://www.amazon.com.au/Ilumina-Worlds-Digitally-Animated-Encyclopedia/dp/0842361855 | accessdate = 2020-04-24 }}</ref> Developed by a team of more than 30 developers, Lyndon was engaged with only 9 months remaining in the project schedule to manage all of the interactive programming which had not started. Beginning from scratch, Lyndon achieved this goal despite content delivery delays of more than 6 months. Its features include [[QuickTime VR]], full-screen video animation, and a fully interactive verse-by-verse first graphical view of the [[New Living Translation Bible]].\n\nStarting in 2002, Lyndon began development of a Christian video game based upon the [[Left Behind (series)|Left Behind]] saga, co-written by [[Tim LaHaye]] and [[Jerry Jenkins]]. [[Left Behind: Eternal Forces]] has gone on to sell more than 70,000 copies and has become the most widely distributed [[Christian gaming|Christian video game]] of all time, although it was released amid tremendous controversy.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nIn an effort to raise the necessary capital to launch the first widely distributed Christian video game, [[Inspired Media Entertainment|Left Behind Games, Incorporated]] went public in February 2006 and does business as Inspired Media Entertainment.\n\n===Controversy===\nOn September 25, 2013, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission announced that they entered into a regulatory, non-criminal civil lawsuit against Lyndon.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = SEC Investigation Press Release | publisher = [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date = 2013-09-25 | url = https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1370539839881#.UycHyfldUtr | accessdate = 2014-03-17 }}</ref> The SEC alleged, without ever providing evidence to the court, that Lyndon inflated the company's revenue by granting stock as pay to a consultant, who then sold the stock, and used the proceeds to purchase inventory of the company.\n\nLyndon entered into a no-admit, no-deny settlement with the SEC. After the SEC failed to provide discovery in accordance with the terms of the settlement agreement with Lyndon, Lyndon filed an appeal which includes documents providing the public with 10 years of Left Behind Games' \"audited\" financials to support his claim that the SEC fraudulently fabricated financial records to the court in order to wrongfully obtain a financial judgment.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Pleadings with References to Evidence in the Record | publisher = Troy Lyndon | date = 2015-06-16 | url = http://www.leftbehindgames.com/sec.html | accessdate = 2015-06-16 }}</ref>\n\nIndependent of the SEC's allegations, the SEC suspended trading of Left Behind Games, Inc. in September\u2013October 2013, due to lack of information about the company, after failure to file certain reports with the SEC.<ref>{{cite web | last = | first = | title = SEC Trading Suspension Press Release | publisher = [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] | date = 2013-09-25 | url = https://www.sec.gov/litigation/suspensions/2013/34-70495.pdf | accessdate = 2014-03-17 }}</ref> In Lyndon's appeal, he claims and provides evidence to substantiate that the reason Left Behind Games was unable to meet its quarterly filing requirements was a result of a lack of finances, resulting directly from SEC's interference with the company's $10 million financing in October 2011.

Adopted by David at age 6, he followed David's engineering footsteps completing his first 5 nationally published games before the age of 20.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHe attended [[Moorpark College]] where he majored in Business Administration, but left college early to pursue more opportunities in the video game industry.\n\n==Career==\nAt age 13, Troy Lyndon developed and sold his first video game professionally, titled Space Voyager for the [[Radio Shack]] TRS-80. Encouraged by his childhood friend, David Jennings,<ref>{{cite web | title = David Jennings Interview | publisher = [[Director Online]] | date = 2008-08-06 | url = http://www.director-online.com/buildArticle.php?id=112 | accessdate = 2009-03-30 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20100102081146/http://director-online.com/buildArticle.php?id=112 | archive-date = 2010-01-02 | url-status = dead }}</ref> he followed with two additional games titled Great Wave, Space Quest and Conqueror also for the TRS-80.\n\nHe co-authored [[Atari]] to [[Commodore 64]] game conversions of Time Runner, Snokie and Flak with co-developers Scott Maxwell and Yves Lempereur. He left to pursue video game development full-time.\n\nWorking under contract for [[Datasoft]], Lyndon completed development of the [[Commodore 64]] of Lost Tomb and developed from scratch the Commodore 64 version of Mr. Do!, consumer versions of coin-op arcade games.\n\nHired by [[GameStar]], which was acquired by [[Activision]], Lyndon started by developing simulated sprite drivers for the Macintosh version of Star League Baseball. Programming for GameStar continued even after the Activision acquisition while Lyndon went on to develop Star Rank Boxing, [[Barry McGuigan World Championship Boxing]], GBA 2-on-2 Basketball and portions of GFL 3D Football. He also produced the game version of [[Howard the Duck]].\n\nBranching out on his own, Lyndon signed a 15 title deal with Capcom to bring numerous coin-op games to the Commodore 64 and new IBM PC platforms. Games included Street Fighter, Sarge, Speed Rumbler, Hat Trick, 1942, Bionic Commando, Ghosts 'n Goblins, Side Arms, and Tiger Road. Lyndon became the co-founder of Pacific Dataworks International with Christopher T. Riggs.\n\nLyndon then started creating original games with co-developer, Michael Knox. They signed an agreement with [[DataEast]] to develop ABC's Monday Night Football and Dream Team Basketball for the PC. Monday Night Football was recognized as one of the best sports games of the year by nomination from the Software Publishers' Association, and it featured several technical innovations: it supported every current graphics card (Hercules Monochrome, CGA, EGA, VGA and 256 color VGA color modes), and included digitized audio played through the PC's internal speaker.\n\n===Madden Football===\nDue to the success of Monday Night Football on the PC, [[Electronic Arts]] sought out Lyndon and his partner Knox to develop a football game which became the first 3D Madden Football game ever developed. Lyndon originally opposed the idea of a 3D game by his lead programmer, Jim Simmons (a friend of Lyndon's who had never developed a professional software product before), but empowered him to create the display engine if he could meet certain timeline deadlines, while Steve Quinn developed graphics. Lyndon and Knox embedded everything they had learned in developing two previous football games into Madden with countless hours with programmer Simmons describing how to make computer animated objects appear as though they were as smart as humans in determining how to play each of the different positions played by football players in real life. Lyndon credits Electronic Arts' producer Richard Hilleman for his countless hours spent with Simmons bug-testing and refining the game which was developed on the new Sega Genesis platform in record time; 6 months in-time for the product launch.\n\nAfter Madden Football's success, Lyndon and Knox with programmer Jim Simmons went on to create the first NHL Hockey video game for the Sega Genesis platform. Utilizing green-screen video capturing equipment, Lyndon and his developers went on to create technologies to rotoscope real-life imagery of NHL characters directly into characters which appeared in video games. As a result, Lyndon built the video game industry's first dedicated filming studio (sound stage).\n\nOver 5 years, Knox and Lyndon grew their development company, Park Place Productions, to 130 employees with several separate divisions, including Game Development, Publishing and Testing, servicing at peak 14 publishers while making 45 games at once.\n\nLyndon left the video games industry for a brief stint to develop CD-ROM productivity products for [[Computer Associates]] including Simply House, Stanley's Complete Book of Home Repair and Improvement and Simply Vacation, the first database driven travel-agent custom vacation software product ever developed. Both products were also innovative in terms of content size. They were also two of the first 10 CD-ROM titles ever to include Intel's Indeo full-screen video playback technology.\n\nReturning to work exclusively under contract with [[Corel Corporation]], Lyndon built a second generation filming studio (sound stage) for the game industry. The first game was Where in the World is Madison Jaxx, an education game on five CD-ROMs intended to teach geography to teenagers and adults. Secondly, Lyndon produced a motion picture; \"Arthur, the King, the Sword, the Legend\", which included more than 5 hours of film featuring more than 60 actors and actresses and a first-time green-screen implementation of horse motion (from a polo field) into a video game. As a results of Corel's departure from the video game industry, other interactive motion pictures included Sinbad, Sargasso: Sea of Fear, Atlantis and Mind Traveler were never finished or released.\n\n===Christian Media projects===\n\nAfter reading a book by [[Bob Buford]] called Half Time, Lyndon left the video games industry for a few years to serve with the Jesus Film Project, the largest missionary organization of [[Campus Crusade for Christ]].
