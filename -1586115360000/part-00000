Air cargo carriers, including [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], also use LGB. 57,000 tons of goods are carried each year.\n\nThe [[Boeing]] Company (formerly [[McDonnell Douglas]]) maintains maintenance facilities for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas/Douglas aircraft (including the historic [[DC-9]] and [[DC-10]] aircraft) at Long Beach, and produced the [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] through 2015. [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] operates a completion/service center.\n\nAirline flights are restricted, but there are many charters, private aviation, flight schools, law enforcement flights, helicopters, advertising blimps, planes towing advertising banners, etc. Long Beach airport is one of the [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|busiest general aviation airports in the world]], with 398,433 aircraft movements in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-54-57_666_2__ | title = Traffic Movements 2007 PRELIMINARY | publisher = Airports Council International | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Long Beach Airport has an aggressive noise abatement program, with three full-time noise specialists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/general-news/20130922/long-beach-makes-noisy-pilots-x2014-and-airlines-x2014-pay|title=Long Beach makes noisy pilots \u2014 and airlines \u2014 pay|first=Brian|last=Sumers|work=[[Press-Telegram]]|date=September 22, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> Under Long Beach municipal law, the city can criminally prosecute the aircraft's owner and the pilots for breaking the noise ordinance.

From 1911 until the airport was created, planes used the beach as a runway.\n\n[[Barnstorming|Barnstormer]] Earl S. Daugherty had leased the area that later became the airport for air shows, stunt flying, wing walking and passenger rides. Later, he started the world's first flight school in 1919 at the same location. In 1923 Daugherty convinced the city council to use the site to create the first municipal airport.\n\n[[Douglas Corrigan|Douglas \"Wrong Way\" Corrigan]] used to fly regularly out of Daugherty Field. Before his infamous flight from [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], to [[Ireland]] in 1938, he had flown from Long Beach to New York. After authorities refused his request to continue on to Ireland, he was supposed to return to Daugherty Field, but a claimed [[navigational]] error routed him to Ireland. He never publicly acknowledged having flown there intentionally.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s the only airline nonstops from Long Beach Airport were to Los Angeles, San Diego, and sometimes Catalina Island; in 1962 [[Western Airlines]] introduced a daily [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Electra]] to San Francisco and one a day to San Diego. Jet schedules began in 1968; in 1969 Western [[Boeing 737-200]]s flew to Las Vegas, Oakland, and San Francisco.  In 1980 the only jets were [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) flights to SFO.\n\nIn 1981 a new airline based in Long Beach, [[Jet America]], began nonstop [[MD-80]]s to Chicago and, in 1982, to Dallas-Fort Worth. That year [[Alaska Airlines]] began nonstop [[Boeing 727]]s to Portland and Seattle. In 1983 [[American Airlines]] introduced nonstops to Chicago O'Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth, and [[United Airlines]] began nonstops to Denver; [[Continental Airlines]] started nonstops to Denver as well. In 1984 United scheduled two [[Boeing 767-200]]s a day nonstop to Denver, the largest passenger airliners ever to serve LGB.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992 Continental, Delta, TWA, and USAir ended service to LGB, and [[American Airlines]] left in early 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nctimes.com/special_reports/travel/article_8a356fe0-1a1a-59f9-8c57-6919f38511fb.html | title=American Airlines to end service from Long Beach Airport | newspaper=[[North County Times]] | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=December 18, 2005 | accessdate=May 27, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Alaska Airlines later ended mainline service, and ended codeshare service in 2015. [[Delta Connection]] and [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional jet flights continue at LGB. In February 2016 Southwest Airlines announced plans to begin service to the airport with an initial 4 available slots.\n\n===Military use===\n[[Image:C-74 long beach.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] at Long Beach Airport with [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]] aircraft in the background.]]\nTo attract the [[United States Navy]], the City of Long Beach built a hangar and an administrative building and then offered to lease it to the Navy for $1 a year for the establishment of the Naval Reserve Air Base. On May 10, 1928, the U.S. Navy commissioned the field as a Naval Reserve Air Base '''(NRAB Long Beach)'''. Two years later the city built a hangar and administrative building for the [[United States Army Air Corps]] as well. Significant developments to the little city airport began only after the city built hangars and administrative facilities for the Army and Navy in 1928\u201330.\n\nAs a Naval Reserve Air Base the mission was to instruct, train and drill Naval Reserve personnel. A ground school was offered three nights a week at the base and two nights a week at the [[UCLA|University of California in Los Angeles]] until 1930, when ground school was continuously offered at the base. On April 9, 1939, training in night flight began, and shortly thereafter its facilities began to be used by fleet aircraft as well.\n\nWith increased activity by airlines and the private airplane industry, particularly with [[Douglas Aircraft]] showing an interest in the Long Beach Municipal Airport, the facility needed more space. With Douglas Aircraft as a resident, the attitude of Long Beach's authorities became openly hostile to naval aviation, with its city manager saying that \"the sooner the Navy gets out of the Long Beach airport, the better we will like it.\"\n\nSo the Navy had begun a survey for another site \u2014 unknown to city officials at the time. [[Ernest King|Admiral Ernest J. King]], then the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, and Admirals [[William D. Leahy]], [[Joseph Taussig|Joseph K. Taussig]], and Allen E. Smith pointedly requested that the city of Long Beach repair the runways and reminded the city that the Pacific Fleet, then lying offshore in Long Beach and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] harbors, had a payroll of more than $1 million a month. Eventually the city complied with the Navy's requests.\n\nThe city remained hostile toward approving a lease on any additional land that the Naval Reserve now required.\n\nThe Navy, fed up with the city of Long Beach, decided upon the purchase of some property owned by a Mrs. Susanna Bixby Bryant, a fact made known by the commander of the base, Commander Thomas A. Gray, to the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, [[John Henry Towers|Admiral John H. Towers]]. The circumstances behind the purchase were revealed to [[James Forrestal|James V. Forrestal]], Under Secretary of the Navy, and by him to the House Naval Affairs committee who approved the purchase. Although Comdr. Gray had offered Mrs. Bryant $350 an acre, in the best patriotic spirit she sold the property at $300 an acre.\n\nWith the site acquired, in 1941, construction funds soon followed and [[Los Alamitos Army Airfield|NAS Los Alamitos]] began to take shape. Upon the transfer of the Naval Reserve Training Facility to Los Alamitos, to the surprise of city officials of Long Beach, in 1942, instead of returning the Naval Reserve Air Base facilities at Long Beach to the city, the Navy turned over the facilities to the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which had established a training base next to it. NARB Long Beach was not totally abandoned but became a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS).\n\nThrough [[World War II]] the airfield was given over to the war effort. In August 1941 the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] took over control of the airport, which had grown to {{convert|500|acre|km2}}. Once Los Alamitos became an operational base in 1941, NAAS Long Beach now turned to servicing carrier borne F4Fs, SBDs, FM-2s, F4Us, F6Fs, TBF/TBMs, and SB2Cs. In addition, it had utility aircraft and such patrol planes as the PBY, SNB, GB3, NH, GH, and SNJ.\n[[File:Long beach airport terminal.jpeg|thumb|Shops inside the terminal]]\nAs the Navy's activities began to be shifted to Los Alamitos the '''Long Beach Army Airfield''' at Long Beach became the home of the Army's Air Transport Command's Ferrying Division, with the 1736th Ferrying Squadron assigned,<ref>Associated Press, \"Pilot Survives Crash in Storm\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', Friday 7 January 1955, Volume LXI, Number 111, page 1.</ref> which included a squadron of 18 women pilots commanded by Barbara London, a long time Long Beach aviator.\n\nLike the Naval Air Ferry Command at NAS Terminal Island, the Army's ferrying work was an immense undertaking, thanks to Douglas Aircraft's wartime production. Ground was broken for the initial Douglas Aircraft facility in November 1940, with dedication in October 1941. Douglas had been drawn to Long Beach's growing municipal airport with its Army and Navy facilities. With wartime contracts the company went into intensive production. The company's first C-47 was delivered 16 days after the attack of [[Pearl Harbor]] and another 4,238 were produced during the war. The plant turned out some 1,000 A-20 Havocs, not to mention 3,000 B-17 Flying Fortresses and 1,156 A-26 Invaders.\n\nWith the end of the war the U.S. Navy abandoned any use of Long Beach Municipal Airport and with it the designation of Long Beach as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:Long beach airport Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|Long Beach Airport's runway 30]]\n[[Image:Long-Beach-airport-terminal.jpg|thumb|right|The old terminal building in 2009]]\n\nLong Beach Airport covers 1,166 [[acre]]s (472 [[hectare|ha]]) at an [[elevation]] of 60 feet (18 m).

Angeles MSA]]. Due to its close proximity to the busier and larger [[Los Angeles International Airport|LAX]] 20 miles away, the airport sees more domestic commercial passenger, cargo, military, and general aviation activity. The airport's placement near many residential areas has made the airport have one of the country's strictest ordinances limiting airport noise.<ref>http://www.lgb.org/information/noise_abatement/frequently_asked_questions.asp</ref>\n\nIt is the 10th busiest airport in California based on passenger boardings, at 1.4 million. As of May 2018, JetBlue operates the most airline flights out of Long Beach; the other airlines are American, Delta, Hawaiian, and Southwest. Air cargo carriers, including [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]], also use LGB. 57,000 tons of goods are carried each year.\n\nThe [[Boeing]] Company (formerly [[McDonnell Douglas]]) maintains maintenance facilities for Boeing and McDonnell Douglas/Douglas aircraft (including the historic [[DC-9]] and [[DC-10]] aircraft) at Long Beach, and produced the [[C-17 Globemaster III|C-17]] through 2015. [[Gulfstream Aerospace]] operates a completion/service center.\n\nAirline flights are restricted, but there are many charters, private aviation, flight schools, law enforcement flights, helicopters, advertising blimps, planes towing advertising banners, etc. Long Beach airport is one of the [[World's busiest airports by traffic movements|busiest general aviation airports in the world]], with 398,433 aircraft movements in 2007.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.aci.aero/cda/aci_common/display/main/aci_content07_c.jsp?zn=aci&cp=1-5-54-57_666_2__ | title = Traffic Movements 2007 PRELIMINARY | publisher = Airports Council International | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe Long Beach Airport has an aggressive noise abatement program, with three full-time noise specialists.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.presstelegram.com/general-news/20130922/long-beach-makes-noisy-pilots-x2014-and-airlines-x2014-pay|title=Long Beach makes noisy pilots \u2014 and airlines \u2014 pay|first=Brian|last=Sumers|work=[[Press-Telegram]]|date=September 22, 2013|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref> Under Long Beach municipal law, the city can criminally prosecute the aircraft's owner and the pilots for breaking the noise ordinance. As the airport continues to grow and air traffic increases, so do the complaints about loud and low flying aircraft. The airport produces a monthly noise and complaint report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lgb.org/information/noise_abatement/monthlyreport.asp|title=Monthly Noise and Activity Reports|publisher=Long Beach Airport|accessdate=January 24, 2015}}</ref>\n\nLong Beach Airport has one terminal in [[Streamline Moderne]] style that is a historical landmark and was renovated in early 2013.\n\n==History==\nThe first transcontinental flight, a biplane flown by [[Calbraith Perry Rodgers]], landed in 1911 on Long Beach's sandy beach. From 1911 until the airport was created, planes used the beach as a runway.\n\n[[Barnstorming|Barnstormer]] Earl S. Daugherty had leased the area that later became the airport for air shows, stunt flying, wing walking and passenger rides. Later, he started the world's first flight school in 1919 at the same location. In 1923 Daugherty convinced the city council to use the site to create the first municipal airport.\n\n[[Douglas Corrigan|Douglas \"Wrong Way\" Corrigan]] used to fly regularly out of Daugherty Field. Before his infamous flight from [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]], to [[Ireland]] in 1938, he had flown from Long Beach to New York. After authorities refused his request to continue on to Ireland, he was supposed to return to Daugherty Field, but a claimed [[navigational]] error routed him to Ireland. He never publicly acknowledged having flown there intentionally.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s the only airline nonstops from Long Beach Airport were to Los Angeles, San Diego, and sometimes Catalina Island; in 1962 [[Western Airlines]] introduced a daily [[Lockheed L-188 Electra|Electra]] to San Francisco and one a day to San Diego. Jet schedules began in 1968; in 1969 Western [[Boeing 737-200]]s flew to Las Vegas, Oakland, and San Francisco.  In 1980 the only jets were [[Pacific Southwest Airlines]] (PSA) flights to SFO.\n\nIn 1981 a new airline based in Long Beach, [[Jet America]], began nonstop [[MD-80]]s to Chicago and, in 1982, to Dallas-Fort Worth. That year [[Alaska Airlines]] began nonstop [[Boeing 727]]s to Portland and Seattle. In 1983 [[American Airlines]] introduced nonstops to Chicago O'Hare and Dallas-Fort Worth, and [[United Airlines]] began nonstops to Denver; [[Continental Airlines]] started nonstops to Denver as well. In 1984 United scheduled two [[Boeing 767-200]]s a day nonstop to Denver, the largest passenger airliners ever to serve LGB.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\nBetween 1990 and 1992 Continental, Delta, TWA, and USAir ended service to LGB, and [[American Airlines]] left in early 2006.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.nctimes.com/special_reports/travel/article_8a356fe0-1a1a-59f9-8c57-6919f38511fb.html | title=American Airlines to end service from Long Beach Airport | newspaper=[[North County Times]] | agency=[[Associated Press]] | date=December 18, 2005 | accessdate=May 27, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Alaska Airlines later ended mainline service, and ended codeshare service in 2015. [[Delta Connection]] and [[American Eagle (airline brand)|American Eagle]] regional jet flights continue at LGB. In February 2016 Southwest Airlines announced plans to begin service to the airport with an initial 4 available slots.\n\n===Military use===\n[[Image:C-74 long beach.jpg|right|thumb|[[Douglas C-74 Globemaster]] at Long Beach Airport with [[Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress]] and [[Curtiss C-46 Commando]] aircraft in the background.]]\nTo attract the [[United States Navy]], the City of Long Beach built a hangar and an administrative building and then offered to lease it to the Navy for $1 a year for the establishment of the Naval Reserve Air Base. On May 10, 1928, the U.S. Navy commissioned the field as a Naval Reserve Air Base '''(NRAB Long Beach)'''. Two years later the city built a hangar and administrative building for the [[United States Army Air Corps]] as well. Significant developments to the little city airport began only after the city built hangars and administrative facilities for the Army and Navy in 1928-30.\n\nAs a Naval Reserve Air Base the mission was to instruct, train and drill Naval Reserve personnel. A ground school was offered three nights a week at the base and two nights a week at the [[UCLA|University of California in Los Angeles]] until 1930, when ground school was continuously offered at the base. On April 9, 1939, training in night flight began, and shortly thereafter its facilities began to be used by fleet aircraft as well.\n\nWith increased activity by airlines and the private airplane industry, particularly with [[Douglas Aircraft]] showing an interest in the Long Beach Municipal Airport, the facility needed more space. With Douglas Aircraft as a resident, the attitude of Long Beach's authorities became openly hostile to naval aviation, with its city manager saying that \"the sooner the Navy gets out of the Long Beach airport, the better we will like it.\"\n\nSo the Navy had begun a survey for another site \u2014 unknown to city officials at the time. [[Ernest King|Admiral Ernest J. King]], then the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, and Admirals [[William D. Leahy]], [[Joseph Taussig|Joseph K. Taussig]], and Allen E. Smith pointedly requested that the city of Long Beach repair the runways and reminded the city that the Pacific Fleet, then lying offshore in Long Beach and [[San Pedro, Los Angeles|San Pedro]] harbors, had a payroll of more than $1 million a month. Eventually the city complied with the Navy's requests.\n\nThe city remained hostile toward approving a lease on any additional land that the Naval Reserve now required.\n\nThe Navy, fed up with the city of Long Beach, decided upon the purchase of some property owned by a Mrs. Susanna Bixby Bryant, a fact made known by the commander of the base, Commander Thomas A. Gray, to the Chief of the Bureau of Aeronautics, [[John Henry Towers|Admiral John H. Towers]]. The circumstances behind the purchase were revealed to [[James Forrestal|James V. Forrestal]], Under Secretary of the Navy, and by him to the House Naval Affairs committee who approved the purchase. Although Comdr. Gray had offered Mrs. Bryant $350 an acre, in the best patriotic spirit she sold the property at $300 an acre.\n\nWith the site acquired, in 1941, construction funds soon followed and [[Los Alamitos Army Airfield|NAS Los Alamitos]] began to take shape. Upon the transfer of the Naval Reserve Training Facility to Los Alamitos, to the surprise of city officials of Long Beach, in 1942, instead of returning the Naval Reserve Air Base facilities at Long Beach to the city, the Navy turned over the facilities to the [[United States Army Air Forces]], which had established a training base next to it. NARB Long Beach was not totally abandoned but became a Naval Auxiliary Air Station (NAAS).\n\nThrough [[World War II]] the airfield was given over to the war effort. In August 1941 the [[Civil Aeronautics Administration (United States)|Civil Aeronautics Administration]] took over control of the airport, which had grown to {{convert|500|acre|km2}}. Once Los Alamitos became an operational base in 1941, NAAS Long Beach now turned to servicing carrier borne F4Fs, SBDs, FM-2s, F4Us, F6Fs, TBF/TBMs, and SB2Cs. In addition, it had utility aircraft and such patrol planes as the PBY, SNB, GB3, NH, GH, and SNJ.\n[[File:Long beach airport terminal.jpeg|thumb|Shops inside the terminal]]\nAs the Navy's activities began to be shifted to Los Alamitos the '''Long Beach Army Airfield''' at Long Beach became the home of the Army's Air Transport Command's Ferrying Division, with the 1736th Ferrying Squadron assigned,<ref>Associated Press, \"Pilot Survives Crash in Storm\", ''The San Bernardino Daily Sun'', Friday 7 January 1955, Volume LXI, Number 111, page 1.</ref> which included a squadron of 18 women pilots commanded by Barbara London, a long time Long Beach aviator.\n\nLike the Naval Air Ferry Command at NAS Terminal Island, the Army's ferrying work was an immense undertaking, thanks to Douglas Aircraft's wartime production. Ground was broken for the initial Douglas Aircraft facility in November 1940, with dedication in October 1941. Douglas had been drawn to Long Beach's growing municipal airport with its Army and Navy facilities. With wartime contracts the company went into intensive production. The company's first C-47 was delivered 16 days after the attack of [[Pearl Harbor]] and another 4,238 were produced during the war. The plant turned out some 1,000 A-20 Havocs, not to mention 3,000 B-17 Flying Fortresses and 1,156 A-26 Invaders.\n\nWith the end of the war the U.S. Navy abandoned any use of Long Beach Municipal Airport and with it the designation of Long Beach as a Naval Auxiliary Air Station.\n\n==Facilities==\n[[Image:Long beach airport Photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|right|Long Beach Airport's runway 30]]\n[[Image:Long-Beach-airport-terminal.jpg|thumb|right|The old terminal building in 2009]]\n\nLong Beach Airport covers 1,166 [[acre]]s (472 [[hectare|ha]]) at an [[elevation]] of 60 feet (18 m).

In addition, $5 million was spent to refurbish the old terminal, which was originally built in 1941 and declared a historic landmark by the city decades later.\n\nThe new terminal retains the open-air feeling of the current terminal complex, and passengers still walk across the tarmac when boarding or leaving their planes.

The NTSB found the water contamination was allowed to build up in the aircraft's fuel sumps due to poor maintenance and pre-flight practices, and lack of communication between the pilot and aircraft mechanics over who was responsible for draining the sumps before each flight. Because of this, enough water was allowed to build up in the fuel sumps to initiate this accident.<ref name=\"NTSB Brief\">{{cite techreport |title=Brief of Accident |number=WPR11FA166 |institution=National Transportation Safety Board |year=2012}}</ref><ref name=\"NTSB Factual Report\">{{cite techreport |title=Factual Report \u2013 Aviation |number=WPR11FA166 |institution=National Transportation Safety Board |year=2012}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Los Angeles|Aviation}}\n{{Commons category|Long Beach Airport}}\n* [[California World War II Army Airfields]]\n* [[Western Air Defense Force]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.lgb.org/ Long Beach Airport], official web site\n* [http://www.militarymuseum.org/LongBeachAAF.html Historic California Posts: Long Beach Army Air Field]\n* [http://msrmaps.com/map.aspx?t=4&s=12&lat=33.8175&lon=-118.1507&w=800&h=850&lp=---+None+--- Aerial image as of 29 March 2004] from [[USGS]] ''[[The National Map]]''\n* {{FAA-diagram|00236}}\n* {{FAA-procedures|LGB}}\n{{US-airport|LGB}}\n\n<!--Navigation box--><br />\n{{Long Beach, California}}\n{{Greater Los Angeles Airports}}\n{{Public Transportation in Greater Los Angeles}}\n\n[[Category:Buildings and structures in Long Beach, California]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Long Beach, California]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces Air Transport Command in North America]]\n[[Category:Airfields of the United States Army Air Forces in California]]\n[[Category:Streamline Moderne architecture in California]]\n[[Category:Airports in Los Angeles County, California]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Long Beach, California]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: 5-11 \u2192 5\u201311, 1928-30 \u2192 1928\u201330", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Long_Beach_Airport"}

The city became the epicenter for the nationwide suffrage movement spearheaded by [[Emmeline Pankhurst]] and her [[Women's Social and Political Union]]. Protests and demonstrations intensified during these years, reaching a peak between 1912 and 1914 as the movement militarized. [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] hosted two major suffragette rallies in 1908 and 1913, the former counting over 250,000 attendees.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/general-history-of-women-s-suffrage-in-britain-8631733.html| title=General History of Women's Suffrage| author=Rebecca Myers| publisher=The Independent| date=2013-05-27| access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref> London was the site of seminal events in the movement, including [[Black Friday (1910)|Black Friday]], when a suffragette march from [[Caxton Hall]] to the [[Palace of Westminster]] dissolved into conflicts with the police, leading to 115 arrests, 2 deaths, and widespread allegations of sexual assault inflicted upon the female protesters.* <ref>{{cite book|title='Black Friday': Violence Against Women in the Suffragette Movement| author=Caroline Morrell| year=1981|publisher=Women's Research and Resources Centre| p=33|ref=harv}}</ref>\n\n===Architecture and Building===\n{{see also|Architecture of London}}\n[[File:London - Regent Street - The Quadrant 1926 by Sir Reginald Blomfield - View SSE.jpg|thumb|Regent's Quadrant, completed in 1928, capped a decades-long rebuilding program in the West End]] \nArchitecturally there was much rebuilding in Central London during the Edwardian years in the prevalent styles of [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] and [[Edwardian Baroque]]. Much of the construction was delayed by the Great War between 1914\u201318, and completed in the 1920s. Major government buildings erected during this time were [[County Hall, London|County Hall]] (1911\u201322), the seat of the [[London County Council]], the [[War Office]] (1906), and the [[Port of London Authority]] Building (1912-1922).<ref>{{cite book| title=The London Compendium| author=Ed Glinert| year=2003|p=422}}</ref><ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.britishlistedbuildings.co.uk/101357519-port-of-london-authority-building-that-part-within-london-borough-of-tower-hamlets-tower-ward| title=Port of London Authority Building (That Part Within London Borough of Tower Hamlets) A Grade II* Listed Building in City of London, London| publisher=britishlistedbuildings.co.uk| access-date=2018-04-19}}</ref> The decrepit buildings of [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]]'s [[Regent Street]], originally constructed in the 1820s and encompassing a large swathe of the West End between [[Regents Park]] in the north and Waterloo Place near [[St. James's Park]] in the south, were rebuilt entirely between 1905 and 1927.<ref>{{cite article| url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/survey-london/vols31-2/pt2/pp85-100| title=Survey of London: Vols. 31 & 32, St. James Westminster Part 2| year=1963| p=85-100}}</ref> The simple [[Regency architecture|Regency]] buildings of the Nash period were replaced with grand new commercial buildings faced in [[Portland Stone]] lining Regent Street, [[Oxford Circus]], and Regent's Quadrant, transforming the appearance of the West End.

Such conditions made those born and raised in London's slums noticeably unhealthy, weak, and malnourished in appearance. Recruitment drives for the [[Boer War]] of 1899-1902 revealed that 7 in 9 working-class Londoners were unfit for service. In his 1903 book on conditions in the East End, ''[[The People of the Abyss]]'', the American author [[Jack London]] wrote of the poor Londoner that: {{quote|\"the air he breathes, and from which he never escapes, is sufficient to weaken him mentally and physically, so that he becomes unable to compete with the fresh virile life from the country hastening on to London Town...It is incontrovertible that the children grow up into rotten adults, without virility or stamina, a weak-kneed, narrow-chested, listless breed, that crumples up and goes down in the brute struggle for life with the invading hordes from the country.\"<ref>{{cite article| url= https://www.londoncatalyst.org.uk/newsite/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/LondonCatalystMofLpovertyessay2013-doc.pdf|title=A reflection on sickness and poverty in London in the late 19th century| author=Beverley Cook| publisher=londoncatalyst.org.uk| date=2013| access-date=2018-06-08}}</ref>}}\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Ministry of Information First World War Official Collection Q30001.jpg|thumb|A military parade taking place in front of Buckingham Palace during the First World War]]\nDuring [[World War I]], London experienced its first bombing raids, carried out by German [[zeppelin]] [[airship]]s and later by aeroplanes. On 31 May 1915 the first aerial bombing raid on London was carried out by a zeppelin, which dropped high explosives over the East End and the docks, killing seven people. There were a further ten airship raids over London during 1915 and 1916 and a further one in 1917.\n\nBy 1917, British success at shooting down airships [[German strategic bombing during World War I|persuaded the German military]] to instead use aeroplanes to attack London. The first attack by [[bombers]] occurred in May 1916 when a single plane attacked the East End. By May 1917 a squadron of [[Gotha G.V|Gotha]] [[biplanes]] was assembled. On 13 June 1917 the largest World War I air raid on London was carried out, resulting in about 160 deaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In this raid fourteen Gotha bombers bombed numerous targets in the City and the East End, including the Fenchurch Street/Aldgate area, [[Royal Albert Dock, London|Royal Albert Dock]], [[Liverpool Street Station]] and Upper North Street School in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]]. Eighteen children were killed at the school, causing public outrage. Further raids followed during 1917 and 1918. However, by May 1918 British air defences had improved sufficiently to start inflicting heavy German losses, and this persuaded Germany to call the raids off.\n\nThese air raids killed around 670 people, injured 1,960 and caused great terror among London's population, though of far greater impact was the number of Londoners who were killed in combat: about 124,000 young men never returned from the war.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe largest explosion in London's history, the [[Silvertown explosion]], occurred during World War I. A munitions factory containing 50 tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] exploded, killing 73 and injuring 400.\n\n==1920s==\n===Interwar Expansion===\nThe early [[20th century AD|20th century]], especially during the [[interwar years]] of the 1920s and 1930s, saw the geographical extent of London's urban area grew faster than at any point before or since. Most of the development was of [[suburban]] expansion into the neighbouring counties of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Kent]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Surrey]]. A preference for lower density suburban housing, typically [[semi-detached]], by Londoners seeking a more \"rural\" lifestyle, superseded Londoners' old predilection for [[terraced house]]s. The rapid expansion of London during this period swallowed up large swathes of countryside. Fears over the loss of countryside led eventually to the introduction of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]], restricting urban growth.\n[[File:Tottenham Court road in London 1927.jpg|thumb|[[Tottenham Court Road|Tottenham Court road]] in 1927]]\nThis meant that London outgrew the boundaries of the [[County of London]], which led to calls by the [[London County Council]] for the creation of a single [[Greater London]] authority covering the entire urban area, although this was rejected by the [[Royal Commission on London Government]] in 1921.\n\nThe population of London's urban area reached its all-time peak of about 8.6 million in 1939. All of this growth occurred outside of the boundaries of the County of London; the population of which actually fell during the interwar years from 4.5 to 4 million.\n\nLarge numbers of [[Jewish]] immigrants fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]], settled in London during the 1930s, mostly in the [[West End of London|West End]].\n\n===High rise housing===\nThe fierce debates over high-rise housing that took place after 1945 were presaged by an acrimonious debate in the 1920s and 1930s.  It pitted enthusiastic advocates and angry critics of multistorey flats for social housing. On the political left, there was firm opposition to what was denounced as 'barracks for the working classes'. Reformers on the right called for multi-story solutions to overcrowding and high rents. One result were attempts to compromise  by developing new solutions to urban living, focused especially on slum clearance and redevelopment schemes. The compromises generally sought to replace inhospitable slums with high-rise blocks served by lifts. In the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] they included John Scurr House (built 1936\u20131937), Riverside Mansions (1925\u20131928) and the Limehouse Fields project (1925 but never built).<ref>Simon Pepper and Peter Richmond, \"Stepney and the Politics of High-Rise Housing: Limehouse Fields to John Scurr House, 1925\u20131937.\" ''London Journal'' 34.1 (2009): 33-54.</ref>\n\n===Architecture and Building===\nAs the suburbs expanded exponentially, in Central London much of the 1920s were spent completing major construction works begun before the First World War and delayed by labour and material shortages. A trend that emerged during the '20s and '30s was the sale and loss of many of London's grandest private homes in the exclusive areas of [[Mayfair]] and [[St. James's]]. The British aristocracy, unable to support the costs of maintaining large houses in London because of sharp rises in income and estate taxes, sold their homes to private developers, who built new commercial and residential premises. This was accelerated by the onset of the Great Depression in the '30s.<ref name=\"David Cannadine 1990\">{{cite book| title=The Decline & Fall of the British Aristocracy| url=https://archive.org/details/declinefallofbri00cann| url-access=registration| author=David Cannadine| year=1990| p=[https://archive.org/details/declinefallofbri00cann/page/116 116\u2013117]}}</ref> These included [[Grosvenor House]] and [[Dorchester House]] on [[Park Lane]], both of which were rebuilt as luxury hotels (the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] and [[The Dorchester]]), [[Devonshire House]], [[Chesterfield House, Westminster|Chesterfield House]] and [[Norfolk House]].<ref name=\"David Cannadine 1990\"/>\n\nAfter the exhibition of [[Art Deco]] architecture at the 1925 [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris, London architects began to adopt the sleek new style with fervor.<ref name=\"senatehouseevents.co.uk\">{{Cite article| url=https://www.senatehouseevents.co.uk/features/exploring-art-deco-architecture-london| title=Exploring Art Deco Architecture in London| publisher=senatehouseevents.co.uk| date=2015-06-08| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=London Deco| author=Thibaud H\u00e9rem| year=2013| publisher=Nobrow Press|p=1}}</ref> Art Deco became the dominant style for new construction in London through the late 1930s, which represented a forward-thinking and innovative new aesthetic in contrast to London's ubiquitous [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] architecture.

A large [[tram]] network  was constructed by the London County Council, through the [[London County Council Tramways|LCC Tramways]]. And the first [[bus|motorbus]] service began in the 1900s (decade).\n\nLarge scale [[railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]] of London's commuter railways took place during the interwar period, mostly by the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]], and the [[London Underground]] system was expanded to London's northern outer suburbs. In 1933, the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] was created to coordinate transport over a large area of south-east England. The road network was modernised with a network of arterial roads being constructed in the 1920s.\n\nMajor infrastructure projects were completed in the interwar years. The most important was the expansion of the [[Port of London]] dock networks with the completion of the [[King George V Dock, London|King George V Dock]], which increased capacity by 10%, the 10 acre Quebec Dock, and a [[lock (water navigation)|lock]] system from [[Blackwall Reach]] to the [[South Dock, Rotherhithe|South Dock]] in [[Rotherhithe]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2009/03/03/pla_history_feature.shtml| title=The River Thames| publisher=bbc.co.uk| date=2009-03-03| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> Existing docks (the [[Royal Albert Dock, London|Royal Albert]] and [[Royal Victoria Dock|Royal Victoria]] docks) were deepened and expanded to accommodate larger ships, while the deep-water port of [[Tilbury]] on the Thames Estuary was expanded as well.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/GBR_Port_of_London_243.php|title=Port of London review and history|publisher=worldportsource.com| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, two airfields created during the First World War to serve aerial defenses against German zeppelin raids were combined to create London's first international airport, [[Croydon Airport]], also known simply as London Airport.

After the beginning of World War One in 1914, Britain experienced a massive financial crisis due to market panic.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were several reasons why London was able to remain relatively prosperous throughout the interwar years. One major reason was the significant amount of population growth London experienced during these years. In fact, London's population increased from 7.25 million in 1911 to 8.73 million in 1939.<ref name=\":1\">London: A Social History, Roy Porter (page 327)</ref> Another major aspect that helped fuel the economy was the Pax Britannica, which brought business through an increase in shipping, imports, and even investments.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nObviously, London was faced with the huge economic demand of war. In fact, Britain spent over \u00a33,251,000,000  from 1914\u20131918.<ref name=\":0\" /> The government took action in order to raise money and revive the economy; Government officials raised direct taxes of property and income, took out large international loans, and increased the printing of money.<ref name=\":0\" /> And while these economic tactics were ultimately successful for all of Britain, London still had to endure rising unemployment and was forced to adapt its workforce.

While there was a relatively high number of women in the workforce prior to the war, the number continued to rise; \"Women\u2019s employment went from 23.6% of the working age population in 1914 to between 37.7% and 46.7% in 1918\".<ref name=\":3\">http://www.marxist.com/women-in-the-first-world-war-britain.htm</ref> The largest employer of women was the munitions industries \u2013 which were primarily employed by women at the time.

The Labour Party would dominate the council until its abolition and replacement by the [[Greater London Council]] in 1965.  Morrison was a dominant figure in local government in the 1920s and 1930s. He became mayor of Hackney and a member of the London County Council in 1922, and for a while was Minister of Transport in Ramsay MacDonald's cabinet. When Labour gained power in London in 1934, Morrison unified the bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (known as London Transport) in 1933., He led the effort to finance and build the new [[Waterloo Bridge]]. He designed the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] around the suburbs and worked to clear slums, build schools, and reform public assistance.<ref>George W.

The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] won a seat in the House of Commons, and the far-right [[British Union of Fascists]] received extensive support.

On 31 May 1915 the first aerial bombing raid on London was carried out by a zeppelin, which dropped high explosives over the East End and the docks, killing seven people. There were a further ten airship raids over London during 1915 and 1916 and a further one in 1917.\n\nBy 1917, British success at shooting down airships [[German strategic bombing during World War I|persuaded the German military]] to instead use aeroplanes to attack London. The first attack by [[bombers]] occurred in May 1916 when a single plane attacked the East End. By May 1917 a squadron of [[Gotha G.V|Gotha]] [[biplanes]] was assembled. On 13 June 1917 the largest World War I air raid on London was carried out, resulting in about 160 deaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} In this raid fourteen Gotha bombers bombed numerous targets in the City and the East End, including the Fenchurch Street/Aldgate area, [[Royal Albert Dock, London|Royal Albert Dock]], [[Liverpool Street Station]] and Upper North Street School in [[Poplar, London|Poplar]]. Eighteen children were killed at the school, causing public outrage. Further raids followed during 1917 and 1918. However, by May 1918 British air defences had improved sufficiently to start inflicting heavy German losses, and this persuaded Germany to call the raids off.\n\nThese air raids killed around 670 people, injured 1,960 and caused great terror among London's population, though of far greater impact was the number of Londoners who were killed in combat: about 124,000 young men never returned from the war.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe largest explosion in London's history, the [[Silvertown explosion]], occurred during World War I. A munitions factory containing 50 tons of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] exploded, killing 73 and injuring 400.\n\n==1920s==\n===Interwar Expansion===\nThe early [[20th century AD|20th century]], especially during the [[interwar years]] of the 1920s and 1930s, saw the geographical extent of London's urban area grew faster than at any point before or since. Most of the development was of [[suburban]] expansion into the neighbouring counties of [[Essex]], [[Hertfordshire]], [[Kent]], [[Middlesex]] and [[Surrey]]. A preference for lower density suburban housing, typically [[semi-detached]], by Londoners seeking a more \"rural\" lifestyle, superseded Londoners' old predilection for [[terraced house]]s. The rapid expansion of London during this period swallowed up large swathes of countryside. Fears over the loss of countryside led eventually to the introduction of the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]], restricting urban growth.\n[[File:Tottenham Court road in London 1927.jpg|thumb|[[Tottenham Court Road|Tottenham Court road]] in 1927]]\nThis meant that London outgrew the boundaries of the [[County of London]], which led to calls by the [[London County Council]] for the creation of a single [[Greater London]] authority covering the entire urban area, although this was rejected by the [[Royal Commission on London Government]] in 1921.\n\nThe population of London's urban area reached its all-time peak of about 8.6 million in 1939. All of this growth occurred outside of the boundaries of the County of London; the population of which actually fell during the interwar years from 4.5 to 4 million.\n\nLarge numbers of [[Jewish]] immigrants fleeing from [[Nazi Germany]], settled in London during the 1930s, mostly in the [[West End of London|West End]].\n\n===High rise housing===\nThe fierce debates over high-rise housing that took place after 1945 were presaged by an acrimonious debate in the 1920s and 1930s.  It pitted enthusiastic advocates and angry critics of multistorey flats for social housing. On the political left, there was firm opposition to what was denounced as 'barracks for the working classes'. Reformers on the right called for multi-story solutions to overcrowding and high rents. One result were attempts to compromise  by developing new solutions to urban living, focused especially on slum clearance and redevelopment schemes. The compromises generally sought to replace inhospitable slums with high-rise blocks served by lifts. In the [[Metropolitan Borough of Stepney]] they included John Scurr House (built 1936\u20131937), Riverside Mansions (1925\u20131928) and the Limehouse Fields project (1925 but never built).<ref>Simon Pepper and Peter Richmond, \"Stepney and the Politics of High-Rise Housing: Limehouse Fields to John Scurr House, 1925\u20131937.\" ''London Journal'' 34.1 (2009): 33-54.</ref>\n\n===Architecture and Building===\nAs the suburbs expanded exponentially, in Central London much of the 1920s were spent completing major construction works begun before the First World War and delayed by labour and material shortages. A trend that emerged during the '20s and '30s was the sale and loss of many of London's grandest private homes in the exclusive areas of [[Mayfair]] and [[St. James's]]. The British aristocracy, unable to support the costs of maintaining large houses in London because of sharp rises in income and estate taxes, sold their homes to private developers, who built new commercial and residential premises. This was accelerated by the onset of the Great Depression in the '30s.<ref name=\"David Cannadine 1990\">{{cite book| title=The Decline & Fall of the British Aristocracy| url=https://archive.org/details/declinefallofbri00cann| url-access=registration| author=David Cannadine| year=1990| p=[https://archive.org/details/declinefallofbri00cann/page/116 116\u2013117]}}</ref> These included [[Grosvenor House]] and [[Dorchester House]] on [[Park Lane]], both of which were rebuilt as luxury hotels (the [[Grosvenor House Hotel]] and [[The Dorchester]]), [[Devonshire House]], [[Chesterfield House, Westminster|Chesterfield House]] and [[Norfolk House]].<ref name=\"David Cannadine 1990\"/>\n\nAfter the exhibition of [[Art Deco]] architecture at the 1925 [[International Exhibition of Modern Decorative and Industrial Arts]] in Paris, London architects began to adopt the sleek new style with fervor.<ref name=\"senatehouseevents.co.uk\">{{Cite article| url=https://www.senatehouseevents.co.uk/features/exploring-art-deco-architecture-london| title=Exploring Art Deco Architecture in London| publisher=senatehouseevents.co.uk| date=2015-06-08| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite book| title=London Deco| author=Thibaud H\u00e9rem| year=2013| publisher=Nobrow Press|p=1}}</ref> Art Deco became the dominant style for new construction in London through the late 1930s, which represented a forward-thinking and innovative new aesthetic in contrast to London's ubiquitous [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] architecture.

A large [[tram]] network  was constructed by the London County Council, through the [[London County Council Tramways|LCC Tramways]]. And the first [[bus|motorbus]] service began in the 1900s (decade).\n\nLarge scale [[railway electrification in Great Britain|electrification]] of London's commuter railways took place during the interwar period, mostly by the [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]], and the [[London Underground]] system was expanded to London's northern outer suburbs. In 1933, the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] was created to coordinate transport over a large area of south-east England. The road network was modernised with a network of arterial roads being constructed in the 1920s.\n\nMajor infrastructure projects were completed in the interwar years. The most important was the expansion of the [[Port of London]] dock networks with the completion of the [[King George V Dock, London|King George V Dock]], which increased capacity by 10%, the 10 acre Quebec Dock, and a [[lock (water navigation)|lock]] system from [[Blackwall Reach]] to the [[South Dock, Rotherhithe|South Dock]] in [[Rotherhithe]].<ref>{{cite web| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/london/content/articles/2009/03/03/pla_history_feature.shtml| title=The River Thames| publisher=bbc.co.uk| date=2009-03-03| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> Existing docks (the [[Royal Albert Dock, London|Royal Albert]] and [[Royal Victoria Dock|Royal Victoria]] docks) were deepened and expanded to accommodate larger ships, while the deep-water port of [[Tilbury]] on the Thames Estuary was expanded as well.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.worldportsource.com/ports/review/GBR_Port_of_London_243.php|title=Port of London review and history|publisher=worldportsource.com| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref>\n\nIn 1920, two airfields created during the First World War to serve aerial defenses against German zeppelin raids were combined to create London's first international airport, [[Croydon Airport]], also known simply as London Airport. This would serve as London's sole international airport until the post-World War 2 era.<ref>{{cite article| url=https://www.sutton.gov.uk/info/200168/libraries_and_culture/1361/croydon_airport| title=Croydon Airport| publisher=Sutton Council| access-date=2018-04-20}}</ref> From London Airport, Britain's first transcontinental airline, [[Imperial Airways]], based its Empire-wide flight network. This began in 1925 with flights to [[Cairo]] and [[Karachi]] via [[Paris, France|Paris]]. From 1932, regular flights were established from London to far-flung corners of the British Empire like [[Singapore]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Khartoum]], [[Kenya]] and [[Cape Town]].<ref>{{cite book| title=The Rise and Fall of the British Empire| author=Lawrence James| year=1990| p=439}}</ref>\n\n==Economy==\n[[File:The Pool of London.jpg|thumb|The [[Pool of London]], 1938. The Port of London remained the largest port in the world and a major sector of the city's economy]]\nPrior to World War One, Britain was the world's economic superpower.<ref name=\":0\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/guides/zqhxvcw</ref> Despite its flourishing economy, Britain was simply not prepared for the economic impact that the war would have.<ref name=\":0\" /> While London remained fairly prosperous relative to the rest of Britain during the interwar years, their economy still experienced an inevitable decline. After the beginning of World War One in 1914, Britain experienced a massive financial crisis due to market panic.<ref name=\":0\" /> There were several reasons why London was able to remain relatively prosperous throughout the interwar years. One major reason was the significant amount of population growth London experienced during these years. In fact, London's population increased from 7.25 million in 1911 to 8.73 million in 1939.<ref name=\":1\">London: A Social History, Roy Porter (page 327)</ref> Another major aspect that helped fuel the economy was the Pax Britannica, which brought business through an increase in shipping, imports, and even investments.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nObviously, London was faced with the huge economic demand of war. In fact, Britain spent over \u00a33,251,000,000  from 1914-1918.<ref name=\":0\" /> The government took action in order to raise money and revive the economy; Government officials raised direct taxes of property and income, took out large international loans, and increased the printing of money.<ref name=\":0\" /> And while these economic tactics were ultimately successful for all of Britain, London still had to endure rising unemployment and was forced to adapt its workforce. In fact, the unemployment rate for those workers who were covered by national insurance in London increased from 7 percent to 10 percent just from July to August 1914.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UZglcJuJWrYC&pg=PA226&lpg=PA226&dq=Niall+Ferguson,+The+Pity+of+War+(1998)+p+249#v=onepage&q=Niall%20Ferguson%2C%20The%20Pity%20of%20War%20(1998)%20p%20249 |title = A Companion to Europe, 1900 - 1945|isbn = 9781444391671|last1 = Martel|first1 = Gordon|date = 2011-03-21}}</ref> A major reason why unemployment didn't get too high during the interwar years was due to the significant increase of women in the workforce. While there was a relatively high number of women in the workforce prior to the war, the number continued to rise; \"Women\u2019s employment went from 23.6% of the working age population in 1914 to between 37.7% and 46.7% in 1918\".<ref name=\":3\">http://www.marxist.com/women-in-the-first-world-war-britain.htm</ref> The largest employer of women was the munitions industries \u2013 which were primarily employed by women at the time. By 1917, the munition factories in Britain accounted for 80 percent of all weapons and shells used by the British Army. Despite the huge role women played in the maintenance of the economy, they still only received around two-thirds of the pay that men received for the same jobs.<ref name=\":3\" /> \"At the end of the first world war the combination of pent-up consumer demand, high money income, a large volume of liquid or near-liquid assets and a backlog of investment fuelled a boom in economic activity which lasted roughly one year, from March 1919 to April 1920\".<ref name=\":2\" />\n\nLondon managed to escape the worst effects of the Great Depression \u2013 which spanned from 1929 until 1939. \"Even in the dark days of the 1930s unemployment barely bit because London, unlike the industrial North, had never become dangerously over dependent on the Empire, but the Empire was {{sic|in tact}}\".<ref name=\":1\" /> Although most parts of the United Kingdom were facing rising unemployment rates and widespread poverty as early as 1929, London had an unemployment rate of 5.6 percent.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cAX5bOJIeEYC&pg=PA47&lpg=PA47#v=onepage&q=unemployment%20rate%20in%20london%20during%20great%20depression |title = The Great Depression: An International Disaster of Perverse Economic Policies|isbn = 978-0472023325|last1 = Hall|first1 = Thomas E.|last2 = David Ferguson|first2 = J.|date = 2009-11-10}}</ref> The areas that were hit the hardest that were the ones most reliant on heavy industry \u2013 such as Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.<ref name=\":5\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/schools/gcsebitesize/history/mwh/britain/depressionrev1.shtml</ref> London, on the other hand, had relatively little business in heavy industry and was more involved in some of the light industries \u2013 such as chemicals, electrical goods and automobiles.<ref name=\":5\" />\n\n==Politics==\nThe [[London County Council]] for much of its early years was controlled by either the [[Progressive Party (London)|Progressive Party]] (allied to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]]) or the [[Municipal Reform Party]] (allied to the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]]).\n\nIn 1934, the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] led by [[Herbert Morrison]] won control of the LCC for the first time. The Labour Party would dominate the council until its abolition and replacement by the [[Greater London Council]] in 1965.  Morrison was a dominant figure in local government in the 1920s and 1930s. He became mayor of Hackney and a member of the London County Council in 1922, and for a while was Minister of Transport in Ramsay MacDonald's cabinet. When Labour gained power in London in 1934, Morrison unified the bus, tram and trolleybus services with the Underground, by the creation of the [[London Passenger Transport Board]] (known as London Transport) in 1933., He led the effort to finance and build the new [[Waterloo Bridge]]. He designed the [[Metropolitan Green Belt]] around the suburbs and worked to clear slums, build schools, and reform public assistance.<ref>George W. Jones and Bernard Donoughue, ''Herbert Morrison: Portrait of a Politician'' (1973) pp 189-210.</ref>\n\nIn the [[East End of London|East End]] during the 1930s, politically extreme parties of both right and left flourished. The [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] won a seat in the House of Commons, and the far-right [[British Union of Fascists]] received extensive support. Clashes between right and left culminated in the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in 1936.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Timeline of London (1900s)#1900s-1930s|Timeline of London 1900s-1930s]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==Further reading==\n* [[Stephen Constantine (historian)|Constantine, Stephen]].

He received his first commissions during study trips to [[Rome]] and the [[Veneto]].\n\nIn 1797, during a stay in Bologna, he moved in political circles close to the ideas of the [[French Revolution]]. Salucci thereby aroused the mistrust of the government of the Habsburg [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany]] and was sentenced to death in absentia in 1798. Thereupon he joined the French [[Arm\u00e9e d'Italie|Italian Army]].\n\nIn 1801 he was employed as [[topographer]] for the [[Cisalpine Republic]], a [[daughter republic]] under [[Napol\u00e9on Bonaparte|Napoleon]] on the territory of Italy, and in 1802 he worked on the fortifications of [[Alessandria]], [[Mantova]], and [[Verona]].\n\nAfterwards he took part in the [[French invasion of Russia]]. He survived and managed to escape to [[Danzig]]. After the [[Battle of Waterloo]] he fell into English captivity, from which he was released in 1816.\n\nNow he initially worked for the Geneva banker [[Jean Gabriel Eynard]], from whom he received a recommendation for King [[Wilhelm I.

The latter appointed him court architect in 1818.\n\nIn [[W\u00fcrttemberg]], the royal pavillon in Weil near [[Esslingen]] was initially built in collaboration with the Queen [[Katharina Pawlowna|Katharina von W\u00fcrttemberg]], who was a passionate architect. In 1819 after her death he built her [[grave chapel on the W\u00fcrttemberg]]. From 1823 to 1829 the [[Schloss Rosenstein]] was built according to the plans of Salucci. Other buildings designed by him are the [[Wilhelmspalais]] and the Alte Reithalle (royal riding hall), both in Stuttgart.\n\nSince the planned costs for the Royal Pavilion in Weil were exceeded, he soon had to have everything approved by the Building and Garden Directorate. In 1828, after a dispute with a superior, he applied for his dismissal. Four days later, however, he asked to be reinstated. In 1839 the [[dry rot]] was discovered in Rosenstein Castle, for which he was made responsible; this led to his final dismissal.\n\nIn 1840 Salucci returned to Florence almost penniless.
