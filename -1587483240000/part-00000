The band has sold over six million records worldwide, including nearly three million in the United States.\n\nThe group consisted of [[Chad Gray]] (lead vocals), [[Greg Tribbett]] (guitar, vocals), [[Ryan Martinie]] (bass guitar) and [[Matthew McDonough]] (drums). Formed in 1996, Mudvayne became popular in the late-1990s [[Decatur, Illinois]] [[underground music]] scene. The band released an [[extended play|EP]], ''[[Kill, I Oughtta]]'', in 1997 and a successful debut album, ''[[L.D. 50 (album)|L.D. 50]]'', in 2000. They had global success with ''[[The End of All Things to Come]]'', ''[[Lost and Found (Mudvayne album)|Lost and Found]]'' and ''[[The New Game]]''.\n\nSince 2010, the band has been inactive, with its members performing in other projects and making guest appearances. Chad Gray is the vocalist for the heavy metal [[supergroup (music)|supergroup]] [[Hellyeah]], of which Greg Tribbett was also a member until 2014.

Ermilova and T. Mokrova.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe second phase of the flight took off from Donetsk at 21:03 Moscow Time.  On board the aircraft were the seven crew members and 77 passengers, of whom 21 were children.  No issues in flight from Donetsk were reported.  At 22:27 and at an altitude of 10,100 meters the flight began to descend 6,000 meters on a bearing of 60\u00b0 in preparation for the approach, which was to be carried out by the pilot in command.  The decrease in altitude occurred approximately 100 kilometers from the airport and approximately 40 kilometers from the point where the flight was due to turn for the approach.  After the descent the flight remained at its current altitude for two minutes at a speed of 440&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the Tu-134 passed [[Dobrynskoye|Dobrynskoe]] as designated by air traffic control, while at a distance of 75 kilometers from the airport, the crew contacted the air traffic controller who gave them permission descend to an altitude of 1,800 meters and set them on a bearing of 292\u00b0 for landing.  At 22:39:20 the flight reported to be 28 kilometers from the airport and at an altitude of 1,800 meters when they were actually at an altitude of 2,000 meters.  As instructed the flight flew level for 25 seconds, decreasing airspeed from 580&nbsp;km/h to 525&nbsp;km/h.  At 22:39:40 while 25&nbsp;km from the airport the controller gave the flight permission to descend to 1,500 meters and transferred the flight to another controller in the tower.  When communications with the new controller began the flight reported their altitude to be 1,500 meters and proceeded with level flight for 25 seconds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the flight was 2.5 kilometers to the right of the cut-off point of the [[Instrument landing system|glideslope]] they requested permission to enter landing mode.  The flight, having deviated 9 kilometers from the route, had reached the transition level at 22:40.  Upon receiving permission to reduce their altitude to 500 meters and execute a fourth turn at 20\u00b0, they flight executed the procedure through a transition level of 1,200 meters and a 17 kilometer radial distance.  The flight was then 3 kilometers from the aerodrome and flying at a speed of 450&nbsp;km/h when it had still not released the landing gear;  in the preparations for landing the navigator forgot to set his altimeter to the correct pressure.  During the third turn the aircraft reduced speed to 390&nbsp;km/h at a consistent altitude.  During the beginning of fourth turn the landing gear was released and the flaps adjusted only when the aircraft\nwas 2,600 meters from the glideslope, while at an altitude of 1,200 meters and a speed of 410&nbsp;km/h.  The fourth turn started with a roll of 20\u00b0 at a distance of 12.5 kilometers from the entrance to the runway; due to previous lateral deviations the roll would have had to reach 30\u00b0 in order to proceed with the route.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt 22:41 the air traffic controller informed the flight crew of weather conditions with visibility being 1,200 meters and mild fog.  Having lost two minutes of needed time to execute the planned route, there was not enough time to sufficiently reduce speed to 330&nbsp;km/h, adjust flaps to 20\u00b0, and reach an altitude of 500 meters safely to continue with the landing.  Nevertheless, the crew continued with the landing and the air traffic controller did not give the crew any warnings.

Ermilova and T. Mokrova.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Synopsis ==\nThe second phase of the flight took off from Donetsk at 21:03 Moscow Time.  On board the aircraft were the seven crew members and 77 passengers, of whom 21 were children.  No issues in flight from Donetsk were reported.  At 22:27 and at an altitude of 10,100 meters the flight began to descend 6,000 meters on a bearing of 60\u00b0 in preparation for the approach, which was to be carried out by the pilot in command.  The decrease in altitude occurred approximately 100 kilometers from the airport and approximately 40 kilometers from the point where the flight was due to turn for the approach.  After the descent the flight remained at its current altitude for two minutes at a speed of 440&nbsp;km/h.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAfter the Tu-134 passed [[Dobrynskoye|Dobrynskoe]] as designated by air traffic control, while at a distance of 75 kilometers from the airport, the crew contacted the air traffic controller who gave them permission descend to an altitude of 1,800 meters and set them on a bearing of 292\u00b0 for landing.  At 22:39:20 the flight reported to be 28 kilometers from the airport and at an altitude of 1,800 meters when they were actually at an altitude of 2,000 meters.  As instructed the flight flew level for 25 seconds, decreasing airspeed from 580&nbsp;km/h to 525&nbsp;km/h.  At 22:39:40 while 25&nbsp;km from the airport the controller gave the flight permission to descend to 1,500 meters and transferred the flight to another controller in the tower.  When communications with the new controller began the flight reported their altitude to be 1,500 meters and proceeded with level flight for 25 seconds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nWhen the flight was 2.5 kilometers to the right of the cut-off point of the [[Instrument landing system|glideslope]] they requested permission to enter landing mode.  The flight, having deviated 9 kilometers from the route, had reached the transition level at 22:40.  Upon receiving permission to reduce their altitude to 500 meters and execute a fourth turn at 20\u00b0, they flight executed the procedure through a transition level of 1,200 meters and a 17 kilometer radial distance.  The flight was then 3 kilometers from the aerodrome and flying at a speed of 450&nbsp;km/h when it had still not released the landing gear;  in the preparations for landing the navigator forgot to set his altimeter to the correct pressure.  During the third turn the aircraft reduced speed to 390&nbsp;km/h at a consistent altitude.  During the beginning of fourth turn the landing gear was released and the flaps adjusted only when the aircraft\nwas 2,600 meters from the glideslope, while at an altitude of 1,200 meters and a speed of 410&nbsp;km/h.  The fourth turn started with a roll of 20\u00b0 at a distance of 12.5 kilometers from the entrance to the runway; due to previous lateral deviations the roll would have had to reach 30\u00b0 in order to proceed with the route.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAt 22:41 the air traffic controller informed the flight crew of weather conditions with visibility being 1,200 meters and mild fog.  Having lost two minutes of needed time to execute the planned route, there was not enough time to sufficiently reduce speed to 330&nbsp;km/h, adjust flaps to 20\u00b0, and reach an altitude of 500 meters safely to continue with the landing.  Nevertheless, the crew continued with the landing and the air traffic controller did not give the crew any warnings.  The aircraft exited the fourth turn at a distance of 8,600 meters from the entrance to the runway with a speed of 390&nbsp;km/h and an altitude 100 meters above the limit but with the stabilizer, flaps and slats in the correct positions.  At a distance of 7,500 meters from the runway and an altitude of 320 meters the navigator picked up on the deviation and asked the captain about correcting the deviation to which the captain initially refused.  While descending to the glidepath at an altitude of 270 meters the copilot corrected the left bank by adjusting the horizontal stabilizer in one procedure (changing the stabilizer required fulfilling three procedures); doing so caused the aircraft to become less stable.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.airdisaster.ru/database.php?id=90|title=\u041a\u0430\u0442\u0430\u0441\u0442\u0440\u043e\u0444\u0430 \u0422\u0443-134\u0410 \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0430\u0432\u0438\u0430\u043f\u0440\u0435\u0434\u043f\u0440\u0438\u044f\u0442\u0438\u044f \u0432 \u0440\u0430\u0439\u043e\u043d\u0435 \u0430/\u043f \u0418\u0432\u0430\u043d\u043e\u0432\u043e|website=www.airdisaster.ru|access-date=2017-10-18}}</ref>\n\nAt a distance of 4,500 meters from the runway, the aircraft held a lateral deviation ranging from 200\u2013300 meters and an altitude of 200 meters.

The line through Holton-le-Clay remained open for freight until December 1980.\n\n==History==\nThe station was opened on 11 December 1905{{sfn|Butt|1995|p=122}} to coincide with the introduction of a [[railmotor|motor train]] service by the [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]].{{sfn|Ludlam|1991|p=93}} It was the second station opened on the [[East Lincolnshire Railway|East Lincolnshire Line]] to serve the village of [[Holton-le-Clay]] in [[Lincolnshire]].
