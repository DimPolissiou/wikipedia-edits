In Mahabharata era, Lord Vishnu in his Narayana from blessed Guru [[Drona]] and his son [[Ashwatthama]] and gifted the knowledge about this weapon. In Mahabharata war [[Ashwatthama]] used this weapon against Pandava army after the death of Drona. It destroyed one Akshauhini of Pandava army completely. This astra fires a powerful tirade of millions of deadly missiles simultaneously. The intensity of the shower is proportional to the resistance. The only way of defense towards this missile, is to show total submission before the missiles hit. This in turn will cause this weapon to stop and spare the target. When it was used, Ekadasha (Eleven) Rudras appear in the sky to destroy the targets. Millions of types of weapons like Chakra, Gadha, ultra sharp arrows appeared in rage to destroy the target.

The string of Vijaya Dhanush cannot be broken by any kind of astra (weapon) or divya astra (divine weapon), nor by anyone and it is so heavy that a normal person in any yuga cannot not lift it. Every time an arrow is released from this bow, it created a terrible twang, which is said to be loud as thunder causing terrible fear in enemies and produces flashes of light as brilliant as lightning, which blinds the enemy. Every time an arrow is aimed, the energy of the arrow is amplified by multiple times as Vijaya Dhanush is charged with sacred mantras.

The \"{{lang|de|[[Wolfsangel]]}}\", while not a rune historically, has the shape of List's \"Gibor\" rune. Runic \"SS\" was the symbol of the Schutzstaffel.\n\n==Usages by neo-Nazi groups==\nMany symbols used by the Nazis have further been appropriated by [[Neo-Nazism|neo-Nazi]] groups, including a number of runes.\n\nNeo-Nazis however also employ various number symbols such as:\n* [[18 (number)|18]], code for [[Adolf Hitler]].

Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of [[Brahmin]]. The second one is Kapila. He is a a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar ([[Blacksmith|Black Smith]]). Both Dev Datt and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of  their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to get rid of this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave. \n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapil that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his head to Goddess Kali and his arms to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice-versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three e leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies. \n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the dual between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice-versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All all the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem.

Bhagwata comes to the stage. He is a character in the Play and also is the narrator of the play. He seeks blessings from Lord Ganesha for the successful performance of the play. Through his narration, he takes the audience to a place, called as Dharampur and introduces the audience to the king Dharmsheel. Then he puts up some rhetorical questions on incompleteness of man and God; and also on the perfection of a man. During his narration, he introduces two characters who are mutual friends. The first one is Devdutta. He is a sharp minded and highly intellectual person. He has defeated poets and Pandits with his knowledge. He is a son of [[Brahmin]]. The second one is Kapila. He is a a muscular man. He has a great physical strength and he is a son of Lohar ([[Blacksmith|Black Smith]]). Both Dev Datt and Kapila are in contrast as the former lacks power and strength, the latter lacks knowledge and intellectual. According to the playwright, the head of Devdutta (knowledge) and the body of Kapila (physical strength) accomplish a complete man. The narrator compares their pair to the pair of Ram-Laxman, Luv-Kush and Krishna-Balram. All these are the pairs of great brothers in Hindu mythology.\n\nA character, Actor-1 appears on the stage shouting and running towards Bhagwata. He tells Bhagwata that he has just seen a strange creature that looks like a horse (by face) but speaks like a man. That creature has the head of a horse and the rest of the body of a man. Without paying any heed to his talks, Bhagwata asks him to get ready for the play. But he runs away from the stage and soon after he comes back shouting again. Now a strange creature appears on the stage. As earlier described by the Actor-1, the creature has the head of a horse and the body of a man. For a moment, Bhagwata thinks that someone is wearing the mask of horse. He tries to remove the mask but realizes that it is truly half a man and a half horse. Now the creature starts to introduce itself before Bhagwata, Actor-1 and the audience.\n\nThe creature introduces himself as Hayavadana and starts to narrate his story. He tells that once upon a time, a princess had to choose a groom for her marriage. So many Princes approached from far and wide. But the princess fell in love with a horse of an Arabian Prince. She became desperate to marry that horse. Eventually her parents allowed her to do so. She was married to the horse. After 15 years of  their marriage, the horse transformed into a celestial being. Now the princess rejected him as her husband. That celestial being cursed her to be a Mare (female horse) and she became so. The princess give birth to Hayavadana. Now Hayavadana wants to to get rid from this cursed life. Bhagwata asks him to go to goddess Kali temple in chitrkut. He also asks the Actor-1 to accompany him on the way. They leave. \n\nNow Bhagwata moves ahead with the story of the play. Devdutta and Kapila appear on the stage. Devdutta tells Kapil that he wants to marry a woman, namely Padmini. With utmost desire to marry Padmini, he pledges to sacrifice his head to Goddess Kali and his arms to Rudra. Kapila goes to Padmini and presents the Proposal to marry Devdutta. Devdatta and Padmini Marry. By the time, Devdutta realizes that Padmini is attracted towards Kapila and vice-versa. Now Padmini is pregnant. Devdutta knowingly tries to put off the program of visiting Ujjain. He tells Kapila that Padmini is ill. But Padmini gives her consent before Kapila. They all three e leave for Ujjain. Padmini repeatedly praises Kapila's physical strength before Devdutta. Devdutta feels jealous but he does not blame Padmini. Kapila and Padmini go to Rudra Temple but Devdutta denies to accompany them. Devdutta knows that Kapila has such a physical strength and beauty that any woman can get attracted towards him. Devdutta goes to goddess Kali temple where he reminds himself of his pledge to sacrifice his head to the Goddess Kali. He Wishes for the Wellness of Kapila and Padmini. He beheads himself with a sword and dies. \n\nMeanwhile, Kapila and Padmini come out of the temple. Kapila gets worried on finding Devdutta nowhere. He leaves Padmini and starts searching for his friend. Finally he reaches in the same Temple and feels shocked to see his friend dead. He feels himself responsible for all this. Kapila takes the same sword and beheads himself. Soon Padmini reaches there and she has no clue how they got died. She considers herself responsible for the dual between the two friends and their deaths. She provokes the Goddess Kali and also tries to kill herself. The Goddess Kali appears and stops her. The Goddess asks her to place the heads with their respective body so that the Goddess will re-join them with her magical powers and bring them back to life. The Goddess also appreciates the two friends. Padmini follows the command in a hurry. The Goddess disappears. Padmini, being thankful to goddess kali, gets a bit relaxed. But soon she realizes her mistake. She has mistakenly placed the heads with irrespective body. So now Devdutta's head is joined with Kapila's body and vice-versa. Soon they regain their senses. For a moment, the two friends are confused. Both make a claim for Padmini. The man with Devdutta's head, makes a plea that head is the master of the body. So he has the right over Padmini. The man with Kapila's head makes a plea that Padmini has remained with Devdutta's body. So he has the right over Padmini. Meanwhile Bhagwata, the narrator, comes on the stage. All all the characters become statues for a moment and the narrator addresses the audience. He asks them to think of a solution to this problem.

It took place in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], following [[Conchita Wurst]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014 contest]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] with the song \"[[Rise Like a Phoenix]]\". It was the second time Austria had hosted the contest, having previously done so in {{Escyr|1967}}. Organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and host broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk]] (ORF), the contest was held at the [[Wiener Stadthalle]] and consisted of two semi-finals on 19 and 21 May, and the final on 23 May 2015. The three live shows were hosted by [[Mirjam Weichselbraun]], [[Alice Tumler]] and [[Arabella Kiesbauer]], while Conchita Wurst hosted the [[green room]].\n\nForty countries participated in the contest, with {{Esccnty|Australia}} making a guest appearance.\n{{Esccnty|Cyprus}} and {{Esccnty|Serbia}} returned, after their one-year absence, while {{Esccnty|Czech Republic}} returned, after their last participation in {{Escyr|2009}}.  Meanwhile, {{Esccnty|Ukraine}} announced their non-participation due to financial and political reasons regarding the [[Ukrainian crisis]].\n\nThe winner was {{Esccnty|Sweden}} with the song \"[[Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w song)|Heroes]]\", performed by [[M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w]] and written by [[Anton Malmberg H\u00e5rd af Segerstad]], [[Joy Deb]] and [[Linnea Deb]]. This was Sweden's sixth victory in the contest, following their wins in {{Escyr|1974}}, {{Escyr|1984}}, {{Escyr|1991}}, {{Escyr|1999}} and {{Escyr|2012}}. Sweden became the first country to win the contest twice in the current format, and this was the country's second win in four years.\nRussia, Italy, Belgium and Australia rounded out the top five. The top two countries of this contest - Sweden and Russia - were the same as the top two countries in the {{Escyr|2012}} contest. This was the first time since the juries were reintroduced alongside the televoting in {{Escyr|2009}} that the winner did not place first in the televoting; Italy was the televote winner, while Sweden was the jury winner.\nFurther down the table, Montenegro achieved its best result since its independence, finishing thirteenth.\n\nFor the first time, the top four of the contest all scored 200 points or better. Russia's entry \"[[A Million Voices (song)|A Million Voices]]\" became the first non-winning Eurovision song to score over 300 points. Austria and {{Esccnty|Germany}} became the first countries since {{Escyr|2003}} to score [[nul points|no points]] in the final. Austria is also the first host country to score [[nul points]].\nThe EBU reported that over 197 million viewers worldwide watched the contest, beating the 2014 viewing figures by 2&nbsp;million.\n\n== Location ==\n{{details|topic=the host city|Vienna}}\n[[File:Wiener Stadthalle Aussen 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Wiener Stadthalle, Vienna \u2013 host venue of the 2015 contest]]\n\n=== Venue ===\nThe event took place in [[Vienna]], Austria, with the venue being the [[Wiener Stadthalle]], after Austria won the right to host this edition of the Eurovision Song Contest for winning its previous 2014 edition with the song \"[[Rise Like a Phoenix]]\" performed by [[Conchita Wurst]].

It took place in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], following [[Conchita Wurst]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014|2014 contest]] in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]] with the song \"[[Rise Like a Phoenix]]\". It was the second time Austria had hosted the contest, having previously done so in {{Escyr|1967}}. Organised by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU) and host broadcaster [[ORF (broadcaster)|\u00d6sterreichischer Rundfunk]] (ORF), the contest was held at the [[Wiener Stadthalle]] and consisted of two semi-finals on 19 and 21 May, and the final on 23 May 2015. The three live shows were hosted by [[Mirjam Weichselbraun]], [[Alice Tumler]] and [[Arabella Kiesbauer]], while Conchita Wurst hosted the [[green room]].\n\nForty countries participated in the contest, with {{Esccnty|Australia}} making a guest appearance.\n{{Esccnty|Cyprus}} and {{Esccnty|Serbia}} returned, after their one-year absence, while {{Esccnty|Czech Republic}} returned, after their last participation in {{Escyr|2009}}.  Meanwhile, {{Esccnty|Ukraine}} announced their non-participation due to financial and political reasons regarding the [[Ukrainian crisis]].\n\nThe winner was {{Esccnty|Sweden}} with the song \"[[Heroes (M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w song)|Heroes]]\", performed by [[M\u00e5ns Zelmerl\u00f6w]] and written by [[Anton Malmberg H\u00e5rd af Segerstad]], [[Joy Deb]] and [[Linnea Deb]]. This was Sweden's sixth victory in the contest, following their wins in {{Escyr|1974}}, {{Escyr|1984}}, {{Escyr|1991}}, {{Escyr|1999}} and {{Escyr|2012}}. Sweden became the first country to win the contest twice in the current format, and this was the country's second win in four years.\nRussia, Italy, Belgium and Australia rounded out the top five. The top two countries of this contest - Sweden and Russia - were the same as the top two countries in the {{Escyr|2012}} contest. This was the first time since the juries were reintroduced alongside the televoting in {{Escyr|2009}} that the winner did not place first in the televoting; Italy was the televote winner, while Sweden was the jury winner.\nFurther down the table, Montenegro achieved its best result since its independence, finishing thirteenth.\n\nFor the first time, the top four of the contest all scored 200 points or better. Russia's entry \"[[A Million Voices (song)|A Million Voices]]\" became the first non-winning Eurovision song to score over 300 points. Austria and {{Esccnty|Germany}} became the first countries since {{Escyr|2003}} to score [[nul points|no points]] in the final. Austria is also the first host country to score [[nul points]].\nThe EBU reported that over 197 million viewers worldwide watched the contest, beating the 2014 viewing figures by 2&nbsp;million.\n\n== Location ==\n{{details|topic=the host city|Vienna}}\n[[File:Wiener Stadthalle Aussen 2008.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Wiener Stadthalle, Vienna \u2013 host venue of the 2015 contest]]\n\n=== Venue ===\nThe event took place in [[Vienna]], Austria, with the venue being the [[Wiener Stadthalle]], after Austria won the right to host this edition of the Eurovision Song Contest for winning its previous 2014 edition with the song \"[[Rise Like a Phoenix]]\" performed by [[Conchita Wurst]].

His father is so rich that he hates even the smell of the poor, and despises anyone who talks about giving money as alms. Sri Krishna's family, too, doesn't mind the opulence they have. Coming from this family, he falls in love with Satya ([[Poorna]]), who thinks the rich become richer by exploiting the poor. In order to make Satya fall for him, Krishna starts acting as a poor chap, with a poor family. He buys his way out to show Satya that he helps the poor, and unintentionally becomes their savior of sorts. When Satya accepts his love, he recruits his family to help him convince her completely. So the rich father becomes a banana seller, rich mother becomes a bajji seller, etc. However, it turns out that Satya is the daughter of Nagineedu (Nagineedu) a factionist from Kurnool who has a rivalry with another faction leader Venkatappa([[Jaya Prakash Reddy]]). She urges her father to share his riches with his followers, an idea which his father doesn't take. But on knowing that she wants to get married to a poor boy, he doesn't mind it. In order to get them married Krishna asks her father to act as a Head Master. Both families in their disguises respectively meet and arrange the marriage of Krishna and Satya. Faction leader Venkatappa attacks the family of GK to kill Nagineedu. Knowing the truth about Nagineedu, GK is angered and cancels the marriage. Krishna uses his brain to try to help resolve issues between Venkatappa and Nagineedu and also convinces his father GK for the marriage. At the End, the two factionists understand the value of life and they stop fighting. Both GK and Nagineedu once again agree upon Krishna's marriage.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Allari Naresh]] as Sri Krishna\n* [[Poorna]] as Satya\n* [[Sayaji Shinde]] as GK (Gurajada Krishnamurthy)\n* Sudha as Rajyalakshmi (GK's wife)\n* [[L.B.

In the context of [[signal processing]], an image is a distributed [[amplitude]] of color(s).<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/MSP.2018.2832195|title = What is a Signal? &#91;Lecture Notes&#93;| journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine| volume=35| issue=5| pages=175\u201377|date = September 2018|last = Chakravorty|first = Pragnan}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Tourism in London795.jpg|thumb]]\nImages may be two-[[dimensional]], such as a photograph or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a [[statue]] or [[hologram]]. They may be captured by [[optics|optical]] devices (such as [[Camera|cameras]], [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s)  and natural objects and phenomena (such as the [[human eye]] or water).\n\nThe word \"image\" is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a [[map]], a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]], a [[pie chart]], a [[Painting (object)|painting]] or a [[banner]]. In this wider sense, images can also be ''rendered'' manually (such as by drawing, [[painting]], carving), rendered automatically by printing or [[computer graphics]] technology, or [[Image development (visual arts)|developed]] by a combination of methods, especially in a [[pseudo-photograph]].\n\n{{anchor|Volatile image}}A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a [[camera obscura]], or a scene displayed on a [[cathode ray tube]]. A fixed image, also called a [[hard copy]], is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile by photography or any other digital process.\n\nA [[mental image]] exists in an individual's mind, as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a [[graph theory|graph]], function, or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity. For example, [[Sigmund Freud]] claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of [[sound art]] have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis.\n\n===Still or moving===\n[[File:en-wikipedia.jpg|thumb]]\nA ''{{vanchor|still image}}'' is a single static image.

In the context of [[signal processing]], an image is a distributed [[amplitude]] of color(s).<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.1109/MSP.2018.2832195|title = What is a Signal? &#91;Lecture Notes&#93;| journal=IEEE Signal Processing Magazine| volume=35| issue=5| pages=175\u201377|date = September 2018|last = Chakravorty|first = Pragnan}}</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Tourism in London795.jpg|thumb]]\nImages may be two-[[dimensional]], such as a photograph or screen display, or three-dimensional, such as a [[statue]] or [[hologram]]. They may be captured by [[optics|optical]] devices (such as [[Camera|cameras]], [[mirror]]s, [[Lens (optics)|lenses]], [[telescope]]s, [[microscope]]s)  and natural objects and phenomena (such as the [[human eye]] or water).\n\nThe word \"image\" is also used in the broader sense of any two-dimensional figure such as a [[map]], a [[Graph (data structure)|graph]], a [[pie chart]], a [[Painting (object)|painting]] or a [[banner]]. In this wider sense, images can also be ''rendered'' manually (such as by drawing, [[painting]], carving), rendered automatically by printing or [[computer graphics]] technology, or [[Image development (visual arts)|developed]] by a combination of methods, especially in a [[pseudo-photograph]].\n\n{{anchor|Volatile image}}A volatile image is one that exists only for a short period of time. This may be a reflection of an object by a mirror, a projection of a [[camera obscura]], or a scene displayed on a [[cathode ray tube]]. A fixed image, also called a [[hard copy]], is one that has been recorded on a material object, such as paper or textile by photography or any other digital process.\n\nA [[mental image]] exists in an individual's mind, as something one remembers or imagines. The subject of an image need not be real; it may be an abstract concept, such as a [[graph theory|graph]], function, or [[imagination|imaginary]] entity. For example, [[Sigmund Freud]] claimed to have dreamed purely in aural-images of dialogs.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}\n\nThe development of synthetic acoustic technologies and the creation of [[sound art]] have led to a consideration of the possibilities of a sound-image made up of irreducible phonic substance beyond linguistic or musicological analysis.\n\n===Still or moving===\n[[File:en-wikipedia.jpg|thumb]]\nA ''{{vanchor|still image}}'' is a single static image. This phrase is used in photography, visual [[Electronic media|media]] and the [[computer industry]] to emphasize that one is not talking about movies, or in very precise or pedantic technical writing such as a [[Standardization|standard]].\n\nA ''{{vanchor|moving image}}'' is typically a movie (film) or video, including [[digital video]]. It could also be an animated display such as a [[zoetrope]].\n\nA ''[[still frame]]'' is a still image derived from one [[Film frame|frame]] of a moving one.

Soleimani was commander of the [[Quds Force]]\u2014which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Bahrain]]\u2014and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]. Nine others were killed alongside Soleimani, including Iranian and [[Iraq]]i nationals such as deputy chairman of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] militia, [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]]\u2014a designated terrorist in the U.S. and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).\n\nThe strike occurred during the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]], which began after the U.S. [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran]] in 2018, reimposed [[United States sanctions against Iran|sanctions]], and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the [[K-1 Air Base]] in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was [[2019 K-1 Air Base attack|attacked]], killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching [[December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria|airstrikes across Iraq and Syria]], killing 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by [[Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad|attacking the U.S. embassy]] in the [[Green Zone]].\n\nU.S. officials justified the strike claiming it was necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken \"in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks...\" <ref>https://www.lawfareblog.com/white-house-releases-report-justifying-soleimani-strike</ref> Some critics of the strike questioned the legality of the attack with respect to [[international law]], as well as the domestic laws of the U.S. Iran called the strike an act of \"[[state terrorism]]\". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5{{nbsp}}January 2020, the [[Iraqi parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|2015 international nuclear deal]].\n\nSoleimani's killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran and stoked fears of a military conflict. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would [[Preemptive war|preemptively]] attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of [[2020 Iranian attack on U.S. forces in Iraq|missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq]], the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in 1988. Following the shootdown of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] amidst the escalation, leaders from both countries seemed reluctant to further escalate the crisis.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{Further|2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|Iran\u2013United States relations}}\n\n=== Assassination as a policy consideration ===\n\nThe modern Middle East has seen a number of occasions in which the assassination of high-level government and military figures was attempted, or at least considered.

Soleimani was commander of the [[Quds Force]]\u2014which has been designated a terrorist organization by the U.S., [[Canada]], [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Bahrain]]\u2014and was considered the second most powerful person of Iran, subordinate to [[Supreme Leader of Iran|Supreme Leader]] [[Ali Khamenei]]. Nine others were killed alongside Soleimani, including Iranian and [[Iraq]]i nationals such as deputy chairman of Iraq's [[Popular Mobilization Forces]] (PMF) and commander of the Iran-backed [[Kata'ib Hezbollah]] militia, [[Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis]]\u2014a designated terrorist in the U.S. and in the [[United Arab Emirates]] (UAE).\n\nThe strike occurred during the [[2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis]], which began after the U.S. [[United States withdrawal from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal with Iran]] in 2018, reimposed [[United States sanctions against Iran|sanctions]], and accused Iranian elements of fomenting a campaign to harass U.S. forces in the region. On 27 December 2019, the [[K-1 Air Base]] in Iraq, which hosts Iraqi and U.S. personnel, was [[2019 K-1 Air Base attack|attacked]], killing an American contractor. The U.S. responded by launching [[December 2019 United States airstrikes in Iraq and Syria|airstrikes across Iraq and Syria]], killing 25 Kata'ib Hezbollah militiamen. Days later, Shia militiamen and their supporters retaliated by [[Attack on the United States embassy in Baghdad|attacking the U.S. embassy]] in the [[Green Zone]].\n\nU.S. officials justified the strike claiming it was necessary to stop an \"imminent attack\", though later clarifying the legal justification of the action as being taken \"in response to an escalating series of attacks...to protect United States personnel, to deter Iran from conducting or supporting further attacks...and to end Iran's strategic escalation of attacks...\" <ref>https://www.lawfareblog.com/white-house-releases-report-justifying-soleimani-strike</ref> Some critics of the strike questioned the legality of the attack with respect to [[international law]], as well as the domestic laws of the U.S. Iran called the strike an act of \"[[state terrorism]]\". The Iraqi government said the attack undermined its national sovereignty and considered it a breach of its bilateral security agreements with the U.S. and an act of aggression against its officials. On 5{{nbsp}}January 2020, the [[Iraqi parliament]] passed a non-binding resolution to expel all foreign troops from its territory while, on the same day, Iran took the fifth and last step of reducing commitments to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|2015 international nuclear deal]].\n\nSoleimani's killing sharply escalated tensions between the U.S. and Iran and stoked fears of a military conflict. Iranian leaders vowed revenge, while U.S. officials said they would [[Preemptive war|preemptively]] attack any Iran-backed paramilitary groups in Iraq that they perceived as a threat. Many in the international community reacted with concern and issued statements or declarations urging restraint and diplomacy. Five days after the airstrike, Iran launched a series of [[2020 Iranian attack on U.S. forces in Iraq|missile attacks on U.S. forces based in Iraq]], the first direct engagement between Iran and the U.S. since [[Operation Praying Mantis]] in 1988. Following the shootdown of [[Ukraine International Airlines Flight 752]] amidst the escalation, leaders from both countries seemed reluctant to further escalate the crisis.\n\n== Background ==\n\n{{Further|2019\u201320 Persian Gulf crisis|Iran\u2013United States relations}}\n\n=== Assassination as a policy consideration ===\n\nThe modern Middle East has seen a number of occasions in which the assassination of high-level government and military figures was attempted, or at least considered.

Eventually, he disbanded the band to form the Long Island Sounds, the name being a pun on [[Long Island Sound]]. While he played in these bands, he worked at odd jobs on the side to make more money, including trading used comic books. Simmons attended [[Sullivan County Community College]] in [[Loch Sheldrake, New York|Loch Sheldrake]], New York. He joined a new band, Bullfrog Bheer, and the band recorded a demo, \"Leeta\"; this was later included on the Kiss box set.\n\nSimmons formed the rock band [[Wicked Lester]] in the early 1970s with Stanley Eisen (now known as [[Paul Stanley]]) and recorded one album, which was never released. Dissatisfied with Wicked Lester's sound and look, Simmons and Stanley attempted to fire their band members; they were met with resistance, and they quit Wicked Lester, walking away from their record deal with [[Epic Records]]. They decided to form the \"ultimate rock band\", and started looking for a drummer. Simmons and Stanley found an ad placed by George Peter John Criscuola (known as [[Peter Criss]]) who was playing clubs in [[Brooklyn]] at the time; they joined and started out as a trio.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring this time, Criss and Simmons also appeared on an unreleased album by Captain Sanity together with members from Criss' previous band Chelsea. Paul Frehley (better known as [[Ace Frehley]]) responded to an ad they put in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' for a lead guitar player, and soon joined them. [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] released their self-titled debut album in February 1974. Stanley took on the role of lead performer on stage, while Simmons became the driving force behind what became an extensive [[Kiss merchandising]] [[exclusive right|franchise]]. The eye section of his \"Demon\" makeup with Kiss came from the wing design of comic book character [[Black Bolt]].<ref>KISS bassist Gene Simmons said on an episode of his television show Gene Simmons Family Jewels that he is a big comic book fan, with the bat-like \"wings\" in his \"Demon\" persona costume being modelled after those worn by Black Bolt [http://www.livedash.com/transcript/gene_simmons_family_jewels-(under_the_knife_)/6120/AETVP/Wednesday_November_3_2010/328010/ Gene Simmons Family Jewels \u2013 Under the Knife? \u2013 Wednesday, Nov 3, 2010 \u2013 mReplay Livedash TV Transcript \u2013 Livedash \u2013 Search what is being mentioned across national TV] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009170844/http://www.livedash.com/transcript/gene_simmons_family_jewels-%28under_the_knife_%29/6120/AETVP/Wednesday_November_3_2010/328010/ |date=October 9, 2011 }}.

At this time, Peter Criss, the original drummer, was voted out of the band, and a replacement was sought to fill his vacancy. The new drummer was Paul Charles Caravello, who went by the stage name of [[Eric Carr]], and played for Kiss from 1980 until his death in 1991. The band hosted its own fan conventions in 1995, and fan feedback about the original Kiss members reunion influenced the highly successful 1996\u20131997 Alive Worldwide reunion tour. In 1998, the band released ''[[Psycho Circus]]''. Since then, the original line-up has once again dissolved, with [[Tommy Thayer]] replacing [[Ace Frehley]] on lead guitar and [[Eric Singer]] (who performed with Kiss from 1991 through 1996) replacing [[Peter Criss]] on drums.\n\n==Playing style==\nAs well as being the bass player, lead vocal duties are split between Simmons and rhythm guitarist [[Paul Stanley]] among most Kiss songs. Some notable songs featuring Simmons singing lead include \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\", \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\", \"[[A World Without Heroes]]\", \"[[I Love It Loud]]\", \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\", \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\", \"Spit\" (second lead vocals), \"Boomerang\", \"[[You Wanted the Best]]\" (first lead vocals), and \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", among others. Simmons possesses a baritone vocal range.\n\n===Stage makeup and persona===\nIn addition to playing bass, Simmons is known for his long tongue, which he frequently sticks out while performing, and on stage is known for his demonic figure by spitting fire and vomiting stage blood. \n\nDuring a 1999 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Simmons was asked about the source and significance of Kiss' stage makeup and personas:\n\n<blockquote>I've always been a fan of [[Americana]], and Americana has always been about imagery, often above content. I think there's nothing wrong with that. The world worships this culture. Most people only think about America in terms of rock & roll, movies and television. Kiss is very all-American, in the sense that our constituency has never had anything in common with critics ... because our power, our lifeblood, our very reason for existence is our fans. Without them, we'd be nothing.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rolling Stone: The Illustrated Portraits|last=Woodward|first=Fred|publisher=Chronicle Books|year=2000|isbn=978-0811828161|location=|pages=213}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:Gene Simmons - Azkena Rock Festival 2010 7.jpg|thumb|right|Gene Simmons [[fire breathing]]]]\nSimmons is a science fiction and [[comic book]] fan and published several [[science fiction fanzines]], among them ''Id'', ''Cosmos'' (which eventually merged with ''Stilletto'' to become ''Cosmos-Stilletto'' and then ''Faun''), ''Tinderbox'', ''Sci-Fi Showcase'', ''Mantis'' and ''Adventure''.

Eventually, he disbanded the band to form the Long Island Sounds, the name being a pun on [[Long Island Sound]]. While he played in these bands, he worked at odd jobs on the side to make more money, including trading used comic books. Simmons attended [[Sullivan County Community College]] in [[Loch Sheldrake, New York|Loch Sheldrake]], New York. He joined a new band, Bullfrog Bheer, and the band recorded a demo, \"Leeta\"; this was later included on the Kiss box set.\n\nSimmons formed the rock band [[Wicked Lester]] in the early 1970s with Stanley Eisen (now known as [[Paul Stanley]]) and recorded one album, which was never released. Dissatisfied with Wicked Lester's sound and look, Simmons and Stanley attempted to fire their band members; they were met with resistance, and they quit Wicked Lester, walking away from their record deal with [[Epic Records]]. They decided to form the \"ultimate rock band\", and started looking for a drummer. Simmons and Stanley found an ad placed by George Peter John Criscuola (known as [[Peter Criss]]) who was playing clubs in [[Brooklyn]] at the time; they joined and started out as a trio.{{Citation needed|date=February 2019}}\n\nDuring this time, Criss and Simmons also appeared on an unreleased album by Captain Sanity together with members from Criss' previous band Chelsea. Paul Frehley (better known as [[Ace Frehley]]) responded to an ad they put in ''[[The Village Voice]]'' for a lead guitar player, and soon joined them. [[Kiss (band)|Kiss]] released their self-titled debut album in February 1974. Stanley took on the role of lead performer on stage, while Simmons became the driving force behind what became an extensive [[Kiss merchandising]] [[exclusive right|franchise]].

At this time, Peter Criss, the original drummer, was voted out of the band, and a replacement was sought to fill his vacancy. The new drummer was Paul Charles Caravello, who went by the stage name of [[Eric Carr]], and played for Kiss from 1980 until his death in 1991. The band hosted its own fan conventions in 1995, and fan feedback about the original Kiss members reunion influenced the highly successful 1996\u20131997 Alive Worldwide reunion tour. In 1998, the band released ''[[Psycho Circus]]''. Since then, the original line-up has once again dissolved, with [[Tommy Thayer]] replacing [[Ace Frehley]] on lead guitar and [[Eric Singer]] (who performed with Kiss from 1991 through 1996) replacing [[Peter Criss]] on drums.\n\n==Playing style==\nAs well as being the bass player, lead vocal duties are split between Simmons and rhythm guitarist [[Paul Stanley]] among most Kiss songs. Some notable songs featuring Simmons singing lead include \"[[Rock and Roll All Nite]]\", \"[[Deuce (song)|Deuce]]\", \"[[A World Without Heroes]]\", \"[[I Love It Loud]]\", \"[[Calling Dr. Love]]\", \"[[Unholy (song)|Unholy]]\", \"Spit\" (second lead vocals), \"Boomerang\", \"[[You Wanted the Best]]\" (first lead vocals), and \"[[Christine Sixteen]]\", among others. Simmons possesses a baritone vocal range.\n\n===Stage makeup and persona===\nIn addition to playing bass, Simmons is known for his long tongue, which he frequently sticks out while performing, and on stage is known for his demonic figure by spitting fire and vomiting stage blood. \n\nDuring a 1999 interview with ''Rolling Stone'', Simmons was asked about the source and significance of Kiss' stage makeup and personas:\n\n<blockquote>I've always been a fan of [[Americana]], and Americana has always been about imagery, often above content. I think there's nothing wrong with that. The world worships this culture. Most people only think about America in terms of rock & roll, movies and television. Kiss is very all-American, in the sense that our constituency has never had anything in common with critics ... because our power, our lifeblood, our very reason for existence is our fans.

The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but the only sections that can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government are the Second Section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], known also as the Section for Relations with States, the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]] (established in 1939 by [[Pius XII]]), and the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]], \n\nIt is normal for every Latin Catholic [[diocese]] to have its own ''curia'' for its administration. For the [[Diocese of Rome]], these functions are ''not'' handled by the Roman Curia, but by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome]], as provided by the apostolic constitution ''[[Ecclesia in Urbe]]''. The pope has, going back to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], been the bishop of Rome. There is also the The [[Vicar General of Rome]], traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the [[Vicar General for Vatican City]], administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in [[Vatican City]].\n\nUntil recently, there still existed [[hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the [[Papal States]] were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by [[Pope Pius X]], was incorporated into the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507667/Roman-Curia |title=Roman Curia (Roman Catholicism) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the [[Holy See]].

The Roman Curia can be loosely compared to [[Cabinet (government)|cabinets]] in governments of countries with a Western form of governance, but the only sections that can be directly compared with specific ministries of a civil government are the Second Section of the [[Secretariat of State (Holy See)|Secretariat of State]], known also as the Section for Relations with States, the [[Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]] (established in 1939 by [[Pius XII]]), and the [[Congregation for Catholic Education]], \n\nIt is normal for every Latin Catholic [[diocese]] to have its own ''curia'' for its administration. For the [[Diocese of Rome]], these functions are ''not'' handled by the Roman Curia, but by the [[Cardinal Vicar|Vicariate General of His Holiness for the City of Rome]], as provided by the apostolic constitution ''[[Ecclesia in Urbe]]''. The pope has, going back to [[Saint Peter|St. Peter]], been the bishop of Rome. There is also the The [[Vicar General of Rome]], traditionally a cardinal, and his deputy the vicegerent, who holds the personal title of archbishop, supervise the governance of the diocese by reference to the Pope himself, but with no more dependence on the Roman Curia, as such, than other Catholic dioceses throughout the world. A distinct office, the [[Vicar General for Vatican City]], administers the portion of the Diocese of Rome in [[Vatican City]].\n\nUntil recently, there still existed [[hereditary officers of the Roman Curia]], holding titles denominating functions that had ceased to be a reality when the [[Papal States]] were lost to the papacy. A reorganization, ordered by [[Pope Pius X]], was incorporated into the [[1917 Code of Canon Law]]. Further steps toward reorganization were begun by [[Pope Paul VI]] in the 1960s. Among the goals of this curial reform were the modernization of procedures and the internationalization of the curial staff. These reforms are reflected in the [[1983 Code of Canon Law]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/507667/Roman-Curia |title=Roman Curia (Roman Catholicism) \u2013 Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |accessdate=26 July 2013}}</ref> The offices of the Vatican City State are not part of the Roman Curia, which is composed only of offices of the [[Holy See]].
