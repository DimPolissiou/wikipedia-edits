Studies by RAND have found that in previous joint programs, different service-specific requirements for complex programs have led to design compromises that raise costs far more than normal single-service programs.  In a comparison between four recent joint service programs ([[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]], [[Joint Strike Fighter]], [[T-6A Texan II]] [[Joint Primary Aircraft Training System]], [[E-8 JSTARS]], [[V-22 Osprey]]) and four recent single-service programs ([[C-17 Globemaster III]], F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, [[T-45 Goshawk]]), costs for joint programs rose 65 percent nine years after a Milestone B decision to move into engineering and manufacturing development compared to 24 percent for independent programs during the same timespan.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/RB9700/RR9759/RAND_RB9759.pdf | title = The Department of Defense Should Avoid a Joint Acquisition Approach to the Sixth-Generation Fighter | publisher = Rand | format = PDF | access-date = 2014-01-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140219035026/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/RB9700/RR9759/RAND_RB9759.pdf | archive-date = 2014-02-19 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nEngine development for sixth generation fighters is already underway to be more efficient in making jets faster and giving them a longer range.  While current engines operate best at a single point in the flight envelope, newer engines could vary their bypass ratios for optimum efficiency at any speed or altitude.  That would give an aircraft a much greater range, faster acceleration, and greater subsonic cruise efficiency.  A [[variable cycle engine]] could configure itself to act like a turbojet at supersonic speeds, while performing like a high-bypass turbofan for efficient cruising at slower speeds; the ability to [[supercruise]] may not be a critical requirement, but it will likely be able to with this engine type.  One critical component is the adaptive fan to allow the engine to vary its bypass ratio depending on altitude and speed with a third stream of air to increase or decrease the bypass ratio.  A low-bypass configuration would be used for take offs and supersonic flight, and a high-bypass configuration would have high propulsive efficiency for cruising.  The U.S. Navy and Air Force have different sixth generation fighter development programs, but both services are working together on engine development.  The Air Force is aiming for a Milestone A decision by 2018, with a production version to be ready possibly by 2021.  Companies involved with next-generation engine development include [[General Electric]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://news.usni.org/2014/06/23/next-generation-engine-work-points-future-u-s-fighter-designs | title = Next Generation Engine Work Points to Future U.S. Fighter Designs | publisher = USNI | date = 23 June 2014 | access-date = 23 June 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140625183540/http://news.usni.org/2014/06/23/next-generation-engine-work-points-future-u-s-fighter-designs | archive-date = 25 June 2014 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 July 2014, General Mike Hostage spoke about the evolving nature of proposed sixth-generation fighter requirements at an event hosted by the [[Air Force Association]] (AFA).  Since [[Air Combat Command]] released a [[request for information]] (RFI) in 2009 for industry feedback on sixth-generation air dominance technologies, teams thinking of requirements have been told not to think in terms of a \"platform\" like a single-seat fighter with a certain number of engines.  Hostage remarked that if next-generation air dominance capabilities came from pressing \"a single button on a keyboard that makes all our adversaries fall to the ground\" it would be acceptable.  Concepts from the Air Force and industry have so far revolved around supersonic [[tailless aircraft]]. One of the key limitations in relying on a single platform is they have a limited weapons load, so the original RFI sought ground-based and non-kinetic solutions, with whatever sixth-generation technology being required to have a larger magazine than current fighter solutions.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-debates-future-fighter-requirement-402243/ | title = USAF debates future fighter requirement | publisher = Flight global | date = 31 July 2014 | access-date = 31 July 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051838/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-debates-future-fighter-requirement-402243/ | archive-date = 8 August 2014 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are significant differences between Navy and Air Force visions for their respective next-generation jet concepts, but both agree on some fundamental characteristic aspects they will share.  American sixth-generation fighters are to feature [[artificial intelligence]] as a decision aid to the pilot, similar in concept to how advanced sensor fusion is used by the F-22 and F-35.  They will also have Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), and communications that allow big data movement between both service's aircraft.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://news.usni.org/2014/08/28/navys-next-fighter-likely-feature-artificial-intelligence | title = Navy\u2019s Next Fighter Likely to Feature Artificial Intelligence | publisher = USNI | date = 28 August 2014 | access-date = 29 August 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140901045923/http://news.usni.org/2014/08/28/navys-next-fighter-likely-feature-artificial-intelligence | archive-date = 1 September 2014 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAir Force General [[Herbert Carlisle]] said in February 2015 that stealth is \"incredibly important\" for their next-generation F-X fighter.  This contrasts with statements made by [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Jonathan Greenert]] that their F/A-XX fighter might not be so focused on survivability as to sacrifice speed and payload.  Unlike the previous F-22 and F-35 development programs that depended on new technologies that drove up cost and delayed introduction, the Air Force is intending to follow a methodical path of risk reduction to include as much prototyping, technology demonstration, and systems engineering work as possible before creation of an aircraft actually starts.  Carlisle describes the sixth-generation strike capability not as just an aircraft, but a system of systems including communications, space capabilities, standoff, and stand-in options.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/acc-chief-stealth-incredibly-important-next-usaf-fighter ACC Chief: Stealth \u2018Incredibly Important\u2019 For Next USAF Fighter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213203440/http://aviationweek.com/defense/acc-chief-stealth-incredibly-important-next-usaf-fighter |date=2015-02-13 }} \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 12 February 2015</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the Navy revealed they were working with the Air Force to potentially release joint analysis of alternatives (AoA) in 2016 for their next-generation fighters; they are allowed to take a joint AoA, then define a service solution that would be good for each service.  The Navy is focusing on replacing the capabilities of the fighter with a wide range of options for the Super Hornet, as well as the [[EA-18G Growler]].  The AoA will run parallel to several other design and technology efforts including engine technology, airframe molds, broadband and IR stealth, and new ways to dominate the electromagnetic spectrum.  Part of the Navy's calculus will be based on how the F-35C performs as a critical forward sensor node for the carrier air wing.  How the fifth-generation F-35C integrates with the rest of the air wing to give greater capabilities than what the platform itself can do may lend itself to the sixth-generation F/A-XX.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/03/27/navy-and-air-force-planning-joint-exploration-of-next-generation-fighter-follow-ons-to-f-22-and-fa-18 Navy and Air Force Planning Joint Exploration of Next Generation Fighter Follow Ons to F-22 and F/A-18E/F] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331205222/http://news.usni.org/2015/03/27/navy-and-air-force-planning-joint-exploration-of-next-generation-fighter-follow-ons-to-f-22-and-fa-18 |date=2015-03-31 }} \u2013 News.USNI.org, 27 March 2015</ref> The Navy aircraft is to have greatly increased speed and range compared to the Super Hornet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-navy-secretly-want-f-14-tomcat-back-35392 |title=Does the Navy Secretly Want the F-14 Tomcat Back? |date=7 November 2018 |website=The National Interest |accessdate=29 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121120015/https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-navy-secretly-want-f-14-tomcat-back-35392 |archive-date=21 November 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, the [[Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments]] (CSBA) released a report concluding that the next-generation U.S. Air Force fighter should be larger and more resembling a bomber than a small, maneuverable traditional fighter.  It analyzed over 1,450 air-to-air engagements since 1965 and found that long-range weapons and sensors have dramatically decreased instances of dogfighting.  With the increase of air defense systems using electronic and infrared sensors and high-speed weapons, traditional designs relying on small size, high speed, and maneuverability may be less relevant and easier to intercept.  As a result, the CSBA suggests building a fighter significantly larger relying on enhanced sensors, signature control, networked situational awareness, and very-long-range weapons to complete engagements before being detected or tracked.  Larger planes would have greater range that would enable them to be stationed further from a combat zone, have greater radar and IR detection capabilities, and carry bigger and longer-range missiles ([[Long-Range Engagement Weapon]]).  One airframe could be fitted with various attachments to fill several roles.  The concept of a small number of large, intercontinental and heavily armed combat aircraft could link itself to the development of the [[Long Range Strike Bomber]].<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/should-future-fighter-be-like-a-bomber-groundbreaking-csba-study/ Should Future Fighter Be Like A Bomber?

Studies by RAND have found that in previous joint programs, different service-specific requirements for complex programs have led to design compromises that raise costs far more than normal single-service programs.  In a comparison between four recent joint service programs ([[Lockheed Martin F-35 Lightning II|F-35]], [[Joint Strike Fighter]], [[T-6A Texan II]] [[Joint Primary Aircraft Training System]], [[E-8 JSTARS]], [[V-22 Osprey]]) and four recent single-service programs ([[C-17 Globemaster III]], F/A-18E/F Super Hornet, F-22 Raptor, [[T-45 Goshawk]]), costs for joint programs rose 65 percent nine years after a Milestone B decision to move into engineering and manufacturing development compared to 24 percent for independent programs during the same timespan.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/RB9700/RR9759/RAND_RB9759.pdf | title = The Department of Defense Should Avoid a Joint Acquisition Approach to the Sixth-Generation Fighter | publisher = Rand | format = PDF | access-date = 2014-01-22 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140219035026/http://www.rand.org/content/dam/rand/pubs/research_briefs/RB9700/RR9759/RAND_RB9759.pdf | archive-date = 2014-02-19 | url-status = live }}</ref>\n\nEngine development for sixth generation fighters is already underway to be more efficient in making jets faster and giving them a longer range.  While current engines operate best at a single point in the flight envelope, newer engines could vary their bypass ratios for optimum efficiency at any speed or altitude.  That would give an aircraft a much greater range, faster acceleration, and greater subsonic cruise efficiency.  A [[variable cycle engine]] could configure itself to act like a turbojet at supersonic speeds, while performing like a high-bypass turbofan for efficient cruising at slower speeds; the ability to [[supercruise]] may not be a critical requirement, but it will likely be able to with this engine type.  One critical component is the adaptive fan to allow the engine to vary its bypass ratio depending on altitude and speed with a third stream of air to increase or decrease the bypass ratio.  A low-bypass configuration would be used for take offs and supersonic flight, and a high-bypass configuration would have high propulsive efficiency for cruising.  The U.S. Navy and Air Force have different sixth generation fighter development programs, but both services are working together on engine development.  The Air Force is aiming for a Milestone A decision by 2018, with a production version to be ready possibly by 2021.  Companies involved with next-generation engine development include [[General Electric]] and [[Pratt & Whitney]].<ref>{{Citation | url = http://news.usni.org/2014/06/23/next-generation-engine-work-points-future-u-s-fighter-designs | title = Next Generation Engine Work Points to Future U.S. Fighter Designs | publisher = USNI | date = 23 June 2014 | access-date = 23 June 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140625183540/http://news.usni.org/2014/06/23/next-generation-engine-work-points-future-u-s-fighter-designs | archive-date = 25 June 2014 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nOn 30 July 2014, General Mike Hostage spoke about the evolving nature of proposed sixth-generation fighter requirements at an event hosted by the [[Air Force Association]] (AFA).  Since [[Air Combat Command]] released a [[request for information]] (RFI) in 2009 for industry feedback on sixth-generation air dominance technologies, teams thinking of requirements have been told not to think in terms of a \"platform\" like a single-seat fighter with a certain number of engines.  Hostage remarked that if next-generation air dominance capabilities came from pressing \"a single button on a keyboard that makes all our adversaries fall to the ground\" it would be acceptable.  Concepts from the Air Force and industry have so far revolved around supersonic [[tailless aircraft]]. One of the key limitations in relying on a single platform is they have a limited weapons load, so the original RFI sought ground-based and non-kinetic solutions, with whatever sixth-generation technology being required to have a larger magazine than current fighter solutions.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-debates-future-fighter-requirement-402243/ | title = USAF debates future fighter requirement | publisher = Flight global | date = 31 July 2014 | access-date = 31 July 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051838/http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/usaf-debates-future-fighter-requirement-402243/ | archive-date = 8 August 2014 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThere are significant differences between Navy and Air Force visions for their respective next-generation jet concepts, but both agree on some fundamental characteristic aspects they will share.  American sixth-generation fighters are to feature [[artificial intelligence]] as a decision aid to the pilot, similar in concept to how advanced sensor fusion is used by the F-22 and F-35.  They will also have Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT), and communications that allow big data movement between both service's aircraft.<ref>{{Citation | url = http://news.usni.org/2014/08/28/navys-next-fighter-likely-feature-artificial-intelligence | title = Navy\u2019s Next Fighter Likely to Feature Artificial Intelligence | publisher = USNI | date = 28 August 2014 | access-date = 29 August 2014 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20140901045923/http://news.usni.org/2014/08/28/navys-next-fighter-likely-feature-artificial-intelligence | archive-date = 1 September 2014 | url-status = live | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nAir Force General [[Herbert Carlisle]] said in February 2015 that stealth is \"incredibly important\" for their next-generation F-X fighter.  This contrasts with statements made by [[Chief of Naval Operations]] Admiral [[Jonathan Greenert]] that their F/A-XX fighter might not be so focused on survivability as to sacrifice speed and payload.  Unlike the previous F-22 and F-35 development programs that depended on new technologies that drove up cost and delayed introduction, the Air Force is intending to follow a methodical path of risk reduction to include as much prototyping, technology demonstration, and systems engineering work as possible before creation of an aircraft actually starts.  Carlisle describes the sixth-generation strike capability not as just an aircraft, but a system of systems including communications, space capabilities, standoff, and stand-in options.<ref>[http://aviationweek.com/defense/acc-chief-stealth-incredibly-important-next-usaf-fighter ACC Chief: Stealth \u2018Incredibly Important\u2019 For Next USAF Fighter] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150213203440/http://aviationweek.com/defense/acc-chief-stealth-incredibly-important-next-usaf-fighter |date=2015-02-13 }} \u2013 Aviationweek.com, 12 February 2015</ref>\n\nIn March 2015, the Navy revealed they were working with the Air Force to potentially release joint analysis of alternatives (AoA) in 2016 for their next-generation fighters; they are allowed to take a joint AoA, then define a service solution that would be good for each service.  The Navy is focusing on replacing the capabilities of the fighter with a wide range of options for the Super Hornet, as well as the [[EA-18G Growler]].  The AoA will run parallel to several other design and technology efforts including engine technology, airframe molds, broadband and IR stealth, and new ways to dominate the electromagnetic spectrum.  Part of the Navy's calculus will be based on how the F-35C performs as a critical forward sensor node for the carrier air wing.  How the fifth-generation F-35C integrates with the rest of the air wing to give greater capabilities than what the platform itself can do may lend itself to the sixth-generation F/A-XX.<ref>[http://news.usni.org/2015/03/27/navy-and-air-force-planning-joint-exploration-of-next-generation-fighter-follow-ons-to-f-22-and-fa-18 Navy and Air Force Planning Joint Exploration of Next Generation Fighter Follow Ons to F-22 and F/A-18E/F] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331205222/http://news.usni.org/2015/03/27/navy-and-air-force-planning-joint-exploration-of-next-generation-fighter-follow-ons-to-f-22-and-fa-18 |date=2015-03-31 }} \u2013 News.USNI.org, 27 March 2015</ref> The Navy aircraft is to have greatly increased speed and range compared to the Super Hornet.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-navy-secretly-want-f-14-tomcat-back-35392 |title=Does the Navy Secretly Want the F-14 Tomcat Back? |date=7 November 2018 |website=The National Interest |accessdate=29 December 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181121120015/https://nationalinterest.org/blog/buzz/does-navy-secretly-want-f-14-tomcat-back-35392 |archive-date=21 November 2018 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIn April 2015, the [[Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments]] (CSBA) released a report concluding that the next-generation U.S. Air Force fighter should be larger and more resembling a bomber than a small, maneuverable traditional fighter.  It analyzed over 1,450 air-to-air engagements since 1965 and found that long-range weapons and sensors have dramatically decreased instances of dogfighting.  With the increase of air defense systems using electronic and infrared sensors and high-speed weapons, traditional designs relying on small size, high speed, and maneuverability may be less relevant and easier to intercept.  As a result, the CSBA suggests building a fighter significantly larger relying on enhanced sensors, signature control, networked situational awareness, and very-long-range weapons to complete engagements before being detected or tracked.  Larger planes would have greater range that would enable them to be stationed further from a combat zone, have greater radar and IR detection capabilities, and carry bigger and longer-range missiles ([[Long-Range Engagement Weapon]]).  One airframe could be fitted with various attachments to fill several roles.  The concept of a small number of large, intercontinental and heavily armed combat aircraft could link itself to the development of the [[Long Range Strike Bomber]].<ref>[http://breakingdefense.com/2015/04/should-future-fighter-be-like-a-bomber-groundbreaking-csba-study/ Should Future Fighter Be Like A Bomber?
