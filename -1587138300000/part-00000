It provides a [[graphical user interface]] for accessing the [[file system]]s. It is also the component of the operating system that presents many user interface items on the screen such as the [[taskbar]] and [[desktop environment|desktop]]. Controlling the computer is possible without Windows Explorer running (for example, the File | Run command in Task Manager on NT-derived versions of Windows will function without it, as will commands typed in a command prompt window).\n\n==Overview==\nWindows Explorer was first included with [[Windows 95]] as a replacement for [[File Manager (Windows)|File Manager]], which came with all versions of [[Windows 3.x]] operating systems. Explorer could be accessed by double-clicking the new My Computer desktop icon, or launched from the new [[Start Menu]] that replaced the earlier [[Program Manager]]. There is also a shortcut key combination: [[Windows key]] + E. Successive versions of Windows (and in some cases, [[Internet Explorer]]) introduced new features and capabilities, removed other features, and generally progressed from being a simple file system navigation tool into a task-based file management system.\n\nWhile \"Windows Explorer\" or \"File Explorer\" is a term most commonly used to describe the file management aspect of the operating system, the Explorer {{em|process}} also houses the operating system's search functionality and File Type associations (based on [[filename extension]]s), and is responsible for displaying the [[Desktop environment|desktop]] [[Icon (computing)|icons]], the [[Start Menu]], the [[Taskbar]], and the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]]. Collectively, these features are known as the [[Windows shell]].\n\nAfter a user logs in, the explorer process is created by userinit process. Userinit performs some initialization of the user environment (such as running the login script and applying group policies) and then looks in the registry at the Shell value and creates a process to run the system-defined shell \u2013 by default, Explorer.exe. Then Userinit exits. This is why Explorer.exe is shown by various process explorers with no parent \u2013 its parent has exited.\n\n==History==\nIn 1995, [[Microsoft]] first released test versions of a shell refresh, named the Shell Technology Preview, and often referred to informally as \"NewShell\".<ref>{{cite web |author-first=Nathan |author-last=Lineback |url=http://toastytech.com/guis/misc4.html|title=Misc Windows|website=toastytech.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> The update was designed to replace the Windows 3.x Program Manager/File Manager based shell with Windows Explorer. The release provided capabilities quite similar to that of the Windows \"Chicago\" ([[Microsoft codenames|codename]] for Windows 95) shell during its late beta phases, however was intended to be nothing more than a test release.<ref>{{cite web |author=John D.

Both held Windows Explorer builds of 3.51.1053.1. The Shell Technology Preview program never saw a final release under NT 3.51. The entire program was moved across to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]] development group who finally integrated the new shell design into the NT code with the release of NT 4.0 in July 1996.\n\n===Windows 98 and Windows Desktop Update===\nWith the release of the [[Windows Desktop Update]] (packaged with [[Internet Explorer 4]] as an optional component, and included in [[Windows 98]]), Windows Explorer became \"integrated\" with Internet Explorer, most notably with the addition of navigation arrows (back and forward) for moving between recently visited directories, as well as Internet Explorer's Favorites menu.\n\nAn [[address bar]] was also added to Windows Explorer, which a user could type in directory paths directly, and be taken to that folder.\n\nAnother feature that was based on Internet Explorer technology was customized folders. Such folders contained a hidden web page that controlled the way the Windows Explorer displayed the contents of the folder.\n\n===Windows ME and Windows 2000===\n[[File:Windows 2000 Explorer.png|thumb|The integrated media player in Windows Explorer in [[Windows 2000]] playing a [[MIDI]] sequence on Media folder.|alt=]]\nThe \"Web-style\" folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default.

[[Shortcut (computing)|File shortcuts]] can also store comments which are displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the shortcut.\n\nThe right-hand pane, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren't displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer.

The [[Indexing Service]] has also been integrated into the operating system and the search pane built into Explorer allows searching files indexed by its database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms689718.aspx|title=What is Indexing Service?|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> The ability to customize the standard buttons was also added.\n\n===Windows XP and Windows Server 2003===\n[[File:Windows Explorer XP.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in [[Windows XP]], showing All Users folder contents.|alt=]]\nThere were significant changes made to Windows Explorer in [[Windows XP]], both visually and functionally. Microsoft focused especially on making Explorer more discoverable and task-based, as well as adding a number of features to reflect the growing use of a computer as a [[Technological convergence|digital hub]].\n\nWindows Explorer in [[Windows Server 2003]] contains all the same features as Windows XP, but the task panes and search companion are disabled by default.\n\n====Task pane====\nThe task pane is displayed on the left-hand side of the window instead of the traditional folder tree view. It presents the user with a list of common actions and destinations that are relevant to the current directory or file(s) selected. For instance, when in a directory containing mostly pictures, a set of \"Picture tasks\" is shown, offering the options to display these pictures as a slide show, to print them out, or to go online to order prints. Conversely, a folder containing music files would offer options to play those files in a media player, or to go online to purchase music. Windows XP had a Media bar but it was removed with SP1. The Media Bar was only available with Windows XP RTM.\n\nEvery folder also has \"File and Folder Tasks\", offering options to create new folders, share a folder on the local network, publish files or folders to a web site, and other common tasks like copying, renaming, moving, and deleting files or folders. File types that have identified themselves as being printable also have an option listed to print the file.\n\nUnderneath \"File and Folder Tasks\" is \"Other Places\", with links to other common locations such as \"My Computer\", \"Control Panel\", and \"My Documents\". These also change depending on what folder the user was in, leading to some criticism of Microsoft for not being consistent in displaying navigation choices.\n\nUnderneath \"Other Places\" is a \"Details\" pane which gives additional information \u2013 typically file size and date, but depending on the file type, a thumbnail preview, author, image dimensions, or other details.\n\nThe \"Folders\" button on the Windows Explorer toolbar toggles between the traditional tree view of folders, and the task pane. Users can get rid of the task pane or restore it using the sequence: Tools \u2013 Folder Options \u2013 General \u2013 Show Common Tasks/Use Windows Classic Folders.\n\n====Search companion====\n[[File:Windows Explorer search puppy.png|thumb|Windows Explorer's default Search Companion, Rover in [[Windows XP]]|alt=]]\nMicrosoft introduced animated \"Search Companions\" in an attempt to make searching more engaging and friendly; the default character is a puppy named Rover (previously used in [[Microsoft Bob]]), with three other characters (Merlin the magician, Earl the surfer, and Courtney) also available. These search companions use the same technology as [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[Office Assistant]]s, even incorporating \"tricks\" and sound effects, and they can be used as Office Assistants if their files are copied into the C:\\Windows\\msagent\\chars folder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/is-microsoft-office-2003-still-decent-for-general/74b58c58-93e9-4865-b598-2ad22fe497e6?auth=1|title=Is Microsoft Office 2003 still decent for general use on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10|website=answers.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe search capability itself is fairly similar to Windows ME and Windows 2000, with one major addition: Search can also be instructed to search only files that are categorically \"Documents\" or \"Pictures, music and video\"; this feature is noteworthy largely because of how Windows determines what types of files can be classified under these categories. In order to maintain a relevant list of file types, Windows Explorer connects to Microsoft and downloads a set of XML files that define what these file types are. The Search Companion can be disabled in favor of the classic search pane used in Windows 2000 by using the [[Tweak UI]] applet from [[Microsoft PowerToys#PowerToys for Windows XP|Microsoft's PowerToys for Windows XP]], or by manually editing the registry.\n\n====Image handling====\n[[Image:Thumbnailviewxp.png|thumb|Folder thumbnail preview icon on [[Windows XP]]|alt=]]\nWindows XP improves image preview in Explorer by offering a Filmstrip view. \"Back\" and \"Previous\" buttons facilitate navigation through the pictures, and a pair of \"Rotate\" buttons offer 90-degree clockwise and counter-clockwise ([[Lossy data compression|lossy]]){{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} rotation of images. Aside from the Filmstrip view mode, there is a 'Thumbnails' mode, which displays [[thumbnail]]-sized images in the folder. A Folder containing images will also show thumbnails of four of the images from that folder overlaid on top of a large folder icon.\n\n====Web publishing====\nWeb sites that offer image hosting services can be plugged into Windows Explorer, which the user can use to select images on their computer, and have them uploaded correctly without dealing with comparatively complex solutions involving FTP or web interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n====Other changes====\n* Explorer gained the ability to understand the metadata of a number of types of files. For example, with images from a digital camera, the [[Exif]] information can be viewed, both in the Properties pages for the photo itself, as well as via optional additional Details View columns.\n* A Tile view mode was added, which displays the file's icon in a larger size (48 \u00d7 48), and places the file name, descriptive type, and additional information (typically the file size for data files, and the publisher name for applications) to the right.\n* The Details view also presented an additional option called \"Show in Groups\" which allows the Explorer to separate its contents by headings based on the field which is used to sort the items.\n* The taskbar can be locked to prevent it from accidentally being moved.\n* Windows Explorer also gained the ability to burn CDs and [[DVD-RAM]] discs in Windows XP.\n* Support for ZIP files called \"compressed folders\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/whatsnew_overview.mspx?mfr=true|title=Windows XP \u2013 What's new with files and folders|website=Windows|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523022826/http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/whatsnew_overview.mspx?mfr=true|archivedate=May 23, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Removed and changed features====\n{{expand section|date=December 2012}}\n{{See also|List of features removed in Windows XP#Windows Explorer}}\n* The sort order has changed compared to the one in Windows 2000.

An alternative is to use the findstr command-line function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Search-for-Contents-in-Any-File-Type-Without-Indexing-Service-Enabled-in-Windows-Vista-and-Windows-7 |title=How to Search for Contents in Any File Type Without Indexing Service Enabled in Windows Vista and Windows 7 |publisher=Wikihow.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref> After right-clicking on a folder one can open a command-line prompt in that folder.\n\nWindows Explorer also contains modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer in Vista and Server 2008 is the details pane, which displays metadata and information relating to the currently selected file or folder. The details pane will also display a thumbnail of the file or an icon of the filetype if the file does not contain visual information. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file.\n[[Image:Details.PNG|thumb|The details pane in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] showing [[metadata]] of an image.|alt=]]\nThe details pane also allows for the change of some textual metadata such as author and title in files that support them within Windows Explorer. A new type of metadata called tags allows users to add descriptive terms to documents for easier categorization and retrieval. Some files support open metadata, allowing users to define new types of metadata for their files. Out-of-the-box, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 supports Microsoft Office documents and most audio and video files. Support for other file types can however be added by writing specialized software to retrieve the metadata at the shell's request. Metadata stored in a file's [[alternate data stream]] only on NTFS volumes cannot be viewed and edited through the summary tab of the file's properties anymore. Instead, all metadata is stored inside the file, so that it will always travel with the file and not be dependent on the file system.<ref name=\"AddTagsProperties\">{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/add-tags-or-other-properties-to-a-file |title=Add tags or other properties to a file |author=[[Microsoft]] |work=Windows How-to |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Layout and icons====\nWindows Explorer in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] also introduces a new layout. The task panes from Windows XP are replaced with a toolbar on top and a navigation pane on the left. The navigation pane contains commonly accessed folders and preconfigured search folders. Eight different views are available to view files and folders, including extra large, large, medium, small, list, details, tiles, and content. In addition, column headers now appear in all icon viewing modes,<ref name=\"StackingCNET\"/> unlike Windows XP where they only appear in the details icon viewing mode.<ref name=\"FilteringTechRepublic\"/> File and folder actions such as cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, delete, rename and properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change the layout of the Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display classic menus, a search pane, a preview pane, a reading pane, and the navigation pane. The preview pane enables users to preview files (e.g., documents or media files) without opening them. If an application, such as [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]], installs preview handlers for file types, then these files can also be edited within the preview pane itself.<ref name=\"10ThingsPreviewPane\">{{cite web |url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/07/13/10-things-windows-explorer-has-a-new-preview-pane.aspx |title=10 Things \u2013 Windows Explorer Has a New Preview Pane |last=White |first=Nick |date=July 13, 2007 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=Windows Vista Team Blog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715153823/http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/07/13/10-things-windows-explorer-has-a-new-preview-pane.aspx |archivedate=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=December 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWindows Vista saw the introduction of the [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumb]] bar for easier navigation. As opposed to the prior address bar which displayed the current folder in a simple editable combobox, this new style structures the path into clickable levels of folder hierarchy (though falls back to the classic edit mode when blank area is clicked), enabling the user to skip as many levels as desired in one click rather than repeatedly clicking \"Up\". It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow to the right of the last item. The menu bar is now hidden by default but reappears temporarily when the user presses Alt.\n\nCheck boxes in Windows Explorer allow the selection of multiple files.<ref name=\"PenandTouch\">{{cite web |url=https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms702418%28v=vs.85%29.aspx |title=Pen and Touch Input in Windows Vista |author=[[Microsoft]] |work=[[Microsoft Developer Network|MSDN]] |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}</ref> Free and used space on all drives is shown in horizontal indicator bars.

In Windows Vista and Server 2008 (and in Windows XP as well if IE7 or 8 is installed), Windows Explorer no longer displays web pages, and IE7 does not support use as a file manager, although one will separately launch the other as necessary.\n\nWhen moving or copying files from one folder to another, if two files have the same name, an option is now available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the user was prompted to choose either a replacement or cancel moving the file. Also, when renaming a file, Explorer only highlights the filename without selecting the extension. Renaming multiple files is quicker as pressing Tab automatically renames the existing file or folder and opens the file name text field for the next file for renaming. Shift+Tab allow renaming in the same manner upwards.\n\nSupport for burning data on DVDs (DVD\u00b1R, DVD\u00b1R DL, DVD\u00b1R RW) in addition to CDs and DVD-RAM using version 2.0 of the [[Image Mastering API]] was added.<ref name=\"WindowsVistaOpticalPlatform\">{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/sto068_wh06.ppt |title=Optical Platform: Windows Vista and Beyond |last2=Walp |first2=David |last1=Mangefeste |first1=Tony |date=2006 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |format=PPT |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604214913/http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/STO068_WH06.ppt |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn case a file is in use by another application, Windows Explorer informs users to close the application and retry the file operation. Also, a new interface IFileIsInUse is introduced into the API which developers can use to let other applications switch to the main window of the application that has the file open or simply close the file from the \"File in Use\" dialog. If the running application exposes these operations by means of the IFileInUse{{Contradict-inline|date=September 2018|reason=The previous sentence calls it IFileIsInUse.}} interface, Windows Explorer, upon encountering a locked file, allows the user to close the file or switch to the application from the dialog box itself.<ref name=\"IFileInUse\">{{cite web |url=http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/03/29/Your-File-Is-In-Use_2620_-Demystified.aspx |title=Your File Is In Use...

The Toolbar button in Explorer to go up one folder from the current folder has been removed (the function still exists however, one can move up a folder by pressing {{key|Alt}} + {{key|\u2191}}). Although still fully available from the menus and keyboard shortcuts, toolbar buttons for Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Delete, Properties and some others are no longer available. The Menu Bar is also hidden by default, but is still available by pressing the Alt key, or changing its visibility in the layout options. Several other features are removed such as showing the size on the status bar without selecting items, storing [[metadata]] in NTFS [[alternate data stream]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969361.aspx|title=Properties|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> the IColumnProvider interface which allowed addition of custom columns to Explorer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776147.aspx|title=IColumnProvider interface (Windows)|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> and folder background customization using desktop.ini.\n\nThe option \"Managing pairs of Web pages and folders\" is also removed, and the user has no way of telling Vista that a .html file and the folder with the same name that was created when saving a complete web page from IE should be treated separately, that is, they cannot delete the folder without deleting the html file as well.<ref>A solution to this is provided on http://windowsxp.mvps.org/webpairs.htm. After the webpairs.reg file has been merged into the registry, the \"Managing pairs of Web pages and folders\" option is available in the Folder Options View tab.</ref>\n\nThe ability to right-click a folder and hit \"Search\" was removed in Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users must open the folder they wish to search in and enter their keywords in the search field located on the top right corner of the window. Alternatively, users can specify other search parameters through the \"Advanced Search\" UI, which can be accessed by clicking on the Organize Bar, and selecting Search Pane under the Layout submenu. Pressing F3 also opens the \"Advanced Search\" interface.\n\n===Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2===\n[[File:Windows Explorer Windows 7.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in [[Windows 7]], showing Libraries.|alt=]]\n\n====Libraries====\nWindows Explorer in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 supports libraries, [[virtual folder]]s described in a <code>.library-ms</code> file that aggregates content from various locations \u2013 including shared folders on networked systems if the shared folder has been indexed by the host system \u2013 and present them in a unified view. Searching in a library automatically federates the query to the remote systems, in addition to searching on the local system, so that files on the remote systems are also searched. Unlike search folders, Libraries are backed by a physical location which allows files to be saved in the libraries. Such files are transparently saved in the backing physical folder. The default save location for a library may be configured by the user, as can the default view layout for each library. Libraries are generally stored in the libraries special folder, which allows them to be displayed on the navigation pane.\n\nBy default, a new user account in Windows 7 contains four libraries, for different file types: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. They are configured to include the user's profile folders for these respective file types, as well as the computer's corresponding Public folders.\n\nIn addition to aggregating multiple storage locations, Libraries enable Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions. Arrangement Views allow users to pivot their views of the library's contents based on metadata. For example, selecting the \"By Month\" view in the Pictures library will display photos in stacks, where each stack represents a month of photos based on the date they were taken. In the Music library, the \"By Artist\" view will display stacks of albums from the artists in their collections, and browsing into an artist stack will then display the relevant albums.\n\nSearch Filter Suggestions are a new feature of the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Explorer's search box. When the user clicks in the search box, a menu shows up below it showing recent searches as well as suggested [[Advanced Query Syntax]] filters that the user can type. When one is selected (or typed in manually), the menu will update to show the possible values to filter by for that property, and this list is based on the current location and other parts of the query already typed. For example, selecting the \"tags\" filter or typing \"tags:\" into the search box will display the list of possible tag values which will return search results.\n\nThe [[metadata]] written within the file, implemented in Vista, is also utilized in Windows 7. This can sometimes lead to long wait times displaying the contents of a folder. For example, if a folder contains many large video files totaling hundreds of gigabytes, and the Window Explorer pane is in Details view mode showing a property contained within the metadata (for example Date, Length, Frame Height), Windows Explorer might have to search the contents of the whole file for the meta data. Some damaged files can cause a prolonged delay as well. This is due to metadata information being able to be placed anywhere within the file, beginning, middle, or end, necessitating a search of the whole file. Lengthy delays also occur when displaying the contents of a folder with many different types of program icons. The icon is contained in the metadata. Some programs cause the activation of a virus scan when retrieving the icon information from the metadata, hence producing a lengthy delay.<ref name=\"AddTagsProperties\"/>\n\nArrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions are database-backed features which require that all locations in the Library be indexed by the Windows Search service. Local disk locations must be indexed by the local indexer, and Windows Explorer will automatically add locations to the indexing scope when they are included in a library. Remote locations can be indexed by the indexer on another Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, on a Windows machine running [[Windows Search 4]] (such as Windows Vista or Windows Home Server), or on another device that implements the MS-WSP remote query protocol.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc251767(PROT.10).aspx\n|title=MS-WSP: Windows Search Protocol\n|work=MSDN Library\n|publisher=Microsoft\n|date=2006-12-18\n|accessdate=2009-06-10\n}}</ref>\n\n====Federated search====\nWindows Explorer also supports federating search to external data sources, such as custom databases or web services, that are exposed over the web and described via an [[OpenSearch]] definition. The federated location description (called a Search Connector) is provided as a <code>.osdx</code> file. Once installed, the data source becomes queryable directly from Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer features, such as previews and thumbnails, work with the results of a federated search as well.\n\n====Other changes====\n* Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 supports showing icons in the context menu and creating cascaded context menus with static verbs in submenus using the [[Windows Registry|Registry]] instead of a [[#Extensibility|shell extension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144171(VS.85).aspx|title=Creating Shortcut Menu Handlers (Windows)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n* The search box in the Explorer window and the address bar can be resized.\n* Certain folders in the navigation pane can be hidden to reduce clutter.\n* Progress bars and overlay icons on an application's button on the taskbar.\n* Content view which shows thumbnails and metadata.\n* Buttons to toggle the preview pane and create a new folder.\n\n====Removed or changed features====\n{{See also|List of features removed in Windows 7#Windows Explorer}}\nIn Windows 7, several features have been removed from Windows Explorer, including the collapsible folder pane, overlay icon for shared items, remembering individual folder window sizes and positions, free disk space on the status bar, icons on the command bar, ability to disable Auto Arrange and Align to Grid, sortable column headings in other views except details view, ability to disable full row selection in details view, automatic horizontal scrolling and scrollbar in the navigation pane and maintaining selection when sorting from the Edit menu.\n\n===Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012===\n[[File:Windows Explorer Ribbon.png|thumb|The new File Explorer with ribbon in [[Windows 8]].|alt=]]\nThe file manager on [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] is renamed File Explorer and introduces new features such as a redesigned interface incorporating a [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon toolbar]], and a redesigned file operation dialog that displays more detailed progress and allows for file operations to be paused and resumed. The details pane from Windows Vista and 7 was removed and replaced with a narrower pane with no icons and fewer detail columns.

File Explorer also allows [[metadata]] for files to be added as [[NTFS]] [[alternate data stream]]s, separate from the data stream for the file.\n\nShell extension handlers are queried by the shell beforehand for modifying the action the shell takes. They can be associated on a per file type \u2013 where they will show up only when a particular action takes place on a particular file type \u2013 or on a global basis \u2013 which are always available.

This feature can be exploited by a relational file system like liquidFOLDERs or [[Tabbles]], clones of the ill-fated Microsoft [[WinFS]]. [[Special folders]], such as My Computer and Network Places in Windows Explorer are implemented this way, as are Explorer views that let items in a [[mobile phone]] or [[digital camera]] be explored. [[Revision control|Source-control systems]] that use Explorer to browse source repositories also use Namespace extensions to allow Explorer to browse the revisions. To implement a namespace extension, the <code>IPersistFolder</code>, <code>IShellView</code>, <code>IShellFolder</code>, <code>IShellBrowser</code> and <code>IOleWindow</code> [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] need to be implemented and registered. The implementation needs to provide the logic for navigating the data store as well as describing the presentation. Windows Explorer will instantiate the COM objects as required.<ref name=\"creatense\"/>\n\nWhile Windows Explorer natively exposes the extensibility points as [[Component Object Model|COM]] [[interface (computing)|interfaces]], [[.NET Framework]] can also be used to write extensions, using the [[COM Interop]] functionality of .NET Framework.<ref name=\"creatense\">{{Cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188741.aspx|title=Create Namespace Extensions for Windows Explorer with the .NET Framework|last=Rensin|first=Dave|date=January 2004|website=msdn.microsoft.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508015925/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188741.aspx|archive-date=May 8, 2008|accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> While Microsoft itself makes available extensions \u2013 such as the photo info tool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=B038D4B5-1D88-437C-9F54-1FB0D210B5EF&displaylang=en|title=Microsoft Download Center: Windows, Office, Xbox & More|website=www.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> \u2013 which are authored using [[.NET Framework]], they currently recommend against writing [[managed code|managed]] shell extensions, as only one instance of the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] (prior to version 4.0) can be loaded per-process.

It provides a [[graphical user interface]] for accessing the [[file system]]s. It is also the component of the operating system that presents many user interface items on the screen such as the [[taskbar]] and [[desktop environment|desktop]]. Controlling the computer is possible without Windows Explorer running (for example, the File | Run command in Task Manager on NT-derived versions of Windows will function without it, as will commands typed in a command prompt window).\n\n==Overview==\nWindows Explorer was first included with [[Windows 95]] as a replacement for [[File Manager (Windows)|File Manager]], which came with all versions of [[Windows 3.x]] operating systems. Explorer could be accessed by double-clicking the new My Computer desktop icon, or launched from the new [[Start Menu]] that replaced the earlier [[Program Manager]]. There is also a shortcut key combination: [[Windows key]] + E. Successive versions of Windows (and in some cases, [[Internet Explorer]]) introduced new features and capabilities, removed other features, and generally progressed from being a simple file system navigation tool into a task-based file management system.\n\nWhile \"Windows Explorer\" or \"File Explorer\" is a term most commonly used to describe the file management aspect of the operating system, the Explorer {{em|process}} also houses the operating system's search functionality and File Type associations (based on [[filename extension]]s), and is responsible for displaying the [[Desktop environment|desktop]] [[Icon (computing)|icons]], the [[Start Menu]], the [[Taskbar]], and the [[Control Panel (Windows)|Control Panel]]. Collectively, these features are known as the [[Windows shell]].\n\nAfter a user logs in, the explorer process is created by userinit process. Userinit performs some initialization of the user environment (such as running the login script and applying group policies) and then looks in the registry at the Shell value and creates a process to run the system-defined shell \u2013 by default, Explorer.exe. Then Userinit exits. This is why Explorer.exe is shown by various process explorers with no parent \u2013 its parent has exited.\n\n==History==\nIn 1995, [[Microsoft]] first released test versions of a shell refresh, named the Shell Technology Preview, and often referred to informally as \"NewShell\".<ref>{{cite web |author-first=Nathan |author-last=Lineback |url=http://toastytech.com/guis/misc4.html|title=Misc Windows|website=toastytech.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> The update was designed to replace the Windows 3.x Program Manager/File Manager based shell with Windows Explorer. The release provided capabilities quite similar to that of the Windows \"Chicago\" ([[Microsoft codenames|codename]] for Windows 95) shell during its late beta phases, however was intended to be nothing more than a test release.<ref>{{cite web |author=John D.

Both held Windows Explorer builds of 3.51.1053.1. The Shell Technology Preview program never saw a final release under NT 3.51. The entire program was moved across to the [[Cairo (operating system)|Cairo]] development group who finally integrated the new shell design into the NT code with the release of NT 4.0 in July 1996.\n\n===Windows 98 and Windows Desktop Update===\nWith the release of the [[Windows Desktop Update]] (packaged with [[Internet Explorer 4]] as an optional component, and included in [[Windows 98]]), Windows Explorer became \"integrated\" with Internet Explorer, most notably with the addition of navigation arrows (back and forward) for moving between recently visited directories, as well as Internet Explorer's Favorites menu.\n\nAn [[address bar]] was also added to Windows Explorer, which a user could type in directory paths directly, and be taken to that folder.\n\nAnother feature that was based on Internet Explorer technology was customized folders. Such folders contained a hidden web page that controlled the way the Windows Explorer displayed the contents of the folder.\n\n===Windows ME and Windows 2000===\n[[File:Windows 2000 Explorer.png|thumb|The integrated media player in Windows Explorer in [[Windows 2000]] playing a [[MIDI]] sequence on Media folder.|alt=]]\nThe \"Web-style\" folders view, with the left Explorer pane displaying details for the object currently selected, is turned on by default.

[[Shortcut (computing)|File shortcuts]] can also store comments which are displayed as a tooltip when the mouse hovers over the shortcut.\n\nThe right-hand pane, which usually just lists files and folders, can also be customized. For example, the contents of the system folders aren't displayed by default, instead showing in the right pane a warning to the user that modifying the contents of the system folders could harm their computer.

The [[Indexing Service]] has also been integrated into the operating system and the search pane built into Explorer allows searching files indexed by its database.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms689718.aspx|title=What is Indexing Service?|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> The ability to customize the standard buttons was also added.\n\n===Windows XP and Windows Server 2003===\n[[File:Windows Explorer XP.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in [[Windows XP]], showing All Users folder contents.|alt=]]\nThere were significant changes made to Windows Explorer in [[Windows XP]], both visually and functionally. Microsoft focused especially on making Explorer more discoverable and task-based, as well as adding a number of features to reflect the growing use of a computer as a [[Technological convergence|digital hub]].\n\nWindows Explorer in [[Windows Server 2003]] contains all the same features as Windows XP, but the task panes and search companion are disabled by default.\n\n====Task pane====\nThe task pane is displayed on the left-hand side of the window instead of the traditional folder tree view. It presents the user with a list of common actions and destinations that are relevant to the current directory or file(s) selected. For instance, when in a directory containing mostly pictures, a set of \"Picture tasks\" is shown, offering the options to display these pictures as a slide show, to print them out, or to go online to order prints. Conversely, a folder containing music files would offer options to play those files in a media player, or to go online to purchase music. Windows XP had a Media bar but it was removed with SP1. The Media Bar was only available with Windows XP RTM.\n\nEvery folder also has \"File and Folder Tasks\", offering options to create new folders, share a folder on the local network, publish files or folders to a web site, and other common tasks like copying, renaming, moving, and deleting files or folders. File types that have identified themselves as being printable also have an option listed to print the file.\n\nUnderneath \"File and Folder Tasks\" is \"Other Places\", with links to other common locations such as \"My Computer\", \"Control Panel\", and \"My Documents\". These also change depending on what folder the user was in, leading to some criticism of Microsoft for not being consistent in displaying navigation choices.\n\nUnderneath \"Other Places\" is a \"Details\" pane which gives additional information \u2013 typically file size and date, but depending on the file type, a thumbnail preview, author, image dimensions, or other details.\n\nThe \"Folders\" button on the Windows Explorer toolbar toggles between the traditional tree view of folders, and the task pane. Users can get rid of the task pane or restore it using the sequence: Tools \u2013 Folder Options \u2013 General \u2013 Show Common Tasks/Use Windows Classic Folders.\n\n====Search companion====\n[[File:Windows Explorer search puppy.png|thumb|Windows Explorer's default Search Companion, Rover in [[Windows XP]]|alt=]]\nMicrosoft introduced animated \"Search Companions\" in an attempt to make searching more engaging and friendly; the default character is a puppy named Rover (previously used in [[Microsoft Bob]]), with three other characters (Merlin the magician, Earl the surfer, and Courtney) also available. These search companions use the same technology as [[Microsoft Office]]'s [[Office Assistant]]s, even incorporating \"tricks\" and sound effects, and they can be used as Office Assistants if their files are copied into the C:\\Windows\\msagent\\chars folder.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/windows_10-update/is-microsoft-office-2003-still-decent-for-general/74b58c58-93e9-4865-b598-2ad22fe497e6?auth=1|title=Is Microsoft Office 2003 still decent for general use on Windows 7, 8.1 and 10|website=answers.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe search capability itself is fairly similar to Windows ME and Windows 2000, with one major addition: Search can also be instructed to search only files that are categorically \"Documents\" or \"Pictures, music and video\"; this feature is noteworthy largely because of how Windows determines what types of files can be classified under these categories. In order to maintain a relevant list of file types, Windows Explorer connects to Microsoft and downloads a set of XML files that define what these file types are. The Search Companion can be disabled in favor of the classic search pane used in Windows 2000 by using the [[Tweak UI]] applet from [[Microsoft PowerToys#PowerToys for Windows XP|Microsoft's PowerToys for Windows XP]], or by manually editing the registry.\n\n====Image handling====\n[[Image:Thumbnailviewxp.png|thumb|Folder thumbnail preview icon on [[Windows XP]]|alt=]]\nWindows XP improves image preview in Explorer by offering a Filmstrip view. \"Back\" and \"Previous\" buttons facilitate navigation through the pictures, and a pair of \"Rotate\" buttons offer 90-degree clockwise and counter-clockwise ([[Lossy data compression|lossy]]){{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} rotation of images. Aside from the Filmstrip view mode, there is a 'Thumbnails' mode, which displays [[thumbnail]]-sized images in the folder. A Folder containing images will also show thumbnails of four of the images from that folder overlaid on top of a large folder icon.\n\n====Web publishing====\nWeb sites that offer image hosting services can be plugged into Windows Explorer, which the user can use to select images on their computer, and have them uploaded correctly without dealing with comparatively complex solutions involving FTP or web interfaces.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}\n\n====Other changes====\n* Explorer gained the ability to understand the metadata of a number of types of files. For example, with images from a digital camera, the [[Exif]] information can be viewed, both in the Properties pages for the photo itself, as well as via optional additional Details View columns.\n* A Tile view mode was added, which displays the file's icon in a larger size (48 \u00d7 48), and places the file name, descriptive type, and additional information (typically the file size for data files, and the publisher name for applications) to the right.\n* The Details view also presented an additional option called \"Show in Groups\" which allows the Explorer to separate its contents by headings based on the field which is used to sort the items.\n* The taskbar can be locked to prevent it from accidentally being moved.\n* Windows Explorer also gained the ability to burn CDs and [[DVD-RAM]] discs in Windows XP.\n* Support for ZIP files called \"compressed folders\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/whatsnew_overview.mspx?mfr=true|title=Windows XP \u2013 What's new with files and folders|website=Windows|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523022826/http://www.microsoft.com/resources/documentation/windows/xp/all/proddocs/en-us/whatsnew_overview.mspx?mfr=true|archivedate=May 23, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Removed and changed features====\n{{expand section|date=December 2012}}\n{{See also|List of features removed in Windows XP#Windows Explorer}}\n* The sort order has changed compared to the one in Windows 2000.

Each property has a preferred sort direction. For example, sort by date defaults to descending order, as does size. But name and type default to ascending order.\n\nSearching for files containing a given text string became problematic with Vista unless the files have been indexed. An alternative is to use the findstr command-line function.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Search-for-Contents-in-Any-File-Type-Without-Indexing-Service-Enabled-in-Windows-Vista-and-Windows-7 |title=How to Search for Contents in Any File Type Without Indexing Service Enabled in Windows Vista and Windows 7 |publisher=Wikihow.com |date=2014-01-27 |accessdate=2014-01-31}}</ref> After right-clicking on a folder one can open a command-line prompt in that folder.\n\nWindows Explorer also contains modifications in the visualization of files on a computer. A new addition to Windows Explorer in Vista and Server 2008 is the details pane, which displays metadata and information relating to the currently selected file or folder. The details pane will also display a thumbnail of the file or an icon of the filetype if the file does not contain visual information. Furthermore, different imagery is overlaid on thumbnails to give more information about the file, such as a picture frame around the thumbnail of an image file, or a filmstrip on a video file.\n[[Image:Details.PNG|thumb|The details pane in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] showing [[metadata]] of an image.|alt=]]\nThe details pane also allows for the change of some textual metadata such as author and title in files that support them within Windows Explorer. A new type of metadata called tags allows users to add descriptive terms to documents for easier categorization and retrieval. Some files support open metadata, allowing users to define new types of metadata for their files. Out-of-the-box, Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008 supports Microsoft Office documents and most audio and video files. Support for other file types can however be added by writing specialized software to retrieve the metadata at the shell's request. Metadata stored in a file's [[alternate data stream]] only on NTFS volumes cannot be viewed and edited through the summary tab of the file's properties anymore. Instead, all metadata is stored inside the file, so that it will always travel with the file and not be dependent on the file system.<ref name=\"AddTagsProperties\">{{cite web |url=http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-vista/add-tags-or-other-properties-to-a-file |title=Add tags or other properties to a file |author=[[Microsoft]] |work=Windows How-to |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Layout and icons====\nWindows Explorer in [[Windows Vista]] and [[Windows Server 2008]] also introduces a new layout. The task panes from Windows XP are replaced with a toolbar on top and a navigation pane on the left. The navigation pane contains commonly accessed folders and preconfigured search folders. Eight different views are available to view files and folders, including extra large, large, medium, small, list, details, tiles, and content. In addition, column headers now appear in all icon viewing modes,<ref name=\"StackingCNET\"/> unlike Windows XP where they only appear in the details icon viewing mode.<ref name=\"FilteringTechRepublic\"/> File and folder actions such as cut, copy, paste, undo, redo, delete, rename and properties are built into a dropdown menu which appears when the Organize button is clicked. It is also possible to change the layout of the Explorer window by using the Organize button. Users can select whether to display classic menus, a search pane, a preview pane, a reading pane, and the navigation pane. The preview pane enables users to preview files (e.g., documents or media files) without opening them. If an application, such as [[Microsoft Office 2007|Office 2007]], installs preview handlers for file types, then these files can also be edited within the preview pane itself.<ref name=\"10ThingsPreviewPane\">{{cite web |url=http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/07/13/10-things-windows-explorer-has-a-new-preview-pane.aspx |title=10 Things \u2013 Windows Explorer Has a New Preview Pane |last=White |first=Nick |date=July 13, 2007 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |work=Windows Vista Team Blog |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715153823/http://windowsvistablog.com/blogs/windowsvista/archive/2007/07/13/10-things-windows-explorer-has-a-new-preview-pane.aspx |archivedate=July 15, 2007 |accessdate=December 14, 2015}}</ref>\n\nWindows Vista saw the introduction of the [[Breadcrumb (navigation)|breadcrumb]] bar for easier navigation. As opposed to the prior address bar which displayed the current folder in a simple editable combobox, this new style structures the path into clickable levels of folder hierarchy (though falls back to the classic edit mode when blank area is clicked), enabling the user to skip as many levels as desired in one click rather than repeatedly clicking \"Up\". It is also possible to navigate to any subfolder of the current folder using the arrow to the right of the last item.

In Windows Vista and Server 2008 (and in Windows XP as well if IE7 or 8 is installed), Windows Explorer no longer displays web pages, and IE7 does not support use as a file manager, although one will separately launch the other as necessary.\n\nWhen moving or copying files from one folder to another, if two files have the same name, an option is now available to rename the file; in previous versions of Windows, the user was prompted to choose either a replacement or cancel moving the file. Also, when renaming a file, Explorer only highlights the filename without selecting the extension. Renaming multiple files is quicker as pressing Tab automatically renames the existing file or folder and opens the file name text field for the next file for renaming. Shift+Tab allow renaming in the same manner upwards.\n\nSupport for burning data on DVDs (DVD\u00b1R, DVD\u00b1R DL, DVD\u00b1R RW) in addition to CDs and DVD-RAM using version 2.0 of the [[Image Mastering API]] was added.<ref name=\"WindowsVistaOpticalPlatform\">{{cite web |url=http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/sto068_wh06.ppt |title=Optical Platform: Windows Vista and Beyond |last2=Walp |first2=David |last1=Mangefeste |first1=Tony |date=2006 |publisher=[[Microsoft]] |format=PPT |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604214913/http://download.microsoft.com/download/5/b/9/5b97017b-e28a-4bae-ba48-174cf47d23cd/STO068_WH06.ppt |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |accessdate=December 21, 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn case a file is in use by another application, Windows Explorer informs users to close the application and retry the file operation. Also, a new interface IFileIsInUse is introduced into the API which developers can use to let other applications switch to the main window of the application that has the file open or simply close the file from the \"File in Use\" dialog. If the running application exposes these operations by means of the IFileInUse{{Contradict-inline|date=September 2018|reason=The previous sentence calls it IFileIsInUse.}} interface, Windows Explorer, upon encountering a locked file, allows the user to close the file or switch to the application from the dialog box itself.<ref name=\"IFileInUse\">{{cite web |url=http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/03/29/Your-File-Is-In-Use_2620_-Demystified.aspx |title=Your File Is In Use...

The Toolbar button in Explorer to go up one folder from the current folder has been removed (the function still exists however, one can move up a folder by pressing {{key|Alt}} + {{key|\u2191}}). Although still fully available from the menus and keyboard shortcuts, toolbar buttons for Cut, Copy, Paste, Undo, Delete, Properties and some others are no longer available. The Menu Bar is also hidden by default, but is still available by pressing the Alt key, or changing its visibility in the layout options. Several other features are removed such as showing the size on the status bar without selecting items, storing [[metadata]] in NTFS [[alternate data stream]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969361.aspx|title=Properties|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> the IColumnProvider interface which allowed addition of custom columns to Explorer<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776147.aspx|title=IColumnProvider interface (Windows)|website=msdn2.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> and folder background customization using desktop.ini.\n\nThe option \"Managing pairs of Web pages and folders\" is also removed, and the user has no way of telling Vista that a .html file and the folder with the same name that was created when saving a complete web page from IE should be treated separately, that is, they cannot delete the folder without deleting the html file as well.<ref>A solution to this is provided on http://windowsxp.mvps.org/webpairs.htm. After the webpairs.reg file has been merged into the registry, the \"Managing pairs of Web pages and folders\" option is available in the Folder Options View tab.</ref>\n\nThe ability to right-click a folder and hit \"Search\" was removed in Windows Vista Service Pack 1. Users must open the folder they wish to search in and enter their keywords in the search field located on the top right corner of the window. Alternatively, users can specify other search parameters through the \"Advanced Search\" UI, which can be accessed by clicking on the Organize Bar, and selecting Search Pane under the Layout submenu. Pressing F3 also opens the \"Advanced Search\" interface.\n\n===Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2===\n[[File:Windows Explorer Windows 7.png|thumb|Windows Explorer in [[Windows 7]], showing Libraries.|alt=]]\n\n====Libraries====\nWindows Explorer in Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 supports libraries, [[virtual folder]]s described in a <code>.library-ms</code> file that aggregates content from various locations \u2013 including shared folders on networked systems if the shared folder has been indexed by the host system \u2013 and present them in a unified view. Searching in a library automatically federates the query to the remote systems, in addition to searching on the local system, so that files on the remote systems are also searched. Unlike search folders, Libraries are backed by a physical location which allows files to be saved in the libraries. Such files are transparently saved in the backing physical folder. The default save location for a library may be configured by the user, as can the default view layout for each library. Libraries are generally stored in the libraries special folder, which allows them to be displayed on the navigation pane.\n\nBy default, a new user account in Windows 7 contains four libraries, for different file types: Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos. They are configured to include the user's profile folders for these respective file types, as well as the computer's corresponding Public folders.\n\nIn addition to aggregating multiple storage locations, Libraries enable Arrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions. Arrangement Views allow users to pivot their views of the library's contents based on metadata. For example, selecting the \"By Month\" view in the Pictures library will display photos in stacks, where each stack represents a month of photos based on the date they were taken. In the Music library, the \"By Artist\" view will display stacks of albums from the artists in their collections, and browsing into an artist stack will then display the relevant albums.\n\nSearch Filter Suggestions are a new feature of the Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 Explorer's search box. When the user clicks in the search box, a menu shows up below it showing recent searches as well as suggested [[Advanced Query Syntax]] filters that the user can type. When one is selected (or typed in manually), the menu will update to show the possible values to filter by for that property, and this list is based on the current location and other parts of the query already typed. For example, selecting the \"tags\" filter or typing \"tags:\" into the search box will display the list of possible tag values which will return search results.\n\nThe [[metadata]] written within the file, implemented in Vista, is also utilized in Windows 7. This can sometimes lead to long wait times displaying the contents of a folder. For example, if a folder contains many large video files totaling hundreds of gigabytes, and the Window Explorer pane is in Details view mode showing a property contained within the metadata (for example Date, Length, Frame Height), Windows Explorer might have to search the contents of the whole file for the meta data. Some damaged files can cause a prolonged delay as well. This is due to metadata information being able to be placed anywhere within the file, beginning, middle, or end, necessitating a search of the whole file. Lengthy delays also occur when displaying the contents of a folder with many different types of program icons. The icon is contained in the metadata. Some programs cause the activation of a virus scan when retrieving the icon information from the metadata, hence producing a lengthy delay.<ref name=\"AddTagsProperties\"/>\n\nArrangement Views and Search Filter Suggestions are database-backed features which require that all locations in the Library be indexed by the Windows Search service. Local disk locations must be indexed by the local indexer, and Windows Explorer will automatically add locations to the indexing scope when they are included in a library. Remote locations can be indexed by the indexer on another Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 machine, on a Windows machine running [[Windows Search 4]] (such as Windows Vista or Windows Home Server), or on another device that implements the MS-WSP remote query protocol.<ref>{{Citation\n|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc251767(PROT.10).aspx\n|title=MS-WSP: Windows Search Protocol\n|work=MSDN Library\n|publisher=Microsoft\n|date=2006-12-18\n|accessdate=2009-06-10\n}}</ref>\n\n====Federated search====\nWindows Explorer also supports federating search to external data sources, such as custom databases or web services, that are exposed over the web and described via an [[OpenSearch]] definition. The federated location description (called a Search Connector) is provided as a <code>.osdx</code> file. Once installed, the data source becomes queryable directly from Windows Explorer. Windows Explorer features, such as previews and thumbnails, work with the results of a federated search as well.\n\n====Other changes====\n* Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 supports showing icons in the context menu and creating cascaded context menus with static verbs in submenus using the [[Windows Registry|Registry]] instead of a [[#Extensibility|shell extension]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144171(VS.85).aspx|title=Creating Shortcut Menu Handlers (Windows)|website=msdn.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref>\n* The search box in the Explorer window and the address bar can be resized.\n* Certain folders in the navigation pane can be hidden to reduce clutter.\n* Progress bars and overlay icons on an application's button on the taskbar.\n* Content view which shows thumbnails and metadata.\n* Buttons to toggle the preview pane and create a new folder.\n\n====Removed or changed features====\n{{See also|List of features removed in Windows 7#Windows Explorer}}\nIn Windows 7, several features have been removed from Windows Explorer, including the collapsible folder pane, overlay icon for shared items, remembering individual folder window sizes and positions, free disk space on the status bar, icons on the command bar, ability to disable Auto Arrange and Align to Grid, sortable column headings in other views except details view, ability to disable full row selection in details view, automatic horizontal scrolling and scrollbar in the navigation pane and maintaining selection when sorting from the Edit menu.\n\n===Windows 8 and Windows Server 2012===\n[[File:Windows Explorer Ribbon.png|thumb|The new File Explorer with ribbon in [[Windows 8]].|alt=]]\nThe file manager on [[Windows 8]] and [[Windows Server 2012]] is renamed File Explorer and introduces new features such as a redesigned interface incorporating a [[Ribbon (computing)|ribbon toolbar]], and a redesigned file operation dialog that displays more detailed progress and allows for file operations to be paused and resumed.

File Explorer also allows [[metadata]] for files to be added as [[NTFS]] [[alternate data stream]]s, separate from the data stream for the file.\n\nShell extension handlers are queried by the shell beforehand for modifying the action the shell takes. They can be associated on a per file type \u2013 where they will show up only when a particular action takes place on a particular file type \u2013 or on a global basis \u2013 which are always available.

This feature can be exploited by a relational file system like liquidFOLDERs or [[Tabbles]], clones of the ill-fated Microsoft [[WinFS]]. [[Special folders]], such as My Computer and Network Places in Windows Explorer are implemented this way, as are Explorer views that let items in a [[mobile phone]] or [[digital camera]] be explored. [[Revision control|Source-control systems]] that use Explorer to browse source repositories also use Namespace extensions to allow Explorer to browse the revisions. To implement a namespace extension, the <code>IPersistFolder</code>, <code>IShellView</code>, <code>IShellFolder</code>, <code>IShellBrowser</code> and <code>IOleWindow</code> [[interface (computing)|interfaces]] need to be implemented and registered. The implementation needs to provide the logic for navigating the data store as well as describing the presentation. Windows Explorer will instantiate the COM objects as required.<ref name=\"creatense\"/>\n\nWhile Windows Explorer natively exposes the extensibility points as [[Component Object Model|COM]] [[interface (computing)|interfaces]], [[.NET Framework]] can also be used to write extensions, using the [[COM Interop]] functionality of .NET Framework.<ref name=\"creatense\">{{Cite web|url=http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188741.aspx|title=Create Namespace Extensions for Windows Explorer with the .NET Framework|last=Rensin|first=Dave|date=January 2004|website=msdn.microsoft.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508015925/https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc188741.aspx|archive-date=May 8, 2008|accessdate=2008-03-31}}</ref> While Microsoft itself makes available extensions \u2013 such as the photo info tool<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?familyid=B038D4B5-1D88-437C-9F54-1FB0D210B5EF&displaylang=en|title=Microsoft Download Center: Windows, Office, Xbox & More|website=www.microsoft.com|accessdate=19 June 2018}}</ref> \u2013 which are authored using [[.NET Framework]], they currently recommend against writing [[managed code|managed]] shell extensions, as only one instance of the [[Common Language Runtime|CLR]] (prior to version 4.0) can be loaded per-process.

This draft also gave the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] the second overall pick after jumping over the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and the [[New York Knicks]] within the draft lottery.\n\nHighlights from the draft include the first Dominican to be the first overall pick ([[Karl-Anthony Towns]]), the highest number of Kentucky Wildcats selected in the draft lottery (four with Karl-Anthony Towns, [[Willie Cauley-Stein]], [[Trey Lyles]], and [[Devin Booker]]), which tied the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] in 2005 for most players selected in the lottery by one school; the tied record for most Kentucky players selected in the draft (six with Towns, Cauley-Stein, Lyles, Booker, [[Andrew Harrison (basketball)|Andrew Harrison]], and [[Dakari Johnson]]), the second Latvian to have been drafted in the first round ([[Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is]]), the first former high school player to have skipped college to play in China that was selected in the draft ([[Emmanuel Mudiay]]), and the first Indian to have been selected in the NBA ([[Satnam Singh Bhamara]]), who was also the first player since 2005 to have been drafted directly from high school (albeit as a postgraduate).\n\nOther noteworthy announcements that came out of the draft included the official announcement of the passing of the last pioneer of the original NBA, [[Harvey Pollack]], around the third pick and the resignation of the league's president of basketball operations [[Rod Thorn]] that became official in August after the end of the first round.\n\n==Draft selections==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| PG || [[Point guard]]\n| SG || [[Shooting guard]]\n| SF || [[Small forward]]\n| PF || [[Power forward (basketball)|Power forward]]\n| C || [[Center (basketball)|Center]]\n|}\n{{NBA Draft legend|2=y|3=y|5=y|6=y}}\n{{stack| \n[[File:Towns9-20190120.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl-Anthony Towns]] was selected first overall by the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]].]]\n[[File:D'Angelo Russell rookie.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[D'Angelo Russell]] was selected second by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].]]\n[[File:Kristaps Porzingis.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is]] was selected fourth by the [[NewOrelans cougar]]\n[[File:Myles Turner (39916223764) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Myles Turner (basketball)|Myles Turner]] was selected eleventh by the [[Indiana Pacers]].]]\n[[File:Devin Booker (30362063153).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Devin Booker]] was selected thirteenth by the [[Phoenix Suns]].]]\n[[File:Rondae Hollis-Jefferson 2018.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Rondae Hollis-Jefferson]] was selected twenty-third by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and traded to the [[Brooklyn Nets]].]] \n[[File:Satnam Singh Bhamara.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Satnam Singh Bhamara|Satnam Singh]] was selected 52nd by the [[Dallas Mavericks]].

The [[NBA draft lottery|draft lottery]] took place on May 19, 2015.\n\nThe [[Minnesota Timberwolves]] won the [[NBA draft lottery|draft lottery]] to earn the [[List of first overall NBA draft picks|first overall pick]] in the draft.

The player selected would also be the third consecutive number one pick on the Timberwolves roster, joining [[Andrew Wiggins]] (2014) and [[Anthony Bennett (basketball)|Anthony Bennett]] (2013) - who were traded to Minnesota for forward [[Kevin Love]]. This draft also gave the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] the second overall pick after jumping over the [[Philadelphia 76ers]] and the [[New York Knicks]] within the draft lottery.\n\nHighlights from the draft include the first Dominican to be the first overall pick ([[Karl-Anthony Towns]]), the highest number of Kentucky Wildcats selected in the draft lottery (four with Karl-Anthony Towns, [[Willie Cauley-Stein]], [[Trey Lyles]], and [[Devin Booker]]), which tied the [[North Carolina Tar Heels men's basketball|North Carolina Tar Heels]] in 2005 for most players selected in the lottery by one school; the tied record for most Kentucky players selected in the draft (six with Towns, Cauley-Stein, Lyles, Booker, [[Andrew Harrison (basketball)|Andrew Harrison]], and [[Dakari Johnson]]), the second Latvian to have been drafted in the first round ([[Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is]]), the first former high school player to have skipped college to play in China that was selected in the draft ([[Emmanuel Mudiay]]), and the first Indian to have been selected in the NBA ([[Satnam Singh Bhamara]]), who was also the first player since 2005 to have been drafted directly from high school (albeit as a postgraduate).\n\nOther noteworthy announcements that came out of the draft included the official announcement of the passing of the last pioneer of the original NBA, [[Harvey Pollack]], around the third pick and the resignation of the league's president of basketball operations [[Rod Thorn]] that became official in August after the end of the first round.\n\n==Draft selections==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| PG || [[Point guard]]\n| SG || [[Shooting guard]]\n| SF || [[Small forward]]\n| PF || [[Power forward (basketball)|Power forward]]\n| C || [[Center (basketball)|Center]]\n|}\n{{NBA Draft legend|2=y|3=y|5=y|6=y}}\n{{stack| \n[[File:Towns9-20190120.jpg|thumb|150px|right|[[Karl-Anthony Towns]] was selected first overall by the [[Minnesota Timberwolves]].]]\n[[File:D'Angelo Russell rookie.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[D'Angelo Russell]] was selected second by the [[Los Angeles Lakers]].]]\n[[File:Kristaps Porzingis.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Kristaps Porzi\u0146\u0123is]] was selected fourth by the [[New York Knicks]].]]\n[[File:Myles Turner (39916223764) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Myles Turner (basketball)|Myles Turner]] was selected eleventh by the [[Indiana Pacers]].]]\n[[File:Devin Booker (30362063153).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Devin Booker]] was selected thirteenth by the [[Phoenix Suns]].]]\n[[File:Rondae Hollis-Jefferson 2018.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Rondae Hollis-Jefferson]] was selected twenty-third by the [[Portland Trail Blazers]] and traded to the [[Brooklyn Nets]].]] \n[[File:Satnam Singh Bhamara.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Satnam Singh Bhamara|Satnam Singh]] was selected 52nd by the [[Dallas Mavericks]].
