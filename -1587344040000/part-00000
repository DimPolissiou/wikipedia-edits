The [[type species]] is ''Nasutoceratops titusi''. The [[Name of a biological genus#Generic name|generic name]] comes from ''nasutus'' in [[Latin]] meaning \"large-nosed\", and ''ceratops'', \"horned-face\" in [[Greek language|Greek]].

The part of the snout around the nostril is strongly developed, representing about three quarters of the skull length in front of the eye sockets. The rear of each nasal bone is hollowed out by a large internal cavity. The contact surface between the [[maxilla]] and the [[praemaxilla]] is exceptionally large. The maxilla also has a large internal flange contacting the praemaxilla via two horizontal facets. The brow horns at their bases are pointed forwards and outwards, then curve inwards, and ultimately twist their points upwards.<ref name=Nasutoceratops>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sampson | first1 = S.

The horn on the nose is low and narrow, with an elongated base. The [[squamosal]] has a high ridge on its upper surface, running from the direction of the eye socket towards the squamosal rim. The skull frill is more or less circular with its widest point at the middle edge. The [[osteoderms]] on the frill edge, the epiparietals and episquamosals, do not have the form of spikes but are shaped like simple low crescents. The rear frill edge is not notched but instead has an epiparietal on the midline.<ref name=Nasutoceratops/>\n[[File:Nasutoceratops skull.jpg|thumb|Skull diagram]]\nThe snout of ''Nasutoceratops'' was short and high; its nasal bones exhibit internal cavities that the authors consider to represent pneumatic excavations, invading the bone from the [[nasal cavity]].  This is noteworthy because pneumatic nasals are unknown in any other ceratopsid, which supports that this feature represents a unique derived trait of this genus. ''Nasutoceratops'' had as many as 29 tooth positions in the maxilla, each occupied by several stacked teeth. The skull roof between the eye sockets is vaulted and is markedly higher than the snout region.

The part of the snout around the nostril is strongly developed, representing about three quarters of the skull length in front of the eye sockets. The rear of each nasal bone is hollowed out by a large internal cavity. The contact surface between the [[maxilla]] and the [[praemaxilla]] is exceptionally large. The maxilla also has a large internal flange contacting the praemaxilla via two horizontal facets. The brow horns at their bases are pointed forwards and outwards, then curve inwards, and ultimately twist their points upwards.<ref name=Nasutoceratops>{{Cite journal | last1 = Sampson | first1 = S.

The horn on the nose is low and narrow, with an elongated base. The [[squamosal]] has a high ridge on its upper surface, running from the direction of the eye socket towards the squamosal rim. The skull frill is more or less circular with its widest point at the middle edge. The [[osteoderms]] on the frill edge, the epiparietals and episquamosals, do not have the form of spikes but are shaped like simple low crescents. The rear frill edge is not notched but instead has an epiparietal on the midline.<ref name=Nasutoceratops/>\n[[File:Nasutoceratops skull.jpg|thumb|Skull diagram]]\nThe snout of ''Nasutoceratops'' was short and high; its nasal bones exhibit internal cavities that the authors consider to represent pneumatic excavations, invading the bone from the [[nasal cavity]].  This is noteworthy because pneumatic nasals are unknown in any other ceratopsid, which supports that this feature represents a unique derived trait of this genus. ''Nasutoceratops'' had as many as 29 tooth positions in the maxilla, each occupied by several stacked teeth.

To a remarkable extent, the area had continued to be so used until the last decade. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the borough was part of [[Aston Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Aston Township]], though this northernmost section of Aston did not have a village aspect as such. With the advent of a railroad, which made its first run-through on Christmas Day 1833, a concentration of houses developed. With the reach of the automobile, a settlement of homes sprang up along the oldest road in the borough. That route, now Valleybrook Road, was once known as the \"Logtown Road\" and was one of the earliest routes from [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester settlement]] to the interior. It wanders over and along the West Branch of [[Chester Creek]] and is noted for its abrupt curves at the borough's southern end.\n\nAn 1836 school building on Valleybrook Road and Llewellyn Road was, in its day, rented by its owners to Aston for $2 a month for use as the school for this area. It was subsequently known as the Logtown School and changed to the Chester Heights School in 1880. A second, much later stone school building stands in its place today. The borough was the Fourth Ward of Aston and had been referred to for some time as Chester Heights and Wawa. It was in the northern or \"Wawa\" area that, over the past one hundred years or more, several large land parcels were acquired for summer residences. To date, most of these tracts have remained relatively unchanged, though they are now used as year-round private residences. (\"Wawa\" was the Indian name for wild goose.)\n\nIn 1852 the cornerstone of [[St. Thomas the Apostle Church (Glen Mills)|St. Thomas the Apostle Church]] was laid, to house a Roman Catholic congregation that had been meeting on the property of the Willcox family since 1728.  It stands today with the addition of a modern church, parochial school and residences. In 1872 an association of [[Methodists]] purchased a farm in Aston, incorporating as the Chester Heights Camp-Meeting Associations, and it still convenes each July for religious retreats. The borough of Chester Heights was officially incorporated in 1945.\n\nToday, approximately one dozen early [[fieldstone]] or brick dwellings remain intact, though not necessarily restored. The oldest homes date to 1720 or earlier; many of them were established by 1777 when \"a number of the stragglers from the defeated American Army, hungry, demoralized and exhausted in their flight from the field at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], collected in the neighborhood of Logtown, where they passed the night, sleeping in the outbuildings and open fields.\" Altogether, the houses represent an historically valuable span of 18th century to Victorian architecture in the borough.<ref>Henry Graham Ashmead, ''History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania'' (1884), p. 293</ref>\n\nThe [[Chester Heights Camp Meeting Historic District]], [[Chamberlain-Pennell House]], and [[Stonehaven (Media, Pennsylvania)|Stonehaven]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nChester Heights was also the home of the fictional Grogan family from the 2008 movie \"Marley and Me\".\n\n==Geography==\nChester Heights is located in western Delaware County at {{Coord|39|53|22|N|75|28|15|W|type:city}} (39.889539, -75.470931).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the southeast by [[Aston Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Aston Township]], to the west by [[Concord Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Concord Township]], to the north by [[Thornbury Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Thornbury Township]], and to the northeast, across [[Chester Creek]], by [[Middletown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Middletown Township]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 1]] (Baltimore Pike) runs through the northern part of the borough, leading northeast {{convert|20|mi}} to [[Philadelphia]] and southwest {{convert|13|mi}} to [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]].

To a remarkable extent, the area had continued to be so used until the last decade. In the 18th and 19th centuries, the borough was part of [[Aston Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Aston Township]], though this northernmost section of Aston did not have a village aspect as such. With the advent of a railroad, which made its first run-through on Christmas Day 1833, a concentration of houses developed. With the reach of the automobile, a settlement of homes sprang up along the oldest road in the borough. That route, now Valleybrook Road, was once known as the \"Logtown Road\" and was one of the earliest routes from [[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester settlement]] to the interior. It wanders over and along the West Branch of [[Chester Creek]] and is noted for its abrupt curves at the borough's southern end.\n\nAn 1836 school building on Valleybrook Road and Llewellyn Road was, in its day, rented by its owners to Aston for $2 a month for use as the school for this area. It was subsequently known as the Logtown School and changed to the Chester Heights School in 1880. A second, much later stone school building stands in its place today. The borough was the Fourth Ward of Aston and had been referred to for some time as Chester Heights and Wawa. It was in the northern or \"Wawa\" area that, over the past one hundred years or more, several large land parcels were acquired for summer residences. To date, most of these tracts have remained relatively unchanged, though they are now used as year-round private residences. (\"Wawa\" was the Indian name for wild goose.)\n\nIn 1852 the cornerstone of [[St. Thomas the Apostle Church (Glen Mills)|St. Thomas the Apostle Church]] was laid, to house a Roman Catholic congregation that had been meeting on the property of the Willcox family since 1728.  It stands today with the addition of a modern church, parochial school and residences. In 1872 an association of [[Methodists]] purchased a farm in Aston, incorporating as the Chester Heights Camp-Meeting Associations, and it still convenes each July for religious retreats. The borough of Chester Heights was officially incorporated in 1945.\n\nToday, approximately one dozen early [[fieldstone]] or brick dwellings remain intact, though not necessarily restored. The oldest homes date to 1720 or earlier; many of them were established by 1777 when \"a number of the stragglers from the defeated American Army, hungry, demoralized and exhausted in their flight from the field at [[Battle of Brandywine|Brandywine]], collected in the neighborhood of Logtown, where they passed the night, sleeping in the outbuildings and open fields.\" Altogether, the houses represent an historically valuable span of 18th century to Victorian architecture in the borough.<ref>Henry Graham Ashmead, ''History of Delaware County, Pennsylvania'' (1884), p. 293</ref>\n\nThe [[Chester Heights Camp Meeting Historic District]], [[Chamberlain-Pennell House]], and [[Stonehaven (Media, Pennsylvania)|Stonehaven]] are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].<ref name=\"nris\">{{NRISref|version=2010a}}</ref>\n\nChester Heights was also the home of the fictional Grogan family from the 2008 movie \"Marley and Me\".\n\n==Geography==\nChester Heights is located in western Delaware County at {{Coord|39|53|22|N|75|28|15|W|type:city}} (39.889539, -75.470931).<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/geographies/reference-files/time-series/geo/gazetteer-files.html|publisher=[[United States Census Bureau]]|accessdate=2011-04-23|date=2011-02-12|title=US Gazetteer files: 2010, 2000, and 1990}}</ref> It is bordered to the southeast by [[Aston Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Aston Township]], to the west by [[Concord Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Concord Township]], to the north by [[Thornbury Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Thornbury Township]], and to the northeast, across [[Chester Creek]], by [[Middletown Township, Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Middletown Township]].\n\n[[U.S. Route 1]] (Baltimore Pike) runs through the northern part of the borough, leading northeast {{convert|20|mi}} to [[Philadelphia]] and southwest {{convert|13|mi}} to [[Kennett Square, Pennsylvania|Kennett Square]].

The residents of the rural portions of the Township did not wish to financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the New Jersey state plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the {{convert|29|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential overdevelopment. The two municipalities currently share a common K-8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services.  Residents are concerned about the unknown costs of a merger and a disproportionate allocation of those costs.<ref name=\"VanDyke\"/>\n\nThe two mayors had publicly endorsed a [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] of a merger.

The residents of the rural portions of the Township did not wish to financially support the construction and maintenance of a public sewer or water utility. Since that time rural Chester Township has relied upon individual private wells for water and septic systems for wastewater treatment while the Borough is primarily, although not entirely, served by public sewer and water. Concerns over the extension of utilities into the rural Township with the resultant potential for large scale growth served as an impediment to consolidation. The prohibition of utility extensions supported by the New Jersey state plan and codified in the Highlands Water Protection Act, along with the development restrictions contained in the Highlands Act have lessened those concerns. Additionally, an aggressive land conservation program in the Township has resulted in over 40% of the {{convert|29|sqmi|km2|adj=on}} Township being placed into permanent preservation, further lessening worries about potential overdevelopment. The two municipalities currently share a common K-8 school district, volunteer fire department, library, first aid squad and other municipal services.  Residents are concerned about the unknown costs of a merger and a disproportionate allocation of those costs.<ref name=\"VanDyke\"/>\n\nThe two mayors had publicly endorsed a [[cost\u2013benefit analysis]] of a merger.

In 1612, the Poles were forced to retreat by the Russian volunteer corps, led by two national heroes, merchant [[Kuzma Minin]] and Prince [[Dmitry Pozharsky]]. The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.\n\nRussia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organised into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670\u201371, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.\n\nIn the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast.

These ''Great Reforms'' spurred industrialization and modernised the Russian army, which had successfully liberated Bulgaria from Ottoman rule in the [[1877\u201378 Russo-Turkish War]].\n\nThe late 19th century saw the rise of various socialist movements in Russia. Alexander&nbsp;II was killed in 1881 by revolutionary terrorists, and the reign of his son\n[[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;III]] (1881\u201394) was less liberal but more peaceful. The last Russian Emperor, [[Nicholas&nbsp;II]] (1894\u20131917), was unable to prevent the events of the Russian [[Revolution of 1905]], triggered by the unsuccessful [[Russo-Japanese War]] and the demonstration incident known as [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]]. The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]].

The bombing of the [[Volga Military District|Volga]] capital destroyed the largest automobile plant [[GAZ]]. This plant supplied tanks for the front.

Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''.

The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]] but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.\n\nIn 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\n\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in one-to-one discussions with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]]. This, however, led to the rise of strong nationalist and separatist movements.

On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].\n\n[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|The neoclassical [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]\n\n[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917\u20131941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken.

Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nSoviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country.

The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas.

In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]].

Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on 7 January, because the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]], and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] (9 May); [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.\n\n[[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nPopular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (the New Year according to the Julian Calendar on 14 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on 7 July) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (which takes place on 8 July and is the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, focusing, however, on family love and fidelity).\n\n[[File:Russian Dolls (4891096981).jpg|thumb|A [[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russia's main architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and [[Mother Russia]] a [[national personification]] of Russia, though the bear image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\n[[File:Peterhof Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russia (44408938295).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peterhof Palace#The Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain|Grand Cascade]] in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], a popular tourist destination in Saint Petersburg]]\n\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet period, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country.

Recognised as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renowned museums as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]], [[Nevsky Prospect]], and [[Arbat Street]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of [[Moscow]] ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, canals and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].\n\nThe warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts such as [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, the oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clear waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tuva]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Russia|Europe}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Russia}}\n* [[Outline of Russia]]\n* [[Index of Soviet Union-related articles]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Russia}}\n{{Wiktionary|Russia|\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n;Government\n* [http://www.gov.ru/index_en.html Official Russian governmental portal]\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/RS.html Chief of State and Cabinet Members]\n* [http://en.rian.ru/ Russian News Agency \"Ria Novosti\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110513104203/http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/09/24/22168374.html Russian radio \"Voice of Russia\"]\n\n;

The [[Romanov Dynasty]] acceded to the throne in 1613 by the decision of Zemsky Sobor, and the country started its gradual recovery from the crisis.\n\nRussia continued its territorial growth through the 17th century, which was the age of [[Cossacks]]. Cossacks were warriors organised into military communities, resembling [[pirates]] and [[pioneers of the New World]]. In 1648, the peasants of Ukraine joined the [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] in rebellion against Poland-Lithuania during the [[Khmelnytsky Uprising]] in reaction to the social and religious oppression they had been suffering under Polish rule. In 1654, the Ukrainian leader, [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]], offered to place Ukraine under the protection of the Russian Tsar, [[Aleksey&nbsp;I]]. Aleksey's acceptance of this offer led to another [[Russo-Polish War (1654\u20131667)|Russo-Polish War]]. Finally, Ukraine was split along the [[Dnieper River]], leaving the western part, [[right-bank Ukraine]], under Polish rule and the eastern part ([[Left-bank Ukraine]] and [[Kiev]]) under Russian rule. Later, in 1670\u201371, the [[Don Cossacks]] led by [[Stenka Razin]] initiated a major uprising in the [[Volga Region]], but the Tsar's troops were successful in defeating the rebels.\n\nIn the east, the rapid Russian exploration and colonisation of the huge territories of Siberia was led mostly by Cossacks hunting for valuable furs and ivory. [[Russian explorers]] pushed eastward primarily along the [[Siberian River Routes]], and by the mid-17th century there were Russian settlements in Eastern Siberia, on the [[Chukchi Peninsula]], along the [[Amur River]], and on the Pacific coast.

The uprising was put down, but the government was forced to concede major reforms ([[Russian Constitution of 1906]]), including granting the [[freedom of speech|freedoms of speech]] and [[freedom of assembly|assembly]], the legalization of political parties, and the creation of an elected legislative body, the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire]].

When Germany launched the [[Invasion of Poland]], the Soviets followed weeks later with [[Soviet Invasion of Poland|their own invasion]] of the country, claiming the eastern half of Poland while avoiding war with the [[Allies of World War II|Allied Powers]].

This city was the main industrial center of the USSR and was located near the [[Moscow Defence Zone]]. The bombing of the [[Volga Military District|Volga]] capital destroyed the largest automobile plant [[GAZ]]. This plant supplied tanks for the front. Whole residential areas and other large factories of the city were destroyed. From 1941 to 1943, German pilots bombed different areas of the city.

Dependent socialist governments were installed in the [[Eastern Bloc]] satellite states. Becoming the world's second [[Russia and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear weapons power]], the USSR established the [[Warsaw Pact]] alliance and entered into a struggle for global dominance, known as the [[Cold War]], with the United States and [[NATO]]. The Soviet Union supported revolutionary movements across the world, including the newly formed People's Republic of China, the [[Democratic People's Republic of Korea]] and, later on, the [[Republic of Cuba]]. Significant amounts of Soviet resources were [[International relations within the Comecon|allocated in aid]] to the other socialist states.<ref>[http://rs6.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?frd/cstdy:@field%28DOCID+su0391%29 Foreign trade] from ''A Country Study: Soviet Union (Former)''.

Russia's [[cosmonaut]] [[Yuri Gagarin]] became the first human to orbit the Earth, aboard the ''[[Vostok&nbsp;1]]'' manned spacecraft on [[Cosmonautics Day|12 April 1961]].\n\nFollowing the ousting of Khrushchev in 1964, another period of [[Collectivity of leadership|collective rule]] ensued, until [[Leonid Brezhnev]] became the leader. The era of the 1970s and the early 1980s was later designated as the [[Era of Stagnation]], a period when economic growth slowed and social policies became static. The 1965 [[Kosygin reform]] aimed for partial [[decentralization]] of the [[Soviet economy]] and shifted the emphasis from [[heavy industry]] and weapons to [[light industry]] and [[consumer goods]] but was stifled by the conservative Communist leadership.\n\nIn 1979, after a Communist-led revolution in Afghanistan, [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan|Soviet forces entered]] that country. The occupation drained economic resources and dragged on without achieving meaningful political results. Ultimately, the Soviet Army was withdrawn from Afghanistan in 1989 due to international opposition, persistent anti-Soviet guerrilla warfare, and a lack of support by Soviet citizens.\n\n[[File:Reagan and Gorbachev hold discussions.jpg|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in one-to-one discussions with US President [[Ronald Reagan]]]]\nFrom 1985 onwards, the last Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who sought to enact liberal reforms in the Soviet system, introduced the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (restructuring) in an attempt to end the [[Era of Stagnation|period of economic stagnation]] and to [[Demokratizatsiya (Soviet Union)|democratise the government]].

On 17 March, a [[1991 Soviet Union referendum|referendum]] was held, in which the vast majority of participating citizens voted in favour of changing the Soviet Union into a [[Union of Sovereign States|renewed federation]]. In August 1991, [[1991 Soviet coup d'\u00e9tat attempt|a coup d'\u00e9tat attempt]] by members of Gorbachev's government, directed against Gorbachev and aimed at preserving the Soviet Union, instead led to the end of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union.

After the [[reforms of Peter the Great]] the change of architectural styles in Russia generally followed that in the Western Europe.\n\nThe 18th-century taste for [[rococo]] architecture led to the ornate works of [[Bartolomeo Rastrelli]] and his followers. The reigns of [[Catherine the Great]] and her grandson [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander&nbsp;I]] saw the flourishing of [[Neoclassical architecture]], most notably in the capital city of [[Saint Petersburg]]. The second half of the 19th century was dominated by the [[Neo-Byzantine architecture in the Russian Empire|Neo-Byzantine]] and [[Russian Revival]] styles. Prevalent styles of the 20th century were the [[Art Nouveau]], [[Constructivist architecture|Constructivism]], and the [[Stalin Empire style]].\n\n[[File:Saint Isaac's Cathedral in SPB.jpeg|thumb|The neoclassical [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] in [[Saint Petersburg]]]]\n\n[[Russian cultural heritage register#Denial of heritage (1917\u20131941)|With the change in values imposed by communist ideology]], the tradition of preservation was broken.

Notable artists from this era include [[El Lissitzky]], [[Kazimir Malevich]], [[Wassily Kandinsky]], and [[Marc Chagall]]. Since the 1930s the revolutionary ideas of the [[avant-garde]] clashed with the newly emerged conservative direction of [[socialist realism]].\n\nSoviet art produced works that were furiously patriotic and [[anti-fascist]] during and after the [[Great Patriotic War]]. Multiple war memorials, marked by a great restrained solemnity, were built throughout the country.

The latter group includes [[Nikolai Danilevsky]] and [[Konstantin Leontiev]], the founders of [[eurasianism]]. In its further development Russian philosophy was always marked by a deep connection to literature and interest in creativity, society, politics and nationalism; [[Russian cosmism]] and religious philosophy were other major areas.

In the 1930s censorship over literature was tightened in line with the policy of [[socialist realism]].

Russian New Year traditions resemble those of the Western Christmas, with [[New Year Tree]]s and gifts, and [[Ded Moroz]] ([[Father Frost]]) playing the same role as [[Santa Claus]]. [[Orthodox Christmas]] falls on 7 January, because the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] still follows the [[Julian calendar]], and all Orthodox holidays are 13 days after Western ones. Two other major Christian holidays are Easter and [[Trinity Sunday]]. [[Kurban Bayram]] and [[Uraza Bayram]] are celebrated by Russian Muslims.\n\nFurther Russian public holidays include [[Defender of the Fatherland Day]] (23 February), which honors Russian men, especially those serving in the army; [[International Women's Day]] (8 March), which combines the traditions of [[Mother's Day]] and [[Valentine's Day]]; [[Spring and Labor Day]] (1 May); [[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] (9 May); [[Russia Day]] (12 June); and [[Unity Day (Russia)|Unity Day]] (4 November), commemorating the popular uprising which expelled the Polish occupation force from Moscow in 1612.\n\n[[Victory Day (May 9)|Victory Day]] is the second most popular holiday in Russia; it commemorates the victory over [[Nazi Germany]] and its allies in the [[Great Patriotic War]]. A huge [[military parade]], hosted by the [[President of Russia]], is annually organised in Moscow on [[Red Square]]. Similar parades take place in all major Russian cities and cities with the status ''[[Hero city]]'' or ''City of Military Glory''.\n\nPopular non-public holidays include [[Old New Year]] (the New Year according to the Julian Calendar on 14 January), [[Tatiana Day]] (students holiday on 25 January), [[Maslenitsa]] (a pre-Christian spring holiday a week before the [[Great Lent]]), [[Cosmonautics Day]] (in tribute to the first human trip into space), [[Ivan Kupala Day]] (another pre-Christian holiday on 7 July) and [[Peter and Fevronia Day]] (which takes place on 8 July and is the Russian analogue of Valentine's Day, focusing, however, on family love and fidelity).\n\n[[File:Russian Dolls (4891096981).jpg|thumb|A [[Matryoshka doll]] taken apart]]\nState symbols of Russia include the [[Byzantine]] [[double-headed eagle]], combined with [[St. George of Moscow]] in the [[Russian coat of arms]]. The [[Russian flag]] dates from the late [[Tsardom of Russia]] period and has been widely used since the time of the [[Russian Empire]]. The [[Russian anthem]] shares its music with the [[Soviet Anthem]], though not the lyrics. The imperial [[motto]] ''God is with us'' and the Soviet motto ''Proletarians of all countries, unite!'' are now obsolete and no new motto has replaced them. The [[hammer and sickle]] and the full [[Soviet coat of arms]] are still widely seen in Russian cities as a part of old architectural decorations. The Soviet [[Red Star]]s are also encountered, often on military equipment and war memorials. The [[Red Banner]] continues to be honored, especially the [[Banner of Victory]] of 1945.\n\nThe [[Matryoshka doll]] is a recognizable symbol of Russia, and the towers of [[Moscow Kremlin]] and [[Saint Basil's Cathedral]] in Moscow are Russia's main architectural icons. [[Cheburashka]] is a mascot of the [[Russian national Olympic team]]. [[St. Mary]], [[St. Nicholas]], [[St. Andrew]], [[St. George]], [[St. Alexander Nevsky]], [[St. Sergius of Radonezh]] and [[St. Seraphim of Sarov]] are Russia's [[patron saint]]s. [[Chamomile]] is the [[national flower]], while [[birch]] is the [[national tree]]. The [[Russian bear]] is an animal symbol and [[Mother Russia]] a [[national personification]] of Russia, though the bear image has a Western origin and Russians themselves have accepted it only fairly recently.\n\n=== Tourism ===\n{{Main|Tourism in Russia}}\n[[File:Peterhof Palace, Saint Petersburg, Russia (44408938295).jpg|thumb|left|The [[Peterhof Palace#The Grand Cascade and Samson Fountain|Grand Cascade]] in [[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], a popular tourist destination in Saint Petersburg]]\n\nTourism in Russia has seen rapid growth since the late Soviet period, first domestic tourism and then international tourism, fueled by the rich cultural heritage and great natural variety of the country.

Recognised as [[World Cities]], they feature such world-renowned museums as the [[Tretyakov Gallery]] and the [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]], famous theaters like [[Bolshoi Theater|Bolshoi]] and [[Mariinsky Theater|Mariinsky]], ornate churches like Saint Basil's Cathedral, [[Cathedral of Christ the Saviour]], [[Saint Isaac's Cathedral]] and [[Church of the Savior on Blood]], impressive fortifications like the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]] and [[Peter and Paul Fortress]], beautiful squares and streets like [[Red Square]], [[Palace Square]], [[Tverskaya Street]], [[Nevsky Prospect]], and [[Arbat Street]]. Rich palaces and parks are found in the former imperial residences in suburbs of [[Moscow]] ([[Kolomenskoye]], [[Tsaritsyno Park|Tsaritsyno]]) and St Petersburg ([[Peterhof Palace|Peterhof]], [[Strelna]], [[Oranienbaum, Russia|Oranienbaum]], [[Gatchina Palace|Gatchina]], [[Pavlovsk Palace|Pavlovsk]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]]). Moscow displays [[Stalinist architecture|Soviet architecture]] at its best, along with [[Moscow International Business Center|modern skyscrapers]], while St Petersburg, nicknamed ''Venice of the North'', boasts of its classical architecture, many rivers, canals and [[Bridges in Saint Petersburg|bridges]].\n\n[[Kazan]], the capital of [[Tatarstan]], shows a mix of Christian Russian and Muslim Tatar cultures. The city has registered a brand ''The Third Capital of Russia'', though a number of other major cities compete for this status, including [[Novosibirsk]], [[Yekaterinburg]] and [[Nizhny Novgorod]].\n\nThe warm subtropical Black Sea coast of Russia is the site for a number of popular sea resorts, like [[Sochi]], the follow-up host of the [[2014 Winter Olympics]]. The mountains of the [[Northern Caucasus]] contain popular ski resorts such as [[Dombay, Russia|Dombay]]. The most famous natural destination in Russia is [[Lake Baikal]], ''the Blue Eye of Siberia''. This unique lake, the oldest and deepest in the world, has crystal-clear waters and is surrounded by [[taiga]]-covered mountains. Other popular natural destinations include [[Kamchatka]] with its volcanoes and geysers, [[Karelia]] with its lakes and [[granite]] rocks, the snowy [[Altai Mountains]], and the wild steppes of [[Tuva]].\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Russia|Europe}}\n{{Wikipedia books|Russia}}\n* [[Outline of Russia]]\n* [[Index of Soviet Union-related articles]]\n{{Clear}}\n\n== Notes ==\n{{notelist}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n{{Sister project links|voy=Russia}}\n{{Wiktionary|Russia|\u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f|\u0420\u0443\u0441\u044c}}\n{{Z148}}<!--     {{No more links}}\n\n       Please be cautious adding more external links.\n\nWikipedia is not a collection of links and should not be used for advertising.\n\n     Excessive or inappropriate links will be removed.\n\n See [[Wikipedia:External links]] and [[Wikipedia:Spam]] for details.\n\nIf there are already suitable links, propose additions or replacements on\nthe article's talk page, or submit your link to the relevant category at\nthe Open Directory Project (dmoz.org) and link there using {{Dmoz}}.\n\n-->\n;Government\n* [http://www.gov.ru/index_en.html Official Russian governmental portal]\n* [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/world-leaders-1/RS.html Chief of State and Cabinet Members]\n* [http://en.rian.ru/ Russian News Agency \"Ria Novosti\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20110513104203/http://english.ruvr.ru/2010/09/24/22168374.html Russian radio \"Voice of Russia\"]\n\n; General information\n* {{curlie|Regional/Europe/Russia}}\n* {{wikiatlas|Russia}}\n* {{osmrelation-inline|60189}}\n* {{CIA World Factbook link|rs|Russia}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20081022164202/http://ucblibraries.colorado.edu/govpubs/for/russia.htm Russia] at ''UCB Libraries GovPubs''\n* [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-17839672 Russia] from the [[BBC News]]\n* [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/513251/Russia Russia] at ''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]''\n* [http://www.ifs.du.edu/ifs/frm_CountryProfile.aspx?Country=RU Key Development Forecasts for Russia] from [[International Futures]]\n\n;Other\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121215070149/http://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552653 Post-Soviet Problems] from the [https://repository.library.georgetown.edu/handle/10822/552494/browse?type=title Dean Peter Krogh Foreign Affairs Digital Archives]\n* [http://rbth.ru/ Russia Beyond the Headlines] International news project about Russia\n* [http://www.russia-travel.com/ Official Russia Travel Guide]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20101111023616/http://russianconsulate.com/ Russian Consulate]\n\n{{Russia topics}}\n{{Navboxes|title=Articles related to Russia\n|list=\n{{Russian souvenirs}}\n{{Subdivisions of Russia}}\n{{World Heritage Sites in Russia}}\n{{Lists of Russians}}\n{{Sovereign states of Europe}}\n{{Countries of Asia}}\n{{Countries bordering the Baltic Sea}}\n{{Countries bordering the Black Sea}}\n{{APEC}}\n{{BRICS}}\n{{Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS)}}\n{{Council of Europe}}\n{{East Asia Summit (EAS)}}\n{{Eurasian Economic Union (EEU)}}\n{{G8 nations}}\n{{G20}}\n{{Organization of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation (BSEC)}}\n{{Quartet on the Middle East}}\n{{Shanghai Cooperation Organisation}}\n{{UN Security Council}}\n{{World Trade Organization}}\n}}\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Russia]]\n[[Category:Federal republics]]\n[[Category:Countries in Europe]]\n[[Category:Countries in Asia]]\n[[Category:Northeast Asian countries]]\n[[Category:North Asian countries]]\n[[Category:Eastern European countries]]\n[[Category:BRICS nations]]\n[[Category:G20 nations]]\n[[Category:E7 nations]]\n[[Category:Christian states]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Council of Europe]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States]]\n[[Category:Member states of the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation]]\n[[Category:Member states of the United Nations]]\n[[Category:Russian-speaking countries and territories]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1991]]\n[[Category:1991 establishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:Kievan Rus']]\n", "name_user": "I dream of horses", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up,typo(s) fixed: President \u2192 president", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russia"}
