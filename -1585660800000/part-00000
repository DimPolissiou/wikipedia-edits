The system involves the [[RecA]] protein (Rad51 in eukaryotes). The RecA protein, stimulated by single-stranded DNA, is involved in the inactivation of the repressor ([[LexA]]) of SOS response genes thereby inducing the response. It is an error-prone repair system that contributes significantly to DNA changes observed in a wide range of species.\n\n==Discovery==\nThe SOS response was discovered and named by [[Miroslav Radman]] in 1975.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Phenomenology of an inducible mutagenic DNA repair pathway in Escherichia coli: SOS repair hypothesis | last=Radman | first=M | journal=Basic Life Sciences | year=1975 | volume=5A | pages=355\u2013367 | pmid=1103845}}</ref>\n\n==Mechanism==\nDuring normal growth, the SOS genes are negatively regulated by LexA [[repressor protein]] dimers. Under normal conditions, LexA binds to a 20-bp consensus sequence (the [[SOS box]]) in the operator region for those genes. Some of these SOS genes are expressed at certain levels even in the repressed state, according to the affinity of LexA for their SOS box. Activation of the SOS genes occurs after DNA damage by the accumulation of single stranded (ssDNA) regions generated at replication forks, where [[DNA polymerase]] is blocked. RecA forms a filament around these ssDNA regions in an ATP-dependent fashion, and becomes activated. The activated form of RecA interacts with the LexA repressor to facilitate the LexA repressor's self-cleavage from the operator.<ref>Nelson, David L., and Michael M. Cox. Lehninger: Principles of Biochemistry 4th Edition. New York: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2005. page 1098.</ref>\n\nOnce the pool of LexA decreases, repression of the SOS genes goes down according to the level of LexA affinity for the SOS boxes. Operators that bind LexA weakly are the first to be fully expressed. In this way LexA can sequentially activate different mechanisms of repair. Genes having a weak SOSbox (such as lexA, recA, uvrA, uvrB, and uvrD) are fully induced in response to even weak SOS-inducing treatments. Thus the first SOS repair mechanism to be induced is [[nucleotide excision repair]] (NER), whose aim is to fix DNA damage without commitment to a full-fledged SOS response.\nIf, however, NER does not suffice to fix the damage, the LexA concentration is further reduced, so the expression of genes with stronger LexA boxes (such as sulA, umuD, umuC - these are expressed late) is induced. SulA stops [[cell division]] by binding to [[FtsZ]], the initiating protein in this process. This causes [[filamentation]], and the induction of UmuDC-dependent mutagenic repair. As a result of these properties, some genes may be partially induced in response to even endogenous levels of DNA damage, while other genes appear to be induced only when high or persistent DNA damage is present in the cell.\n\n==Antibiotic resistance==\nRecent research has shown that the SOS pathway may be essential in the acquisition of bacterial mutations which lead to [[Antibiotic resistance|resistance]] to some antibiotic drugs.<ref name=\"Lee\">{{cite journal | title=Inhibition of Mutation and Combating the Evolution of Antibiotic Resistance | last=Cirz | first=RT | journal=PLoS Biology | year=2005 | volume=3 | issue=6 | page=e176 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0030176 | pmid=15869329 | last2=Chin | first2=JK | last3=Andes | first3=DR | last4=De Cr\u00e9cy-Lagard | first4=V | last5=Craig | first5=WA | last6=Romesberg | first6=FE | pmc=1088971|display-authors=etal}} {{open access}}</ref> The increased rate of mutation during the SOS response is caused by three low-fidelity [[DNA polymerase]]s: [[Pol II]], [[Pol IV]] and [[Pol V]].<ref name=\"Lee\"/>  Researchers are now targeting these proteins with the aim of creating drugs that prevent SOS repair.

Shen probably left Linzi after its capture by the [[Yan (state)|state of Yan]] in 285{{nbsp}}BC, possibly moving to the [[State of Han|Han kingdom]] and absorbing the \"Legalist\" tradition there. He died roughly 10 years later.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=871}}<ref>Julia Ching, R. W. L. Guisso. 1991. p. 76.

Ancient China: A History. https://books.google.com/books?id=vh8xDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT207</ref> and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are \"not the product of one man's efforts.\" He also argued for [[Wu wei]], or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines as Shen Buhai, saying\n{{quote| text=The Dao of ruler and ministers is that the ministers labour themselves with tasks while the prince has no task; the prince is relaxed and happy while the ministers bear responsibility for tasks.

As a result, every task is taken care of. The correct way of government is thus.<ref>L.K.

Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue.  Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, later used by the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' and ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', to Shen, given a \"dimensional\" difference through Fa (measurement, standards, protocol, administrative method), social relationships (\"yin\") and division. Shen Dao eschews appointment by interview in favour of a mechanical distribution (\"the basis of fairness\") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement.<ref>John Knoblock 1990. p. 172.

However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian [[Li (Confucian)|Li]]'s supplementation of ''Fa'' and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.<ref>Masayuki Sato 2003. p. 134\u2013135.

[Such a ruler] neither overworked his heart-mind with knowledge nor exhausted himself with self-interest (si), but, rather, depended on laws and methods for settling matters of order and disorder, rewards and punishments for deciding on matters of right and wrong, and weights and balances for resolving issues of heavy or light...<ref name=\"Erica Brindley p.6, 8\"/>\n\nThe reason why those who apportion horses use ce-lots, and those who apportion fields use gou-lots, is not that they take ce and gou-lots to be superior to human wisdom, but that one may eliminate private interest and stop resentment by these means. Thus it is said: 'When the great lord relies on fa and does not act personally, affairs are judged in accordance with (objective) method (fa).' The benefit of fa is that each person meets his reward or punishment according to his due, and there are no further expectations of the lord. Thus resentment does not arise and superiors and inferiors are in harmony.\n\nIf the lord of men abandons method (Fa) and governs with his own person, then penalties and rewards, seizures and grants, will all emerge from the lord's mind. If this is the case, then those who receive rewards, even if these are commensurate, will ceaselessly expect more; those who receive punishment, even if these are commensurate, will endlessly expect more lenient treatment... people will be rewarded differently for the same merit and punished differently for the same fault.

An itinerant [[Chinese people|Chinese]] [[Chinese philosophy|philosopher]] from [[State of Zhao|Zhao]], he was probably born about 350{{nbsp}}BC, travelling to the city of Linzi (modern [[Zibo]], [[Shandong]]) in 300{{nbsp}}BC to become a member of the [[Jixia Academy]]. Shen probably left Linzi after its capture by the [[Yan (state)|state of Yan]] in 285{{nbsp}}BC, possibly moving to the [[State of Han|Han kingdom]] and absorbing the \"Legalist\" tradition there. He died roughly 10 years later.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2014|p=871}}<ref>Julia Ching, R. W. L. Guisso. 1991. p.76.

Major, Constance A. Cook. 2007 p.207. Ancient China: A History. https://books.google.com/books?id=vh8xDQAAQBAJ&pg=PT207</ref> and the promotion of ministers, saying that order and chaos are \"not the product of one man's efforts.\" He also argued for [[Wu wei]], or the non action of the ruler, along the same lines as Shen Buhai, saying\n{{quote| text=The Dao of ruler and ministers is that the ministers labour themselves with tasks while the prince has no task; the prince is relaxed and happy while the ministers bear responsibility for tasks. The ministers use all their intelligence and strength to perform his job satisfactorily, in which the ruler takes no part, but merely waits for the job to be finished.

Taking it upon himself to attempt a new, analytical solution, Shen advocated fairness as a new virtue.  Scholar Sugamoto Hirotsugu attributes the concept of Fen, or social resources, later used by the ''[[Guanzi (text)|Guanzi]]'' and ''[[Xunzi (book)|Xunzi]]'', to Shen, given a \"dimensional\" difference through Fa (measurement, standards, protocol, administrative method), social relationships (\"yin\") and division. Shen Dao eschews appointment by interview in favour of a mechanical distribution (\"the basis of fairness\") with the invariable Fa apportioning every person according to their achievement.<ref>John Knoblock 1990. p.172.

However, doubting its long-term viability Shen did not exclude moral values and accepted (qualified) Confucian [[Li (Confucian)|Li]]'s supplementation of ''Fa'' and social relationships, though he frames Li in terms of (impersonal) rules.<ref>Masayuki Sato 2003. p.134=135.

Thus it is said: 'When the great lord relies on fa and does not act personally, affairs are judged in accordance with (objective) method (fa).' The benefit of fa is that each person meets his reward or punishment according to his due, and there are no further expectations of the lord. Thus resentment does not arise and superiors and inferiors are in harmony.\n\nIf the lord of men abandons method (Fa) and governs with his own person, then penalties and rewards, seizures and grants, will all emerge from the lord's mind. If this is the case, then those who receive rewards, even if these are commensurate, will ceaselessly expect more; those who receive punishment, even if these are commensurate, will endlessly expect more lenient treatment... people will be rewarded differently for the same merit and punished differently for the same fault.
