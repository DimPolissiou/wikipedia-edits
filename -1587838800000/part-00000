It stars [[Marlon Brando]] and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Pat Henning]], and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The musical score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was suggested by \"Crime on the Waterfront\" by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November\u2013December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|51286}}</ref> The film focuses on union violence and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success. It received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and won eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]]; in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.\n\nIn 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was one of the first 25 films to be deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/91732574/|title=On the waterfront|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Irish Mob|Mob]]-connected union boss Johnny Friendly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) gloats about his iron-fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]] know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play \"D and D\" (\"deaf and dumb\"), accepting their subservient position, rather than risking the danger and shame of informing.\n\nTerry Malloy ([[Marlon Brando]]) is a dockworker whose brother Charley \"the Gent\" ([[Rod Steiger]]) is Friendly's right-hand man.  Terry had been a promising boxer until Friendly instructed Charley to have Terry deliberately lose a fight so that Friendly could win money by betting against him. Terry coaxes Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), a popular dockworker, into an ambush, preventing Joey from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry assumed that Friendly's enforcers were only going to \"lean\" on Joey to pressure him into silence, and is surprised when Joey is killed.\n\nJoey's sister Edie ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), angry about her brother's death, shames \"waterfront priest\" Father Barry ([[Karl Malden]]) into fomenting action against the mob-controlled union. Friendly sends Terry to attend and inform on a dockworkers' meeting Father Barry holds in the church, which is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape the violence, and is smitten with her. Another dockworker, Timothy J. \"Kayo\" Dugan (Pat Henning), who agrees to testify after Father Barry promises unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.\n\nAlthough Terry resents being used as a tool in Joey's death, and despite Father Barry's impassioned \"sermon on the docks\" reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a [[Calvary|crucifixion]], Terry is at first willing to remain \"D and D\", even when [[subpoena]]ed to testify. However, when Edie, unaware of Terry's role in her brother's death, begins to return Terry's feelings, Terry is tormented by his awakening conscience and confesses the circumstances of Joey's death to Father Barry and Edie. Horrified, Edie breaks up with him.\n\nAs Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry, offering him a good job where he can receive kickbacks without any physical work, and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who blames his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. In what has become an iconic scene, Terry reminds Charley that had it not been for the fixed fight, Terry's prizefighting career would have bloomed. \"I coulda' had class. I coulda' been a contender. I could've been somebody\", laments Terry to his brother, \"Instead of a bum, which is what I am \u2013 let's face it.\" Charley gives Terry the gun, and advises him to run. Terry flees to Edie's apartment, where she first refuses to let him in, but finally admits her love for him. Friendly, having had Charley watched, has Charley murdered that night near the apartment and his body hung in an alley as bait to lure Terry out to his death, but Terry and Edie both escape the attempt on Terry's life.\n\nAfter finding Charley's body, Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry prevents it by blocking Terry's line of fire and convincing Terry to fight Friendly by testifying in court instead. Terry proceeds to give damaging testimony implicating Friendly in Joey's murder and other illegal activities, causing Friendly's mob boss to cut him off and Friendly to face [[indictment]].\n\nAfter the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. Terry is shunned by his former friends and by a neighborhood boy who had previously looked up to him. Refusing Edie's suggestion that they move far away from the waterfront together, Terry shows up during recruitment at the docks. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did. The confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witness the confrontation, show their support for Terry by refusing to work, unless Terry is working, too, and pushing Friendly into the river. Encouraged by Father Barry and Edie, the badly injured Terry forces himself to his feet and enters the dock, followed by the other workers. A soaking wet and face-scarred Friendly, now left with nothing, swears revenge on them all, but his threats fall on deaf ears as they enter the garage, and the door closes behind them.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Eva_marie_saint_marlon_brando_waterfront_14.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Eva Marie Saint]] as Edie Doyle, with [[Marlon Brando]] as Terry Malloy]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Terry Malloy\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Father Barry \n* [[Lee J.

One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally titled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie \"pro-American\". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archivedate=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter rewriting the script, Schulberg and Kazan approached [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who eventually told them he did not like a single thing about the script, asking, \"Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?\" This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer [[Sam Spiegel]], who set up a deal with Columbia. Spiegel was insistent on Schulberg delivering a perfect screenplay, and barraged the writer with changes and suggestions, to the frustration of Schulberg.\n\nSchulberg's script nonetheless went through a number of changes before reaching the screen. In an early draft, the Terry Malloy character was not an ex-pug dockworker, but a cynical investigative reporter, as well as an older, divorced man.\n\n===Real-life basis for characters===\n\nTerry Malloy's fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DeVincenzo, who testified before a real-life [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Commission]] about activities on the Hoboken Docks and suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DeVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with [[Columbia Pictures]] over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DeVincenzo claimed to have recounted his story to screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings. Schulberg attended DeVincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.\n\nThe character of Father Barry was based on the real-life \"waterfront priest\" [[John M. Corridan|Father John M. Corridan]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and graduate of [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|west side of Manhattan]]. Father Corridan was interviewed extensively by Schulberg, who also wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, ''Waterfront Priest'' by Allen Raymond.\n\nThe character of Johnny Friendly was partially based on [[International Longshoremen's Association]] East River dock boss [[Michael Clemente]]. Friendly also had aspects of former [[Murder, Inc.]] head  [[Albert Anastasia]], who was underboss and later the boss for the Mangano crime family that ran the Brooklyn docks, later renamed the Gambino crime family. In 1979, Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had \"a handshake deal\"{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a \"more Brando-like\" actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade Spiegel that \"an actor like Marlon Brando\" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterward, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had been signed for this role.\n\nThe part of Edie Doyle was offered to [[Grace Kelly]], who turned it down, preferring to make ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Kazan said in his autobiography ''A Life'' that the choice of an actress to play Edie Doyle was narrowed to [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]]. There was something well-bred about Montgomery that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} who was raised on the waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey. He gave the part to Saint.\n\nThe role of Terry's older brother Charley was originally offered to [[Lawrence Tierney]], who asked for too much money, so the role went to [[Rod Steiger]]. Despite playing Terry's older brother, Steiger was one year younger than Brando.\n\nSeveral of the labor boss's men in the film, including [[Abe Simon]] as Barney, [[Tony Galento]] as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tillio, were former professional heavyweight boxers in real life.\n\n===Filming locations===\n''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.<ref name=movielove>{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.<ref>'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)</ref> In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A.

It is also on the [[Vatican's list of films|Vatican's list of 45 greatest films]], compiled in 1995.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://archive.usccb.org/movies/vaticanfilms.shtml |title=Vatican Best Films List |publisher=USCCB |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Home media==\n{{Anchor|Video|DVD|DVD release}} The first home video release of the film was by [[Sony Pictures Home Entertainment|Columbia Pictures Home Entertainment]] in 1982, on VHS and Beta. RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's \"Studio Heritage Collection\", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette \"Contender: Mastering the Method\", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]].\n\nThe 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: \"In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era. Here, for the first time, Criterion is presenting the film in all three aspect ratios so that viewers can compare and choose the version they prefer.\"\n\n==Adaptations==\nBuilding on the success of the film, Schulberg expanded the script into a novel which was released in 1955, titled ''Waterfront''.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe film script was adapted to stage by Schulberg.

It stars [[Marlon Brando]] and features [[Karl Malden]], [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Rod Steiger]], [[Pat Henning]], and [[Eva Marie Saint]] in her film debut. The musical score was composed by [[Leonard Bernstein]]. The film was suggested by \"Crime on the Waterfront\" by [[Malcolm Johnson (journalist)|Malcolm Johnson]], a series of articles published in November\u2013December 1948 in the ''[[The New York Sun (historical)|New York Sun]]'' which won the 1949 [[Pulitzer Prize for Local Reporting]], but the screenplay by [[Budd Schulberg]] is directly based on his own original story.<ref name=afi>{{AFI film|51286}}</ref> The film focuses on union violence and corruption amongst [[Stevedore|longshoremen]], while detailing widespread corruption, extortion, and racketeering on the waterfronts of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], [[New Jersey]].\n\n''On the Waterfront'' was a critical and commercial success. It received twelve [[Academy Awards|Academy Award]] nominations and won eight, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Actor|Best Actor]] for Brando, [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress|Best Supporting Actress]] for Saint, and [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Kazan. In 1997, it was ranked by the [[American Film Institute]] as [[AFI's 100 Years... 100 Movies|the eighth-greatest American movie of all time]]; in AFI's 2007 list, it was ranked 19th. It is Bernstein's only original film score not adapted from a stage production with songs.\n\nIn 1989, ''On the Waterfront'' was was one of the first 25 films to be deemed \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\" by the [[Library of Congress]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/item/91732574/|title=On the waterfront|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref> and selected for preservation in the United States [[National Film Registry]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/programs/national-film-preservation-board/film-registry/complete-national-film-registry-listing/|title=Complete National Film Registry Listing {{!}} Film Registry {{!}} National Film Preservation Board {{!}} Programs at the Library of Congress {{!}} Library of Congress|website=Library of Congress, Washington, D.C. 20540 USA|access-date=2019-04-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|date=September 19, 1989|title=ENTERTAINMENT: Film Registry Picks First 25 Movies|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1989-09-19-mn-347-story.html|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|access-date=April 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Plot==\n[[Irish Mob|Mob]]-connected union boss Johnny Friendly ([[Lee J. Cobb]]) gloats about his iron-fisted control of the waterfront. The police and the [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Crime Commission]] know that Friendly is behind a number of murders, but witnesses play \"D and D\" (\"deaf and dumb\"), accepting their subservient position, rather than risking the danger and shame of informing.\n\nTerry Malloy ([[Marlon Brando]]) is a dockworker whose brother Charley \"the Gent\" ([[Rod Steiger]]) is Friendly's right-hand man.  Terry had been a promising boxer until Friendly instructed Charley to have Terry deliberately lose a fight so that Friendly could win money by betting against him. Terry coaxes Joey Doyle (Ben Wagner), a popular dockworker, into an ambush, preventing Joey from testifying against Friendly before the Crime Commission. Terry assumed that Friendly's enforcers were only going to \"lean\" on Joey to pressure him into silence, and is surprised when Joey is killed.\n\nJoey's sister Edie ([[Eva Marie Saint]]), angry about her brother's death, shames \"waterfront priest\" Father Barry ([[Karl Malden]]) into fomenting action against the mob-controlled union. Friendly sends Terry to attend and inform on a dockworkers' meeting Father Barry holds in the church, which is broken up by Friendly's men. Terry helps Edie escape the violence, and is smitten with her. Another dockworker, Timothy J. \"Kayo\" Dugan (Pat Henning), who agrees to testify after Father Barry promises unwavering support, ends up dead after Friendly arranges for him to be crushed by a load of whiskey in a staged accident.\n\nAlthough Terry resents being used as a tool in Joey's death, and despite Father Barry's impassioned \"sermon on the docks\" reminding the longshoremen that Christ walks among them and that every murder is a [[Calvary|crucifixion]], Terry is at first willing to remain \"D and D\", even when [[subpoena]]ed to testify. However, when Edie, unaware of Terry's role in her brother's death, begins to return Terry's feelings, Terry is tormented by his awakening conscience and confesses the circumstances of Joey's death to Father Barry and Edie. Horrified, Edie breaks up with him.\n\nAs Terry increasingly leans toward testifying, Friendly decides that Terry must be killed unless Charley can coerce him into keeping quiet. Charley tries bribing Terry, offering him a good job where he can receive kickbacks without any physical work, and finally threatens Terry by holding a gun against him, but recognizes that he has failed to sway Terry, who blames his own downward spiral on his well-off brother. In what has become an iconic scene, Terry reminds Charley that had it not been for the fixed fight, Terry's prizefighting career would have bloomed. \"I coulda' had class. I coulda' been a contender. I could've been somebody\", laments Terry to his brother, \"Instead of a bum, which is what I am \u2013 let's face it.\" Charley gives Terry the gun, and advises him to run. Terry flees to Edie's apartment, where she first refuses to let him in, but finally admits her love for him. Friendly, having had Charley watched, has Charley murdered that night near the apartment and his body hung in an alley as bait to lure Terry out to his death, but Terry and Edie both escape the attempt on Terry's life.\n\nAfter finding Charley's body, Terry sets out to shoot Friendly, but Father Barry prevents it by blocking Terry's line of fire and convincing Terry to fight Friendly by testifying in court instead. Terry proceeds to give damaging testimony implicating Friendly in Joey's murder and other illegal activities, causing Friendly's mob boss to cut him off and Friendly to face [[indictment]].\n\nAfter the testimony, Friendly announces that Terry will not find employment anywhere on the waterfront. Terry is shunned by his former friends and by a neighborhood boy who had previously looked up to him. Refusing Edie's suggestion that they move far away from the waterfront together, Terry shows up during recruitment at the docks. When he is the only man not hired, Terry openly confronts Friendly, calling him out and proclaiming that he is proud of what he did. The confrontation develops into a vicious brawl, with Terry getting the upper hand until Friendly's thugs gang up on Terry and nearly beat him to death. The dockworkers, who witness the confrontation, show their support for Terry by refusing to work, unless Terry is working, too, and pushing Friendly into the river. Encouraged by Father Barry and Edie, the badly injured Terry forces himself to his feet and enters the dock, followed by the other workers. A soaking wet and face-scarred Friendly, now left with nothing, swears revenge on them all, but his threats fall on deaf ears as they enter the garage, and the door closes behind them.\n\n==Cast==\n[[Image:Eva_marie_saint_marlon_brando_waterfront_14.jpg|thumb|right|275px|[[Eva Marie Saint]] as Edie Doyle, with [[Marlon Brando]] as Terry Malloy]]\n{{castlist|\n* [[Marlon Brando]] as Terry Malloy\n* [[Karl Malden]] as Father Barry \n* [[Lee J.

One of Kazan's critics was his friend and collaborator, the noted playwright [[Arthur Miller]], who had earlier written the first version of the script, originally titled ''The Hook''. Kazan had agreed to direct it, and in 1951 they met with [[Harry Cohn]] at [[Columbia Pictures]] about making the picture. Cohn agreed in principle to make ''The Hook'', but there were concerns about the portrayal of corrupt union officials.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} When Cohn asked the antagonists be changed to Communists, Miller refused. Cohn sent a letter telling Miller it was interesting he had resisted Columbia's desire to make the movie \"pro-American\". Kazan asked Miller to rewrite the script; Miller declined due to his disenchantment with Kazan's friendly testimony before the HUAC. Kazan then replaced Miller with [[Budd Schulberg]].<ref>{{cite news | first=Geneveive | last=Haas | title=Dartmouth acquires Budd Schulberg '36 papers | date=November 21, 2006 | url=http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | work=Dartmouth News | accessdate=January 6, 2007 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206144751/http://www.dartmouth.edu/~news/releases/2006/11/21a.html | archivedate=February 6, 2007 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nAfter rewriting the script, Schulberg and Kazan approached [[Darryl F. Zanuck]], who eventually told them he did not like a single thing about the script, asking, \"Who's going to care about a bunch of sweaty longshoremen?\" This led Kazan and Schulberg to meet with independent producer [[Sam Spiegel]], who set up a deal with Columbia. Spiegel was insistent on Schulberg delivering a perfect screenplay, and barraged the writer with changes and suggestions, to the frustration of Schulberg.\n\nSchulberg's script nonetheless went through a number of changes before reaching the screen. In an early draft, the Terry Malloy character was not an ex-pug dockworker, but a cynical investigative reporter, as well as an older, divorced man.\n\n===Real-life basis for characters===\n\nTerry Malloy's fight against corruption was in part modeled after whistle-blowing longshoreman Anthony DeVincenzo, who testified before a real-life [[Waterfront Commission of New York Harbor|Waterfront Commission]] about activities on the Hoboken Docks and suffered a degree of ostracism for his deed. DeVincenzo sued and settled, many years after, with [[Columbia Pictures]] over the appropriation of what he considered his story. DeVincenzo claimed to have recounted his story to screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]] during a month-long session of waterfront barroom meetings. Schulberg attended DeVincenzo's waterfront commission testimony every day during the hearing.\n\nThe character of Father Barry was based on the real-life \"waterfront priest\" [[John M. Corridan|Father John M. Corridan]], a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] priest and graduate of [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] who operated a Roman Catholic labor school on the [[West Side (Manhattan)|west side of Manhattan]]. Father Corridan was interviewed extensively by Schulberg, who also wrote the foreword to a biography of Father Corridan, ''Waterfront Priest'' by Allen Raymond.\n\nThe character of Johnny Friendly was partially based on [[International Longshoremen's Association]] East River dock boss [[Michael Clemente]]. Friendly also had aspects of former [[Murder, Inc.]] head  [[Albert Anastasia]], who was underboss and later the boss for the Mangano crime family that ran the Brooklyn docks, later renamed the Gambino crime family. In 1979, Clemente and other members of the Genovese family were indicted for corruption and racketeering on the New York waterfront.\n\n===Casting===\nAccording to [[Richard Schickel]] in his biography of Kazan, Marlon Brando initially refused the role of Terry Malloy, and [[Frank Sinatra]] (a native of [[Hoboken, New Jersey|Hoboken]], where the film was being made) then had \"a handshake deal\"{{spnd}}but no formally signed contract{{spnd}}to play the part, even attending an initial costume fitting. But Kazan still favored Brando for the role, partly because casting Brando would assure a larger budget for the picture. While Brando's agent, Jay Kanter, attempted to persuade Brando to change his mind, Kazan enlisted actor Karl Malden, whom Kazan considered more suited to a career as a director than as an actor, to direct and film a screen test of a \"more Brando-like\" actor as Terry Malloy, in an effort to persuade Spiegel that \"an actor like Marlon Brando\" could perform the role more forcefully than Sinatra. To that end, Malden filmed a screen test of [[Actors Studio]] members [[Paul Newman]] and [[Joanne Woodward]] performing the love scene between Terry and Edie. Persuaded by the Newman/Woodward screen test, Spiegel agreed to reconsider Brando for the role, and shortly afterward, Kanter convinced Brando to reconsider his refusal. Within a week, Brando signed a contract to perform in the film. At that point, a furious Sinatra demanded to be cast in the role of Father Barry, the waterfront priest. It was left to Spiegel to break the news to Sinatra that Malden had been signed for this role.\n\nThe part of Edie Doyle was offered to [[Grace Kelly]], who turned it down, preferring to make ''[[Rear Window]]'' instead. Kazan said in his autobiography ''A Life'' that the choice of an actress to play Edie Doyle was narrowed to [[Elizabeth Montgomery]] and [[Eva Marie Saint]]. There was something well-bred about Montgomery that Kazan thought would not be becoming for Edie,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} who was raised on the waterfront in Hoboken, New Jersey. He gave the part to Saint.\n\nThe role of Terry's older brother Charley was originally offered to [[Lawrence Tierney]], who asked for too much money, so the role went to [[Rod Steiger]]. Despite playing Terry's older brother, Steiger was one year younger than Brando.\n\nSeveral of the labor boss's men in the film, including [[Abe Simon]] as Barney, [[Tony Galento]] as Truck, and Tami Mauriello as Tillio, were former professional heavyweight boxers in real life.\n\n===Filming locations===\n''On the Waterfront'' was filmed over 36 days on location in various places in [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], including the docks, workers' slum dwellings, bars, littered alleys, and rooftops. The church used for exterior scenes in the film was the historic [[Church of Our Lady of Grace (Hoboken, New Jersey)|Our Lady of Grace]], built in 1874, while the interiors were shot at the Church of St. Peter and St. Paul at 400 Hudson Street.<ref name=movielove>{{cite movielove}}, p. 10-11</ref>\n\n==Reception==\nUpon its release, the film received positive reviews from critics, and was a commercial success, earning an estimated $4.2 million at the North American box office in 1954.<ref>'The Top Box-Office Hits of 1954', ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' (January 5, 1955)</ref> In his July 29, 1954, review, ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' critic A.

RCA/Columbia Pictures Home Video later re-released it in 1984, 1986, and 1990, respectively, the latter being a part of the [[Columbia Classics]] line-up. Columbia TriStar later reissued the film on VHS in 1995 as part of the line-up's \"Studio Heritage Collection\", and the first DVD version was released in 2001. Among the special features is the featurette \"Contender: Mastering the Method\", a video photo gallery, an interview with Elia Kazan, an audio commentary, filmographies, production notes, and theatrical trailers. The film has been added to the [[Criterion Collection]].\n\nThe 2013 Criterion Collection release presents the film in three aspect ratios: 1.66:1, 1.85:1, and 1.33:1. The accompanying booklet explains the reasoning behind this choice: \"In 1953, Columbia Pictures was transitioning to the new widescreen format and declared that all its upcoming films, including ''On The Waterfront'', would be suitable for projection in any aspect ratio from the full frame of 1.33:1 to the then widest standard of 1.85:1. The customary frame of European cinematographer Boris Kaufman (''Twelve Angry Men'', ''Baby Doll'') split the difference at 1.66:1, so that all that was required was for him to leave extra room at the top and bottom of the frame and make sure that nothing essential would be lost in the widescreen presentation. At its premiere in 1954, ''On The Waterfront'' was projected at 1.85:1. Over subsequent decades, millions of television viewers became accustomed to seeing the film with the open-matte 1.33:1 framing, a presentation that has carried over into the home video era.

It opened on Broadway in November 1984. It included technical innovations for the time, including lasers, filmlike scenic dissolves and sounds that enveloped the audience. The story is a little different, with the motivations of Father Barry made more explicit, and the ending is less happy and more realistic.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/20/theater/on-the-waterfront-adapted-for-stage.html |title=On the Waterfront adapted for stage |work=[[The New York Times]] |author=Eleanor Blau |date=March 20, 1984 |accessdate=February 23, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe Indian films ''[[Kabzaa]]'' (1988) and ''[[Ghulam (film)|Ghulam]]'' (1998) are inspired by ''On the Waterfront''.{{cn|date=March 2020}} \n\nThe TV show ''On the Waterfront'' (2001) is a spoof/homage to the film.{{cn|date=March 2020}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n* Raymond, Allen, ''Waterfront Priest'' (New York: Henry Holt and Company, 1955); forward by ''On the Waterfront'' screenwriter [[Budd Schulberg]]\n\n===Further reading===\n* {{cite book |last= Clark |first= Neil G. |title= Dock Boss: Eddie McGrath and the West Side Waterfront |publisher= Barricade Books |location= New Jersey |year=2017 |isbn=1569808139}}\n* {{cite book |last= Rapf |first= Joanna E. |title= On the Waterfront |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge, UK |year=2003 |isbn=0-521-79400-5}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|On the Waterfront (1954 film)}}\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{AFI film|51286}}\n* {{IMDb title|0047296}}\n* {{tcmdb title|4749}}\n* {{Amg movie|36311}}\n* {{Rotten Tomatoes|on_the_waterfront}}\n* [http://www.filmsite.org/onth.html filmsite.org]\n* [http://www.lib.berkeley.edu/MRC/kazan.html#waterfront Bibliography of articles and books about On the Waterfront] via UC Berkeley Media Resources Center\n*[https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2663-on-the-waterfront-everybody-part-of-everybody-else ''On the Waterfront: Everybody Part of Everybody Else''] an essay by [[Michael Almereyda]] at the [[Criterion Collection]]\n\n{{Elia Kazan}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title = Awards for ''On the Waterfront''\n|list =\n{{AcademyAwardBestPicture 1941-1960}}\n{{GoldenGlobeBestMotionPictureDrama 1951-1960}}\n{{National Board of Review Award for Best Film}}\n{{New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Film}}\n{{The Silver Lion}}\n}}\n\n{{Portal bar|Film|United States|1950s}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:On The Waterfront}}\n[[Category:1954 films]]\n[[Category:1950s crime drama films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:American crime drama films]]\n[[Category:Best Drama Picture Golden Globe winners]]\n[[Category:Best Picture Academy Award winners]]\n[[Category:American black-and-white films]]\n[[Category:Compositions by Leonard Bernstein]]\n[[Category:English-language films]]\n[[Category:Films about brothers]]\n[[Category:Films about the Irish Mob]]\n[[Category:Films about the labor movement]]\n[[Category:Films about whistleblowing]]\n[[Category:Films based on newspaper and magazine articles]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Elia Kazan]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Actor Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Drama Actor Golden Globe winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films featuring a Best Supporting Actress Academy Award-winning performance]]\n[[Category:Films set in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films shot in New Jersey]]\n[[Category:Films whose art director won the Best Art Direction Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose cinematographer won the Best Cinematography Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Directing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose director won the Best Director Golden Globe]]\n[[Category:Films whose editor won the Best Film Editing Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Films whose writer won the Best Original Screenplay Academy Award]]\n[[Category:Irish-American media]]\n[[Category:Mafia films]]\n[[Category:Union violence]]\n[[Category:United States National Film Registry films]]\n[[Category:Films produced by Sam Spiegel]]\n", "name_user": "Arjayay", "label": "safe", "comment": "Duplicate word removed", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_the_Waterfront"}
