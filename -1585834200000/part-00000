{"title_page": "On shell and off shell", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=November 2014}}\nIn [[physics]], particularly in [[quantum field theory]], configurations of a physical system that satisfy classical [[equations of motion]] are called '''on shell''', and those that do not are called '''off shell'''.\n\nIn quantum field theory, [[virtual particle]]s are termed off shell because they do not satisfy the [[energy\u2013momentum relation]]; real exchange particles do satisfy this relation and are termed on shell (mass shell).<ref>Thomson, M. (2013). ''Modern particle physics''.

[[Noether's theorem]] regarding differentiable symmetries of physical action and [[conservation law]]s is another on-shell theorem.\n\n==Mass shell==\n[[Image:Hyperboloid Of Two Sheets Quadric.png|thumb|upright|right|Points on the hyperboloid surface (the \"shell\") are solutions to the equation.]]\nMass shell is a synonym for '''mass hyperboloid''', meaning the [[hyperboloid]] in [[energy]]&ndash;[[momentum]] space describing the solutions to the equation:\n\n:<math>E^2 - |\\vec{p} \\,|^2 c^2 = m^2 c^4</math>,\n\nthe [[Energy\u2013momentum relation|mass-energy equivalence formula]] which gives the energy ''E'' in terms of the momentum <math>\\vec{p}</math> and the [[rest mass]] ''m'' of a particle. The equation for the mass shell is also often written in terms of the [[four-momentum]]; in [[Einstein notation]] with [[metric signature]] (+,\u2013,\u2013,\u2013) and units where the [[speed of light]] ''c'' = 1, as <math>p^\\mu p_\\mu \\equiv p^2 = m^2</math>. In the literature, one may also encounter <math>p^\\mu p_\\mu = - m^2</math> if the metric signature used is (\u2013,+,+,+).\n\nThe four-momentum of an exchanged virtual particle <math>X</math> is <math>q_\\mu</math>, with mass <math>q^2 = m_X^2</math>.  The four-momentum  <math>q_\\mu</math> of the virtual particle is the difference between the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles.\n\nVirtual particles corresponding to internal [[propagator]]s in a [[Feynman diagram]] are in general allowed to be off shell, but the amplitude for the process will diminish depending on how far off shell they are. This is because the <math>q^2</math>-dependence of the propagator is determined by the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles. The propagator typically has [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] on the mass shell.<ref>Thomson, M. (2013). ''Modern particle physics''. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107034266}}, p.119.</ref>\n\nWhen speaking of the propagator, negative values for ''E'' that satisfy the equation are thought of as being on shell, though the classical theory does not allow negative values for the energy of a particle.  This is because the propagator incorporates into one expression the cases in which the particle carries energy in one direction, and in which its [[antiparticle]] carries energy in the other direction; negative and positive on-shell ''E'' then simply represent opposing flows of positive energy.\n\n==Scalar field ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nAn example comes from considering a [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] in ''D''-dimensional [[Minkowski space]]. Consider a [[Lagrangian density]] given by <math>\\mathcal{L}(\\phi,\\partial_\\mu \\phi)</math>.

[[Noether's theorem]] regarding differentiable symmetries of physical action and [[conservation law]]s is another on-shell theorem.\n\n==Mass shell==\n[[Image:Hyperboloid Of Two Sheets Quadric.png|thumb|upright|right|Points on the hyperboloid surface (the \"shell\") are solutions to the equation.]]\nMass shell is a synonym for '''mass hyperboloid''', meaning the [[hyperboloid]] in [[energy]]&ndash;[[momentum]] space describing the solutions to the equation:\n\n:<math>E^2 - |\\vec{p} \\,|^2 c^2 = m^2 c^4</math>,\n\nthe [[Energy\u2013momentum relation|mass-energy equivalence formula]] which gives the energy ''E'' in terms of the momentum <math>\\vec{p}</math> and the [[rest mass]] ''m'' of a particle. The equation for the mass shell is also often written in terms of the [[four-momentum]]; in [[Einstein notation]] with [[metric signature]] (+,\u2013,\u2013,\u2013) and units where the [[speed of light]] ''c'' = 1, as <math>p^\\mu p_\\mu \\equiv p^2 = m^2</math>. In the literature, one may also encounter <math>p^\\mu p_\\mu = - m^2</math> if the metric signature used is (\u2013,+,+,+).\n\nThe four-momentum of an exchanged virtual particle <math>X</math> is <math>q_\\mu</math>, with mass <math>q^2 = m_X^2</math>.  The four-momentum  <math>q_\\mu</math> of the virtual particle is the difference between the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles.\n\nVirtual particles corresponding to internal [[propagator]]s in a [[Feynman diagram]] are in general allowed to be off shell, but the amplitude for the process will diminish depending on how far off shell they are. This is because the <math>q^2</math>-dependence of the propagator is determined by the four-momenta of the incoming and outgoing particles. The propagator typically has [[mathematical singularity|singularities]] on the mass shell.<ref>Thomson, M. (2013). ''Modern particle physics''. Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-1107034266}}, p.119.</ref>\n\nWhen speaking of the propagator, negative values for ''E'' that satisfy the equation are thought of as being on shell, though the classical theory does not allow negative values for the energy of a particle.  This is because the propagator incorporates into one expression the cases in which the particle carries energy in one direction, and in which its [[antiparticle]] carries energy in the other direction; negative and positive on-shell ''E'' then simply represent opposing flows of positive energy.\n\n==Scalar field ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2019}}\nAn example comes from considering a [[scalar field theory|scalar field]] in ''D''-dimensional [[Minkowski space]].

From 1877 to 1891, George served in the [[Royal Navy]], until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. On the death of his grandmother in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He became [[king-emperor]] on his father's death in 1910.\n\nGeorge V's reign saw the rise of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Irish republicanism]], and the [[Indian independence movement]], all of which radically changed the political landscape. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the elected [[British House of Commons]] over the unelected [[House of Lords]]. As a result of the [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), the empires of his first cousins [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] fell, while the [[British Empire]] expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the [[House of Windsor]], which he renamed from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] as a result of anti-German public sentiment. In 1924 he appointed the first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[First MacDonald ministry|ministry]] and in 1931 the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]] recognised the dominions of the Empire as separate, independent states within the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nGeorge was born on 3 June 1865, in [[Marlborough House]], London. He was the second son of [[Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. His father was the eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and his mother was the eldest daughter of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. He was baptised at [[Windsor Castle]] on 7 July 1865 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Longley]].<ref>His godparents were the [[George V of Hanover|King of Hanover]] (Queen Victoria's cousin, for whom [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] stood proxy); the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (Prince Albert's brother, for whom the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]], stood proxy); the [[Ernst Leopold, 4th Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]] (the Prince of Wales's half-cousin); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (the Princess of Wales's brother, for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], stood proxy); the [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (George's maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's cousin); the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's aunt, for whom George's aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine]] (George's aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] stood proxy) (''The Times'' (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p. 12).</ref>\n\n[[File:King George V of the United Kingdom as a boy, 1870.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|George as a young boy, 1870]]\nAs a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. George was only 17&nbsp;months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. [[John Neale Dalton]] was appointed as their tutor in 1871. Neither Albert Victor nor George excelled intellectually.<ref>Clay, p. 39; Sinclair, pp. 46\u201347</ref> As their father thought that the navy was \"the very best possible training for any boy\",<ref>Sinclair, pp. 49\u201350</ref> in September 1877, when George was 12&nbsp;years old, both brothers joined the cadet training ship [[HMS Prince of Wales (1860)|HMS ''Britannia'']] at [[Dartmouth, Devon]].<ref>Clay, p. 71; Rose, p. 7</ref>\n\nFor three years from 1879, the royal brothers served on {{HMS|Bacchante|1876|6}}, accompanied by Dalton. They toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Caribbean]], South Africa and Australia, and visited [[Norfolk, Virginia]], as well as South America, the [[Mediterranean]], Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm,<ref>Rose, p. 13</ref> and was received in an audience by the [[Emperor Meiji]]; George and his brother presented [[Empress Haruko]] with two [[wallabies]] from Australia.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912 ''(Columbia University Press, 2002) pp. 350\u2013351</ref> Dalton wrote an account of their journey entitled ''The Cruise of HMS Bacchante''.<ref>Rose, p. 14; Sinclair, p. 55</ref> Between Melbourne and Sydney, Dalton recorded a sighting of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', a mythical ghost ship.<ref>Rose, p. 11</ref> When they returned to Britain, the Queen complained that her grandsons could not speak French or German, and so they spent six months in [[Lausanne]] in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to learn another language.<ref>Clay, p. 92; Rose, pp. 15\u201316</ref> After Lausanne, the brothers were separated; Albert Victor attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], while George continued in the [[Royal Navy]]. He travelled the world, visiting many areas of the British Empire. During his naval career he commanded ''Torpedo Boat 79'' in home waters then {{HMS|Thrush|1889|6}} on the North America station, before his last active service in command of [[HMS Melampus (1890)|HMS ''Melampus'']] in 1891\u201392. From then on, his naval rank was largely honorary.<ref>Sinclair, p. 69</ref>\n\n==Marriage==\n{{see also|Wedding of Prince George, Duke of York, and Princess Mary of Teck}}\n[[File:Kinggeorgev1928.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Pale-eyed young man with a beard and moustache|George, 1893]]\n\nAs a young man destined to serve in the navy, Prince George served for many years under the command of his uncle, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh]], who was stationed in [[Malta]]. There, he grew close to and fell in love with his cousin, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but his mother and aunt\u2014the Princess of Wales and [[Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh]]\u2014opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. The Duchess, the only daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia]], resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]], the future [[King of Romania]], in 1893.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n[[File:Princess Mary of Teck wedding dress 1893 no2.jpg|thumb|right|George and Mary on their wedding day]]\n\nIn November 1891, George's elder brother, Albert Victor, became engaged to his [[second cousin once removed]] [[Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]], known as \"May\" within the family.<ref>Rose, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Her parents were [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck]] (a member of a [[morganatic]], cadet branch of the [[House of W\u00fcrttemberg]]), and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], a male-line granddaughter of [[King George&nbsp;III]] and a first cousin of Queen Victoria.<ref>Rose, p. 29</ref>\n\nOn 14 January 1892, six weeks after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of [[pneumonia]], leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father. George had only just recovered from a serious illness himself, after being confined to bed for six weeks with [[typhoid fever]], the disease that was thought to have killed his grandfather Prince Albert.<ref>Rose, pp. 20\u201321, 24</ref> Queen Victoria still regarded Princess May<!--Yes, May! Please do not change--> as a suitable match for her grandson, and George and May grew close during their shared period of mourning.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 230\u2013231</ref>\n\nA year after Albert Victor's death, George proposed to May<!--Yes, May! Please do not change--> and was accepted. They married on 6 July 1893 at the [[Chapel Royal]] in [[St James's Palace]], London. Throughout their lives, they remained devoted to each other. George was, on his own admission, unable to express his feelings easily in speech, but they often exchanged loving letters and notes of endearment.<ref>Sinclair, p. 178</ref>\n\n==Duke of York==\n[[File:George, Duke of York, and his children.jpg|thumb|George with his children, [[Edward VIII|Edward]], [[George VI|Albert]], and [[Mary, Princess Royal and Countess of Harewood|Mary]], photographed by Alexandra in 1899]]\n\nThe death of his elder brother effectively ended George's naval career, as he was now second in line to the throne, after his father.<ref name=\"dnb\">[[Colin Matthew|Matthew, H.

[[Randolph Churchill]] claimed that George was a strict father, to the extent that his children were terrified of him, and that George had remarked to the [[Edward Stanley, 17th Earl of Derby|Earl of Derby]]: \"My father was frightened of his mother, I was frightened of my father, and I am damned well going to see to it that my children are frightened of me.\" In reality, there is no direct source for the quotation and it is likely that George's parenting style was little different from that adopted by most people at the time.<ref>Rose, pp. 53\u201357; Sinclair, p. 93 ''ff''</ref> Whether this was the case or not, his children did seem to resent his strict nature, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester|Prince Henry]] going as far as to describe him as a \"terrible father\" in later years.<ref>Vickers, ch. 18</ref>\n\nThey lived mainly at [[York Cottage]],<ref>Renamed from ''Bachelor's Cottage''</ref> a relatively small house in [[Sandringham, Norfolk]], where their way of life mirrored that of a comfortable middle-class family rather than royalty.<ref>Clay, p. 154; Nicolson, p. 51; Rose, p. 97</ref> George preferred a simple, almost quiet, life, in marked contrast to the lively social life pursued by his father. His official biographer, [[Harold Nicolson]], later despaired of George's time as Duke of York, writing: \"He may be all right as a young midshipman and a wise old king, but when he was Duke of York&nbsp;... he did nothing at all but kill [''i.e.'' shoot] animals and stick in stamps.\"<ref>[[Harold Nicolson]]'s diary quoted in Sinclair, p. 107</ref> George was an avid [[stamp collector]], which Nicolson disparaged,<ref>Nicolson's ''Comments 1944\u20131948'', quoted in Rose, p. 42</ref> but George played a large role in building the [[Royal Philatelic Collection]] into the most comprehensive collection of United Kingdom and Commonwealth stamps in the world, in some cases setting record purchase prices for items.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.royal.gov.uk/The%20Royal%20Collection%20and%20other%20collections/TheRoyalPhilatelicCollection/History.aspx|title=The Royal Philatelic Collection|publisher=Official website of the British Monarchy|accessdate=1 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 1894, George's uncle [[Alexander III of Russia]] died.

Their tour included Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the [[Colony of Newfoundland]]. The tour was designed by [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]] with the support of Prime Minister [[Lord Salisbury]] to reward the Dominions for their participation in the [[South African War]] of 1899\u20131902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape [[Afrikaner]]s resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.<ref>{{citation|first=Phillip|last=Buckner|title=The Royal Tour of 1901 and the Construction of an Imperial Identity in South Africa|journal=South African Historical Journal|date=November 1999|volume=41|pages=324\u2013348|doi=10.1080/02582479908671897}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Tom Roberts]] of the Duke opening the first [[Parliament of Australia]] on 9 May 1901]]\n\nIn Australia, the Duke opened the first session of the [[Australian Parliament]] upon the [[Constitutional history of Australia|creation of the Commonwealth of Australia]].<ref>Rose, pp. 43\u201344</ref> In New Zealand, he praised the military values, bravery, loyalty, and obedience to duty of New Zealanders, and the tour gave New Zealand a chance to show off its progress, especially in its adoption of up-to-date British standards in communications and the processing industries.

The King's paternal grandfather was [[Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]; consequently, the King and his children bore the titles Prince and Princess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke and Duchess of Saxony. Queen Mary, although British like her mother, was the daughter of the [[Duke of Teck]], a descendant of the German [[Dukes of W\u00fcrttemberg]]. The King had brothers-in-law and cousins who were British subjects but who bore German titles such as Duke and Duchess of Teck, Prince and Princess of Battenberg, and Prince and Princess of Schleswig-Holstein.

The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class\u2014a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Prochaska | first1 = Frank | year = 1999 | title = George V and Republicanism, 1917\u20131919 | url = | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201351 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/10.1.27}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last1 = Kirk | first1 = Neville | year = 2005 | title = The Conditions of Royal Rule: Australian and British Socialist and Labour Attitudes to the Monarchy, 1901\u201311 | url = | journal = Social History | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 64\u201388 | doi=10.1080/0307102042000337297}}</ref>\n\nThe years between 1922 and 1929 saw frequent changes in government. In 1924, George appointed the first Labour Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three major parties. George's tactful and understanding reception of the first Labour government (which lasted less than a year) allayed the suspicions of the party's sympathisers. During the [[General Strike of 1926]] the King advised the government of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] against taking inflammatory action,<ref>Nicolson, p. 419; Rose, pp. 341\u2013342</ref> and took exception to suggestions that the strikers were \"revolutionaries\" saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>Rose, p. 340; Sinclair, p. 105</ref>\n\n[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|alt=A group pose of eight men in smart evening wear.

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] formalised the Dominion's legislative independence<ref>Rose, p. 348</ref> and established that the succession to the throne could not be changed unless all the Parliaments of the Dominions as well as the Parliament at Westminster agreed.<ref name=\"dnb\"/> The Statute's preamble described the monarch as \"the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations\", who were \"united by a common allegiance\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/introduction|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of a [[Great Depression|world financial crisis]], the King encouraged the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin,<ref name=\"Rose, pp. 373\u2013379\">Rose, pp. 373\u2013379</ref><ref>[[Vernon Bogdanor]] argues that George V played a crucial and active role in the political crisis of August\u2013October 1931, and was a determining influence on Prime Minister MacDonald, in Bogdanor, Vernon (1991) [http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/1/1.full.pdf+html \"1931 Revisited: The Constitutional Aspects\"], ''Twentieth Century British History'' '''2''' (1): 1\u201325 (Subscription required).

[[Emperor of India]], from 6 May 1910 until his death in 1936.\n\nBorn during the reign of his grandmother [[Queen Victoria]], George was third in the [[succession to the British throne|line of succession]] behind his father, [[Prince Albert Edward]], and his own elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. From 1877 to 1891, George served in the [[Royal Navy]], until the unexpected death of his elder brother in early 1892 put him directly in line for the throne. On the death of his grandmother in 1901, George's father ascended the throne as Edward VII, and George was created [[Prince of Wales]]. He became [[king-emperor]] on his father's death in 1910.\n\nGeorge V's reign saw the rise of [[socialism]], [[communism]], [[fascism]], [[Irish republicanism]], and the [[Indian independence movement]], all of which radically changed the political landscape. The [[Parliament Act 1911]] established the supremacy of the elected [[British House of Commons]] over the unelected [[House of Lords]]. As a result of the [[First World War]] (1914\u20131918), the empires of his first cousins [[Nicholas II of Russia]] and [[Wilhelm II of Germany]] fell, while the [[British Empire]] expanded to its greatest effective extent. In 1917, George became the first monarch of the [[House of Windsor]], which he renamed from the [[House of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] as a result of anti-German public sentiment.

He had smoking-related health problems throughout much of his later reign and at his death was succeeded by his eldest son, [[Edward VIII]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nGeorge was born on 3 June 1865, in [[Marlborough House]], London. He was the second son of [[Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]], and [[Alexandra, Princess of Wales]]. His father was the eldest son of [[Queen Victoria]] and [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], and his mother was the eldest daughter of [[King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. He was baptised at [[Windsor Castle]] on 7 July 1865 by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Charles Longley]].<ref>His godparents were the [[George V of Hanover|King of Hanover]] (Queen Victoria's cousin, for whom [[Prince Edward of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach]] stood proxy); the [[Ernest II, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]] (Prince Albert's brother, for whom the [[Lord President of the Council]], [[Granville Leveson-Gower, 2nd Earl Granville|Earl Granville]], stood proxy); the [[Ernst Leopold, 4th Prince of Leiningen|Prince of Leiningen]] (the Prince of Wales's half-cousin); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (the Princess of Wales's brother, for whom the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[John Townshend, 1st Earl Sydney|Viscount Sydney]], stood proxy); the [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen of Denmark]] (George's maternal grandmother, for whom Queen Victoria stood proxy); the [[Prince George, Duke of Cambridge|Duke of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's cousin); the [[Princess Augusta of Hesse-Kassel|Duchess of Cambridge]] (Queen Victoria's aunt, for whom George's aunt [[Princess Helena of the United Kingdom|Princess Helena]] stood proxy); and [[Princess Louis of Hesse and by Rhine]] (George's aunt, for whom her sister [[Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll|Princess Louise]] stood proxy) (''The Times'' (London), Saturday, 8 July 1865, p. 12).</ref>\n\n[[File:King George V of the United Kingdom as a boy, 1870.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Boy wearing a sailor suit|George as a young boy, 1870]]\nAs a younger son of the Prince of Wales, there was little expectation that George would become king. He was third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother, [[Prince Albert Victor]]. George was only 17&nbsp;months younger than Albert Victor, and the two princes were educated together. [[John Neale Dalton]] was appointed as their tutor in 1871.

They toured the colonies of the [[British Empire]] in the [[Caribbean]], South Africa and Australia, and visited [[Norfolk, Virginia]], as well as South America, the [[Mediterranean]], Egypt, and East Asia. In 1881 on a visit to Japan, George had a local artist tattoo a blue and red dragon on his arm,<ref>Rose, p. 13</ref> and was received in an audience by the [[Emperor Meiji]]; George and his brother presented [[Empress Haruko]] with two [[wallabies]] from Australia.<ref>Keene, Donald ''Emperor of Japan: Meiji and His World, 1852\u20131912 ''(Columbia University Press, 2002) pp. 350\u2013351</ref> Dalton wrote an account of their journey entitled ''The Cruise of HMS Bacchante''.<ref>Rose, p. 14; Sinclair, p. 55</ref> Between Melbourne and Sydney, Dalton recorded a sighting of the ''[[Flying Dutchman]]'', a mythical ghost ship.<ref>Rose, p. 11</ref> When they returned to Britain, the Queen complained that her grandsons could not speak French or German, and so they spent six months in [[Lausanne]] in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to learn another language.<ref>Clay, p. 92; Rose, pp. 15\u201316</ref> After Lausanne, the brothers were separated; Albert Victor attended [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], while George continued in the [[Royal Navy]].

During his naval career he commanded ''Torpedo Boat 79'' in home waters then {{HMS|Thrush|1889|6}} on the North America station, before his last active service in command of [[HMS Melampus (1890)|HMS ''Melampus'']] in 1891\u201392.

There, he grew close to and fell in love with his cousin, Princess [[Marie of Edinburgh]]. His grandmother, father and uncle all approved the match, but his mother and aunt\u2014the Princess of Wales and [[Maria Alexandrovna, Duchess of Edinburgh]]\u2014opposed it. The Princess of Wales thought the family was too pro-German, and the Duchess of Edinburgh disliked England. The Duchess, the only daughter of [[Alexander II of Russia]], resented the fact that, as the wife of a younger son of the British sovereign, she had to yield precedence to George's mother, the Princess of Wales, whose father had been a minor German prince before being called unexpectedly to the throne of Denmark. Guided by her mother, Marie refused George when he proposed to her. She married [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand]], the future [[King of Romania]], in 1893.<ref>Pope-Hennessy, pp. 250\u2013251</ref>\n\n[[File:Princess Mary of Teck wedding dress 1893 no2.jpg|thumb|right|George and Mary on their wedding day]]\n\nIn November 1891, George's elder brother, Albert Victor, became engaged to his [[second cousin once removed]] [[Princess Victoria Mary of Teck]], known as \"May\" within the family.<ref>Rose, pp. 22\u201323</ref> Her parents were [[Prince Francis, Duke of Teck]] (a member of a [[morganatic]], cadet branch of the [[House of W\u00fcrttemberg]]), and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge]], a male-line granddaughter of [[King George&nbsp;III]] and a first cousin of Queen Victoria.<ref>Rose, p. 29</ref>\n\nOn 14 January 1892, six weeks after the formal engagement, Albert Victor died of [[pneumonia]], leaving George second in line to the throne, and likely to succeed after his father.

Their tour included Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Mauritius, South Africa, Canada, and the [[Colony of Newfoundland]]. The tour was designed by [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Joseph Chamberlain]] with the support of Prime Minister [[Lord Salisbury]] to reward the Dominions for their participation in the [[South African War]] of 1899\u20131902. George presented thousands of specially designed South African War medals to colonial troops. In South Africa, the royal party met civic leaders, African leaders, and Boer prisoners, and was greeted by elaborate decorations, expensive gifts, and fireworks displays. Despite this, not all residents responded favourably to the tour. Many white Cape [[Afrikaner]]s resented the display and expense, the war having weakened their capacity to reconcile their Afrikaner-Dutch culture with their status as British subjects. Critics in the English-language press decried the enormous cost at a time when families faced severe hardship.<ref>{{citation|first=Phillip|last=Buckner|title=The Royal Tour of 1901 and the Construction of an Imperial Identity in South Africa|journal=South African Historical Journal|date=November 1999|volume=41|pages=324\u2013348|doi=10.1080/02582479908671897}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Opening of the first parliament.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Tom Roberts]] of the Duke opening the first [[Parliament of Australia]] on 9 May 1901]]\n\nIn Australia, the Duke opened the first session of the [[Australian Parliament]] upon the [[Constitutional history of Australia|creation of the Commonwealth of Australia]].<ref>Rose, pp. 43\u201344</ref> In New Zealand, he praised the military values, bravery, loyalty, and obedience to duty of New Zealanders, and the tour gave New Zealand a chance to show off its progress, especially in its adoption of up-to-date British standards in communications and the processing industries.

The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class\u2014a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour party]] politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.<ref>{{citation | last1 = Prochaska | first1 = Frank | year = 1999 | title = George V and Republicanism, 1917\u20131919 | url = | journal = Twentieth Century British History | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201351 | doi=10.1093/tcbh/10.1.27}}</ref><ref>{{citation | last1 = Kirk | first1 = Neville | year = 2005 | title = The Conditions of Royal Rule: Australian and British Socialist and Labour Attitudes to the Monarchy, 1901\u201311 | url = | journal = Social History | volume = 30 | issue = 1| pages = 64\u201388 | doi=10.1080/0307102042000337297}}</ref>\n\nThe years between 1922 and 1929 saw frequent changes in government. In 1924, George appointed the first Labour Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], in the absence of a clear majority for any one of the three major parties. George's tactful and understanding reception of the first Labour government (which lasted less than a year) allayed the suspicions of the party's sympathisers. During the [[General Strike of 1926]] the King advised the government of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Stanley Baldwin]] against taking inflammatory action,<ref>Nicolson, p. 419; Rose, pp. 341\u2013342</ref> and took exception to suggestions that the strikers were \"revolutionaries\" saying, \"Try living on their wages before you judge them.\"<ref>Rose, p. 340; Sinclair, p. 105</ref>\n\n[[File:ImperialConference.jpg|thumb|alt=A group pose of eight men in smart evening wear.

The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] formalised the Dominion's legislative independence<ref>Rose, p. 348</ref> and established that the succession to the throne could not be changed unless all the Parliaments of the Dominions as well as the Parliament at Westminster agreed.<ref name=\"dnb\"/> The Statute's preamble described the monarch as \"the symbol of the free association of the members of the British Commonwealth of Nations\", who were \"united by a common allegiance\".<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Geo5/22-23/4/introduction|title=Statute of Westminster 1931|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=20 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nIn the wake of a [[Great Depression|world financial crisis]], the King encouraged the formation of a [[National Government (United Kingdom)|National Government]] in 1931 led by MacDonald and Baldwin,<ref name=\"Rose, pp. 373\u2013379\">Rose, pp. 373\u2013379</ref><ref>[[Vernon Bogdanor]] argues that George V played a crucial and active role in the political crisis of August\u2013October 1931, and was a determining influence on Prime Minister MacDonald, in Bogdanor, Vernon (1991) [http://tcbh.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/1/1.full.pdf+html \"1931 Revisited: The Constitutional Aspects\"], ''Twentieth Century British History'' '''2''' (1): 1\u201325 (Subscription required).

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and the sequel to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' (1994). The story follows the [[player character]]s, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna]], in their quests to save Angel Island; Sonic tries to prevent [[Doctor Robotnik]] from relaunching his orbital weapon, the Death Egg, while Knuckles scuffles with Robotnik's minion, EggRobo. The game takes place across six [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] in which the player collects [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and fights [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]].\n\nThe Japanese members of [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed ''Sonic & Knuckles'' simultaneously alongside ''Sonic 3''. The two were intended to be released as a single game, but time constraints and small [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] sizes forced Sega split the project in two. The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge features \"lock-on technology\" that allows the game to connect to the ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' or ''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' cartridges, combining elements from either game. This feature was implemented so the game could be experienced as intended.\n\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] on October 18, 1994. It sold 1.24 million copies and received positive reviews; critics were impressed with the [[replay value]] and lock-on technology despite its similarity to ''Sonic 3''. Alongside ''Sonic 3'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). It has also been rereleased through [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog compilations|various compilations]] and on digital platforms such as [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]], while it was bundled with ''Sonic 3'' as intended on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Sonic the Hedgehog 3#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog 3}}\n[[File:Sonic & Knuckles gameplay 002.png|thumb|left|Knuckles explores Mushroom Hill, the first zone of ''Sonic & Knuckles'']]\nSince ''Sonic & Knuckles'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' were initially developed as one game, their gameplay is similar: both are [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformers]] with similar [[level design]], graphics, and game mechanics. However, in ''Sonic & Knuckles'', unlike in ''Sonic 3'', the player chooses either Sonic or Knuckles at the title screen,<ref name=\"ign\" /> [[Tails (character)|Miles \"Tails\" Prower]] is not available to select, and the player cannot control two characters together. There is also no [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode or save feature.<ref name=\"m2224\" />\n\nThe [[player character]] moves through six [[level (video gaming)|levels]], each divided into two acts.<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201315.</ref> The first act of each level ends with a [[miniboss]] fight with one of [[Doctor Eggman|Dr. Robotnik]]'s robots,<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 9.</ref> while the second ends with a regular [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik (or EggRobo in Knuckles' campaign).<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 15.</ref> Sonic and Knuckles traverse levels differently; Sonic can jump slightly higher and has access to unique shield abilities, whereas Knuckles can glide and climb most walls. The levels also include [[cutscene]]s that differ based on the character selected, as Sonic and Knuckles are opponents for most of the game.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nThe game contains two types of bonus stages accessed by passing a [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]] with at least 20 [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]]. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]. The second type involves bouncing around a room with a [[slot machine]] in its center with the intention of winning [[1-up|extra lives]] and [[power-up]]s.<ref name=\"m1618\">''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16\u201318.</ref>\n\nSpecial Stages are entered by finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player is placed in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment and must turn all of a number of blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones. Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on them make the player walk backwards in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.<ref name=\"m1618\" />\n\n=== Lock-on technology ===\n{{redirect|Blue Sphere|the video game in the Star Ocean series|Star Ocean: Blue Sphere}}\n\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' features \"lock-on technology\" that allows players to open the hatch on the cartridge and insert a second cartridge. When ''Sonic 3'' is inserted, the player can play through both games as one, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. This features several changes to the games,<ref name=\"ign\" /> such as slightly altered level layouts,<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 22.</ref> the ability to play through ''Sonic 3'' levels as Knuckles<ref name=\"ign\" /> or ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels as Tails, and the ability to save progress in ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels.<ref name=\"m2224\">''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 22\u201324.</ref> Additionally, combining the cartridges is the only way to collect \"Super Emeralds\", earned by accessing Special Stages in the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels after collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds from ''Sonic 3''. When all Super Emeralds have been collected, Sonic, Knuckles, and Tails can transform into Hyper Sonic, Hyper Knuckles, and Super Tails respectively, each with unique abilities.<ref name=\"cheats\">{{cite web|title=Sonic And Knuckles Collection Cheats|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/cheats/sonic-and-knuckles-collection|publisher=[[Game Revolution]]|accessdate=January 26, 2015}}</ref> \n\nInserting ''Sonic 2'' unlocks ''Knuckles the Echidna in Sonic the Hedgehog 2'', wherein the player can play ''Sonic 2'' using Knuckles' abilities.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nIf the player attaches any other Genesis game released prior to ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a screen with Sonic, Tails, Knuckles, and Robotnik stating \"No Way!\" is displayed.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sonic & Knuckles Cheats and Overview|url=http://www.gamerevolution.com/cheats/sonic-and-knuckles|publisher=Game Revolution|accessdate=January 27, 2015}}</ref> From here, the player can also access a minigame based on ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} and ''Sonic & Knuckles''{{'s}} Chaos Emerald Special Stages.<ref name=\"allgame\" /> The attached cartridge determines the Special Stage layout. If the player attaches the original ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'',<ref name=\"allgame\" /> they are able to access all of the possible variations of the special stages, each with a unique level number and corresponding [[Password (video gaming)|password]]. This game is named ''Blue Sphere'' in ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]''.<ref name=\"cheats\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nThe story begins immediately after the events of ''Sonic 3'', where Dr. Robotnik's orbital weapon, the Death Egg, is damaged in a battle with Sonic and crash-lands back onto Angel Island. Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.\n\nKnuckles' story, which takes place after the events of Sonic's campaign, begins in Mushroom Hill,{{efn|When connected to ''Sonic 3'', Knuckles' campaign begins in Angel Island, rather than Mushroom Hill.}} where he is relaxing with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him through more difficult versions of most of the same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:SegaGenesis-Sonic+Knuckles-lock-on-open.jpg|thumb|The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] features a \"lock-on\" adapter that allows it to be physically attached to other Genesis cartridges.]]\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was developed by the Japanese members of [[Sega Technical Institute]] (STI).<ref name=\"den\">{{cite web|last1=Horowitz|first1=Ken|title=Developer's Den: Sega Technical Institute|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/06/developers-den-sega-technical-institute/|website=Sega-16|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=June 11, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"gamestm\">{{cite journal|title=Sonic 3 & Knuckles - Behind the Scenes|journal=[[GamesTM]]|issue=60|pages=140\u2013144|url=http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_3_%26_Knuckles_-_Behind_the_Scenes_(GamesTM_issue_60)}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Story of Sonic the Hedgehog |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |issue=158 |year=2016 |first=Nick |last=Thorpe |pages=18\u201325}}</ref> It and ''Sonic 3'' were originally planned as a single game;<ref name=dev1>{{cite web|title=Sonic & Knuckles Development overview|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/02/sonic_and_knuckles_virtual_console|website=NintendoLife|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref> according to designer [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]], the team \"really wanted to hit a home run\", with larger stages that took longer to develop.<ref name=\"GI: Two\"/> As [[ROM cartridge]]s were too small to contain the game and publisher [[Sega]] wanted it released in time for a promotional deal with [[McDonald's]], ''Sonic 3'' was split in two,<ref name=\"GI: Two\">{{cite web |last1=Shea |first1=Brian |title=How Sonic 3 Became Two Separate Games |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/10/10/how-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-became-two-games-sonic-and-knuckles-lock-on-technology.aspx |website=[[Game Informer]] |date=October 10, 2016}}</ref> with ''Sonic & Knuckles'' as the second part of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/articles/654/654750p4.html|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|title=Sega's Yuji Naka Talks!|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDespite the split, the developers wanted the games to feel like a single experience.<ref name=\"GI: Two\"/> According to Roger Hector, vice president and general manager of STI, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of ''Sonic & Knuckles'', between the releases of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=When Knuckles Met Sonic|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=20}}</ref> The team explained their situation to Sega's hardware division, which gave them the lock-on adapter. The team knew that players would likely use the adapter to insert games beside ''Sonic 3'', so they implemented the ''Blue Sphere'' minigame for most games. They made Knuckles playable in ''Sonic 2'' if that game was inserted because the team found his playstyle suited its levels. However, the team did not implement the same feature for the original ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' as it \"didn't really feel right\".<ref name=\"GI: Two\"/>\n\nPrior to the release of ''Sonic & Knuckles'' in North America, [[Blockbuster Video]] and [[MTV]] co-sponsored a tournament in which children were allowed to play a pre-release version.

[[platform game]] developed and published by [[Sega]]. It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and the sequel to ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' (1994). The story follows the [[player character]]s, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic the Hedgehog]] and [[Knuckles the Echidna]], in their quests to save Angel Island; Sonic tries to prevent [[Doctor Robotnik]] from relaunching his orbital weapon, the Death Egg, while Knuckles scuffles with Robotnik's minion, EggRobo. The game takes place across six [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] in which the player collects [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and fights [[Boss (video gaming)|bosses]].\n\nThe Japanese members of [[Sega Technical Institute]] developed ''Sonic & Knuckles'' simultaneously alongside ''Sonic 3''. The two were intended to be released as a single game, but time constraints and small [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] sizes forced Sega split the project in two. The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge features \"lock-on technology\" that allows the game to connect to the ''Sonic the Hedgehog 2'' or ''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' cartridges, combining elements from either game. This feature was implemented so the game could be experienced as intended.\n\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] on October 18, 1994. It sold 1.24 million copies and received positive reviews; critics were impressed with the [[replay value]] and lock-on technology despite its similarity to ''Sonic 3''. Alongside ''Sonic 3'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). It has also been rereleased through [[List of Sonic the Hedgehog compilations|various compilations]] and on digital platforms such as [[Xbox Live Arcade]] and the [[Wii]]'s [[Virtual Console]], while it was bundled with ''Sonic 3'' as intended on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].\n\n== Gameplay ==\n{{See also|Sonic the Hedgehog 3#Gameplay|l1=Gameplay of Sonic the Hedgehog 3}}\n[[File:Sonic & Knuckles gameplay 002.png|thumb|left|Knuckles explores Mushroom Hill, the first zone of ''Sonic & Knuckles'']]\nSince ''Sonic & Knuckles'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 3]]'' were initially developed as one game, their gameplay is similar: both are [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformers]] with similar [[level design]], graphics, and game mechanics. However, in ''Sonic & Knuckles'', unlike in ''Sonic 3'', the player chooses either Sonic or Knuckles at the title screen,<ref name=\"ign\" /> [[Tails (character)|Miles \"Tails\" Prower]] is not available to select, and the player cannot control two characters together. There is also no [[multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode or save feature.<ref name=\"m2224\" />\n\nThe [[player character]] moves through six [[level (video gaming)|levels]], each divided into two acts.<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201315.</ref> The first act of each level ends with a [[miniboss]] fight with one of [[Doctor Eggman|Dr. Robotnik]]'s robots,<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 9.</ref> while the second ends with a regular [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik (or EggRobo in Knuckles' campaign).<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 15.</ref> Sonic and Knuckles traverse levels differently; Sonic can jump slightly higher and has access to unique shield abilities, whereas Knuckles can glide and climb most walls. The levels also include [[cutscene]]s that differ based on the character selected, as Sonic and Knuckles are opponents for most of the game.<ref name=\"ign\" />\n\nThe game contains two types of bonus stages accessed by passing a [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]] with at least 20 [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]]. The first type has Sonic or Knuckles orbit floating, glowing spheres, jetting off each one when a button is pressed, while a fence of light approaches from the bottom and will remove the player from the stage if touched. Collecting 50 rings in this stage earns the player a [[continue (video gaming)|continue]]. The second type involves bouncing around a room with a [[slot machine]] in its center with the intention of winning [[1-up|extra lives]] and [[power-up]]s.<ref name=\"m1618\">''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16\u201318.</ref>\n\nSpecial Stages are entered by finding giant rings hidden in secret passageways: the player is placed in a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] environment and must turn all of a number of blue spheres red by running through them, but must avoid all red spheres, including formerly blue ones. Yellow spheres bounce the player long distances, and white spheres with red stars on them make the player walk backwards in the opposite direction. Completing a Special Stage earns the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; collecting all seven Emeralds allows the player to turn into [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] or Super Knuckles, more powerful versions of the characters.<ref name=\"m1618\" />\n\n=== Lock-on technology ===\n{{redirect|Blue Sphere|the video game in the Star Ocean series|Star Ocean: Blue Sphere}}\n\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' features \"lock-on technology\" that allows players to open the hatch on the cartridge and insert a second cartridge. When ''Sonic 3'' is inserted, the player can play through both games as one, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. This features several changes to the games,<ref name=\"ign\" /> such as slightly altered level layouts,<ref>''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 22.</ref> the ability to play through ''Sonic 3'' levels as Knuckles<ref name=\"ign\" /> or ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels as Tails, and the ability to save progress in ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels.<ref name=\"m2224\">''Sonic & Knuckles'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 22\u201324.</ref> Additionally, combining the cartridges is the only way to collect \"Super Emeralds\", earned by accessing Special Stages in the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' levels after collecting all seven Chaos Emeralds from ''Sonic 3''.

Sonic travels through each zone looking to retrieve the Chaos Emeralds to defeat Robotnik, and once again comes into conflict with Knuckles, who believes Sonic is trying to steal the Emeralds for himself. In Hidden Palace Zone, Sonic fights and defeats Knuckles. The two hear a disturbance outside of the chamber, and go out to find Dr. Robotnik stealing the Master Emerald, the secret to the island's levitation powers. Knuckles attempts to attack Robotnik, but is electrically shocked in the process, and is trapped with Sonic in an underground passage. Knuckles, realizing Sonic is on his side, shows him a portal that leads them to Sky Sanctuary, where the Death Egg is relaunching. Sonic proceeds to infiltrate the Death Egg, and defeats Robotnik as Super Sonic.\n\nKnuckles' story, which takes place after the events of Sonic's campaign, begins in Mushroom Hill,{{efn|When connected to ''Sonic 3'', Knuckles' campaign begins in Angel Island, rather than Mushroom Hill.}} where he is relaxing with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him through more difficult versions of most of the same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. If all the Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.\n\n== Development and release ==\n[[File:SegaGenesis-Sonic+Knuckles-lock-on-open.jpg|thumb|The ''Sonic & Knuckles'' [[ROM cartridge|cartridge]] features a \"lock-on\" adapter that allows it to be physically attached to other Genesis cartridges.]]\n''Sonic & Knuckles'' was developed by the Japanese members of [[Sega Technical Institute]] (STI).<ref name=\"den\">{{cite web|last1=Horowitz|first1=Ken|title=Developer's Den: Sega Technical Institute|url=http://www.sega-16.com/2007/06/developers-den-sega-technical-institute/|website=Sega-16|accessdate=15 March 2018|date=June 11, 2007}}</ref><ref name=\"gamestm\">{{cite journal|title=Sonic 3 & Knuckles - Behind the Scenes|journal=[[GamesTM]]|issue=60|pages=140\u2013144|url=http://info.sonicretro.org/Sonic_3_%26_Knuckles_-_Behind_the_Scenes_(GamesTM_issue_60)}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Story of Sonic the Hedgehog |magazine=[[Retro Gamer]] |publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]] |issue=158 |year=2016 |first=Nick |last=Thorpe |pages=18\u201325}}</ref> It and ''Sonic 3'' were originally planned as a single game;<ref name=dev1>{{cite web|title=Sonic & Knuckles Development overview|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/2010/02/sonic_and_knuckles_virtual_console|website=NintendoLife|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref> according to designer [[Takashi Iizuka (game designer)|Takashi Iizuka]], the team \"really wanted to hit a home run\", with larger stages that took longer to develop.<ref name=\"GI: Two\"/> As [[ROM cartridge]]s were too small to contain the game and publisher [[Sega]] wanted it released in time for a promotional deal with [[McDonald's]], ''Sonic 3'' was split in two,<ref name=\"GI: Two\">{{cite web |last1=Shea |first1=Brian |title=How Sonic 3 Became Two Separate Games |url=https://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2016/10/10/how-sonic-the-hedgehog-3-became-two-games-sonic-and-knuckles-lock-on-technology.aspx |website=[[Game Informer]] |date=October 10, 2016}}</ref> with ''Sonic & Knuckles'' as the second part of the story.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://xbox.gamespy.com/articles/654/654750p4.html|publisher=[[GameSpy]]|title=Sega's Yuji Naka Talks!|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref>\n\nDespite the split, the developers wanted the games to feel like a single experience.<ref name=\"GI: Two\"/> According to Roger Hector, vice president and general manager of STI, the lock-on technology was conceived two and a half years before the release of ''Sonic & Knuckles'', between the releases of ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog (1991 video game)|Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' and ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine|last= |first= |title=When Knuckles Met Sonic|magazine=[[GamePro]]|issue=66|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=January 1995|page=20}}</ref> The team explained their situation to Sega's hardware division, which gave them the lock-on adapter. The team knew that players would likely use the adapter to insert games beside ''Sonic 3'', so they implemented the ''Blue Sphere'' minigame for most games. They made Knuckles playable in ''Sonic 2'' if that game was inserted because the team found his playstyle suited its levels. However, the team did not implement the same feature for the original ''Sonic the Hedgehog'' as it \"didn't really feel right\".<ref name=\"GI: Two\"/>\n\nPrior to the release of ''Sonic & Knuckles'' in North America, [[Blockbuster Video]] and [[MTV]] co-sponsored a tournament in which children were allowed to play a pre-release version.

His mother was Maryna Mokievska (1624\u20131707) (known from 1674\u201375 by her monastic name Maria Magdalena),<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2012/11/21/100727/ \u041d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0456 \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043f\u0438 (At Pechersk is found a burial of Mazepa's mother)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]</ref> and his father was Stefan Adam Mazepa (?-1666). Maryna Mokievska came  from the family of a Cossack officer who fought alongside [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. She gave birth to two children \u2013 Ivan and Oleksandra. Stefan Mazepa served as an Otaman of [[Bila Tserkva]] (1654), a Cossack representative of the King of the Polish-Lithuanian [[Rzecz Pospolita]], and a Czernih\u00f3w [[podczaszy]] (Cup-bearer of Chernihiv, 1662).\n\nIvan Mazepa was educated first in the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], then at a Jesuit college in [[Warsaw]].

At the same time Ivan Mazepa signed the [[Kolomak Articles]], which were based on the [[Hlukhiv Articles]] of [[Demian Mnohohrishny]].\n\nGradually, Mazepa accumulated great wealth, becoming one of Europe's largest land owners. A multitude of churches were built all over Ukraine during his reign in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style. He founded schools and printing houses, and expanded the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], the primary educational institution of Ukraine at the time, to accommodate 2,000 students.\n\nIn 1702, the Cossacks of [[Right-bank Ukraine]], under the leadership of hetman [[Semen Paliy]], began an uprising against [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], which after early successes was defeated. Mazepa convinced Russian Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to allow him to intervene, which he successfully did, taking over major portions of Right-bank Ukraine, while Poland was weakened by an invasion of Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]].\n\n===The Great Northern War===\n{{see also|Campaign of Grodno}}\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, as the [[Russian Empire]] lost significant territory in the [[Great Northern War]], Peter I decided to reform the Russian army and to centralize control over his realm. In Mazepa's opinion, the strengthening of Russia's central power could put at risk the broad autonomy granted to the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654. Attempts to assert control over the Zaporozhian Cossacks included demands of having them fight in any of the tsar's wars, instead of only defending their own land against regional enemies as was agreed to in previous treaties. Now Cossack forces were made to fight in distant wars in [[Livonia]] and [[Lithuania]], leaving their own homes unprotected from the [[Tatars]] and [[Poles]]. Ill-equipped and not properly trained to fight on par with the tactics of modern European armies, Cossacks suffered heavy losses and low morale. The Hetman himself started to feel his post threatened in the face of increasing calls to replace him with one of the abundant generals of the Russian army.\n\n===Change of sides===\nThe last straw in the souring relations with Tsar Peter was his refusal to commit any significant force to defend Ukraine against the Polish King [[Stanislaus Leszczynski]], an ally of [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who threatened to attack the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in 1708. Peter expected that king Charles of Sweden was going to attack and thought that he could spare no forces. In the opinion of Mazepa, this blatantly violated the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], since Russia refused to protect Ukraine's territory and left it to fare on its own. As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Clergy]]'s allegiance to the Tsar. Learning of Mazepa's treason, the Russian army sacked and razed the Cossack Hetmanate capital of [[Baturyn]], killing most of the defending garrison and many common people. The Russian army was ordered to tie the dead Cossacks to crosses and float them down the [[Dnieper River]] to the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThose Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new hetman, [[Ivan Skoropadsky]], on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the [[Zaporizhian Sich]], which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack.\n\n===Decisive battle===\n[[File:Mazepa2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] and [[Mazepa]] at [[Dnieper River]] after the [[Battle of Poltava]]]]\n\nThe Swedish and Russian armies spent the first half of 1709 maneuvering for advantage in the anticipated great battle, and trying to secure the support of the local populace. Finally in June the [[Battle of Poltava]] took place. It was won by Russia and Peter The Great , putting an end to Mazepa's hopes of transferring Ukraine into the control of Sweden, which in a treaty had promised independence to Ukraine. Mazepa fled with [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[fortress]] of [[Bendery]], where Mazepa soon died.\n\nMazepa was buried in Gala\u021bi (now Romania), but his tomb was disturbed several times and eventually lost as a result of the Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe (St. George) Church demolition in 1962.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/cine-fost-cazacul-mazepa-razboinicul-tulbura-europa-300-ani-moarte-rapus-pamant-romanesc-fost-ingropat-sase-ori-1_55df2afef5eaafab2cf9d431/index.html|title=Cine a fost cazacul Mazepa, r\u0103zboinicul care tulbur\u0103 Europa chiar \u015fi dup\u0103 300 de ani de la moarte.

However, others argue that it was Imperial Russia who broke the treaty by not even trying to protect the Cossack homeland during busy fighting abroad while Ukrainian peasants were complaining about the conduct of local [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] troops. Many Cossacks had died while building [[Saint Petersburg]], and the Tsar planned to deploy Cossack troops far from their homeland.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t124cP06gg0C&pg=PA244 A History of Ukraine], [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-7820-9}}, page 244</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/160 Ukraine: A History] by [[Orest Subtelny]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8390-6}}, page 164</ref>\n\n[[File:Ivan Mazepa Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|Mazepa monument in Poltava]]\n\nThe image of a disgraceful traitor persisted throughout Russian and Soviet history. The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] [[anathema]]ised and [[excommunication|excommunicated]] him for political reasons. Until 1869, his name was even added to the list of traitors publicly cursed in Russian churches during the [[Feast of Orthodoxy]] service, along with [[Pugachev]], [[Stenka Razin|Razin]] and [[False Dmitry I]]. Later, a positive view of Mazepa was taboo in the [[Soviet Union]] and considered as a sign of \"Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]\". During the years of [[Perestroika]], however, many historical works saw light that viewed Mazepa differently. After [[Ukraine]]'s independence in 1991, Mazepa was proclaimed a national hero in Ukraine's official historiography and mainstream media,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as he was the first post-Pereyaslav Treaty hetman to take a stand against the Tsar, who failed to abide by the Treaty.

His mother was Maryna Mokievska (1624\u20131707) (known from 1674\u201375 by her monastic name Maria Magdalena),<ref>[http://www.istpravda.com.ua/short/2012/11/21/100727/ \u041d\u0430 \u041f\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0440\u0441\u044c\u043a\u0443 \u0437\u043d\u0430\u0439\u0434\u0435\u043d\u043e \u043c\u043e\u0433\u0438\u043b\u0443 \u043c\u0430\u0442\u0435\u0440\u0456 \u041c\u0430\u0437\u0435\u043f\u0438 (At Pechersk is found a burial of Mazepa's mother)]. [[Ukrayinska Pravda]]</ref> and his father was Stefan Adam Mazepa (?-1666). Maryna Mokievska came  from the family of a Cossack officer who fought alongside [[Bohdan Khmelnytsky]]. She gave birth to two children \u2013 Ivan and Oleksandra. Stefan Mazepa served as an Otaman of [[Bila Tserkva]] (1654), a Cossack representative of the King of the Polish-Lithuanian [[Rzecz Pospolita]], and a Czernih\u00f3w [[podczaszy]] (Cup-bearer of Chernihiv, 1662).\n\nIvan Mazepa was educated first in the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], then at a Jesuit college in [[Warsaw]].

At the same time Ivan Mazepa signed the [[Kolomak Articles]], which were based on the [[Hlukhiv Articles]] of [[Demian Mnohohrishny]].\n\nGradually, Mazepa accumulated great wealth, becoming one of Europe's largest land owners. A multitude of churches were built all over Ukraine during his reign in the [[Ukrainian Baroque]] style. He founded schools and printing houses, and expanded the [[Kyiv-Mohyla Academy]], the primary educational institution of Ukraine at the time, to accommodate 2,000 students.\n\nIn 1702, the Cossacks of [[Right-bank Ukraine]], under the leadership of hetman [[Semen Paliy]], began an uprising against [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]], which after early successes was defeated. Mazepa convinced Russian Tsar [[Peter I of Russia|Peter I]] to allow him to intervene, which he successfully did, taking over major portions of Right-bank Ukraine, while Poland was weakened by an invasion of Swedish king [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]].\n\n===The Great Northern War===\n{{see also|Campaign of Grodno}}\nIn the beginning of the 18th century, as the [[Russian Empire]] lost significant territory in the [[Great Northern War]], Peter I decided to reform the Russian army and to centralize control over his realm. In Mazepa's opinion, the strengthening of Russia's central power could put at risk the broad autonomy granted to the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] under the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]] in 1654. Attempts to assert control over the Zaporozhian Cossacks included demands of having them fight in any of the tsar's wars, instead of only defending their own land against regional enemies as was agreed to in previous treaties. Now Cossack forces were made to fight in distant wars in [[Livonia]] and [[Lithuania]], leaving their own homes unprotected from the [[Tatars]] and [[Poles]]. Ill-equipped and not properly trained to fight on par with the tactics of modern European armies, Cossacks suffered heavy losses and low morale. The Hetman himself started to feel his post threatened in the face of increasing calls to replace him with one of the abundant generals of the Russian army.\n\n===Change of sides===\nThe last straw in the souring relations with Tsar Peter was his refusal to commit any significant force to defend Ukraine against the Polish King [[Stanislaus Leszczynski]], an ally of [[Charles XII of Sweden]], who threatened to attack the [[Cossack Hetmanate]] in 1708. Peter expected that king Charles of Sweden was going to attack and thought that he could spare no forces. In the opinion of Mazepa, this blatantly violated the [[Treaty of Pereyaslav]], since Russia refused to protect Ukraine's territory and left it to fare on its own. As the Swedish and Polish armies advanced towards Ukraine, Mazepa allied with them on 28 October 1708. However, only 3,000 Cossacks followed their Hetman, with the rest remaining loyal to the Tsar. Mazepa's call to arms was further weakened by the [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox Clergy]]'s allegiance to the Tsar. Learning of Mazepa's treason, the Russian army sacked and razed the Cossack Hetmanate capital of [[Baturyn]], killing most of the defending garrison and many common people. The Russian army was ordered to tie the dead Cossacks to crosses and float them down the [[Dnieper River]] to the [[Black Sea]].\n\nThose Cossacks who did not side with Mazepa elected a new hetman, [[Ivan Skoropadsky]], on 11 November 1708. The fear of further reprisals and suspicion of Mazepa's newfound Swedish ally prevented most of Ukraine's population from siding with him. Surprisingly, the only significant support that he gathered came from the [[Zaporizhian Sich]], which, though at odds with the Hetman in the past, considered him and the nobility he represented a lesser evil compared with the Tsar. The Sich Cossacks paid dearly for their support of Mazepa, as Peter The Great ordered the Sich to be razed in 1709 and a decree was issued to execute any active Zaporizhian Cossack.\n\n===Decisive battle===\n[[File:Mazepa2.JPG|thumb|250px|[[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] and [[Mazepa]] at [[Dnieper River]] after the [[Battle of Poltava]]]]\n\nThe Swedish and Russian armies spent the first half of 1709 maneuvering for advantage in the anticipated great battle, and trying to secure the support of the local populace. Finally in June the [[Battle of Poltava]] took place. It was won by Russia and Peter The Great , putting an end to Mazepa's hopes of transferring Ukraine into the control of Sweden, which in a treaty had promised independence to Ukraine. Mazepa fled with [[Charles XII of Sweden|Charles XII]] to the [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] [[fortress]] of [[Bendery]], where Mazepa soon died.\n\nMazepa was buried in Gala\u021bi (now Romania), but his tomb was disturbed several times and eventually lost as a result of the Sf\u00e2ntul Gheorghe (St. George) Church demolition in 1962.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://adevarul.ro/locale/galati/cine-fost-cazacul-mazepa-razboinicul-tulbura-europa-300-ani-moarte-rapus-pamant-romanesc-fost-ingropat-sase-ori-1_55df2afef5eaafab2cf9d431/index.html|title=Cine a fost cazacul Mazepa, r\u0103zboinicul care tulbur\u0103 Europa chiar \u015fi dup\u0103 300 de ani de la moarte.

However, others argue that it was Imperial Russia who broke the treaty by not even trying to protect the Cossack homeland during busy fighting abroad while Ukrainian peasants were complaining about the conduct of local [[Muscovy|Muscovite]] troops. Many Cossacks had died while building [[Saint Petersburg]], and the Tsar planned to deploy Cossack troops far from their homeland.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=t124cP06gg0C&pg=PA244 A History of Ukraine], [[Paul Robert Magocsi]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 1996, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-7820-9}}, page 244</ref><ref>[https://archive.org/details/ukrainehistory00subt_0/page/160 Ukraine: A History] by [[Orest Subtelny]], [[University of Toronto Press]], 2000, {{ISBN|978-0-8020-8390-6}}, page 164</ref>\n\n[[File:Ivan Mazepa Poltava.jpg|thumb|left|Mazepa monument in Poltava]]\n\nThe image of a disgraceful traitor persisted throughout Russian and Soviet history.

Until 1869, his name was even added to the list of traitors publicly cursed in Russian churches during the [[Feast of Orthodoxy]] service, along with [[Pugachev]], [[Stenka Razin|Razin]] and [[False Dmitry I]]. Later, a positive view of Mazepa was taboo in the [[Soviet Union]] and considered as a sign of \"Ukrainian [[bourgeois nationalism]]\". During the years of [[Perestroika]], however, many historical works saw light that viewed Mazepa differently. After [[Ukraine]]'s independence in 1991, Mazepa was proclaimed a national hero in Ukraine's official historiography and mainstream media,{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}} as he was the first post-Pereyaslav Treaty hetman to take a stand against the Tsar, who failed to abide by the Treaty.

However, in 1088 [[William the Conqueror]] created the [[Earl of Warwick#Earls of Warwick; First creation (1088)|Earldom of Warwick]] and thereafter gave Turchil's estates to the [[Normans|Norman]] nobleman [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick]]. The Arden family seems to have remained as tenants of the Earldom, for in 1204 a Thomas Arden held the tenancy. In 1329 Sir Robert Arden was licensed to [[Battlement|crenellate]] Drayton [[manor house]]. The male line of the Arden family ended in 1376 with the death of Sir Giles Arden, whose son had predeceased him. Sir Giles' granddaughters Margaret and Joan were minors, but on reaching their majority and marriage they inherited the Drayton estate.\n\nJoan and her husband surrendered their share of Drayton to Margaret who had married Lewis Greville. The house remained the seat of the Greville family until 1565, when a later Lewis Greville was heavily in debt and sold the manor to one Thomas Webb. By 1588 Thomas Webb had died leaving Drayton to his brother Richard and widow Katherine. Lewis Greville lured Richard Webb to [[Sezincote House]] in [[Gloucestershire]] where Greville got Webb drunk, persuaded him to write a will in Greville's favour and then murdered him. Greville was tried for murder, and because he refused to enter a plea he was executed by pressing instead of hanging.<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\nBy 1598 most of the manor of Drayton belonged to [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope]] of [[Hanwell, Oxfordshire|Hanwell]].<ref name=Lobel-1/> In 1611 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] made Cope [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet]].{{sfn|Lobel|Crossley|1969|pp=112\u2013123}} Drayton remained with the [[Cope baronets#Cope of Hanwell (1611)|Cope Baronets of Hanwell]] until the death of Sir John Cope, 5th Baronet in 1721. It then passed to another branch of the Cope family, [[Cope baronets#Cope of Bruern (1714)|Sir Jonathan Cope]], 1st Baronet of [[Bruern Abbey|Bruern]]. When Sir Charles Cope, 3rd Baronet died in 1781, Drayton passed to one of his sisters, Catherine. In 1790 Catherine's daughter Arabella was married to [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] and received Drayton from her mother. In 1825 Drayton was inherited by the Duke and Duchess's younger daughter, [[Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr]]. When she died in 1870 her manorial rights passed to the North family of [[Wroxton Abbey]].<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\nIn about 1629 [[Sir William Cope, 2nd Baronet]] sold a large acreage of land at Drayton to \n[[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele]] of [[Broughton Castle]].

[[John Bridges (bishop)|John Bridges]], whom [[James I of England|James I]] had appointed [[Bishop of Oxford]] in 1603, suspended Cleaver for failing to adhere to the [[Book of Common Prayer#1559 Prayer Book|Book of Common Prayer]]. In 1607 Sir Anthony Cope persuaded [[Richard Bancroft]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] to accept [[Henry Scudder (clergyman)|Henry Scudder]] as Drayton's new curate. In 1619 Scudder was succeeded by another puritan, Thomas Lodge, who was described as ''\"a burning and a shining light\"'' and was curate until 1651. A [[low church]] tradition survived in Drayton with John Dover, who was curate 1688\u20131725.

Its [[Toponymy|toponym]] comes from the [[Old English]] ''drag'' meaning to carry goods.<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\n==Manor==\nAfter the [[Norman conquest of England|Norman conquest]] of 1066 the conquering [[Normans]] dispossessed many [[Anglo-Saxons|Saxon]] landowners, but the [[Domesday Book]] records that in 1086 Drayton still belonged to a Saxon [[thegn]], Turchil of Arden. However, in 1088 [[William the Conqueror]] created the [[Earl of Warwick#Earls of Warwick; First creation (1088)|Earldom of Warwick]] and thereafter gave Turchil's estates to the [[Normans|Norman]] nobleman [[Henry de Beaumont, 1st Earl of Warwick]]. The Arden family seems to have remained as tenants of the Earldom, for in 1204 a Thomas Arden held the tenancy. In 1329 Sir Robert Arden was licensed to [[Battlement|crenellate]] Drayton [[manor house]]. The male line of the Arden family ended in 1376 with the death of Sir Giles Arden, whose son had predeceased him. Sir Giles' granddaughters Margaret and Joan were minors, but on reaching their majority and marriage they inherited the Drayton estate.\n\nJoan and her husband surrendered their share of Drayton to Margaret who had married Lewis Greville. The house remained the seat of the Greville family until 1565, when a later Lewis Greville was heavily in debt and sold the manor to one Thomas Webb. By 1588 Thomas Webb had died leaving Drayton to his brother Richard and widow Katherine. Lewis Greville lured Richard Webb to [[Sezincote House]] in [[Gloucestershire]] where Greville got Webb drunk, persuaded him to write a will in Greville's favour and then murdered him. Greville was tried for murder, and because he refused to enter a plea he was executed by pressing instead of hanging.<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\nBy 1598 most of the manor of Drayton belonged to [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet|Anthony Cope]] of [[Hanwell, Oxfordshire|Hanwell]].<ref name=Lobel-1/> In 1611 [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] made Cope [[Sir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet]].{{sfn|Lobel|Crossley|1969|pp=112\u2013123}} Drayton remained with the [[Cope baronets#Cope of Hanwell (1611)|Cope Baronets of Hanwell]] until the death of Sir John Cope, 5th Baronet in 1721. It then passed to another branch of the Cope family, [[Cope baronets#Cope of Bruern (1714)|Sir Jonathan Cope]], 1st Baronet of [[Bruern Abbey|Bruern]]. When Sir Charles Cope, 3rd Baronet died in 1781, Drayton passed to one of his sisters, Catherine. In 1790 Catherine's daughter Arabella was married to [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] and received Drayton from her mother. In 1825 Drayton was inherited by the Duke and Duchess's younger daughter, [[Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr]]. When she died in 1870 her manorial rights passed to the North family of [[Wroxton Abbey]].<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\nIn about 1629 [[Sir William Cope, 2nd Baronet]] sold a large acreage of land at Drayton to \n[[William Fiennes, 1st Viscount Saye and Sele]] of [[Broughton Castle]]. By 1790 the same property belonged to [[Francis North, 1st Earl of Guilford]] of Wroxton Abbey. In 1935 and 1942 the Norths sold their lands at Drayton to [[Trinity College, Oxford]].<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\n==Parish church==\nThe [[Church of England parish church]] of [[Saint Peter]] was in existence by 1223.<ref name=Lobel-1/> Its earliest surviving features are a [[Norman architecture|Norman]] priest's doorway and the [[Baptismal font|font]].<ref name=Sherwood587>{{harvnb|Sherwood|Pevsner|1974|p=587}}</ref> In the 14th century St Peter's was almost completely rebuilt<ref name=Lobel-1/> and north and south [[Aisle#Architecture|aisles]] were added, all in the [[English Gothic architecture#Decorated Gothic|Decorated Gothic style]].<ref name=Sherwood587/> Lobel and Crossley contend that the [[clerestorey]] was added at the same time,<ref name=Lobel-1/> but it is in the [[English Gothic architecture#Perpendicular Gothic|Perpendicular Gothic]] style and Sherwood and Pevsner contend it was added later.<ref name=Sherwood587/> The low west [[steeple (architecture)|tower]] was added in 1808<ref name=Sherwood587/> and has three 17th century bells: two cast in 1634 and two more cast in 1670.<ref name=Lobel-1/> In 1878 the [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival architect]] [[Edwin Dolby]] restored the church and added a vestry.<ref name=Sherwood587/> St Peter's is a [[Listed building#Categories of listed building|Grade II* listed building]].<ref>{{NHLE |num=1369591 |desc=Church of St Peter |grade=II* |accessdate=10 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nSir Anthony Cope, 1st Baronet (1550\u20131615) was a [[puritan]], and in 1598 he presented Robert Cleaver, a [[Presbyterianism|presbyterian]] to be [[curate]] of Drayton. [[John Bridges (bishop)|John Bridges]], whom [[James I of England|James I]] had appointed [[Bishop of Oxford]] in 1603, suspended Cleaver for failing to adhere to the [[Book of Common Prayer#1559 Prayer Book|Book of Common Prayer]]. In 1607 Sir Anthony Cope persuaded [[Richard Bancroft]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] to accept [[Henry Scudder (clergyman)|Henry Scudder]] as Drayton's new curate. In 1619 Scudder was succeeded by another puritan, Thomas Lodge, who was described as ''\"a burning and a shining light\"'' and was curate until 1651. A [[low church]] tradition survived in Drayton with John Dover, who was curate 1688-1725. From 1778 until the 1960s all of Drayton's curates were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]] and most had served as [[Mission (Christian)|missionaries]] in other continents.<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\nSt Peter's is now one of eight ecclesiastical parishes in the Ironstone [[Benefice#Church of England|Benefice]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.achurchnearyou.com/benefice.php?B=27/271CT |title=Benefice of Ironstone |author=[[Archbishops' Council]] |work=[[A Church Near You]] |publisher=[[Church of England]] |accessdate=10 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150406205632/http://www.achurchnearyou.com/benefice.php?B=27%2F271CT |archive-date=6 April 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\n==Social and economic history==\n[[File:Ivy Cottage, Drayton - geograph.org.uk - 1018742.jpg|thumb|Ivy Cottage, a thatched 16th century [[Cotswold stone|Hornton Stone]] house in Drayton]]\nThe Domesday Book records that in 1086 Drayton had a [[water mill]], presumably on Sor Brook on the western boundary of the parish just below the village.

It was made into a [[Toll road|turnpike]] in 1744 and ceased to be one in 1871.{{sfn|Lobel|Crossley|1969|pp=112\u2013123}} In the 1920s it was classified as part of the A41 road. After the completion of the [[M40 motorway]] in 1990 this part of the A41 was \"detrunked\" and reclassified as the B4100.\n\nThe main road between Banbury and [[Stratford-upon-Avon]] branches off the Banbury - Warwick road and descends through Drayton village to cross Sor Brook. An [[Acts of Parliament in the United Kingdom|Act of Parliament]] to turn this road was passed in 1747 works to improve the road and establish toll houses were not undertaken until 1754.<ref name=Lobel-1/> Since the 1920s it has been classified the [[A422 road]].\n\nDrayton's earliest recorded [[public house]]s were licensed from 1753. By 1782 the village had two pubs, the Hare and Hounds and the Roebuck Inn. The last record of the Hare and Hounds is from 1806,<ref name=Lobel-1/> but the Roebuck Inn continues to trade.

One of the day schools was still extant in 1855, when the [[George Sackville-West, 5th Earl De La Warr|5th Earl De La Warr]] and Countess De La Warr had given two cottages to be converted into a schoolroom. This was rebuilt by 1891 but was still unsatisfactory and in 1900 a separate infants' classroom was built. The number of pupils declined in the 1930s and the school was closed in 1948.<ref name=Lobel-1/>\n\n[[File:Wroxton OIR P-hut.JPG|thumb|[[Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway]]'s permanent way hut (known as a P-hut) at Drayton in 2005.
