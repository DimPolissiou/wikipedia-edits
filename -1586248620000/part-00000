As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, John Mortensen, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464.

As students progressed, partimenti became unfigured. (Fenaroli Partimento Fugue 8, Book 5, Gj1418)]]\n\nA '''Partimento''' (from the [[Italian language|Italian]]: partimento, plural partimenti) is a sketch (often a bass line), written out on a single staff, whose main purpose is to be a guide for the improvisation (\"realization\") of a composition at the keyboard.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=14}} Partimento differs from simple basso continuo [[accompaniment|accompaniment]] in that the result is a complete, fully-realized composition.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=167}} \n\n== History ==\n[[File:Durante.jpg|thumb|Francesco Durante, hailed by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] as,\"the most celebrated harmonist of Italy, that is to say of the entire world.\"{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=70}}]]\n[[File:Leonardo Leo.jpg|thumb|Leonardo Leo]]\n\n=== Beginnings ===\nThe Partimenti evolved in the late 17th century in educational milieus in Bologna, Rome, and Naples. \n\n=== Golden Age ===\nThe golden age of partimento was presided over by [[Francesco Durante|Francesco Durante]] and [[Leonardo Leo|Leonardo Leo]], the 2nd generation of Neapolitan masters.{{sfn|Sanguinetti|2012|p=67}} Many important Italian composers emerged from the musical institutions in Naples, Bologna, and Milano, such as [[Giovanni Battista Pergolesi]], [[Giuseppe Verdi]], [[Domenico Cimarosa]], [[Vincenzo Bellini]], [[Gaetano Donizetti]], [[Gaspare Spontini]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]].\n\n=== Influence on Paris Conservatory ===\n\n=== Decline and Disappearance ===\n\n=== Revival ===\nThe rediscovery of the partimento tradition in modern research since around 2000 has enabled new ways of looking at the musical education and composing practice in the 18th and 19th centuries. Influential monographs concerning partimento include [[Robert Gjerdingen|Robert O. Gjerdingen]]'s ''Music in the Galant Style'' (2007) and [[Giorgio Sanguinetti|Giorgio Sanguinetti]]'s ''The Art of Partimento'' (2012). Today, partimento studies provide an important impetus for a more integrative approach to learning counterpoint, harmony, and improvisation.\n\nNotable modern players include [[Ewald Demeyere|Ewald Demeyere]], Tobias Cramm, John Mortensen, Nicoleta Paraschivescu and [[Matteo Messori|Matteo Messori]].\n\n== How Partimento was Taught ==\n\n{{Quote|text=To begin with, one will play all unfigured basses with simple consonant chords: from that performance the Master will clearly understand if his pupil has correctly understood the principles thereof. Secondly, one shall introduce all feasible dissonances for that given bass. Lastly, one shall shape the properly said imitation.|author=Emanuele Guarnaccia|title=''Metodo nuovamente riformato de'partimenti'', 3, 1825 ca|source={{sfn|Guarnaccia|1825|p=3}}}}\n\nPartimenti were typically used as exercises to train conventional models of [[voice leading]], [[harmony]], and musical form, such as the so-called [[Rule of the octave|Rule of the Octave]] (the harmonized scale), [[Cadence (music)|cadences]] and [[Sequence (music)|sequences]] (the movimenti, or moti del basso). The beginners\u2019 partimenti treatises usually present rules, which are then followed by exercises of increasing difficulty, presenting [[figured bass]]  as well as [[unfigured bass]] lines, and culminating in the advanced exercises of imitative partimenti and partimento [[fugue|fugues]].\n\n=== Harmony vs Counterpoint ===\nThere is no strict separation between [[counterpoint]] and harmony in the Partimento tradition.\n\n== Consonances and Dissonances ==\nMusic is composed of consonances and dissonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=2}}\n\n=== Consonances ===\nThe four consonances are the 3rd, 5th, 6th and 8th. The 5th and 8th are '''perfect consonances''' because one cannot make distinctions between them by expanding them with a sharp or diminishing them with a flat. The 3rd and 6th are considered '''imperfect consonances''' because one can make distinctions between them.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=3}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <g b>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 3rd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d a'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 5th } } \\bar \"||\" <b g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 6th } }  \\bar \"||\"<g g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 8th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\nThere is a prohibition against two octaves or two fifths moving in parallel because, due to their perfection, they create no variation in harmony, and these [perfect intervals] are the fundamental basses that rule the key.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=4}}\n\n=== Dissonances ===\nThe four dissonances are the 2nd, 4th, 7th and 9th. They were invented to make the consonances sound more beautiful. These cannot be used unless prepared by a preceding consonance and subsequently resolved to one of the aforementioned consonances.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=14}}\n\n<score vorbis=\"1\" lang=\"lilypond\">\n   {\n        \\new Staff <<\n            \\new Voice \\relative c' {\n                \\stemDown \\clef bass \\key g \\major \\time 4/4 \\tempo 2 = 60 \\set Score.tempoHideNote = ##t\n                <fis, g>1^\\markup { \\center-column { 2nd } }  \\bar \"||\" <d g>^\\markup { \\center-column { 4th } } \\bar \"||\" <a g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 7th } }  \\bar \"||\"<fis g'>^\\markup { \\center-column { 9th } }\n                }\n            >>\n     }\n</score>\n\n== Cadences ==\nA cadence is when the bass goes from \u2460 to \u2464, and [then] from \u2464 to \u2460.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7a}} There are three types of cadences: Simple, Compound and Double.{{sfn|Fenaroli|1775|p=7b}}\n\n=== Simple Cadence ===\nA simple cadence is when one gives the bass the simple consonances required by both \u2460 and \u2464.

{"title_page": "Reverse chronology", "text_new": "{{synthesis|date=April 2010}}\n\n'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.\n\nIn a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.\n\nMany stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.\n\nIn [[interactive fiction]], reverse chronology is a well-known technique.<ref>https://ifdb.tads.org/poll?id=fp7gh2yvrq824f7u</ref>.  For instance, the story ''[[Beanstalk the and Jack]]''<ref>http://www.delron.org.uk/reviews/beanstalk.html</ref>, tells the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' using reverse chronology: the opening scene<ref>https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=iturltygobcm1at8</ref> depicts Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene features Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the story, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.\n\nIn the film ''[[Irr\u00e9versible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often \"more than meets the eye.\"\n\n== Examples of use ==\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.<ref>Albrecht, Michael von; & Schmeling, Gareth L.

[[Cambridge University Press]]. p. 1036. {{ISBN|0-521-83179-2}}</ref>\n\n[[Philip K. Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves (\"old-birth\"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story \"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].\n\n[[Iain M. Banks|Iain Banks]]'s novel ''[[Use of Weapons]]'' (1990) interweaves two parallel stories, one told in standard chronology and one in reverse, both concluding at a critical moment in the main character's life.\n\n[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a \"certain paragraph\" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.\n\n[[Julia Alvarez]]'s novel ''[[How the Garc\u00eda Girls Lost Their Accents]]'' (1991) opens in 1989 with one of the characters returning to her native Dominican Republic. The story of why the family left and their attempts to succeed in New York are told in reverse chronological order, with the last events happening in 1956.<ref>http://www.arls.org/2011/11/arls-teen-book-review-how-the-garcia-girls-lost-their-accents/</ref>\n\n''[[The Night Watch (Waters novel)|The Night Watch]]'' (2006) by [[Sarah Waters]] is written in three episodes moving backwards from 1947 to 1941, beginning in post-war London and moving back to the early days of the war. [[All the Birds, Singing]] (2013) by the Australian author [[Evie Wyld]], relates two stories in parallel, both beginning from the same point in time, one running forwards and one backwards. The novel won the 2014 Miles Franklin Award and the 2014 Encore Award.<ref>Harvey, Samantha. 'When a Story is Best Told Backwards: on the Melancholy of Reverse Narratives', in ''Literary Hub'', 15 November 2018</ref>\n\n=== Theatre ===\nA number of [[Play (theatre)|plays]] have employed this technique. [[George S. Kaufman]] and [[Moss Hart|Moss Hart's]] 1934 play, ''[[Merrily We Roll Along (play)|Merrily We Roll Along]]'', is told in reverse order, as is the [[Harold Pinter]] play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' (1978). Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace \u00e0 trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance. The Czech comedy ''[[Happy End (1966 film)|Happy End]]'' (1966) is a farce which starts with a guillotined man finding his head popped back on his shoulders and ends with him as a new-born being pushed back into his mother's womb.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,841358,00.html | work=Time | title=Cinema: Happy End | date=1968-06-28 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}</ref> [[Atom Egoyan]], influenced by Pinter's plays, tells the story of ''[[The Sweet Hereafter (film)|The Sweet Hereafter]]'' (1997) in reverse chronology, with the first scene of the film set in 1977 and the last in 1968.<ref>MacDermott, Felim; & McGrath, Declan (2003).

The ''Seinfeld'' episode is a take-off of the Harold Pinter play ''[[Betrayal (play)|Betrayal]]'' and has a character named \"Pinter.\"<ref name=\"Gateward\"/> [[Redrum (The X-Files)|\"Redrum\"]], a 2000 episode of ''[[The X-Files]],'' uses the technique in focusing on a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The 2002 ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' episode \"Hindsight\" uses reverse chronology to illustrate the events leading to traumatic car accident. A 1997 ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' episode, \"[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]\", which writer Kenneth Biller claimed was based on a [[Martin Amis]] novel [[Time's Arrow (novel)|''Time's Arrow'']], also features a character experiencing the events in reverse along with the audience. The ''[[Sealab 2021]]'' episode \"Shrabster\" is also in reverse order. For a few seasons, the revived ''[[Doctor Who]]'' had an extensive storyline focusing on a relationship between the Doctor and his companions' daughter (River Song) from the future based on \"opposite timelines\" (i.e., as the Doctor was travelling through time on one path, River was travelling on an opposite path) causing them to interact in opposite chronological order. In 2017, the British tv mini-series ''Rellik'' (Killer backwards) tells a story about a serial killer in backwards order. In 2018, the episode \"[[Once Removed]]\", from the series ''[[Inside No. 9]]'' uses reverse chronology to tell a dark story about a family who is moving house, and the murder that subsequently begins. Also from 2018, the second installment of the [[FX (TV channel)|FX]] anthology series ''[[American Crime Story]]'' focuses on [[The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story|the assassination of designer Gianni Versace]], employing reverse chronology through the course of several episodes to explore the background of Versace's killer Andrew Cunanan.\n\n=== Comics ===\nThe story \"The Time Eater\" from issue 40 of the comic \"[[Vampirella]]\", scripted by Jack Butterworth and published in 1975, included the concept of human lives running backwards. People were shown to be exhumed, reunited with families, separated from their spouses in order to attend school, and finally returned to the womb. Dialogue was reversed also. [[Alan Moore]]'s 1983 short story \"The Reversible Man\" from issue 308 of the comic \"[[2000 AD (comics)|2000AD]]\" told an ordinary man's life backwards, using the same concept as Butterworth but recasting it as a first-person narrative. [[Brian K. Vaughan]] wrote an issue of the ongoing ''[[Midnighter]]'' series told in reverse chronology.  The issue explored the fact that the character Midnighter has the ability to calculate millions of possible scenarios for any given situation.  The issue does not have the scenes in reverse order, but rather the individual pages run backwards.\n\nIssue 43 of Bongo's \"[[Simpsons Comics]]\" is told in reverse order: the story opens with a depiction of a crane lifting a crashed car out of a lake; each subsequent scene (which lasts for one page) carries a caption informing the reader that it took place, for instance, \"20 minutes earlier\". The penultimate page jumps back thirty years and shows [[Homer Simpson]] as a child\n\n=== Anime ===\nThe 2007 anime television series ''[[Touka Gettan]]'' employed entirely this narrative method. All 26 episodes were aired in chronologically reverse order, with the first episode being the ending of the story while the last episode being the beginning.\n\n=== Music ===\nThe lyrics to \"[[All Along the Watchtower#Background|All Along the Watchtower]]\", written by [[Bob Dylan]], are, he says, \"in a rather reverse order\"; indeed, the final verse begins with the words \"All along the watchtower\", and if reversed, the [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]s would tell the story in the correct order.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\nThe lyrics to \"Apparition. Apparitions.\" by [[Trophy Scars]] describe the events leading up to a woman's suicide in reverse order, beginning with her death and ending with her initial romance with her boyfriend.\n\nThe song \"One Thing Leads to Another\" by the [[Pet Shop Boys]] (on a limited release of their 1993 album ''[[Very (Pet Shop Boys album)|Very]]'') describes the events leading up to a man's death in reverse order.\n\nMultiple music videos\u2014including, perhaps most famously, [[Coldplay]]'s \"[[The Scientist (song)|The Scientist]]\"\u2014use reverse chronology in which a scene plays backwards while someone sings normally. This is done by filming the video chronologically but getting the actor to sing the lyrics backwards (if applicable). The music video for Enigma's \"Return to Innocence\" uses reverse chronology showing a man's life, beginning with his death as an old man and ending with his baptism as an infant. The music video for [[Linkin Park]]'s \"Bleed It Out\" also uses the same method, whereas the band performs normally, but everything else is reversed. In 2016, Malaysian singer-songwriter Yuna used reverse chronology in her music video \"Lanes\". [[Mutemath]] also achieved widespread popularity with its music video for \"[[Typical_(MuteMath_song)|Typical]]\".\n\nThe events of the song \"Reverse\" by [[SomeKindaWonderful]], as said in the title itself, are told in reverse chronology.\n\nThe lyrics in \"Rewind\" by NaS also tell a story in reverse chronology, with some of the dialogue even being in reverse order.\n\n\"Good Mistake\" Album by [[Bahram Nouraei]] is the first Iranian concept album ever made inspired by reverse chronology as the storytelling method.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bahramnouraei.com/about#/|title=Bahram Nouraei&nbsp;\u2014 Official Website|website=bahramnouraei.com}}</ref>\n\nThere have also been several discussions as to how the picturisation of Neela Vaanam \"Manmadan Ambu\" (sung by Kamal Haasan himself) has been slightly inspired from official video of Coldplay's \"The Scientist\". The whole song has been depicted in such a way so as to highlight the events that led to the death of Mannar's (Kamal's character) French wife Juliet, in reverse.\n\n=== Video games ===\nThe [[Dead Island announcement trailer|announcement trailer]] of 2011 video game, ''[[Dead Island]]'', also present in reverse chronological order with flash of chronological action edited into the whole video.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lZqrG1bdGtg|title=Dead Island: Official Announcement Trailer|website=youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n* [[In medias res]]\n* [[Nonlinear narrative]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Reverse Chronology}}\n[[Category:Film and video terminology]]\n[[Category:Narratology]]\n[[Category:Plot (narrative)]]\n", "text_old": "{{synthesis|date=April 2010}}\n\n'''Reverse chronology''' is a method of story-telling whereby the [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] is revealed in reverse order.\n\nIn a story employing this technique, the first [[Scene (fiction)|scene]] shown is actually the conclusion to the plot. Once that scene ends, the penultimate scene is shown, and so on, so that the final scene the viewer sees is the first chronologically.\n\nMany stories employ [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]], showing prior events, but whereas the scene order of most conventional films is A-B-C-etc., a film in reverse chronology goes Z-Y-X-etc.\n\nIn [[interactive fiction]], reverse chronology is a well-known technique.<ref>https://ifdb.tads.org/poll?id=fp7gh2yvrq824f7u</ref>.  For instance, the story ''[[Beanstalk the and Jack]]''<ref>http://www.delron.org.uk/reviews/beanstalk.html</ref>, tells the [[fairy tale]] ''[[Jack and the Beanstalk]]'' using reverse chronology: the opening scene<ref>https://ifdb.tads.org/viewgame?id=iturltygobcm1at8</ref> depicts Jack chopping the beanstalk down and killing the giant. The next scene features Jack being discovered by the giant and climbing down the beanstalk in fear of his life. Later, we see Jack running into the man with the infamous magic beans, then, at the end of the story, being sent off by his mother to sell the cow.\n\n== Purpose ==\nThe unusual nature of this method means it is only used in stories of a specific nature. For example, ''[[Memento (film)|Memento]]'' features a man with [[anterograde amnesia]], meaning he is unable to form new memories. The film parallels the protagonist's perspective by unfolding in reverse chronological order, leaving the audience as ignorant of the events that occurred prior to each scene (which, played in reverse chronological order, will not be revealed until later) as the protagonist is.\n\nIn the film ''[[Irr\u00e9versible]],'' an act of [[homicide|homicidal]] violence takes place at the start of the movie (i. e., it is the final event to take place). During the remainder of the film we learn not only that the violence is an act of vengeance, but what exactly is being avenged. The film was highly controversial for its graphic nature; had the scenes been shown in chronological order, this violent content would make it a simple, and pointlessly brutal, revenge movie. However, as it is, told in reverse, the audience is made to consider the exact consequences of each action, and there is often \"more than meets the eye.\"\n\n== Examples of use ==\n\n=== Literature ===\nThe epic poem ''[[Aeneid]]'', written by [[Virgil]] in the 1st century BC, uses reverse chronology within scenes.<ref>Albrecht, Michael von; & Schmeling, Gareth L.

Dick]], in his 1967 novel ''[[Counter-Clock World]]'', describes a future in which time has started to move in reverse, resulting in the dead reviving in their own graves (\"old-birth\"), living their lives in reverse, eventually ending in returning to the womb, and splitting into an egg and a sperm during copulation between a recipient woman and a man. The novel was expanded from Dick's short story \"Your Appointment Will Be Yesterday\", first published in the August 1966 edition of [[Amazing Stories]].\n\n[[Martin Amis]]'s 1991 novel ''[[Time's Arrow (novel)|Time's Arrow]]'' tells the story of a man who, it seems, brings dead people to life. Eventually it is revealed that the story is being seen backwards, and he was a doctor at [[Auschwitz]] who brought death to live people. He escaped to the United States, and the novel starts with his death and ends with his birth. Amis writes in the Afterword that he had a \"certain paragraph\" from [[Kurt Vonnegut|Kurt Vonnegut's]] ''[[Slaughterhouse Five]]'' (1969) in mind.  As he waits to be taken by aliens to the planet Tralfamadore, the protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, watches a war movie backwards. American planes full of holes fly backwards as German planes suck bullets from them; bombers take their bombs back to base where they are returned to the States, reduced to ore and buried. The American fliers became high school kids again, and, Billy guesses, Hitler ultimately returns to babyhood.\n\n[[Iain M.

Kaufman and Hart's play was adapted as [[Merrily We Roll Along (musical)|a musical comedy by Stephen Sondheim]] in 1981, and Pinter's play was made into [[Betrayal (1983 film)|a film]] in 1983.\n\n=== Film ===\nIn 1927, [[Jean Epstein]]'s ''La glace \u00e0 trois faces'' (''The Three Sided Mirror'') features a sequence where the events happen in reverse, beginning with the protagonist's exit from a room until the viewer sees the entrance.

At the start, this spinoff of the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart was openly available through ''Billboard'', ''[[Billboard Radio Monitor]]'' and ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' from its 2003 inception to 2008, when it became exclusive-only to ''Billboard'', up until the chart was renamed in 2011, when it made its playlist available for viewing on ''BDS Radio''<nowiki/>'s website. A modified version was added to ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s website in January 2013, featuring 15 songs. This would be expanded to 25 (later to 40) after ''Billboard'' revamped its website in January 2015, along with adding an archive section that allows its readers to research the songs, artists, and their peak positions since its inception.\n\nWhen ''Billboard'' updated its website in August 2018, the entire chart entries and positions dating from the August 16 to October 18, 2003 issues were officially added as a acknowledgement to reflect its entire history. The unpublished chart included 40 titles to reflect tracks that had airplay spins among Dance outlets, some of them previous reporters from the Rhythmic or Mainstream Top 40 panels (the original six stations that made up the panel had all switched formats); a sample from the September 20, 2003 chart featured songs that charted during this period include those that had previously run on other ''Billboard'' charts after it had ended its run (\"[[Dance with My Father (song)|Dance With My Father]]\" by [[Luther Vandross]]; \"[[Gotta Get Thru This (song)|Gotta Get Thru This]]\" by [[Daniel Bedingfield]]; and \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]), recently released Dance/EDM singles (\"[[Satisfaction (Benny Benassi song)|Satisfaction]]\" by [[Benny Benassi]] Presents The Biz; \"Gates of Mind\" by [[Sterbinszky]] & Tranzident Featuring Jewl; \"It Just Won't Do\" by [[Tim Deluxe]] featuring Sam Obernik) and certain Hip-Hop tracks ([[50 Cent]]'s \"[[P.I.M.P.]]\").<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-dance-airplay/2003-09-20 Dance/Mix Show Airplay (September 20, 2003)] from Billboard (August 31, 2018)</ref> The chart would be reduced to 25 titles in the October 4, 2003 issue, removing the non-Dance titles with the exception of those that had been remixed for Dance radio.\n\nIts first number-one in the inaugural issue at the time it was unpublished was \"[[Crazy In Love]]\" by [[Beyonce]] featuring [[Jay Z]], which spent seven weeks at the top,<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-dance-airplay/2003-08-16 Dance/Mix Show Airplay (August 16, 2003)] from Billboard (August 31, 2018)</ref> followed by \"[[Never (Past Tense)]]\" by [[Roc Project]] featuring [[Tina Arena]] in the October 4, 2003 issue.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-dance-airplay/2003-10-04 Dance/Mix Show Airplay (October 4, 2018)] from Billboard (August 31, 2018)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6480337/chart-highlights-madonnas-living-for-love-debuts-on-pop-songs|title=Chart Highlights: Madonna's 'Living for Love' Debuts on Pop Songs, Leads Dance Club Songs|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}</ref> After ''Billboard'' made the chart official on October 17, 2003, \"[[Just the Way You Are (Milky song)|Just the Way You Are]]\" by [[Milky]] became the official number one single in its October 25, 2003 published issue, even though it had been number one for three weeks, having topped it the week ending October 11 (2003).<ref name=\"bits\">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2003-10-17|accessdate=2010-06-28|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|title=Billboard Bits: Jack Black, Dub Narcotic, Milky |last=Caulfield|first=Keith}}</ref>\n\nIn the issue dated November 19, 2011, the chart's name and methodology was changed.  Director of charts Keith Caulfield explained in his \"Over the Counter\" column: \"Effective this week, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki/>'s Dance Airplay chart is renamed Dance/Mix Show Airplay, as its source of data is widely expanded. Formerly a ranking based on airplay at six dance-formatted reporters (four terrestrial radio stations, plus SiriusXM's BPM channel and Music Choice's Dance/Electronica channel) the plays-based list expands to include mixshow plays on mainstream top 40 and select rhythmic stations that have submitted their hours of mixshow programming, as monitored by Nielsen BDS, to ''Billboard''.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Caulfield |first1=Keith |year=2011 |title=Over the Counter |magazine=Billboard |issue=2011-11-19 |page=53 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2014, the 25-song chart expanded back to 40 positions after eleven years (effective with the December 6, 2014 issue), allowing more dance singles to chart while simultaneously making the chart less pop-oriented.\n\nIn comparison to other dance charts, American commercial radio's definition of dance music is arguably far more marginal, which is reflected in the chart's content. After the alterations made in 2011, the chart somewhat moved away from its initial purpose of charting conventional dance songs, instead including more remixed pop and urban songs in place of traditional forms of dance music and/or music by dance artists. By 2012, however, the influx of EDM songs in mix shows and the addition of two additional dance outlets amongst those monitored once again increased the dance content found on the chart, thereby decreasing to some extent the number of remixed pop and R&B tracks featured.\n\n==Chart criteria==\nThere are 40 positions on this chart and it is solely based on radio airplay. Eight stations (five terrestrial, one cable, one satellite and one online internet service), serve as exclusive reporters and are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>[http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/docs/solutions/measurement/radio/BDS_StationsMonitored.pdf BDS Monitored Station Panel]</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Nielsen Audio]] listener data. The chart also includes 84 selected Mainstream, Adult, and Rhythmic Top 40 reporters that features mix shows as part of their programming, which in turn also contributes to the [[Radio Songs]] chart as a semi-component to the [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. Dance/Mix Show Airplay makes up part of the main [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart, which was launched with January 26, 2013 issue.\n\nSongs receiving the greatest growth will receive a \"bullet\", although there are tracks that will also get bullets if the loss in detections doesn't exceed the percentage of downtime from a monitored station. \"Airpower\" awards are issued to songs that appear on the top 20 of both the airplay and audience chart for the first time, while the \"greatest gainer\" award is given to song with the largest increase in detections. A song with six or more spins in its first week is awarded an \"airplay add\". If a song is tied for the most spins in the same week, the one with the biggest increase that previous week will rank higher, but if both songs show the same amount of spins regardless of detection the song that is being played at more stations is ranked higher. Songs that fall below the top 15 and have been on the chart after 26 weeks are removed and go to the 20-song recurrent status.\n\n==Chart statistics and other facts==\nWith the exception of Madonna, David Guetta, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, and The Chainsmokers, all of whom crossed over to Pop from Dance and continue to be core Dance artists, the artists in the following lists are Pop and/or Rhythmic acts; the songs that landed them on the Dance chart were generally remixes of the original recordings. Rihanna and Katy Perry, however, has been more successful at both [[Dance Club Songs]] and Dance/Mix Show Airplay, where Madonna leads with 49 number ones at the former, seven of those on this chart, followed by Rihanna with 33 (9 on this chart) and Perry with 19 (including 4 on this chart) while achieving success at Pop and Rhythmic. Guetta is the only male artist to see 8 of his 14 Dance Club Songs number ones also reach number one at Dance/Mix Show Airplay, while Britney Spears, Clean Bandit, Sam Smith, Coldplay, Daft Punk, Halsey, Harris, Dua Lipa, Zedd, Rihanna, Ellie Goulding, Khalid, and Marshmello can lay claim to being the only artists to place number ones at Dance Club Songs, Dance/Electronic Songs, and Dance/Mix Show Airplay.\n\n===Artists with the most number-one hits===\nAs of 2019, [[Calvin Harris]] and [[Rihanna]] have accumulated the most chart toppers, with twelve number ones apiece. Rihanna was also the youngest artist on this chart to reach number one with \"[[Pon de Replay]]\" in 2005, when she was 16, while Harris leads among male artists. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist on this chart to see seven singles all reach number one consecutively, making her the only artist on this chart to accomplish this feat, and also has the most number-ones from one album, all four singles from ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' topped the chart (Although she is now tied with [[Katy Perry]], as her four singles from ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' have reached the top spot). In addition, Madonna was also named the number-one Dance Airplay artist for the decade (2003\u20132009) in ''Billboard'''s decade-end recap in 2009. [[The Chainsmokers]] have the most number ones among duo or groups with 7, followed by [[Cascada]] and [[AnnaGrace]], who are tied with 3. However, AnnaGrace are the only duo or group to score their first consecutive number ones on this chart, while The Chainsmokers can claim the most weeks at number one, with 48.\n\n:1.

That record would be broken by \"[[Take Over Control]]\" by [[Afrojack]] featuring [[Eva Simons]] on January 22, 2011, when that song took the number one position four times in its run.\n*Lady Gaga's first single \"[[Just Dance (song)|Just Dance]]\" holds the record for the longest run on the chart without reaching number one, 44 weeks, as of March 21, 2009.

The feat was accomplished on June 18, 2005.\n*In 2007 [[Eric Prydz]] vs. [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Proper Education|Proper Education (The Wall)]]\" became the first number-one single on this chart to feature a remixed recording of an original song, as the track was based on Pink Floyd's \"[[Another Brick in the Wall#Part II|Another Brick in the Wall Part 2]].\"\n*[[Natasja Saad]] was the first artist to reach the top spot posthumously, as her collaboration with [[Rune RK|Enur]], \"[[Calabria (song)|Calabria]]\", reached number one on January 22, 2008.\n*[[Filo & Peri]] featuring Eric Lumiere's \"Anthem\" was the first [[Trance music|trance]] recording by an American act in this genre, to reach the number one position on February 16, 2008..\n*Beyonc\u00e9, [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Kelly Rowland]] are the only artists on this chart to reach number one as members of a group ([[Destiny's Child]]) and as solo artists.\n*[[Kim Sozzi]]'s 2008 number-one single \"Feel Your Love\" was the first single on this chart to be named the top song of the year before the year had started, as it was named the number one single of 2009. The track reached number one in December 2008 but continued its 45-week chart run in 2009. Because of Billboard's requirements for songs that had charted from December of the previous year to November of the following year, \"Feel Your Love\" became eligible in this case.\n*In 2010, both [[Inna]] and [[Kesha]] became the first artists on this chart to swap each other's number-one chart positions with debut singles, with Inna's \"[[Hot (Inna song)|Hot]]\" succeeding Kesha's \"[[Tik Tok (song)|Tik Tok]]\" and then having the latter returned the favor to the former.\n*In 2010, [[Deadmau5]] featuring [[Rob Swire]]'s \"[[Ghosts N Stuff]]\" became the first song on this chart to make the slowest climb to number one, 24 weeks.

At the start, this spinoff of the [[Dance Club Songs]] chart was openly available through ''Billboard'', ''[[Billboard Radio Monitor]]'' and ''[[R&R (magazine)|R&R]]'' from its 2003 inception to 2008, when it became exclusive-only to ''Billboard'', up until the chart was renamed in 2011, when it made its playlist available for viewing on ''BDS Radio''<nowiki/>'s website. A modified version was added to ''Billboard''<nowiki/>'s website in January 2013, featuring 15 songs. This would be expanded to 25 (later to 40) after ''Billboard'' revamped its website in January 2015, along with adding an archive section that allows its readers to research the songs, artists, and their peak positions since its inception.\n\nWhen ''Billboard'' updated its website in August 2018, the entire chart entries and positions dating from the August 16 to October 18, 2003 issues were officially added as a acknowledgement to reflect its entire history. The unpublished chart included 40 titles to reflect tracks that had airplay spins among Dance outlets, some of them previous reporters from the Rhythmic or Mainstream Top 40 panels (the original six stations that made up the panel had all switched formats); a sample from the September 20, 2003 chart featured songs that charted during this period include those that had previously ran on other ''Billboard'' charts after it had ended its run (\"[[Dance with My Father (song)|Dance With My Father]]\" by [[Luther Vandross]]; \"[[Gotta Get Thru This (song)|Gotta Get Thru This]]\" by [[Daniel Bedingfield]]; and \"[[Can't Get You Out of My Head]]\" by [[Kylie Minogue]]), recently released Dance/EDM singles (\"[[Satisfaction (Benny Benassi song)|Satisfaction]]\" by [[Benny Benassi]] Presents The Biz; \"Gates of Mind\" by [[Sterbinszky]] & Tranzident Featuring Jewl; \"It Just Won't Do\" by [[Tim Deluxe]] featuring Sam Obernik) and certain Hip-Hop tracks ([[50 Cent]]'s \"[[P.I.M.P.]]\").<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-dance-airplay/2003-09-20 Dance/Mix Show Airplay (September 20, 2003)] from Billboard (August 31, 2018)</ref> The chart would be reduced to 25 titles in the October 4, 2003 issue, removing the non-Dance titles with the exception of those that had been remixed for Dance radio.\n\nIts first number-one in the inaugural issue at the time it was unpublished was \"[[Crazy In Love]]\" by [[Beyonce]] featuring [[Jay Z]], which spent seven weeks at the top,<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-dance-airplay/2003-08-16 Dance/Mix Show Airplay (August 16, 2003)] from Billboard (August 31, 2018)</ref> followed by \"[[Never (Past Tense)]]\" by [[Roc Project]] featuring [[Tina Arena]] in the October 4, 2003 issue.<ref>[https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-dance-airplay/2003-10-04 Dance/Mix Show Airplay (October 4, 2018)] from Billboard (August 31, 2018)</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6480337/chart-highlights-madonnas-living-for-love-debuts-on-pop-songs|title=Chart Highlights: Madonna's 'Living for Love' Debuts on Pop Songs, Leads Dance Club Songs|work=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc |date=February 23, 2015|accessdate=February 23, 2015}}</ref> After ''Billboard'' made the chart official on October 17, 2003, \"[[Just the Way You Are (Milky song)|Just the Way You Are]]\" by [[Milky]] became the official number one single in its October 25, 2003 published issue, even though it had been number one for three weeks, having topped it the week ending October 11 (2003).<ref name=\"bits\">{{cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IBEEAAAAMBAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|date=2003-10-17|accessdate=2010-06-28|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc|title=Billboard Bits: Jack Black, Dub Narcotic, Milky |last=Caulfield|first=Keith}}</ref> \n\nIn the issue dated November 19, 2011, the chart's name and methodology was changed.  Director of charts Keith Caulfield explained in his \"Over the Counter\" column: \"Effective this week, ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]''<nowiki/>'s Dance Airplay chart is renamed Dance/Mix Show Airplay, as its source of data is widely expanded. Formerly a ranking based on airplay at six dance-formatted reporters (four terrestrial radio stations, plus SiriusXM's BPM channel and Music Choice's Dance/Electronica channel) the plays-based list expands to include mixshow plays on mainstream top 40 and select rhythmic stations that have submitted their hours of mixshow programming, as monitored by Nielsen BDS, to ''Billboard''.\"<ref>{{cite magazine |last1=Caulfield |first1=Keith |year=2011 |title=Over the Counter |magazine=Billboard |issue=2011-11-19 |page=53 |publisher=Nielsen Business Media}}</ref>\n\nOn November 26, 2014, the 25-song chart expanded back to 40 positions after eleven years (effective with the December 6, 2014 issue), allowing more dance singles to chart while simultaneously making the chart less pop-oriented.\n\nIn comparison to other dance charts, American commercial radio's definition of dance music is arguably far more marginal, which is reflected in the chart's content. After the alterations made in 2011, the chart somewhat moved away from its initial purpose of charting conventional dance songs, instead including more remixed pop and urban songs in place of traditional forms of dance music and/or music by dance artists. By 2012, however, the influx of EDM songs in mix shows and the addition of two additional dance outlets amongst those monitored once again increased the dance content found on the chart, thereby decreasing to some extent the number of remixed pop and R&B tracks featured.\n\n==Chart criteria==\nThere are 40 positions on this chart and it is solely based on radio airplay. Eight stations (five terrestrial, one cable, one satellite and one online internet service), serve as exclusive reporters and are electronically monitored 24 hours a day, seven days a week by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]].<ref>[http://www.nielsen.com/content/dam/corporate/us/en/docs/solutions/measurement/radio/BDS_StationsMonitored.pdf BDS Monitored Station Panel]</ref> Songs are ranked by a calculation of the total number of spins per week with its \"audience impression\", which is based upon exact times of airplay and each station's [[Nielsen Audio]] listener data. The chart also includes 84 selected Mainstream, Adult, and Rhythmic Top 40 reporters that features mix shows as part of their programming, which in turn also contributes to the [[Radio Songs]] chart as a semi-component to the [[Mainstream Top 40]] chart. Dance/Mix Show Airplay makes up part of the main [[Dance/Electronic Songs]] chart, which was launched with January 26, 2013 issue.\n\nSongs receiving the greatest growth will receive a \"bullet\", although there are tracks that will also get bullets if the loss in detections doesn't exceed the percentage of downtime from a monitored station. \"Airpower\" awards are issued to songs that appear on the top 20 of both the airplay and audience chart for the first time, while the \"greatest gainer\" award is given to song with the largest increase in detections. A song with six or more spins in its first week is awarded an \"airplay add\". If a song is tied for the most spins in the same week, the one with the biggest increase that previous week will rank higher, but if both songs show the same amount of spins regardless of detection the song that is being played at more stations is ranked higher. Songs that fall below the top 15 and have been on the chart after 26 weeks are removed and go to the 20-song recurrent status.\n\n==Chart statistics and other facts==\nWith the exception of Madonna, David Guetta, Kaskade, Calvin Harris, and The Chainsmokers, all of whom crossed over to Pop from Dance and continue to be core Dance artists, the artists in the following lists are Pop and/or Rhythmic acts; the songs that landed them on the Dance chart were generally remixes of the original recordings. Rihanna and Katy Perry, however, has been more successful at both [[Dance Club Songs]] and Dance/Mix Show Airplay, where Madonna leads with 49 number ones at the former, seven of those on this chart, followed by Rihanna with 33 (9 on this chart) and Perry with 19 (including 4 on this chart) while achieving success at Pop and Rhythmic. Guetta is the only male artist to see 8 of his 14 Dance Club Songs number ones also reach number one at Dance/Mix Show Airplay, while Britney Spears, Clean Bandit, Sam Smith, Coldplay, Daft Punk, Halsey, Harris, Dua Lipa, Zedd, Rihanna, Ellie Goulding, Khalid, and Marshmello can lay claim to being the only artists to place number ones at Dance Club Songs, Dance/Electronic Songs, and Dance/Mix Show Airplay. \n\n===Artists with the most number-one hits===\nAs of 2019, [[Calvin Harris]] and [[Rihanna]] have accumulated the most chart toppers, with twelve number ones apiece. Rihanna was also the youngest artist on this chart to reach number one with \"[[Pon de Replay]]\" in 2005, when she was 16, while Harris leads among male artists. [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] is the only artist on this chart to see seven singles all reach number one consecutively, making her the only artist on this chart to accomplish this feat, and also has the most number-ones from one album, all four singles from ''[[Confessions on a Dance Floor]]'' topped the chart (Although she is now tied with [[Katy Perry]], as her four singles from ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' have reached the top spot). In addition, Madonna was also named the number-one Dance Airplay artist for the decade (2003\u20132009) in ''Billboard'''s decade-end recap in 2009. [[The Chainsmokers]] have the most number ones among duo or groups with 7, followed by [[Cascada]] and [[AnnaGrace]], who are tied with 3. However, AnnaGrace are the only duo or group to score their first consecutive number ones on this chart, while The Chainsmokers can claim the most weeks at number one, with 48.\n\n:1.

In 2009, the track was named the number one single of the decade in Billboard's decade-end recap of the top 50 Dance Airplay songs from 2003 to 2009.\n*As of the May 2, 2009 issue, \"Every Word\" by [[Ercola]] featuring Daniela spent most of 46 week run in the top 10 without dropping below number 10.\n*[[Despina Vandi]]'s 2004 hit \"[[Gia (song)|Gia]]\" was the chart's first foreign-language recording to reach number one.\n*[[Kelly Osbourne]]'s single \"[[One Word]]\" holds the distinction of being the first song to claim the number one spot on the Dance/Mix Show Airplay, [[Hot Dance Club Play]] and [[Hot Dance Single Sales]] charts in the same week. The feat was accomplished on June 18, 2005.\n*In 2007 [[Eric Prydz]] vs. [[Pink Floyd]]'s \"[[Proper Education|Proper Education (The Wall)]]\" became the first number-one single on this chart to feature a remixed recording of an original song, as the track was based on Pink Floyd's \"[[Another Brick in the Wall#Part II|Another Brick in the Wall Part 2]].\"\n*[[Natasja Saad]] was the first artist to reach the top spot posthumously, as her collaboration with [[Rune RK|Enur]], \"[[Calabria (song)|Calabria]]\", reached number one on January 22, 2008.\n*[[Filo & Peri]] featuring Eric Lumiere's \"Anthem\" was the first [[Trance music|trance]] recording by an American act in this genre, to reach the number one position on February 16, 2008..\n*Beyonc\u00e9, [[Michelle Williams (singer)|Michelle Williams]] and [[Kelly Rowland]] are the only artists on this chart to reach number one as members of a group ([[Destiny's Child]]) and as solo artists.\n*[[Kim Sozzi]]'s 2008 number-one single \"Feel Your Love\" was the first single on this chart to be named the top song of the year before the year had started, as it was named the number one single of 2009. The track reached number one in December 2008 but continued its 45-week chart run in 2009.

In 1958, the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]] had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom). However their executives were called \"Commissions\" rather than \"High Authorities\".<ref name=\"ENA commission history\"/> The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].

Under the Treaty of Nice, the first Commission to be appointed after the number of member states reached 27 would have to be reduced to \"less than the number of Member States\". The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the [[European Council]], and membership would rotate equally between member states. Following the [[2007 enlargement of the European Union|accession of Romania and Bulgaria]] in January 2007, this clause took effect for the next Commission.<ref>See the attached Protocol, Article 4</ref> The Treaty of Lisbon, which came into force on 1 December 2009, mandated a reduction of the number of commissioners to two-thirds of member-states from 2014 unless the Council decided otherwise. Membership would rotate equally and no member state would have more than one Commissioner. However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the Council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards. However, according to the treaties it still has to be fewer than the total number of members, thus it was proposed that the member state that does not get a Commissioner would get the post of High Representative&nbsp;\u2013 the so-called 26+1 formula.<ref>{{cite news|last=Smyth|first=Jamie|title=Rejection may undermine EU's effectiveness, warns Swedish premier|work=The Irish Times|date=5 September 2009|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0905/1224253907844.html|accessdate=15 September 2009}}</ref><ref>[http://euobserver.com/843/27360 Czechs prepare for possible second Irish No], ''EUobserver'', 8 January 2009</ref> This guarantee (which may find its way into the next treaty amendment, probably in an accession treaty) contributed to the Irish approving the treaty in a second referendum in 2009.\n\nLisbon also combined the posts of [[European Commissioner for External Relations]] with the Council's [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|High Representative for the Common Foreign and Security Policy]].

This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries.

However the more capable the candidate is, the more likely the Commission President will assign them a powerful portfolio, the distribution of which is entirely at his discretion. The President's team is then subject to hearings at the [[European Parliament]] which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole. If members of the team are found to be too inappropriate, the President must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole Commission being voted down. As Parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners there is usually a compromise whereby the worst candidates are removed but minor objections are put aside so the Commission can take office. Once the team is approved by parliament, it is formally put into office by the [[European Council]] ([[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|TEU Article 17:7]]).\n\nFollowing their appointment, the President appoints a number of [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-Presidents]] (the High Representative is mandated to be one of them) from among the commissioners. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he or she is away.<ref name=\"bbc examine\"/>\n\n===Dismissal===\nThe European Parliament can dissolve the Commission as a whole following a [[vote of no-confidence]] but only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the Council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).\n\n===Political styles===\nThe [[Barroso Commission]] took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style of control over the college, which earned him some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|publisher=EU Observer|title=EU commission sees civil servants' power grow|date=22 February 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/843/23553|accessdate=27 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under Barroso, the Commission began to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role.

A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the Commission and is used \"for justifying the EU and the commission\" increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves.

While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the [[United States Congress]], the fact that there are no direct elections for the position of commission president calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some Eurosceptics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mulvey|first=Stephen|title=The EU's democratic challenge|work=BBC News|date=21 November 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> The fact that the commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed [[Comitology|'comitology committees']]) on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1468-0491.00185 | volume=15 | issue=2 | title=The Democratic Legitimacy of the European Union Committee System | year=2002 | journal=Governance | pages=185\u2013210 | last1 = Rhinard | first1 = Mark}}</ref>\n\nEven though democratic structures and methods are changing there is not such a mirror in creating a European [[civil society]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lamming|first=Richard|title=The democratic credentials of the new European Union: does the Constitution increase the EU's democratic legitimacy?|publisher=[[Federal Union]]|date=10 September 2004|url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml|accessdate=17 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515052243/http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml|archivedate=15 May 2007}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] may go some way to resolving the perceived deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president.

The High Authority was the supranational administrative executive of the new European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). It took office first on 10 August 1952 in Luxembourg City. In 1958, the [[Treaty of Rome|Treaties of Rome]] had established two new communities alongside the ECSC: the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) and the [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom). However their executives were called \"Commissions\" rather than \"High Authorities\".<ref name=\"ENA commission history\"/> The reason for the change in name was the new relationship between the executives and the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].

The exact number of Commissioners was to be decided by a unanimous vote of the [[European Council]], and membership would rotate equally between member states.

However, the treaty was rejected by voters in Ireland in 2008 with one main concern being the loss of their Commissioner. Hence a guarantee given for a rerun of the vote was that the Council would use its power to amend the number of Commissioners upwards.

This is opposed to weighting regulations for their effect on the economy. Thus, the Commission often proposes stricter legislation than other countries.

However the more capable the candidate is, the more likely the Commission President will assign them a powerful portfolio, the distribution of which is entirely at his discretion. The President's team is then subject to hearings at the [[European Parliament]] which will question them and then vote on their suitability as a whole. If members of the team are found to be too inappropriate, the President must then reshuffle the team or request a new candidate from the member state or risk the whole Commission being voted down. As Parliament cannot vote against individual Commissioners there is usually a compromise whereby the worst candidates are removed but minor objections are put aside so the Commission can take office. Once the team is approved by parliament, it is formally put into office by the [[European Council]] ([[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union/Title III: Provisions on the Institutions#Article 17|TEU Article 17:7]]).\n\nFollowing their appointment, the President appoints a number of [[Vice-President of the European Commission|Vice-Presidents]] (the High Representative is mandated to be one of them) from among the commissioners. For the most part, the position grants little extra power to Vice-Presidents, except the first Vice-President who stands in for the President when he or she is away.<ref name=\"bbc examine\"/>\n\n===Dismissal===\nThe European Parliament can dissolve the Commission as a whole following a [[vote of no-confidence]] but only the President can request the resignation of an individual Commissioner. However, individual Commissioners, by request of the Council or Commission, can be compelled to retire on account of a breach of obligation(s) and if so ruled by the European Court of Justice (Art. 245 and 247, Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union).\n\n===Political styles===\nThe [[Barroso Commission]] took office in late 2004 after being delayed by objections from the Parliament, which forced a reshuffle. In 2007 the Commission increased from 25 to 27 members with the accession of Romania and Bulgaria who each appointed their own Commissioners. With the increasing size of the Commission, Barroso adopted a more presidential style of control over the college, which earned him some criticism.<ref>{{cite web|last=Beunderman|first=Mark|publisher=EU Observer|title=EU commission sees civil servants' power grow|date=22 February 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/843/23553|accessdate=27 February 2007}}</ref>\n\nHowever, under Barroso, the Commission began to lose ground to the larger member states as countries such as France, the UK and Germany sought to sideline its role. This has increased with the creation of the [[President of the European Council]] under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Iey Berry|first=Peter Sain |publisher=EU Observer|title=[Comment] Power is slipping from the commission to the council|date=18 January 2008|url=http://euobserver.com/9/25484|accessdate=18 January 2008}}</ref> There has also been a greater degree of [[European Commissioner#Politicisation|politicisation within the Commission]].\n\n==Administration==\n{{Further|European Civil Service}}\n[[File:Androulla Vassiliou2.jpg|thumb|Cypriot politician [[Androulla Vassiliou]] was European Commissioner for Education, Culture, Multilingualism and Youth between 2010 and 2014.]]\nThe Commission is divided into departments known as [[Directorate-General|Directorates-General]] (DGs) that can be likened to departments or [[Ministry (government department)|ministries]]. Each covers a specific policy area such as agriculture or justice and citizens' rights or internal services such as human resources and translation and is headed by a director-general who is responsible to a commissioner.

The single largest DG is the [[Directorate-General for Translation (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Translation]], with a 2309-strong staff, while the largest group by nationality is Belgian (18.7%), probably due to a majority (17,664) of staff being based in the country.<ref>{{cite web|title=Civil Service: Staff figures|publisher=Europa (web portal)|url=http://ec.europa.eu/civil_service/about/figures/index_en.htm |accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Press===\n[[File:Berlaymont Press Room.jpg|thumb|Press Room in the Berlaymont]]\n\nCommunication with the press is handled by the [[Directorate-General Communication (European Commission)|Directorate-General Communication]].

It takes place every weekday in the Commission's press room at the Berlaymont where journalists may ask questions of Commission officials on any topic and legitimately expect to get an \"on the record\" answer for live TV. Such a situation is unique in the world.<ref>{{cite news|last =Lynam|first=Joe|title=The peculiar world of the European Union|work=BBC News|date=1 April 2007|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6496813.stm|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref>\n\nIt has been noted by one researcher that the press releases issued by the Commission are uniquely political. A release often goes through several stages of drafting which emphasises the role of the Commission and is used \"for justifying the EU and the commission\" increasing their length and complexity. Where there are multiple departments involved a press release can also be a source of competition between areas of the Commission and Commissioners themselves. This also leads to an unusually high number of press releases, 1907 for 2006, and is seen as a unique product of the EU's political set-up.<ref name=\"Press Releases\">{{cite web|last =Mahony|first=Honor|title=EU carefully manages PR through 1000s of press releases|publisher=EU Observer|date=17 October 2007|url=http://euobserver.com/9/24971|accessdate=17 October 2007}}</ref> The number of Commission press releases shows a decreasing trend. 1768 press releases were published in 2010 and 1589 in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Search result in Rapid, the European Commission's press database, 1 January 2010 to 31 December 2010 and 1 January 2011 to 31 December 2011|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/searchAction.do|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref>\n\nThere is a larger press corps in Brussels than Washington, D.C.; in 2007, media outlets in every Union member-state had a Brussels [[correspondent]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Parker |first=John |title=A tale of two cities |journal=E!Sharp Magazine |pages=42\u201344 |date=January\u2013February 2007 |publisher=Encompass Publications}}</ref> However, following the [[Late 2000s recession|global downturn]], the press corps in Brussels shrunk by a third by 2010.

Within the EU, the legitimacy of the commission is mainly drawn from the vote of approval that is required from the European Parliament, along with its power to dismiss the body. Eurosceptics have therefore raised the concern of the relatively low turnout (often less than 50%) in elections for the European Parliament [[1999 European Parliament election|since 1999]]. While that figure may be higher than that of some national elections, including the off-year elections of the [[United States Congress]], the fact that there are no direct elections for the position of commission president calls the position's legitimacy into question in the eyes of some Eurosceptics.<ref>{{cite news|last=Mulvey|first=Stephen|title=The EU's democratic challenge|work=BBC News|date=21 November 2003|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3224666.stm|accessdate=17 June 2007}}</ref> The fact that the commission can directly decide (albeit with oversight from specially formed [[Comitology|'comitology committees']]) on the shape and character of implementing legislation further raises concerns about democratic legitimacy.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/1468-0491.00185 | volume=15 | issue=2 | title=The Democratic Legitimacy of the European Union Committee System | year=2002 | journal=Governance | pages=185\u2013210 | last1 = Rhinard | first1 = Mark}}</ref>\n\nEven though democratic structures and methods are changing there is not such a mirror in creating a European [[civil society]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Lamming|first=Richard|title=The democratic credentials of the new European Union: does the Constitution increase the EU's democratic legitimacy?|publisher=[[Federal Union]]|date=10 September 2004|url=http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml|accessdate=17 June 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070515052243/http://www.federalunion.org.uk/europe/democraticcredentials.shtml|archivedate=15 May 2007}}</ref> The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] may go some way to resolving the perceived deficit in creating greater democratic controls on the Commission, including enshrining the procedure of linking elections to the selection of the Commission president.

He has competed at multiple world championship level [[sailing (sport)|sailing]] events, including the [[America's Cup]], the [[Whitbread Round the World Race]],the [[Volvo Ocean Race]] and the [[Olympic Games]]. In 1998 he was selected as the [[US Sailor of the Year Awards|US Rolex Yachtsmen of the Year]]. He has won seven world championships, twice participated in the Olympic Games and seven times in the America's Cup.   In 2002 he was elected into the Sailing World Hall of Fame.\n\n==Biography==\nPaul Cayard was born in [[San Francisco]], [[California]].  He began sailing in 1967 at the age of eight.  He graduated in 1981 with a degree in business management from [[San Francisco State University]].   He speaks three languages: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Italian language|Italian]].  He enjoys flying and holds a [[Pilot certification in the United States|pilots certification]] for single engine aircraft.  Of all his sailing accomplishments, he counts his 1988 Star Class world championship as his most prized victory.<ref name=Cayard>{{cite web|url=http://www.cayardsailing.com/cs_PaulCayard.cfm|title=Paul Cayard Profile|work=Cayard Sailing|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601092853/http://www.cayardsailing.com/cs_PaulCayard.cfm|archivedate=June 1, 2010|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nCayard is a member of four different yacht clubs,  the St. Francis Yacht Club,  the San Francisco Yacht Club, the Encinal Yacht Club, and the Yacht Club de Monaco.<ref name=Cayard/>\n\nFor the 34th America's Cup in San Francisco, Paul Cayard was the CEO of [[Team Artemis|Artemis Racing]].<ref>http://www.sailingworld.com/blogs/racing/americas-cup/complexity-squared</ref>\n\n== Sailing career ==\nFrom an early age Cayard showed great promise as a sailor, and by his early teens was successfully sailing high performance dinghies such as the [[505 (dinghy)|International 505]] and Laser. As Cayard grew and became more proficient in sailing, he gained the notice of [[Tom Blackaller]], who invited Cayard to crew for him on his [[Star (sailboat)|Star class]] sailboat.  Blackaller would become an influential mentor, and the Star Class would become a lifelong passion for Cayard.\n\nIn 1984, Cayard was selected as an alternate in the [[Olympic Games]] for the USA sailing team.  Sailing in the Star Class, he won the silver medal at the pre-Olympic regatta in 2003, going on to finish 5th at the 2004 Summer Olympic Games in [[Athens]].\n\nCayard has competed in a broad range of ocean racing events with an impressive record. He has won the 1994 [[Kenwood Cup]], the 1994 and 1996 [[Sardinia Cup]], and the 1995 [[Admirals Cup]]. His top achievement in this arena was becoming the first American to win the [[Volvo Ocean Race|Whitbread Round the World]] in 1997/1998 as skipper of [[EF Language]]. He beat out ten other yachts for the prize over a course of 32,000 miles (51,500&nbsp;km).\n\nAs of 2006, Cayard competed in the Volvo Ocean Race as skipper of ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' syndicate sponsored by [[The Walt Disney Company]] in reference to the movie of the same name. Cayard Sailing, Inc. managed the syndicate.  The team won the final leg into Gothenburg and finished the overall race in 2nd place.\n\nIn 2007, Paul Cayard and Russell Coutts announced the launch of the World Sailing League in partnership with internationally renowned Portuguese sports promoter, Jo\u00e3o Lagos. The World Sailing League (WSL) will be held at premier sailing locations around the world with the series winner receiving $2 million in prize money.\n\nIn 2009, Cayard joined [[Artemis Racing]], owned by [[Torbj\u00f6rn T\u00f6rnqvist]].  Cayard was the Skipper of the Louis Vuitton Trophy team and Tactician onboard TP52 Artemis (www.artemisracing.com).  \n[[Artemis Racing]] became the Challenger of Record in the [[34th America's Cup]] in 2010 and Cayard became CEO.\n\n=== America's Cup ===\nCayard's first [[America's Cup]] was in 1983 aboard [[Tom Blackaller|Tom Blackaller's]] ''Defender'' as a jib trimmer. ''Defender'' finished third in the defender selection series. For the [[1987 America's Cup]] series, Cayard moved up to tactician and alternate helmsman on Blackaller's new boat ''USA'', which lost out to [[Dennis Conner]]'s ''Stars & Stripes'' for the right to challenge for the cup.<ref>[http://www.americaone.org/cup/history7.html History of the America\u2019s Cup - The Cup Down Under]</ref>\n\nFor the [[1992 America's Cup]], Cayard became manager and skipper of ''[[Il Moro di Venezia]]'' from Italy, a syndicate backed by [[Raul Gardini]]. In 1991, he won the first ever [[International America's Cup Class]] world championship. Over the months long challenger selection series, Cayard's team beat out seven other teams from six other countries to win the [[1992 Louis Vuitton Cup]] and gain the right to challenge for the America's Cup. Part of the challenge included protests where Cayard successfully protested the employment of a bowsprit on the [[Team New Zealand|New Zealand challenge]].\n\nThough ''Il Moro di Venezia'' was outclassed in the America's Cup races by the faster ''[[America\u00b3]]'', Cayard's expertise in sailing provided some memorable moments. In the second race of the series, his yacht won the start and maintained a small lead for the entire race. He employed classic match racing tactics throughout the race, and at the downwind finish managed to beat ''America\u00b3'' by three seconds, producing what was at the time the smallest winning margin in cup history. Cayard went on to lose this series 4-1.\n\nIn 1995, Cayard rejoined an American effort for the America's Cup, joining Team Dennis Conner aboard ''[[Stars & Stripes (yacht)|Stars & Stripes]]'' as primary helmsman. Though ''Stars & Stripes'' was noticeably slower than other boats on the defender series, the syndicate managed to win the [[1995 Citizen Cup]] for the right to defend the Cup. In an unprecedented move, Team Dennis Conner decided to use the faster yacht ''[[List of IACC yachts|Young America]]'' from the PACT 95 syndicate to defend the Cup. Cayard and this syndicate ended up losing the Cup 5-0 to [[Team New Zealand]], who had won the [[1995 Louis Vuitton Cup]].\n\nWith the change in venue and hemisphere for the Cup, the next America's Cup was not held until 2000. For the [[2000 America's Cup]], Cayard formed his own syndicate with backing from a number of sponsors and named it ''[[International America's Cup Class|AmericaOne]]''. The sponsoring yacht club was [[St. Francis Yacht Club]] of San Francisco. This syndicate competed against 14 challengers from 10 nations for the right to challenge for the Cup. ''AmericaOne'' reached the finals of the [[2000 Louis Vuitton Cup]] racing against ''Prada'' for the right to challenge against [[Team New Zealand]] for the 2000 America's Cup. The final over the best of nine races was hotly contested, with neither yacht ever winning by more than two minutes. ''Prada'' won the first race, and ''AmericaOne'' the second. ''Prada'' went on to win the next two races, putting ''AmericaOne'' at a 3-1 disadvantage. ''AmericaOne'' then proceeded to win the next three races in a row and appeared on the brink of winning the Louis Vuitton Cup. However, equipment fatigue and failure proved decisive, several spinnakers were blown out, and ''Prada'' ended up winning the next two races and the series, 5-4, earning the right to challenge for the Cup.  Prada ultimately lost in the America's Cup, 5-0 to the defender Team New Zealand.<ref>[http://www.americaone.org/cup/history8.html History of the America\u2019s Cup - Big Boats Reborn]</ref>\n\nFollowing the conclusion of the 2000 America's Cup, Cayard recommended to the ''AmericaOne'' syndicate board of trustees that the syndicate should not compete for the [[2003 America's Cup]], citing significant financial and recruiting obstacles. Assets of AmericaOne were eventually sold to [[Larry Ellison]] who founded the Oracle Racing syndicate, later joining forces with BMW Racing to form [[Oracle BMW Racing]], with Cayard as skipper. Cayard later was moved out of the skipper position into an administrative position and ultimately left the syndicate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/WORLD/sailing/12/11/cayard.ppl/index.html|title=Cayard Laments Oracle Move|work=CNN Inside Sailing|date=December 11, 2002}}</ref><ref>[http://www.yachtracing.com/richroberts/012903.htm Cayard: the AC From the Outside (en)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929201533/http://www.yachtracing.com/richroberts/012903.htm |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>\n\nIn March 2007, Cayard was involved in the [[2007 America's Cup]] as Technical Advisor to Desafio Espanol 2007. Cayard also commentated on the [[2007 Louis Vuitton Cup]] and on the [[2007 America's Cup]] for [[La7]], the Italian broadcast rights holder.  On 12 October 2007, Cayard announced that he was joining [[Desafio Espanol]] as Sports Director for the 33rd America's Cup.\n\nFor the 33rd America's Cup, Cayard provided commentary for Eurosport and in 2009 joined Torbjorn Tornqvist's sailing on Artemis Racing for the TP52 and Louis Vuitton Trophy regattas. Cayard also helmed RC44 Katusha on the RC44 Championship Tour from 2010-2012.\n\n=== Achievements ===\n{{updated|27 September 2015|<ref>https://members.sailing.org/sailors/biog.php?memberid=40455</ref>}}\n{| {{AchievementTable|Event=yes|NotesOff=y}}\n|-\n| 1978 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[San Francisco]], USA || 4th || Star class\n|-\n| 1979 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Marstrand]], Sweden || 17th || Star class\n|-\n| 1984 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Vilamoura]], Portugal || style=\"background:#c96;\"| 3rd || Star class\n|-\n| 1985 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Nassau, Bahamas|Nassau]], Bahamas || style=\"background:#c96;\"| 3rd || Star class\n|-\n| 1987 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Chicago]], USA || style=\"background:#c96;\"| 3rd || Star class\n|-\n| 1988 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Buenos Aires]], Argentina ||style=\"background:gold;\"| 1st || Star class\n|-\n| 1989 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Porto Cervo]], Italy || 10th || Star class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 1991 || [[IACC World Championship]]  || [[San Diego]], ||1st|| America's Cup\n|-\n| [[IOR 50 World Championship]] || [[Japan]], ||1st|| Intl. 50' Class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 1992 || [[ISAF Open Match Racing World Championship|IYRU Match Racing World Championships]] || [[Long Beach, California|Long Beach]], USA || 5th || Match racing\n|-\n| [[Star World Championships]] || [[San Francisco]], USA || style=\"background:#c96;\"| 3rd || Star class\n|-\n| 1996 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil || 4th || Star class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2002 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Marina del Rey]], USA || 4th || Star class\n|-\n| [[Farr 40 World Championships]] || [[Paradise Island]], Bahamas || 6th || Farr 40 class\n|-\n| 2003 || [[ISAF Sailing World Championships]] || [[Cadiz]], Spain || 8th || Star class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2004 || [[Star World Championships]] || [[Gaeta]], Italy || 5th || Star class\n|-\n| Olympic Games || [[Athens]], Greece || 5th || Star class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2008 || [[Farr 40 World Championships]] || [[Florida]], USA || 11th || Farr 40 class\n|-\n| [[TP52 World Championships]] || [[Lanzarote]], Spain || 7th || TP52 class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2009 || [[505 World Championships]] || [[San Francisco]], USA || 7th || 505 class\n|-\n| [[TP52 World Championships]] || [[Palma, Majorca|Palma]], Spain || style=\"background:#c96;\"| 3rd || TP52 class\n|-\n|rowspan=2| 2010 || [[RC44 World Championships]] || [[Puerto Calero]], Spain || 4th || RC44 class\n|-\n| [[TP52 World Championships]] || [[Valencia]], Spain || 4th || TP52 class\n|}\n\n* Won the El Toro class North American championship in the under 18 category in 1975.\n* Won the Star class world championship in 1988.\n* Won the [[Maxi yacht|Maxi class]] world championship in 1988 aboard ''Il Moro di Venezia III''.\n* Won the 1989 One Ton class world championship.\n* Won the 1991 50-foot world championship aboard ''Abracadabra'' in Japan.\n* 1991 Yachting magazine Yachtsman of the Year.\n* Won the Louis Vuitton Cup in 1992.\n* 1992 [[Rothmans]] Yachtsman of the Year.\n* Won the Citizens Cup in 1995 for the right to defend the America's Cup.\n* Won 1994 and 1996 Sardinia Cup (ocean racing)\n* Won 1994 Kenwood Cup (ocean racing)\n* Won the 1995 Admiral's Cup (ocean racing)\n* Won the 1996 International Level Class 40 world championship.\n* Won the 1999 Steinlager Cup.\n* Won the 1997/98 Whitbread Round the World Race (now known as the [[Volvo Ocean Race]]) as skipper of the [[Sweden|Swedish]] entry EF Language.\n* 1998 [[Rolex]] Yachtsman of the Year.\n* Won 2002 IMS world championship in [[Capri]], Italy.\n* 2002 inductee into the Sailing World Hall of Fame.\n* 2005-2006 Skippered 'Pirates of the Caribbean' in the Volvo Ocean Race, placing 2nd overall.\n* Tactician on board John Kilroy's ''Samba Pa Ti'', winner of the [[Farr 40]] North American Championships 2004, US National Championships 2004, Pacific Coast Championships 2004, and West Coast Season Championships 2004.\n* 2010 Became CEO of Artemis Racing, Challenger of Record for the 34th America's Cup, which is backed by Torbj\u00f6rn Tornqvist. \n* 2011 Inducted into the [[National Sailing Hall of Fame]] in San Diego, CA.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nshof.org/hall-of-fame/class-of-2011-extended/78-the-national-sailing-hall-of-fame/hall-of-fame-2011/333-cayard-paul-2011-hall-of-fame|title=Paul Cayard 2011 Inductee |publisher=Nshof.org |date= |accessdate=November 22, 2019}}</ref>\n* 2012 Sailed as tactician in October ACWS event in San Francisco for Artemis Racing Red.\n* 2014 Won Miami Star Winter Series -

In 1640, a community of English immigrants was established by residents of Hartford, making Farmington the oldest inland settlement west of the [[Connecticut River]] and the twelfth oldest community in the state.  Settlers found the area ideal because of its rich soil, location along the floodplain of the [[Farmington River]], and valley geography.\n\nThe town and river were given their present names in 1645, which is considered the incorporation year of the town.  The town's boundaries were later enlarged several times, making it the largest in the [[Connecticut Colony]]. The town was named \"Farmington\" on account of its location within a farming district.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA332|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=332}}</ref>\n\nFarmington has been called the \"mother of towns\" because its vast area was divided to produce nine other central Connecticut communities. The borough of Unionville, in Farmington's northwest corner, was once home to many factories harnessing the [[water power]] of the Farmington River.\n\nFarmington is steeped in [[New England]] history.  Main Street, in the historic village section, is lined with [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] estates, some of which date back to the 17th century. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], [[George Washington]] passed through Farmington on several occasions and referred to the town as \"the village of pretty houses.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Eve |last=Glasberg |title=A 'Village of Pretty Houses,' Where Women's Lives Were Reshaped |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/travel/03trip.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1146283463-YKay2YVq+ebGHCcNTtHgUA/ |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=2006-03-03 |access-date=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313210323/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/travel/03trip.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1146283463-YKay2YVq+ebGHCcNTtHgUA%2F |archive-date=2007-03-13 |df= }}</ref>  In addition, French troops under General [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] encamped in Farmington en route to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to offer crucial support to General Washington's army.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:John Warner Barber - Northwest View of Farmington from Round Hill.jpg|thumb|left|''Northwest View of Farmington from Round Hill'', by [[John Warner Barber]], 1836]]\n[[File:PostcardPO&StageCoachFarmingtonCT1906.jpg|thumb|right|Post office and stage coach, 1907 postcard]]\n\nThe majority of Farmington residents were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and were active in aiding escaped [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].

The Amistad|''Amistad'' trial]].  In 1841, 38 [[Mende people|Mende]] [[Africans]] and [[Joseph Cinqu\u00e9|Cinqu\u00e9]], the leader of the revolt on the ''Amistad'' [[slave ship]], were housed and educated in Farmington after the U.S. government refused to provide for their return to Africa following the trial.  The Mende were educated in English and [[Christianity]] while funds were raised by residents for their return to Africa.\n\nThe [[Farmington Canal]], connecting [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]] with [[Northampton, Massachusetts]], passed through the Farmington River on its eastern bank and was in operation between 1828 and 1848.  The canal's [[Right-of-way (transportation)|right of way]] and [[towpath]] were eventually used for a railroad, portions of which were active up to the 1990s.  Part of the canal and railroad line has now been converted to a multi-use trail.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:Ct rattle west.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Rattlesnake Mountain]]\nAccording to the [[United States Census Bureau]], the town has a total area of {{convert|74.5|km2|order=flip}}, of which {{convert|72.6|km2|order=flip}} is land and {{convert|2.0|km2|order=flip}}, or 2.65%, is water.<ref name=\"Census 2010\"/>\n\nAfter its founding, Farmington gave up territory to form [[Southington, Connecticut|Southington]] (1779), [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]] (1785), [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]] (1830), [[Plainville, Connecticut|Plainville]] (1869), and parts of [[Berlin, Connecticut|Berlin]] (1785) and [[Bloomfield, Connecticut|Bloomfield]] (1835).<ref>Barry, Ann P. \u201cConnecticut Towns and Their Establishment.\u201d  Hartford, CT:  Connecticut State Library, Archives, History, and Genealogy Unit, 1985.</ref>  Farmington presently borders the towns of [[Avon, Connecticut|Avon]], [[Burlington, Connecticut|Burlington]], [[Newington, Connecticut|Newington]], [[West Hartford, Connecticut|West Hartford]], and [[Plainville, Connecticut|Plainville]], and the cities of [[New Britain, Connecticut|New Britain]] and [[Bristol, Connecticut|Bristol]].\n\nFarmington is mostly wooded, but there are also meadows and hills in the east and southeast.

In 1640, a community of English immigrants was established by residents of Hartford, making Farmington the oldest inland settlement west of the [[Connecticut River]] and the twelfth oldest community in the state.  Settlers found the area ideal because of its rich soil, location along the floodplain of the [[Farmington River]], and valley geography.\n\nThe town and river were given their present names in 1645, which is considered the incorporation year of the town.  The town's boundaries were later enlarged several times, making it the largest in the [[Connecticut Colony]]. The town was named \"Farmington\" on account of its location within a farming district.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Connecticut Magazine: An Illustrated Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoEyAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA332|year=1903|publisher=Connecticut Magazine Company|page=332}}</ref>\n\nFarmington has been called the \"mother of towns\" because its vast area was divided to produce nine other central Connecticut communities. The borough of Unionville, in Farmington's northwest corner, was once home to many factories harnessing the [[water power]] of the Farmington River.\n\nFarmington is steeped in [[New England]] history.  Main Street, in the historic village section, is lined with [[American colonial architecture|colonial]] estates, some of which date back to the 17th century. During the [[American Revolutionary War|Revolutionary War]], [[George Washington]] passed through Farmington on several occasions and referred to the town as \"the village of pretty houses.\"<ref>{{cite news |first=Eve |last=Glasberg |title=A 'Village of Pretty Houses,' Where Women's Lives Were Reshaped |url=http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/travel/03trip.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1146283463-YKay2YVq+ebGHCcNTtHgUA/ |work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] |date=2006-03-03 |access-date=2007-03-15 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070313210323/http://travel2.nytimes.com/2006/03/03/travel/03trip.html?adxnnl=1&adxnnlx=1146283463-YKay2YVq+ebGHCcNTtHgUA%2F |archive-date=2007-03-13 |df= }}</ref>  In addition, French troops under General [[Jean-Baptiste Donatien de Vimeur, comte de Rochambeau|Rochambeau]] encamped in Farmington en route to [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] to offer crucial support to General Washington's army.\n\n===Nineteenth century===\n[[File:John Warner Barber - Northwest View of Farmington from Round Hill.jpg|thumb|left|''Northwest View of Farmington from Round Hill'', by [[John Warner Barber]], 1836]]\n[[File:PostcardPO&StageCoachFarmingtonCT1906.jpg|thumb|right|Post office and stage coach, 1907 postcard]]\n\nThe majority of Farmington residents were [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]] and were active in aiding escaped [[slavery in the United States|slaves]].

The Amistad|''Amistad'' trial]].  In 1841, 38 [[Mende people|Mende]] [[Africans]] and [[Joseph Cinqu\u00e9|Cinqu\u00e9]], the leader of the revolt on the ''Amistad'' [[slave ship]], were housed and educated in Farmington after the U.S. government refused to provide for their return to Africa following the trial.

Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words.

In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/a\u0272/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}.

Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

From {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}}]]\n\n'''Ngang tone:'''\n\n*The ''ngang'' tone is level at around the mid level (33) and is produced with [[modal voice]] [[phonation]] (i.e. with \"normal\" phonation). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"level\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) level\".\n\n'''Huy\u1ec1n tone:'''\n\n*The ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''n\u1eb7ng'' and ''ng\u00e3''/''h\u1ecfi'' tones.\nThe ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone are pronounced as low rising tone (12) [\u02e9\u02e8] in fast speech or low falling-rising tone (212) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8] in more careful utternce. \nThe ''ng\u00e3'' and ''h\u1ecfi'' tone are merged into a mid falling-rising (214) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] which is somewhat similar ''h\u1ecfi'' tone of non-Hanoi Northern accent mentioned above.\n\n====North-central and Central varieties====\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]] pronounce every tone as a n\u1eb7ng tone.\n\n===Eight-tone analysis===\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=45}}</ref>  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:\n\n:(C<sub>1</sub>)(w)V(G|C<sub>2</sub>)+T\n\nwhere\n:{| cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* C<sub>1</sub> = initial consonant onset\n* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}\n* V = vowel nucleus\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})\n* C<sub>2</sub> = final consonant coda\n* T = tone.\n|}\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;\"\n!

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''\u01a1'' = {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, ''\u00e2'' = {{IPA|/\u025c/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}, ''\u0103'' = {{IPA|/\u0250/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/\u025c/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description. He says that his work is not a \"complete grammar\" but rather a \"descriptive introduction.\"  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Alves, Mark J. 2007. \"A Look At North-Central Vietnamese.\" In ''SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002'', edited by Ratree Wayland et al..

Final {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}} is, then, identified with syllable-initial {{IPA|/c, \u0272/}}.\n\nAnother analysis has final {{angbr|ch}} and {{angbr|nh}} as representing predictable [[allophonic]] variants of the velar phonemes {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/\u014b/}} that occur after upper front vowels {{IPA|/i/}} (orthographic {{angbr|i}}) and {{IPA|/e/}} (orthographic {{angbr|\u00ea}}). This analysis interprets orthographic \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as an underlying {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, which becomes phonetically open and diphthongized: {{IPA|/\u025bk/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/\u025b\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0103j\u014b\u031f]}}.<ref>Although there are some words where orthographic {{angbr|c}} and {{angbr|ng}} occur after {{IPA|/\u025b/}}, these words are few and are mostly loanwords or [[onomatopoeia]]</ref> This diphthongization also affects \u27e8\u00each\u27e9 and \u27e8\u00eanh\u27e9: {{IPA|/ek/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306jk\u031f\u031a]}}, {{IPA|/e\u014b/}} \u2192 {{IPA|[\u0259\u0306j\u014b\u031f]}}.\n\nArguments for the second analysis include the limited distribution of final {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}}, the gap in the distribution of {{IPA|[k]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}} which do not occur after {{IPA|[i]}} and {{IPA|[e]}}, the pronunciation of \u27e8ach\u27e9 and \u27e8anh\u27e9 as {{IPA|[\u025bc]}} and {{IPA|[\u025b\u0272]}} in certain conservative central dialects,<ref name=\"rhyme\"/> and the patterning of {{IPA|[k]}}~{{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u014b]}}~{{IPA|[\u0272]}} in certain reduplicated words. Additionally, final {{IPA|[c]}} is not articulated as far forward as the initial {{IPA|[c]}}: {{IPA|[c]}} and {{IPA|[\u0272]}} are pre-velar {{IPA|[k\u031f, \u014b\u031f]}} with no alveolar contact.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Kirby|2011|p=383}}</ref>\n\nThe first analysis closely follows the surface pronunciation of a slightly different Hanoi dialect than the second. In this dialect, the {{IPA|/a/}} in {{IPA|/ac/}} and {{IPA|/a\u0272/}} is not diphthongized but is actually articulated more forward, approaching a front vowel {{IPA|[\u00e6]}}.

Tones differ in\n\n* pitch\n* length\n* contour melody\n* intensity\n* [[phonation]] (with or without accompanying constricted vocal cords)\n\nUnlike many Native American, African, and Chinese languages, Vietnamese tones do not rely solely on [[pitch contour]]. Vietnamese often uses instead a [[register complex]] (which is a combination of phonation type, pitch, length, vowel quality, etc.). So perhaps a better description would be that Vietnamese is a register language and not a \"pure\" tonal language.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=93}}</ref>\n\nIn Vietnamese orthography, tone is indicated by diacritics written above or below the vowel.\n\n===Six-tone analysis===\n\nThere is much variation among speakers concerning how tone is realized phonetically. There are differences between varieties of Vietnamese spoken in the major geographic areas (northern, central, southern) and smaller differences within the major areas (e.g. Hanoi vs. other northern varieties). In addition, there seems to be variation among individuals. More research is needed to determine the remaining details of tone realization and the variation among speakers.\n\n====Northern varieties====\n\nThe six tones in the Hanoi and other northern varieties are:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n!

From {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}}]]\n\n'''Ngang tone:'''\n\n*The ''ngang'' tone is level at around the mid level (33) and is produced with [[modal voice]] [[phonation]] (i.e. with \"normal\" phonation). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"level\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) level\".\n\n'''Huy\u1ec1n tone:'''\n\n*The ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone starts low-mid and falls (21). Some Hanoi speakers start at a somewhat higher point (31). It is sometimes accompanied by [[breathy voice]] (or lax) phonation in some speakers, but this is lacking in other speakers: ''b\u00e0'' = {{IPA|[\u0253a\u02e8\u02e9]}}.<ref>For example, {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|Edmondson|1998}} show a male speaker from [[Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh Province|Nam \u0110\u1ecbnh]] with [[lax voice]] and a female speaker from Hanoi with breathy voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n'' tone while another male speaker from Hanoi has modal voice for the ''huy\u1ec1n''.</ref> Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"grave-lowering\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"low falling\".\n\n'''H\u1ecfi tone:'''\n\n* The ''h\u1ecfi'' tone starts a mid level and falls. It starts with modal voice phonation, which moves increasingly toward [[tense voice]] with accompanying [[harsh voice]] (although the harsh voice seems to vary according to speaker). In Hanoi, the tone is mid falling (31). In other northern speakers, the tone is mid falling and then rises back to the mid level (313 or 323). This characteristic gives this tone its traditional description as \"dipping\". However, the falling-rising contour is most obvious in citation forms or when syllable-final; in other positions and when in fast speech, the rising contour is negligible. The ''h\u1ecfi'' also is relatively short compared with the other tones, but not as short as the ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"smooth-rising\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"dipping-rising\".\n\n'''Ng\u00e3 tone:'''\n\n* The ''ng\u00e3'' tone is mid rising (35). Many speakers begin the vowel with modal voice, followed by strong [[creaky voice]] starting toward the middle of the vowel, which is then lessening as the end of the syllable is approached. Some speakers with more dramatic glottalization have a [[glottal stop]] closure in the middle of the vowel (i.e. as {{IPA|[V\u0294V]}}). In Hanoi Vietnamese, the tone starts at a higher pitch (45) than other northern speakers. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-raised\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"creaking-rising\".\n\n'''S\u1eafc tone:'''\n\n*The ''s\u1eafc'' tone starts as mid and then rises (35) in much the same way as the ''ng\u00e3'' tone. It is accompanied by [[tense voice]] phonation throughout the duration of the vowel. In some Hanoi speakers, the ''ng\u00e3'' tone is noticeably higher than the ''s\u1eafc'' tone, for example: ''s\u1eafc'' = {{IPA|\u02e7\u02e6}} (34); ''ng\u00e3'' = {{IPA|\u02e6\u02c0\u02e5}} (45). Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"acute-angry\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"high (or mid) rising\".\n\n'''N\u1eb7ng tone:'''\n\n* The ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone starts mid or low-mid and rapidly falls in pitch (32 or 21). It starts with tense voice that becomes increasingly tense until the vowel ends in a glottal stop closure. This tone is noticeably shorter than the other tones. Alexandre de Rhodes (1651) describes this as \"chesty-heavy\"; {{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} describes it as \"constricted\".\n\n====Southern varieties====\n{{Expand section|date=January 2011}}\nThe Southern variety is similar through all tones except for the ''n\u1eb7ng'' and ''ng\u00e3''/''h\u1ecfi'' tones.\nThe ''n\u1eb7ng'' tone are pronounced as low rising tone (12) [\u02e9\u02e8] in fast speech or low falling-rising tone (212) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e8] in more careful utternce. \nThe ''ng\u00e3'' and ''h\u1ecfi'' tone are merged into a mid falling-rising (214) [\u02e8\u02e9\u02e6] which is somewhat similar ''h\u1ecfi'' tone of non-Hanoi Northern accent mentioned above.\n\n====North-central and Central varieties====\n\n{{Expand section|date=May 2008}}\n\nNorth-central and Central Vietnamese varieties are fairly similar with respect to tone although within the North-central dialect region there is considerable internal variation.\n\nIt is sometimes said (by people from other provinces) that people from [[Ngh\u1ec7 An]] pronounce every tone as a n\u1eb7ng tone.\n\n===Eight-tone analysis===\n\nAn older analysis assumes eight tones rather than six.<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Ph\u1ea1m|2003|p=45}}</ref>  This follows the lead of traditional Chinese phonology.  In [[Middle Chinese]], syllables ending in a vowel or nasal allowed for three tonal distinctions, but syllables ending with {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}} or {{IPA|/k/}} had no tonal distinctions.  Rather, they were consistently pronounced with a short high tone, which was called the [[entering tone]] and considered a fourth tone. Similar considerations lead to the identification of two additional tones in Vietnamese for syllables ending in {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/c/}} and {{IPA|/k/}}.  These are not [[phoneme|phonemically]] distinct from the ''s\u1eafc'' and ''n\u1eb7ng'' tones, however, and hence not considered as separate tones by modern linguists and are not distinguished in the orthography.\n\n==Syllables and phonotactics==\nAccording to {{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997}}, there are 4,500 to 4,800 possible spoken syllables (depending on dialect), and the standard national orthography (''[[Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef]]'') can represent 6,200 syllables (''Qu\u1ed1c Ng\u1eef'' orthography represents more phonemic distinctions than are made by any one dialect).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Hannas|1997|p=88}}</ref> A description of syllable structure and exploration of its patterning according to the Prosodic Analysis approach of J.R. Firth is given in Henderson (1966).<ref>{{Harvcoltxt|Henderson|1966}}</ref>\n\nThe Vietnamese [[syllable|syllable structure]] follows the scheme:\n\n:(C<sub>1</sub>)(w)V(G|C<sub>2</sub>)+T\n\nwhere\n:{| cellpadding=\"7\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"background: #f9f9f9;\"\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* C<sub>1</sub> = initial consonant onset\n* w = labiovelar on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}\n* V = vowel nucleus\n| style=\"vertical-align: top;\" |\n* G = off-glide coda ({{IPA|/j/}} or {{IPA|/w/}})\n* C<sub>2</sub> = final consonant coda\n* T = tone.\n|}\n\nIn other words, a syllable has an obligatory nucleus and tone, and can have an optional consonant [[syllable onset|onset]], an optional on-glide {{IPA|/w/}}, and an optional [[syllable coda|coda]] or off-glide.\n\nMore explicitly, the syllable types are as follows:\n\n:{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- style=\"font-size: 85%; background: #f2f2f2;\"\n!

His vowels above are only the basic vowel phonemes. Thompson gives a very detailed description of each vowel's various allophonic realizations.\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Han|1966}} uses acoustic analysis, including [[spectrogram]]s and [[formant]] measuring and plotting, to describe the vowels. She states that the primary difference between orthographic ''\u01a1'' & ''\u00e2'' and ''a'' & ''\u0103'' is a difference of length (a ratio of 2:1).  ''\u01a1'' = {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}}, ''\u00e2'' = {{IPA|/\u025c/}}; ''a'' = {{IPA|/\u0250\u02d0/}}, ''\u0103'' = {{IPA|/\u0250/}}. Her formant plots also seem to show that {{IPA|/\u025c\u02d0/}} may be slightly higher than {{IPA|/\u025c/}} in some contexts (but this would be secondary to the main difference of length).\n\nAnother thing to mention about Han's studies is that she uses a rather small number of participants and, additionally, although her participants are native speakers of the Hanoi variety, they all have lived outside of Hanoi for a significant period of their lives (e.g. in [[France]] or [[Ho Chi Minh City]]).\n\n{{Harvcoltxt|Nguy\u1ec5n|1997}} has a simpler, more symmetrical description. He says that his work is not a \"complete grammar\" but rather a \"descriptive introduction.\"  So, his chart above is more a phonological vowel chart rather than a phonetic one.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*Alves, Mark J. 2007. \"A Look At North-Central Vietnamese.\" In ''SEALS XII Papers from the 12th Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society 2002'', edited by Ratree Wayland et al..
