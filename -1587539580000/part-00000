The serial was first broadcast on the [[BBC]] and was directed by [[David Yates]], written by [[Andrew Davies (writer)|Andrew Davies]] and produced by [[Nigel Stafford-Clark]]. [[David Suchet]] starred as Augustus Melmotte, with [[Shirley Henderson]] as his daughter Marie, [[Matthew Macfadyen]] as Sir Felix Carbury, [[Cillian Murphy]] as Paul Montague and [[Miranda Otto]] as Mrs Hurtle.\n\n==Plot summary==\n\nAugustus Melmotte is a foreign financier with a mysterious past. When he and his family move to London, the city's upper crust begins buzzing with rumours about him and a host of characters find their lives changed because of him.\n\nLady Carbury is a widow living in straitened circumstances with her handsome but dissolute son, Sir Felix, and her modest, intelligent daughter, Henrietta. Sir Felix has gambled away his inheritance and his mother supports them by writing. Her close friend, Mr Broune, a newspaper publisher, reviews her books favourably because of his regard for her and clearly wants their relationship to be closer.\n\nAt his gambling club, Felix hears his friends say that Melmotte's daughter, Marie, will have a huge dowry. Returning home, he impulsively tells his mother that he will try to retrieve the family's fortunes by marrying Marie. When the Carburys are invited to a grand ball given at Melmotte's Grosvenor Square mansion, Felix, an experienced ladies' man, meets Marie, a trusting and inexperienced girl, and sweeps her off her feet.\n\nRoger, the Carburys' cousin, is a kind and decent country squire. He has been in love with Henrietta for years but has never said anything, as she has only recently come of age. Paul Montague is a young engineer, formerly Roger's ward. Newly returned to England from America with plans to build a railroad from Utah to Mexico, Paul meets Henrietta when the Carburys visit Roger's estate.\n\nRoger visits London and proposes to Henrietta, who explains that her fondness for him can never become the love he hopes for. Roger refuses to give up, but when he meets Paul later and reveals what happened, Paul discloses that he too is interested in Henrietta. The men's long friendship cools.\n\nPaul and his American partner meet with Melmotte, who agrees to arrange a stock offering.  He invites Sir Felix and a number of his aristocratic friends to join the railroad's board of directors; none of them knows or cares anything about the company's business, but they are delighted at the chance to profit from it.\n\nThe stock offering proves a huge success and the share price goes up and up. Melmotte's prestige and influence are greatly enhanced and he begins to be accepted in English society. Paul is anxious to go to America to begin construction, but for some reason Melmotte keeps putting off the financial arrangements that are necessary for the work.\n\nPaul learns that Mrs Hurtle, a woman he was engaged to in America, has come to London. She vanished before the marriage and he assumed that she had thrown him over. Now she tells him that she means to enforce his promise of marriage. Through a combination of bullying and pleading, she keeps a hold on him.\n\nSir Felix continues to woo Marie and finally approaches Melmotte, who is doubtful of the idea because Felix has no money. Marie convinces Felix to elope, that her father will eventually support them financially. To pay for the trip to New York, she steals a cheque from Melmotte's desk. At the docks Felix fails to board, hung over from a night at his club, while Marie is stopped by constables investigating the stolen cheque and is forced to return to her father's house.\n\nMarie is visited by Felix's sister Henrietta, who informs her that Felix doesn't have the courage to defy Melmotte and has no interest in marrying Marie without a dowry. Marie's feelings for Felix soon change from love to hatred.\n\nMelmotte has had himself elected to Parliament, and on the strength of the successful railroad stock offering, has borrowed huge sums of money and begun other ambitious projects. Only Paul seems to know or care whether the railroad exists. When he returns to London to confront Melmotte, Melmotte warns that if the truth is revealed, Paul and everyone who has invested in the railroad will be ruined. Paul, unwilling to be involved in a fraud even if it makes him rich, tells the whole story to Mr Alf, who promptly publishes it in his newspaper. The railroad company's stock begins to plunge.\n\nSir Felix is aware of his sister's interest in Paul, and when Henrietta reproaches him for abandoning Marie, he spitefully tells her what he knows about Paul. Henrietta visits Mrs Hurtle, who makes Henrietta believe that her affair is still going on. Henrietta then tells Paul they cannot see each other again.\n\nThe precipitous fall of the railroad stock causes Melmotte's fortunes to sink as quickly as they rose. His creditors begin pressing for repayment. As a last resort, he asks Marie to turn over to him a large sum of money he put in her name to protect it from his creditors, but Marie, who has become bitter and cynical since the end of her relationship with Sir Felix, refuses. Melmotte commits suicide. Marie, still wealthy thanks to her nest egg, packs up and leaves London.\n\nWith the failure of her son's attempt to marry Marie, Lady Carbury is at the end of her rope financially. The publisher, Mr Broune, proposes marriage to her and she accepts happily.  He persuades her to send Sir Felix, in the charge of an Anglican clergyman, to a remote town in Prussia, far from the temptations of London club life and where he will not be able to importune his mother for funds.\n\nMrs Hurtle, accepting that Paul will never marry her, quits London; before going she informs Henrietta of the truth. Henrietta and Paul marry, while their former suitors, Roger Carbury and Mrs Hurtle, each learn to accept the situation with some grace. It is revealed at the end that Paul and Henrietta lived a long and happy life, while Mrs Hurtle dies of old age.\n\n==Awards==\nAt the [[British Academy Television Awards 2002|2002 BAFTA Awards]], director David Yates and producer Nigel Stafford-Clark collected an award for ''The Way We Live Now'', which won ''Best Drama Serial''.

Kobi is the only Israeli to win Mr. Universe Junior on behalf of the NABBA Association. As of 2019, Kobi holds a professional card ([[International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness]] pro), and one of the few Israelis to hold that card, and the youngest of them to win it (22).\n\n==Biography==\nIfrach was born and raised in [[Zichron Yaacov]], to an [[ultra-Orthodox]] religious home, which has eight brothers and sisters. Already at the age of 11 his older brother Meir exposed him to the world of [[bodybuilding]] he fell in love with. When he was young, he was sent to study at a [[yeshiva]] in [[Tiberias]], but he would often leave his Torah lessons to work out in the gym.\n\nAt 16, Ifrach first competed in [[Mr. Israel]] on behalf of the NABBA Association, which won him second place in the youth category. In 2013, Kobi first won the Mr. Israel competition, where he lost in the final the year before. Kobi held the title of Mr. Israel on behalf of the NABBA Association until the age of 21 for four years, and from 2015 to 2016 he also won the title of champion of this competition. In July 2015, the young Ifrach won the title of Deputy Mr. World of Youth, in the competition held in [[Malta]], and in May a year later, again won second place, in the Mr. World of Competition held in [[Brazil]].\n\nIn October 2016, Ifrach won the grand title of his career so far, and was the first Israeli in decades of the competition to win it in his category. Ifrach won Mr. Universe on behalf of the NABBA Association. A year later, Yasper flourished again in this competition in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], with another Israeli, who for years served as Kobi's partner, Shalev Ledani. Since Kobi passed the age of 21, he knew he would not be able to enter this competition in October 2018, so he tried his luck in another competition - Top de Colmar, France, on April 8, 2018. Kobi reached this competition to compete in the Semi Pro category, where bodybuilders from the highest levels compete in the world, and is not limited in age. Ifrach won second place in this competition. A month later, he did it again and won Mr. Israel and the Champions Champion for the third time. On [[June 10]], he flew to [[Spain]] with his first trainer - Eyal Hasson, for the world's largest competition, [[Mr. Olympia]] Amateur. He won first place in the youth category up to the age of 24, and in fifth place with the same ranking as sixth, in the category \"Heavy Education up to 90 kg\". Inflorescence rose in the competition weighing 86&nbsp;kg, while still 1.69 meters.\n\nOn June 9, 2019, Ifrach won first place in the Mr. Olympia Amateur Championship, a status that earned him a professional ticket (IFBB pro) and placed him in the Israeli record book when he is one of the few to do so.\n\n==Personal life==\nSince 2016, Kobi Ifrach has served as the presenter of the world's largest bodybuilding apparel company, Gorilla Wear, and the Canadian [[sports nutrition]] supplement company Beverly Nutrition. In his youth from his personal trainer he was a bodybuilder - Eyal Hasson, but for the past three years his personal trainer was Dani Kaganovich, another young bodybuilder who has won several desirable degrees in the world.

Kobi is the only Israeli to win Mr. Universe Junior on behalf of the NABBA Association. As of 2019, Kobi holds a professional card ([[International Federation of BodyBuilding & Fitness]] pro), and one of the few Israelis to hold that card, and the youngest of them to win it (22).\n\n==Biography==\nIfrach was born and raised in [[Zichron Yaacov]], to an [[ultra-Orthodox]] religious home, which has eight brothers and sisters. Already at the age of 11 his older brother Meir exposed him to the world of [[bodybuilding]] he fell in love with. When he was young, he was sent to study at a [[yeshiva]] in [[Tiberias]], but he would usually leave for Torah lessons to work out in the gym.\n\nAt 16, Ifrach first competed in Mr. Israel on behalf of the NABBA Association, which won him second place in the youth category. In 2013, Kobi first won the Mr. Israel competition, where he lost in the final the year before. Kobi held the title of Mr. Israel on behalf of the NABBA Association until the age of 21 for four years, and from 2015 to 2016 he also won the title of champion of this competition. In July 2015, the young Ifrach won the title of Deputy Mr. World of Youth, in the competition held in [[Malta]], and in May a year later, again won second place, in the Mr. World of Competition held in [[Brazil]].\n\nIn October 2016, Ifrach won the grand title of his career so far, and was the first Israeli in decades of the competition to win it in his category. Ifrach won Mr. Univers on behalf of the NABBA Association. A year later, Yasper flourished again in this competition in [[Birmingham]], [[England]], with another Israeli, who for years served as Kobi's partner, Shalev Ledani. Since Kobi passed the age of 21, he knew he would not be able to enter this competition in October 2018, so he tried his luck in another competition - Top de Colmar, France, on April 8, 2018. Kobi reached this competition to compete in the Semi Pro category, where bodybuilders from the highest levels compete in the world, and is not limited in age. Ifrach won second place in this competition. A month later, he did it again and won Mr. Israel and the Champions Champion for the third time. On [[June 10]], he flew to [[Spain]] with his first trainer - Eyal Hasson, for the world's largest competition, [[Mr. Olympia]] Amateur. He won first place in the youth category up to the age of 24, and in fifth place with the same ranking as sixth, in the category \"Heavy Education up to 90 kg\". Inflorescence rose in the competition weighing 86&nbsp;kg, while still 1.69 meters.\n\nOn June 9, 2019, Ifrach won first place in the Mr. Olympia Amateur Championship, a status that earned him a professional ticket (IFBB pro) and placed him in the Israeli record book when he is one of the few to do so.\n\n==Personal life==\nSince 2016, Kobi Ifrach has served as the presenter of the world's largest bodybuilding apparel company, Gorilla Wear, and the Canadian [[sports nutrition]] supplement company Beverly Nutrition. In his youth from his personal trainer he was a bodybuilder - Eyal Hasson, but for the past three years his personal trainer was Dani Kaganovich, another young bodybuilder who has won several desirable degrees in the world. Kobi is a member of the NABBA Association, whose president of the Association is \"Mr. World\", June Hannah. From 2018 Kobi will blossom open a personal training and counseling program in bodybuilding, preparation for contests or even weight loss programs and weight loss regardless of competitions for the general capacitor. In 2019 Ifrach finished his circular with \"Beverly Nutrition\" and signed a contract with the Israeli [[dietary supplement]] company \"Amino\".\n\nIn February 2020 Kobi signed on a new contact with Beverly Nutrition to be their presenter at world bodybuilding shows.\n\n==References==\n* [https://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4873254,00.html Kosher beefcake: Israeli wins Mr. Universe]\n* [https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/kobi-ifrach-and-armand-peri-inspire-new-generation-of-bodybuilders/ Kobi Ifrach Inspire New Generation of Bodybuilders]\n\n[[Category:Israeli bodybuilders]]\n[[Category:1996 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:People from Zikhron Ya'akov]]\n", "name_user": "\u05e9\u05d9\u05dc\u05d5\u05e0\u05d9", "label": "safe", "comment": "corrections", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobi_Ifrach"}

It returned to North Coast Rep by popular demand in August 2008, and subsequently was seen at [[Central Michigan University]], Dick Enberg's alma mater on October 10, 2008.

NCAA Tournament]] at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, when McGuire blurted out \"Holy mackerel! Holy mackerel! Holy mackerel!\" following a game-winning buzzer beater by [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech]]'s James Forrest. The shot was the first three-pointer of Forrest's collegiate career in the first game McGuire broadcast for CBS.\n* Following his broadcast of a 1996 NCAA Regional Championship, McGuire garnered fame for dancing with the players of [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] who were celebrating their entry into the Final Four. He would do the same the following year with the players from the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]]. The Minnesota players proclaimed they wanted to \"Get down with Al!\"\n* McGuire's broadcasting career was capped by a warm and poignant reunion less than a year before his death. When Dick Enberg joined CBS Sports in 2000 after a long career with NBC, McGuire was able to be reunited with Enberg and longtime CBS commentator Billy Packer. On Feb. 5, 2000, the trio called its final game together when Michigan State easily defeated UCONN 85-66. It was the first game the trio had called in nineteen year when Indiana defeated North Carolina for the 1981 NCAA National Championship game for NBC.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of NCAA Division I Men's Final Four appearances by coach]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Find a Grave|6001545}}\n\n{{Navboxes| list1 =\n{{Belmont Abbey Crusaders men's basketball coach navbox}}\n{{Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball coach navbox}}\n{{Marquette Golden Eagles athletic director navbox}}\n{{1977 Marquette Warriors men's basketball navbox}}\n{{1992 Basketball HOF}}\n{{Basketball Hall of Fame coaches}}\n{{Associated Press College Basketball Coach of the Year}}\n{{NABC Coach of the Year}}\n{{UPI College Basketball Coach of the Year}}\n{{College Basketball on NBC}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGuire, Al}}\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Bullets (1944\u20131954) players]]\n[[Category:Basketball coaches from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Belmont Abbey Crusaders men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:College basketball announcers in the United States]]\n[[Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States]]\n[[Category:Deaths from leukemia]]\n[[Category:Marquette Golden Eagles athletic directors]]\n[[Category:Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:New York Knicks draft picks]]\n[[Category:New York Knicks players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:St. John's Red Storm men's basketball players]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox college coach\n| name = Al McGuire\n| image = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| birth_date = {{Birth date|1928|9|7}}\n| birth_place = [[New York City|New York City, New York]]\n| death_date = {{Death date and age|2001|1|26|1928|9|7}}\n| death_place = [[Brookfield, Wisconsin]]\n| alma_mater = \n| player_years1 = 1947\u20131951\n| player_team1 = [[St. John's Red Storm men's basketball|St. John's]]\n| player_years2 = 1951\u20131953\n| player_team2 = [[New York Knicks]]\n| player_years3 = 1953\u20131954\n| player_team3 = [[Baltimore Bullets (1944\u201354)|Baltimore Bullets]]\n| coach_years1 = 1955\u20131957\n| coach_team1 = [[Dartmouth Big Green men's basketball|Dartmouth]] (assistant)\n| coach_years2 = 1957\u20131964\n| coach_team2 = [[Belmont Abbey Crusaders men's basketball|Belmont Abbey]]\n| coach_years3 = 1964\u20131977\n| coach_team3 = [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette]]\n| overall_record = \n| bowl_record = \n| tournament_record = \n| championships = [[List of NCAA Division I men's basketball champions|NCAA Championship]] ([[1977 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1977]])<br>2\u00d7 [[NCAA Men's Division I Final Four appearances by coaches|Regional Championships - Final Four]] (1974, 1977)<br />[[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] champion ([[1970 NIT|1970]])\n| awards = AP Coach of the Year (1971)<br/>[[UPI College Basketball Coach of the Year|UPI Coach of the Year]] (1971)<br/>[[United States Basketball Writers Association|USBWA]] Coach of the Year (1971)<br />NABC Coach of the Year (1974)\n| coaching_records = \n| BASKHOF_year = 1992\n| CBBASKHOF_year = 2006\n}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| name = Al McGuire\n| image = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| title=Chairman of the [[President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports]]\n| term_start= 1980\n| term_end= 1981\n| president=[[Jimmy Carter]]\n| predecessor=[[Jerry Apodaca]]\n| successor=[[George Allen (American football coach)|George Allen]]\n}}\n'''Alfred Emanuel McGuire''' (September 7, 1928 \u2013 January 26, 2001) was an American [[college basketball]] coach and broadcaster, the head coach at [[Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball|Marquette University]] from [[1964\u201365 Marquette Warriors men's basketball team|1964]] to [[1976\u201377 Marquette Warriors men's basketball team|1977]].

Reflecting on the event ten years later, McGuire said that the 1979 title game in [[Jon M. Huntsman Center|Salt Lake City]] \"put college basketball on its [[afterburner]].\" That national championship game remains the highest-rated NCAA Final broadcast.\n\n==Death==\nAfter a long bout with [[leukemia]], McGuire died at age 72 in <!-- January 26-->2001 in [[Brookfield, Wisconsin]].<ref name=ergtrut/><ref name=lmtreno/>\n\n==Legacy==\nThe [[Al McGuire Center]], which includes a statue in his honor, opened on the Marquette campus in 2004.\n\nHe was elected to the [[Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame]] in 1993.\n\nMcGuire's brother [[Dick McGuire|Dick (Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductee 1993)]] was also a prominent figure in basketball, having starred at St. John's and then with the New York Knicks of the NBA.

McGuire is not related to the late [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|North Carolina]] and [[University of South Carolina|South Carolina]] coach [[Frank McGuire]]. Al and Frank coached against each other when Frank was head man at South Carolina. Al played for Frank at St. John's. Frank McGuire has been considered Al's coaching mentor.\n\nMcGuire was survived by his wife, Patricia, three children, sons [[Allie McGuire|Allie]] (who played for his father at Marquette) and Rob and daughter Noreen, and six grandchildren.\n\n==Play==\nAl McGuire's former television broadcast partner and friend, [[Dick Enberg]], penned a one-man theatrical play entitled ''Coach'' portrayed by actor [[Cotter Smith]].\n\nIt debuted at Marquette University's Helfaer Theater in 2005, and returned there by popular demand in 2006.  The play was then presented at the Alliance Theatre in [[Atlanta]] during the 2007 Final Four Championship, at [[Hofstra University]] in February 2008, and at the North Coast Repertory in San Diego County in April 2008. It returned to North Coast Rep by popular demand in August 2008, and subsequently was seen at [[Central Michigan University]], Dick Enberg's alma mater on October 10, 2008.

CBS Sports' [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|March Madness]]\n* Perhaps his most famous line as a commentator came during the [[1992 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|1992 NCAA Tournament]] at the Bradley Center in Milwaukee, when McGuire blurted out \"Holy mackerel! Holy mackerel! Holy mackerel!\" following a game-winning buzzer beater by [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets men's basketball|Georgia Tech]]'s James Forrest. The shot was the first three-pointer of Forrest's collegiate career in the first game McGuire broadcast for CBS.\n* Following his broadcast of a 1996 NCAA Regional Championship, McGuire garnered fame for dancing with the players of [[Syracuse Orange men's basketball|Syracuse]] who were celebrating their entry into the Final Four. He would do the same the following year with the players from the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|University of Minnesota]]. The Minnesota players proclaimed they wanted to \"Get down with Al!\"\n* McGuire's broadcasting career was capped by a warm and poignant reunion less than a year before his death. When Dick Enberg joined CBS Sports in 2000 after a long career with NBC, McGuire was able to be reunited with Enberg and longtime CBS commentator Billy Packer. On Feb. 5, 2000, the trio called its final game together when Michigan State easily defeated UCONN 85-66. It was the first game the trio had called in nineteen year when Indiana defeated North Carolina for the 1981 NCAA National Championship game for NBC.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of NCAA Division I Men's Final Four appearances by coach]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n{{wikiquote}}\n* {{Find a Grave|6001545}}\n\n{{Navboxes| list1 =\n{{Belmont Abbey Crusaders men's basketball coach navbox}}\n{{Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball coach navbox}}\n{{Marquette Golden Eagles athletic director navbox}}\n{{1977 Marquette Warriors men's basketball navbox}}\n{{1992 Basketball HOF}}\n{{Basketball Hall of Fame coaches}}\n{{Associated Press College Basketball Coach of the Year}}\n{{NABC Coach of the Year}}\n{{UPI College Basketball Coach of the Year}}\n{{College Basketball on NBC}}\n}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:McGuire, Al}}\n[[Category:1928 births]]\n[[Category:2001 deaths]]\n[[Category:American men's basketball players]]\n[[Category:Baltimore Bullets (1944\u20131954) players]]\n[[Category:Basketball coaches from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Basketball players from New York (state)]]\n[[Category:Belmont Abbey Crusaders men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:Deaths from cancer in Wisconsin]]\n[[Category:College basketball announcers in the United States]]\n[[Category:College men's basketball head coaches in the United States]]\n[[Category:Deaths from leukemia]]\n[[Category:Marquette Golden Eagles athletic directors]]\n[[Category:Marquette Golden Eagles men's basketball coaches]]\n[[Category:National Collegiate Basketball Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame inductees]]\n[[Category:New York Knicks draft picks]]\n[[Category:New York Knicks players]]\n[[Category:Sportspeople from Brooklyn]]\n[[Category:St. John's Red Storm men's basketball players]]\n", "name_user": "Joeykai", "label": "safe", "comment": "clean up", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Al_McGuire"}

Created, written, and directed by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], and produced by [[Ash Atalla]], the programme follows the day-to-day lives of office employees in the [[Slough]] branch of the fictional Wernham Hogg paper company. Gervais also stars in the series, playing the central character [[David Brent]].\n\nTwo six-episode series were made, along with a pair of extended [[The Office Christmas Specials|Christmas specials]]. When it was first shown on BBC Two, ratings were relatively low, but it has since become one of the most successful of all British comedy exports. As well as being shown internationally on [[BBC Worldwide]], channels such as [[BBC Prime]], [[BBC America]], and [[BBC Canada]], the series has been sold to broadcasters in over 80 countries, including [[ABC1]] in Australia, [[The Comedy Network]] in Canada, [[TVNZ]] in New Zealand, and the pan-Asian [[satellite television|satellite channel]] [[STAR World]], based in Hong Kong. The show was first shown in the United States on BBC America in 2003, and later on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] from 2009 to 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Office comes to Adult Swim |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/04/29/the-office-comes-to-adult-swim |accessdate=25 May 2019 |agency=IGN}}</ref>\n\nThe show centres on themes of social clumsiness, the trivialities of human behaviour, self-importance and conceit, frustration, desperation and fame. The protagonist David Brent was influenced by [[Basil Fawlty]] (played by [[John Cleese]]) from the acclaimed BBC sitcom ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fawlty Towers 40th anniversary: Britain's finest sitcom was TV's most perfectly constructed farce |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/fawlty-towers-40th-anniversary-britains-finest-sitcom-was-tvs-most-perfectly-constructed-farce-10506552.html |accessdate=25 May 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref> The success of ''The Office'' led to a number of localised adaptations (based upon its basic story and themes) being produced for the television markets of other nations, resulting in [[The Office|an international ''Office'' franchise]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Garrison|first=Laura Turner|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|work=Splitsider}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe show is a mockumentary based in a branch of a large paper company called Wernham Hogg (where \"life is stationery\"), in the [[Slough Trading Estate]] in [[Berkshire]]. Slough is a large town immortalised for its lack of appeal by [[John Betjeman]] in his poem \"[[Slough (poem)|Slough]]\" (\"Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough/It isn't fit for humans now...\").<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://worlds-poetry.com/john_betjeman/slough|title=John Betjeman: Slough|work=Worlds Poetry|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref>\nThe office is headed by general manager David Brent (Gervais), aided by his team leader and Assistant to the Regional Manager [[Gareth Keenan]], played by [[Mackenzie Crook]]. Much of the series' comedic success stems from Brent, who frequently makes attempts to win favour with his employees and peers with embarrassing or disastrous results. Brent's character flaws are used to comic effect, including numerous verbal gaffes, inadvertent [[racism in the United Kingdom|racism]] and [[sexism]], and other social [[wikt:faux pas|faux pas]].\n\nThe other main plot line of the series, and many of the more human elements found therein, come from the unassuming [[Tim Canterbury]] ([[Martin Freeman]]), whose relationship with bored receptionist [[Dawn Tinsley]] ([[Lucy Davis]]) is a major [[story arc|arc]] in the series. Their flirtation soon builds to a mutual romantic attraction, despite her [[engagement]] to dour and laddish warehouse worker Lee ([[Joel Beckett]]).\n\n==Characters==\n{{For|A comparison between characters in different series|The Office#Counterparts}}\n: <small>{{Color box|#bfd|border=darkgray}} = [[Ensemble cast|Main cast]] (credited) </small>\n: <small>{{Color box|#ffdddd|border=darkgray}} = [[Recurring character|Recurring cast]] (4+)</small>\n: <small>{{Color box|#ADD8E6|border=darkgray}} = [[Guest appearance|Guest cast]] (1-3)</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"5\" | Appearances\n|-\n!

Insecure, and totally [[narcissistic]], he believes he is a successful [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]] in the business world and a [[Renaissance man]], talented in philosophy, music and comedy. Although he thinks he is patient, funny and popular, others perceive him as annoying, rude and selfish. His immature behaviour comes across as he bumbles around the office \u2013 always hovering around the camera \u2013 telling unfunny jokes, performing hackneyed impressions, and generally getting into trouble by talking before thinking. Brent thinks he is a kind, [[political correctness|politically correct]] man, but his preoccupation with this position, and the discrepancy between it and his often patronising (and at times offensive) jokes, gets him into trouble. His cluelessness regarding his awkwardness, his lack of empathy, his unquenchable thirst for gratification, and his ridiculous way of trying to save face are the driving comical forces of this show.\n\n====Tim Canterbury====\n{{Main|Tim Canterbury}}\nTim Canterbury is a sales representative at Wernham Hogg. Unlike David, Tim is witty and considerate. His humour and kindness make him one of the most likeable employees in the office, but at 30 he still lives with his parents and works at a job he believes to be completely pointless. He maintains his sanity by pursuing an improbable romance with receptionist Dawn Tinsley and by playing practical jokes on Gareth. Although he wishes to leave Wernham Hogg to study psychology, his insecurity prevents him from taking any significant action. During Series One and Two, he also fails to further pursue a relationship with Dawn. Chosen as David's successor at the end of series 2, he declines and lets Gareth take the position, which, however, does not keep him from playing pranks on Gareth.\n\n====Gareth Keenan====\n{{Main|Gareth Keenan}}\nGareth Keenan is Tim's selfish deskmate and enemy. Gareth is a humourless [[jobsworth]] with few good personality traits. He is obsessed with his military service in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and annoys Tim with his pretentious comments. He takes pride in being \"[[Team Leader]]\", not realising his title is mostly meaningless, and he imposes the little authority he has on his co-workers. He is stubborn and insensitive. Tim and Dawn repeatedly insinuate [[homosexuality]] through questioning him about his military experience using [[double entendre]]s. Apparently proud of his close connections with David and glossing over David's poor treatment of him, he later \u2013 during the Christmas special \u2013 gets back at David by patronising and humiliating him in front of the cameras.\n\n====Dawn Tinsley====\n{{Main|Dawn Tinsley}}\nDawn Tinsley is the company receptionist and Brent's [[dogsbody]]. She frequently has to put up with his attempts at humour and social interaction. Like her friend and co-worker Tim, she is aware of the sad state of her life \u2013 she has been in a long, rocky engagement with her fianc\u00e9 Lee, a surly warehouse worker, and gave up illustrating children's books to pursue her current fruitless career. During the Christmas special, Dawn and Lee return from their illegally prolonged US vacation.\n\n====Jennifer Taylor-Clarke====\n{{Main|Jennifer Taylor-Clarke}}\nJennifer Taylor-Clarke ([[Stirling Gallacher]]) was Brent's immediate superior in Series One. Nicknamed [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] by him, she is a serious-minded professional, and Brent's behaviour and comedy-driven style of management are shown to be puerile and ineffectual by contrast. At the end of Series One she is made a partner in the firm and, during series 2, repeatedly reprimands David for inappropriate behaviour.\n\n====Ricky Howard====\nRicky Howard ([[Oliver Chris]]) was introduced as Brent's new [[Temporary work|temp]] in the pilot, and a recent graduate. He was prominently featured in episode three, where he and Tim form a team for trivia night. The two end up winning, successfully answering a tie-breaker question on Shakespeare against Finch. His past experiences at game shows, including winning ''[[Blockbusters (British game show)|Blockbusters]]'', causes Finch to wind him up after beating him and Tim at \"Throwing\" claiming \"Screw Blockbusters, Screw [[Bob Holness]] and screw your Gold Run!\".\n\n====Chris Finch====\n{{Main|Chris Finch}}\nChris Finch (\"Finchy\") ([[Ralph Ineson]]) is a \"bloody good\" outside sales representative, he is the only character in the series who is genuinely and deliberately narcissistic. He is brashly confident, rasping-voiced with a natural flair for bullying others with swift, humiliating putdowns, Brent being his usual target. He likes to dominate conversations and is successful with women, but shows a humourless violent attitude when he loses the staff quiz in Series One. David describes him as his \"best friend\" but actually acts more like a lackey, laughing at his jokes and attempting to impress him to feel popular only to be repaid with verbal abuse. Finch is such a bad loser at the quiz, he exclaims he and Brent can beat the team who beat them at many other things, so decides he can beat them at \"Throwing\", and if he throws anything they choose over the building, they will win the quiz and the champagne instead (which they eventually do, with Tim's shoe being the nominated object). In the [[The Office Christmas specials#Part 2|Christmas Special]], David finally stands up to Chris.\n\n====Neil Godwin====\n{{Main|Neil Godwin}}\nNeil Godwin ([[Patrick Baladi]]) is Brent's counterpart at the [[Swindon]] branch and eventually his immediate superior. He is young, charming, professional and energetic, a more competent manager than Brent, and has a better relationship with staff. Brent is hugely resentful and jealous of him, and makes occasional, often childish attempts to either undermine or rival him. He grows increasingly exasperated with Brent's incompetence, poor judgement and failure to do his job properly and is therefore instrumental in David's redundancy.\n\n====Rachel====\nRachel ([[Stacey Roca]]) is a bubbly and attractive co-worker who starts a relationship with Tim. After a deluded Gareth reveals his plans to seduce her, Tim is shocked when she begins to pressure him to make a greater commitment. He realises that his ongoing love for Dawn is far greater than his feelings for Rachel and breaks off the relationship.\n\n====Anne====\nAnne ([[Elizabeth Berrington]]): Only appearing in the Christmas special, she is Tim's pregnant desk mate. She annoys him as she speaks continuously about herself and other topics no-one else is interested in. She coldly tells David that no one is interested in his invitation to go out for a drink, causing discomfort amongst her co-workers. However, an encounter with Glynn at the office party causes her to run out of the office in tears.\n\n===Secondary characters===\nSeveral other recurring characters, although not central to the episodes, play an important role in the series. These include:\n\n<!---Recurring in both series--->\n* Keith Bishop ([[Ewen MacIntosh]]): Keith works in the accounts department. Heavy set, slow-talking and apparently emotionless, he is a man of few words. When he does speak, his comments can be eloquent and sometimes disturbing.\n* Lee ([[Joel Beckett]]): Dawn's fianc\u00e9 who works in the company's warehouse. She met him in school and they have been together ever since. Lee is humourless, dull, and controlling. He often undermines and embarrasses Dawn, and is dismissive of her ideas of being an illustrator. His idea of a romantic proposal was a four-word notice in the newspaper \u2014 \"Lee love Dawn. Marriage?\". It is clear from an early stage that she stays with him out of a fear of loneliness rather than real love. Lee has a somewhat violent temper, which is shown when he holds Tim against a wall, simply for starting to dance with Dawn.\n* Glynn aka Taffy ([[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]]): The [[misogynistic]], sexist warehouse manager at the company and Lee's supervisor, who is seen as being very slack and has little respect for anyone who works outside the warehouse, particularly management.\n<!---Recurring in Series 1--->\n* Malcolm (Robin Hooper): An older staff member, he is naturally most worried about the prospect of redundancies and therefore often challenges Brent's handling of the situation, criticising his relaxed attitude, his lack of management ability and several incidents, such as hiring a personal secretary when the office is facing redundancies. Brent openly dislikes him, sneering at Malcolm's criticisms and openly lying about \"faking\" the high blood pressure that cost him a promotion and saved the Slough office from closure. Malcolm does not appear in Series Two, having presumably been made redundant.\n* Donna ([[Sally Bretton]]): Introduced in series 1, episode 2 as the daughter of Brent's friends Ron and Elaine, who has come to work at the office. She makes a quick impact in the office, starting a relationship with Ricky, but fails to reciprocate Keenan's romantic feelings towards her.\n* Karen Roper (Nicola Cotter): Brent's personal secretary, hired because he insists that he needs an assistant. Several of the staff are apprehensive about Brent hiring new and unnecessary personnel while the branch is facing downsizing and redundancies. She is not seen in Series Two due to David proclaiming she was 'Last in, first out'.\n<!---Recurring in Series 2--->\n* Trudy (Rachel Isaac): Welsh Trudy is first introduced in Series Two as one of several of the new intake from the Swindon branch. Almost immediately, she establishes herself as something of a good-time girl, blending in well with the rest of the staff and enjoying a booze-fuelled birthday celebration in her honour at the office. Her casual, sexually charged nature does not go unnoticed by the male members of staff, with David often trying to take advantage of this only to be ignored.\n* Oliver (Howard Saddler): Oliver is good-natured and tolerant, which is lucky for him as he is the only black person working in the office. Because of this he becomes the target for most of David's well-meaning but hideously misguided attempts to show what a politically correct and racially tolerant man he is.\n* Brenda ([[Julie Fernandez]]): Brenda naturally brings out the worst in Brent; she is not impressed by his patronising behaviour. She highlights the gap between Brent's vision of himself as a modern enlightened man and the reality of his ignorance and thoughtlessness. She uses a wheelchair, which results in her being stranded on a stairwell during a fire drill when David and Gareth decide they cannot be bothered to carry her all the way down.\n<!---Short appearances--->\n* Rowan ([[Vincent Franklin]]): A training facilitator who is progressively frustrated by Brent's attempts to undermine and take control of a team training session, often forcing it to veer off track.\n* Simon ([[Matthew Holness]]): Working in [[information technology|IT]], he visits the office to install [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] software on the computers while discussing his theories with Keenan about [[Bruce Lee]] faking his own death so that he could go undercover and fight the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]]. An arrogant show-off and boaster, he claims to be the record holder of the fastest lap down at 'SuperKarts', something which he claims experts have said would make him the best [[Formula 1]] racer in the country.\n* Ray ([[Tom Goodman-Hill]]) and Jude ([[Jennifer Hennessy]]): The only two recurring characters in Series Two who do not work for Wernham Hogg. Instead, they work for a consultancy firm that organises business management seminars. They approach Brent about being a guest speaker at one of the seminars but are totally unimpressed with his unorthodox presentation on motivational techniques.\n* Helena ([[Olivia Colman]]): A reporter for the internal paper merchant newspaper \"Inside Paper\" who finds interviewing Brent quite difficult because he attempts to dictate what she should write in her article.\n* Carol (Sandy Hendrickse): Brent's [[blind date]] with whom he hits it off and who seems to like him.\n* Oggy aka 'The Ogg Monster' ([[Stephen Merchant]]): One of Gareth's best friends. His real name is Nathan.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Ricky Gervais]] as [[David Brent]]\n*[[Martin Freeman]] as [[Tim Canterbury]]\n*[[Mackenzie Crook]] as [[Gareth Keenan]]\n*[[Lucy Davis]] as [[Dawn Tinsley]]\n*[[Stirling Gallacher]] as [[Jennifer Taylor-Clarke]]\n*[[Oliver Chris]] as Ricky Howard\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Chris Finch]]\n*[[Patrick Baladi]] as [[Neil Godwin]]\n*[[Stacey Roca]] as Rachel\n*[[Elizabeth Berrington]] as Anne\n\n===Minor cast===\n<!-- (incomplete)-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n====Series 1 and 2====\n*[[Joel Beckett]] as Lee\n*Jamie Deeks as Jamie\n*Jane Lucas as Sheila\n*[[Ewen MacIntosh]] as Keith Bishop\n*Emma Manton as Emma\n*Ron Merchant as Gordon\n*Alexander Perkins as Ralph\n*Phillip Pickard as Phillip\n*[[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]] as Glynn \"Taffy\"\n{{col-3}}\n\n====Series 1 only====\n*[[Sally Bretton]] as Donna\n*Angela Clerkin as Jackie\n*Yvonne D'Alpra as Joan\n*Robin Hooper as Malcolm\n*[[Vincent Franklin]] as Rowan (training facilitator)\n*Nicola Cotter as Karen Roper\n{{col-3}}\n\n====Series 2 only====\n*[[Julie Fernandez]] as Brenda\n*[[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Ray\n*[[Jennifer Hennessy]] as Jude\n*[[Matthew Holness]] as Simon (the computer geek)\n*[[Stephen Merchant]] as Oggy\n*[[Bruce Mackinnon]] as Jimmy the Perv\n*Rachel Isaac as Trudy\n*Tony MacMurray as Tony\n*Howard Saddler as Oliver\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Office (British TV series) episodes}}\n\nIn total, there are fourteen episodes of ''The Office'': six in each series and two 45-minute Christmas special episodes.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe show has received critical acclaim, and has been regarded as one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/top/|title=Top 50 TV Sitcoms - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Series one currently holds a [[Metacritic]] score of 98 out of 100, based on 12 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk|title=The Office (UK)|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Series two received similar acclaim, holding a [[Metacritic]] score of 93 out of 100, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk/season-2|title=The Office (UK)|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> [[The Office Christmas specials|''The Office'' Christmas specials]] were also well received, and hold a [[Metacritic]] score of 98 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk/season-3|title=The Office (UK)|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> ''The Office'' was named by ''The Telegraph'' as one of the 10 best TV sitcoms of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10121664/The-10-best-TV-sitcoms-of-all-time.html|title=The 10 best TV sitcoms of all time|first=Gerard O'Donovan, Ben Lawrence, Chris Harvey, Andrew Pettie, Neil Midgley and Michael|last=Hogan|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> In 2019, the series was ranked 6th on ''[[The Guardian]]'''s list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |title= The 100 best TV shows of the 21st century |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/100-best-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century |website=The Guardian |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nAt the [[British Comedy Awards]] in 2001, ''The Office'' won the Best New TV Comedy award.

In 2004, [[Microsoft|Microsoft UK]] commissioned two 20-minute corporate videos featuring Brent being interviewed by Jeff Merchant (played by Stephen Merchant), a Microsoft employee who becomes increasingly exasperated by Brent's antics. Brent is obviously resentful of the company's success. He believes he has what it takes to become the next managing director of Microsoft and continually drops hints to that effect. While not on general release, the videos emerged on the Internet in 2006. The clips also appeared on certain [[peer-to-peer]] networks. Microsoft was unhappy with the leak, stating that the videos \"were never intended to be viewed by the public\".<ref>{{cite news  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Microsoft unhappy at Gervais leak   | work =   | publisher = BBC News  | date = 30 August 2006  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5298376.stm  | doi =   | accessdate = 23 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Comic Relief: \"The Office Revisited\"====\nAdditionally, a Comic Relief charity short was made in 2013 entitled \"The Office Revisited\"\n\n===Online===\nIn 2013 Gervais developed a series of videos, and released them on his YouTube channel entitled \"[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPf6bUqN1Brt7YUifE52IEJV4l553NZ1v Learn Guitar with David Brent]\".

Created, written, and directed by [[Ricky Gervais]] and [[Stephen Merchant]], and produced by [[Ash Atalla]], the programme follows the day-to-day lives of office employees in the [[Slough]] branch of the fictional Wernham Hogg paper company. Gervais also stars in the series, playing the central character [[David Brent]].\n\nTwo six-episode series were made, along with a pair of extended [[The Office Christmas Specials|Christmas specials]]. When it was first shown on BBC Two, ratings were relatively low, but it has since become one of the most successful of all British comedy exports. As well as being shown internationally on [[BBC Worldwide]], channels such as [[BBC Prime]], [[BBC America]], and [[BBC Canada]], the series has been sold to broadcasters in over 80 countries, including [[ABC1]] in Australia, [[The Comedy Network]] in Canada, [[TVNZ]] in New Zealand, and the pan-Asian [[satellite television|satellite channel]] [[STAR World]], based in Hong Kong. The show was first shown in the United States on BBC America in 2003, and later on [[Cartoon Network]]'s late night programming block [[Adult Swim]] from 2009 to 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title=The Office comes to Adult Swim |url=https://uk.ign.com/articles/2009/04/29/the-office-comes-to-adult-swim |accessdate=25 May 2019 |agency=IGN}}</ref>\n\nThe show centres on themes of social clumsiness, the trivialities of human behaviour, self-importance and conceit, frustration, desperation and fame. The protagonist David Brent was influenced by [[Basil Fawlty]] (played by [[John Cleese]]) from the acclaimed BBC sitcom ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fawlty Towers 40th anniversary: Britain's finest sitcom was TV's most perfectly constructed farce |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/fawlty-towers-40th-anniversary-britains-finest-sitcom-was-tvs-most-perfectly-constructed-farce-10506552.html |accessdate=25 May 2019 |work=The Independent}}</ref> The success of ''The Office'' led to a number of localised adaptations (based upon its basic story and themes) being produced for the television markets of other nations, resulting in [[The Office|an international ''Office'' franchise]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Garrison|first=Laura Turner|title=Exploring the International Franchises of The Office|url=http://splitsider.com/2011/05/exploring-the-international-franchises-of-the-office/|work=Splitsider}}</ref>\n\n==Premise==\nThe show is a mockumentary based in a branch of a large paper company called Wernham Hogg (where \"life is stationery\"), in the [[Slough Trading Estate]] in [[Berkshire]]. Slough is a large town immortalised for its lack of appeal by [[John Betjeman]] in his poem \"[[Slough (poem)|Slough]]\" (\"Come, friendly bombs and fall on Slough/It isn't fit for humans now...\").<ref>{{citeweb|url=http://worlds-poetry.com/john_betjeman/slough|title=John Betjeman: Slough|work=Worlds Poetry|accessdate=29 January 2015}}</ref>\nThe office is headed by general manager David Brent (Gervais), aided by his team leader and Assistant to the Regional Manager [[Gareth Keenan]], played by [[Mackenzie Crook]]. Much of the series' comedic success stems from Brent, who frequently makes attempts to win favour with his employees and peers with embarrassing or disastrous results. Brent's character flaws are used to comic effect, including numerous verbal gaffes, inadvertent [[racism in the United Kingdom|racism]] and [[sexism]], and other social [[wikt:faux pas|faux pas]].\n\nThe other main plot line of the series, and many of the more human elements found therein, come from the unassuming [[Tim Canterbury]] ([[Martin Freeman]]), whose relationship with bored receptionist [[Dawn Tinsley]] ([[Lucy Davis]]) is a major [[story arc|arc]] in the series. Their flirtation soon builds to a mutual romantic attraction, despite her [[engagement]] to dour and laddish warehouse worker Lee ([[Joel Beckett]]).\n\n==Characters==\n{{For|A comparison between characters in different series|The Office#Counterparts}}\n: <small>{{Color box|#bfd|border=darkgray}} = [[Ensemble cast|Main cast]] (credited) </small>\n: <small>{{Color box|#ffdddd|border=darkgray}} = [[Recurring character|Recurring cast]] (4+)</small>\n: <small>{{Color box|#ADD8E6|border=darkgray}} = [[Guest appearance|Guest cast]] (1-3)</small>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Actor\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Character\n! colspan=\"5\" | Appearances\n|-\n!

Insecure, and totally [[narcissistic]], he believes he is a successful [[wiktionary:maverick|maverick]] in the business world and a [[Renaissance man]], talented in philosophy, music and comedy. Although he thinks he is patient, funny and popular, others perceive him as annoying, rude and selfish. His immature behaviour comes across as he bumbles around the office \u2013 always hovering around the camera \u2013 telling unfunny jokes, performing hackneyed impressions, and generally getting into trouble by talking before thinking. Brent thinks he is a kind, [[political correctness|politically correct]] man, but his preoccupation with this position, and the discrepancy between it and his often patronising (and at times offensive) jokes, gets him into trouble. His cluelessness regarding his awkwardness, his lack of empathy, his unquenchable thirst for gratification, and his ridiculous way of trying to save face are the driving comical forces of this show.\n\n====Tim Canterbury====\n{{Main|Tim Canterbury}}\nTim Canterbury is a sales representative at Wernham Hogg. Unlike David, Tim is witty and considerate. His humour and kindness make him one of the most likeable employees in the office, but at 30 he still lives with his parents and works at a job he believes to be completely pointless. He maintains his sanity by pursuing an improbable romance with receptionist Dawn Tinsley and by playing practical jokes on Gareth. Although he wishes to leave Wernham Hogg to study psychology, his insecurity prevents him from taking any significant action. During Series One and Two, he also fails to further pursue a relationship with Dawn. Chosen as David's successor at the end of series 2, he declines and lets Gareth take the position, which, however, does not keep him from playing pranks on Gareth.\n\n====Gareth Keenan====\n{{Main|Gareth Keenan}}\nGareth Keenan is Tim's selfish deskmate and enemy. Gareth is a humourless [[jobsworth]] with few good personality traits. He is obsessed with his military service in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and annoys Tim with his pretentious comments. He takes pride in being \"[[Team Leader]]\", not realising his title is mostly meaningless, and he imposes the little authority he has on his co-workers. He is stubborn and insensitive. Tim and Dawn repeatedly insinuate [[homosexuality]] through questioning him about his military experience using [[double entendre]]s. Apparently proud of his close connections with David and glossing over David's poor treatment of him, he later \u2013 during the Christmas special \u2013 gets back at David by patronising and humiliating him in front of the cameras.\n\n====Dawn Tinsley====\n{{Main|Dawn Tinsley}}\nDawn Tinsley is the company receptionist and Brent's [[dogsbody]]. She frequently has to put up with his attempts at humour and social interaction. Like her friend and co-worker Tim, she is aware of the sad state of her life \u2013 she has been in a long, rocky engagement with her fianc\u00e9 Lee, a surly warehouse worker, and gave up illustrating children's books to pursue her current fruitless career. During the Christmas special, Dawn and Lee return from their illegally prolonged US vacation.\n\n====Jennifer Taylor-Clarke====\n{{Main|Jennifer Taylor-Clarke}}\nJennifer Taylor-Clarke ([[Stirling Gallacher]]) was Brent's immediate superior in Series One. Nicknamed [[Camilla Parker Bowles]] by him, she is a serious-minded professional, and Brent's behaviour and comedy-driven style of management are shown to be puerile and ineffectual by contrast. At the end of Series One she is made a partner in the firm and, during series 2, repeatedly reprimands David for inappropriate behaviour.\n\n====Ricky Howard====\nRicky Howard ([[Oliver Chris]]) was introduced as Brent's new [[Temporary work|temp]] in the pilot, and a recent graduate. He was prominently featured in episode three, where he and Tim form a team for trivia night. The two end up winning, successfully answering a tie-breaker question on Shakespeare against Finch. His past experiences at game shows, including winning ''[[Blockbusters (British game show)|Blockbusters]]'', causes Finch to wind him up after beating him and Tim at \"Throwing\" claiming \"Screw Blockbusters, Screw [[Bob Holness]] and screw your Gold Run!\".\n\n====Chris Finch====\n{{Main|Chris Finch}}\nChris Finch (\"Finchy\") ([[Ralph Ineson]]) is a \"bloody good\" outside sales representative, he is the only character in the series who is genuinely and deliberately narcissistic. He is brashly confident, rasping-voiced with a natural flair for bullying others with swift, humiliating putdowns, Brent being his usual target. He likes to dominate conversations and is successful with women, but shows a humourless violent attitude when he loses the staff quiz in Series One. David describes him as his \"best friend\" but actually acts more like a lackey, laughing at his jokes and attempting to impress him to feel popular only to be repaid with verbal abuse. Finch is such a bad loser at the quiz, he exclaims he and Brent can beat the team who beat them at many other things, so decides he can beat them at \"Throwing\", and if he throws anything they choose over the building, they will win the quiz and the champagne instead (which they eventually do, with Tim's shoe being the nominated object). In the [[The_Office_Christmas_specials#Part_2|Christmas Special]], David finally stands up to Chris.\n\n====Neil Godwin====\n{{Main|Neil Godwin}}\nNeil Godwin ([[Patrick Baladi]]) is Brent's counterpart at the [[Swindon]] branch and eventually his immediate superior. He is young, charming, professional and energetic, a more competent manager than Brent, and has a better relationship with staff. Brent is hugely resentful and jealous of him, and makes occasional, often childish attempts to either undermine or rival him. He grows increasingly exasperated with Brent's incompetence, poor judgement and failure to do his job properly and is therefore instrumental in David's redundancy.\n\n====Rachel====\nRachel ([[Stacey Roca]]) is a bubbly and attractive co-worker who starts a relationship with Tim. After a deluded Gareth reveals his plans to seduce her, Tim is shocked when she begins to pressure him to make a greater commitment. He realises that his ongoing love for Dawn is far greater than his feelings for Rachel and breaks off the relationship.\n\n====Anne====\nAnne ([[Elizabeth Berrington]]): Only appearing in the Christmas special, she is Tim's pregnant desk mate. She annoys him as she speaks continuously about herself and other topics no-one else is interested in. She coldly tells David that no one is interested in his invitation to go out for a drink, causing discomfort amongst her co-workers. However, an encounter with Glynn at the office party causes her to run out of the office in tears.\n\n===Secondary characters===\nSeveral other recurring characters, although not central to the episodes, play an important role in the series. These include:\n\n<!---Recurring in both series--->\n* Keith Bishop ([[Ewen MacIntosh]]): Keith works in the accounts department. Heavy set, slow-talking and apparently emotionless, he is a man of few words. When he does speak, his comments can be eloquent and sometimes disturbing.\n* Lee ([[Joel Beckett]]): Dawn's fianc\u00e9 who works in the company's warehouse. She met him in school and they have been together ever since. Lee is humourless, dull, and controlling. He often undermines and embarrasses Dawn, and is dismissive of her ideas of being an illustrator. His idea of a romantic proposal was a four-word notice in the newspaper \u2014 \"Lee love Dawn. Marriage?\". It is clear from an early stage that she stays with him out of a fear of loneliness rather than real love. Lee has a somewhat violent temper, which is shown when he holds Tim against a wall, simply for starting to dance with Dawn.\n* Glynn aka Taffy ([[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]]): The [[misogynistic]], sexist warehouse manager at the company and Lee's supervisor, who is seen as being very slack and has little respect for anyone who works outside the warehouse, particularly management.\n<!---Recurring in Series 1--->\n* Malcolm (Robin Hooper): An older staff member, he is naturally most worried about the prospect of redundancies and therefore often challenges Brent's handling of the situation, criticising his relaxed attitude, his lack of management ability and several incidents, such as hiring a personal secretary when the office is facing redundancies. Brent openly dislikes him, sneering at Malcolm's criticisms and openly lying about \"faking\" the high blood pressure that cost him a promotion and saved the Slough office from closure. Malcolm does not appear in Series Two, having presumably been made redundant.\n* Donna ([[Sally Bretton]]): Introduced in series 1, episode 2 as the daughter of Brent's friends Ron and Elaine, who has come to work at the office. She makes a quick impact in the office, starting a relationship with Ricky, but fails to reciprocate Keenan's romantic feelings towards her.\n* Karen Roper (Nicola Cotter): Brent's personal secretary, hired because he insists that he needs an assistant. Several of the staff are apprehensive about Brent hiring new and unnecessary personnel while the branch is facing downsizing and redundancies. She is not seen in Series Two due to David proclaiming she was 'Last in, first out'.\n<!---Recurring in Series 2--->\n* Trudy (Rachel Isaac): Welsh Trudy is first introduced in Series Two as one of several of the new intake from the Swindon branch. Almost immediately, she establishes herself as something of a good-time girl, blending in well with the rest of the staff and enjoying a booze-fuelled birthday celebration in her honour at the office. Her casual, sexually charged nature does not go unnoticed by the male members of staff, with David often trying to take advantage of this only to be ignored.\n* Oliver (Howard Saddler): Oliver is good-natured and tolerant, which is lucky for him as he is the only black person working in the office. Because of this he becomes the target for most of David's well-meaning but hideously misguided attempts to show what a politically correct and racially tolerant man he is.\n* Brenda ([[Julie Fernandez]]): Brenda naturally brings out the worst in Brent; she is not impressed by his patronising behaviour. She highlights the gap between Brent's vision of himself as a modern enlightened man and the reality of his ignorance and thoughtlessness. She uses a wheelchair, which results in her being stranded on a stairwell during a fire drill when David and Gareth decide they cannot be bothered to carry her all the way down.\n<!---Short appearances--->\n* Rowan ([[Vincent Franklin]]): A training facilitator who is progressively frustrated by Brent's attempts to undermine and take control of a team training session, often forcing it to veer off track.\n* Simon ([[Matthew Holness]]): Working in [[information technology|IT]], he visits the office to install [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] software on the computers while discussing his theories with Keenan about [[Bruce Lee]] faking his own death so that he could go undercover and fight the [[Triad (underground society)|Triads]]. An arrogant show-off and boaster, he claims to be the record holder of the fastest lap down at 'SuperKarts', something which he claims experts have said would make him the best [[Formula 1]] racer in the country.\n* Ray ([[Tom Goodman-Hill]]) and Jude ([[Jennifer Hennessy]]): The only two recurring characters in Series Two who do not work for Wernham Hogg. Instead, they work for a consultancy firm that organises business management seminars. They approach Brent about being a guest speaker at one of the seminars but are totally unimpressed with his unorthodox presentation on motivational techniques.\n* Helena ([[Olivia Colman]]): A reporter for the internal paper merchant newspaper \"Inside Paper\" who finds interviewing Brent quite difficult because he attempts to dictate what she should write in her article.\n* Carol (Sandy Hendrickse): Brent's [[blind date]] with whom he hits it off and who seems to like him.\n* Oggy aka 'The Ogg Monster' ([[Stephen Merchant]]): One of Gareth's best friends. His real name is Nathan.\n\n==Cast==\n===Main cast===\n*[[Ricky Gervais]] as [[David Brent]]\n*[[Martin Freeman]] as [[Tim Canterbury]]\n*[[Mackenzie Crook]] as [[Gareth Keenan]]\n*[[Lucy Davis]] as [[Dawn Tinsley]]\n*[[Stirling Gallacher]] as [[Jennifer Taylor-Clarke]]\n*[[Oliver Chris]] as Ricky Howard\n*[[Ralph Ineson]] as [[Chris Finch]]\n*[[Patrick Baladi]] as [[Neil Godwin]]\n*[[Stacey Roca]] as Rachel\n*[[Elizabeth Berrington]] as Anne\n\n===Minor cast===\n<!-- (incomplete)-->\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n====Series 1 and 2====\n*[[Joel Beckett]] as Lee\n*Jamie Deeks as Jamie\n*Jane Lucas as Sheila\n*[[Ewen MacIntosh]] as Keith Bishop\n*Emma Manton as Emma\n*Ron Merchant as Gordon\n*Alexander Perkins as Ralph\n*Phillip Pickard as Phillip\n*[[David Schaal (actor)|David Schaal]] as Glynn \"Taffy\"\n{{col-3}}\n\n====Series 1 only====\n*[[Sally Bretton]] as Donna\n*Angela Clerkin as Jackie\n*Yvonne D'Alpra as Joan\n*Robin Hooper as Malcolm\n*[[Vincent Franklin]] as Rowan (training facilitator)\n*Nicola Cotter as Karen Roper\n{{col-3}}\n\n====Series 2 only====\n*[[Julie Fernandez]] as Brenda\n*[[Tom Goodman-Hill]] as Ray\n*[[Jennifer Hennessy]] as Jude\n*[[Matthew Holness]] as Simon (the computer geek)\n*[[Stephen Merchant]] as Oggy\n*[[Bruce Mackinnon]] as Jimmy the Perv\n*Rachel Isaac as Trudy\n*Tony MacMurray as Tony\n*Howard Saddler as Oliver\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of The Office (British TV series) episodes}}\n\nIn total, there are fourteen episodes of ''The Office'': six in each series and two 45-minute Christmas special episodes.\n\n==Critical reception==\nThe show has received critical acclaim, and has been regarded as one of the greatest British sitcoms of all time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comedy.co.uk/guide/tv/top/|title=Top 50 TV Sitcoms - British Comedy Guide|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Series one currently holds a [[Metacritic]] score of 98 out of 100, based on 12 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk|title=The Office (UK)|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> Series two received similar acclaim, holding a [[Metacritic]] score of 93 out of 100, based on 16 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk/season-2|title=The Office (UK)|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> [[The Office Christmas specials|''The Office'' Christmas specials]] were also well received, and hold a [[Metacritic]] score of 98 out of 100, based on 19 reviews, indicating \"universal acclaim\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/tv/the-office-uk/season-3|title=The Office (UK)|publisher=|accessdate=25 September 2016}}</ref> ''The Office'' was named by ''The Telegraph'' as one of the 10 best TV sitcoms of all time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10121664/The-10-best-TV-sitcoms-of-all-time.html|title=The 10 best TV sitcoms of all time|first=Gerard O'Donovan, Ben Lawrence, Chris Harvey, Andrew Pettie, Neil Midgley and Michael|last=Hogan|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}</ref> In 2019, the series was ranked 6th on ''[[The Guardian]]'''s list of the 100 best TV shows of the 21st century.<ref>{{cite web |title= The 100 best TV shows of the 21st century |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/sep/16/100-best-tv-shows-of-the-21st-century |website=The Guardian |accessdate=23 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Awards and recognition==\nAt the [[British Comedy Awards]] in 2001, ''The Office'' won the Best New TV Comedy award.

In 2004, [[Microsoft|Microsoft UK]] commissioned two 20-minute corporate videos featuring Brent being interviewed by Jeff Merchant (played by Stephen Merchant), a Microsoft employee who becomes increasingly exasperated by Brent's antics. Brent is obviously resentful of the company's success. He believes he has what it takes to become the next managing director of Microsoft and continually drops hints to that effect. While not on general release, the videos emerged on the Internet in 2006. The clips also appeared on certain [[peer-to-peer]] networks. Microsoft was unhappy with the leak, stating that the videos \"were never intended to be viewed by the public\".<ref>{{cite news  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =   | coauthors =   | title = Microsoft unhappy at Gervais leak   | work =   | publisher = BBC News  | date = 30 August 2006  | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/5298376.stm  | doi =   | accessdate = 23 August 2008}}</ref>\n\n====Comic Relief: \"The Office Revisited\"====\nAdditionally, a Comic Relief charity short was made in 2013 entitled \"The Office Revisited\"\n\n===Online===\nIn 2013 Gervais developed a series of videos, and released them on his YouTube channel entitled \"[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLPf6bUqN1Brt7YUifE52IEJV4l553NZ1v Learn Guitar with David Brent]\".

The family lives in [[Wembley]], [[London]], England. The show's central premise is that Sanjeev's parents have supported his dream of being a [[television presenter]] by having a TV studio built on what used to be their back garden.  [[Running gag]]s include Sanjeev's apparent social ineptitude, Ashwin's obsession with financial matters and his tendency to tell long stories with no real point, and Ummi's stories of her absurd exploits with her childhood friend Saraswati the bicycle (so named because of her [[contortionist]] skills).  It is also a regular conceit that the guests' appearance fees are paid in Bimla's [[chutney]].\n\nThe show has an [[improvisation]]al feel, though in reality much of the regular cast's performance was scripted but the guest interviews were not. In the early episodes only Meera Syal improvised to any great extent though as the cast became accustomed to their characters, the improvised content increased for later episodes. Bhaskar stated in a 2009 interview, \"We never rehearsed the guests, and the best ones were the ones to keep the ball in the air.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Why comedians are dubbing Hollywood|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/why-comedians-are-dubbing-hollywood-1543507.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=6 May 2012|date=3 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWhen talking about ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' for the British Book Awards, Sanjeev Bhaskar stated that he chose [[42 (number)|42]] as the house number because in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series 42 features prominently as the [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything]].\n\nSanjeev Bhaskar told interviewer [[Mark Lawson]] in August 2007 that the inspiration for the series was an embarrassing evening when he took a girlfriend to meet his parents. They asked her awkward questions and he wondered how they would react if he invited a famous person to his home.

The [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]] screens it in Australia.  Its previous time slot, being right before hugely successful Australian comedy ''[[Kath & Kim (Australian TV series)|Kath & Kim]]'', made the programme successful there. It was very popular in New Zealand {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, as well, where it was screened by [[Television New Zealand]]. It has been broadcast in the United States on [[BBC America]], and in Canada, the programme was viewed on [[BBC Canada]], a [[digital cable]] [[TV channel|channel]], weeknights at 9:00 [[North American Eastern Time Zone|North American Eastern Time]].<ref>http://www.bbccanada.com/schedule/default.asp?scheduleTime=allday</ref>  It was shown in Sweden, as ''Curry Curry talkshow'', by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]2 in 2004, in the [[Netherlands]] on the public broadcasting foundation [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting|NPS]] ([[Nederland 3]]), in [[Switzerland]] on Swiss TV station [[Schweizer Fernsehen|DRS]], in India on [[Comedy Central]].\n\nIn August 2002, the American channel [[NBC]] entered a deal to buy the format but later dropped out.\n\nA new version of the show was planned for Sunday evenings on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], restyled as a show in the 2003-04 season featuring a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino-American]] family called ''The Ortegas'' and featuring [[Cheech Marin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a11130/the-ortegas-to-air-on-fox-sunday-nights.html |title='The Ortegas' to air on Fox, Sunday nights - TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> However the program was dropped from Fox's post-baseball playoffs schedule to focus the network's schedule on the success of ''[[The O.C.]]'' at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/06/business/media-fox-drops-the-ortegas-but-insists-the-show-has-not-been-canceled.html |title=MEDIA; Fox Drops 'The Ortegas' but Insists the Show Has Not Been Canceled - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=6 October 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> and became another one of Fox's series which were scheduled, but never made it to air. Six episodes were produced, but never aired.\n\nThe Australian version, ''[[Greeks on the Roof]]'' (featuring [[Greek Australian]]s), debuted in 2003 but was soon taken off the air because of very low ratings.\n\n[[ARY Digital]] has produced a Pakistani version of the show called ''Ghaffar at Dhoraji'' featuring a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] family living in [[Karachi]]. [[Sony]] Television has produced an Indian version of the show called ''Batliwalla House No. 43'' featuring a [[Parsee]] family living in [[Mumbai]].\n\nIn Russia, [[Channel One (Russian TV channel)|Channel One]] made the Armenian version of the show called ''Rubik Vsemogushchiy'' ([[English language|en:]] ''Rubik Allmighty''; ''Rubik'' is a short for the Armenian name ''Ruben''). The idea of the show was that an Armenian named Rubik (played by Ruben Dzhaginyan) and his family interview the Russian stars (such as pop singers [[Vera Brezhneva]] and [[Anna Semenovich]]; TV presenters Dmitri Dibrov, Timur Rodriguez (real name Timur Yunusov), Valdis Pelsh and [[Sergei Svetlakov]]; and actors Igor Vernik and [[Anastasia Zavorotnyuk]]). There were just four episodes of the show, and it was soon taken off the air because of generally negative reviews from critics.<ref>[[:ru:\u0420\u0443\u0431\u0438\u043a \u0412\u0441\u0435\u043c\u043e\u0433\u0443\u0449\u0438\u0439]]</ref>\n\n==Sky 1 revival==\nOn 1 May 2012, it was announced that a pilot for a revival of the show would be produced by [[Hat Trick Productions]] as '''''The Kumars at No. 42B''''' for [[Sky 1]].

In the early episodes only Meera Syal improvised to any great extent though as the cast became accustomed to their characters, the improvised content increased for later episodes. Bhaskar stated in a 2009 interview, \"We never rehearsed the guests, and the best ones were the ones to keep the ball in the air.\"<ref>{{cite news|title=Why comedians are dubbing Hollywood|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/comedy/features/why-comedians-are-dubbing-hollywood-1543507.html|newspaper=The Independent|accessdate=6 May 2012|date=3 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nWhen talking about ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'' for the British Book Awards, Sanjeev Bhaskar stated that he chose [[42 (number)|42]] as the house number because in the ''Hitchhiker's'' series 42 features prominently as the [[Answer to Life, the Universe, and Everything]].\n\nSanjeev Bhaskar told interviewer [[Mark Lawson]] in August 2007 that the inspiration for the series was an embarrassing evening when he took a girlfriend to meet his parents. They asked her awkward questions and he wondered how they would react if he invited a famous person to his home.

It was very popular in New Zealand {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}, as well, where it was screened by [[Television New Zealand]]. It has been broadcast in the United States on [[BBC America]], and in Canada, the programme was viewed on [[BBC Canada]], a [[digital cable]] [[TV channel|channel]], weeknights at 9:00 [[North American Eastern Time Zone|North American Eastern Time]].<ref>http://www.bbccanada.com/schedule/default.asp?scheduleTime=allday</ref>  It was shown in Sweden, as ''Curry Curry talkshow'', by [[Sveriges Television|SVT]]2 in 2004, in the [[Netherlands]] on the public broadcasting foundation [[Nederlandse Programma Stichting|NPS]] ([[Nederland 3]]), in [[Switzerland]] on Swiss TV station [[Schweizer Fernsehen|DRS]], in India on [[Comedy Central]].\n\nIn August 2002, the American channel [[NBC]] entered a deal to buy the format but later dropped out.\n\nA new version of the show was planned for Sunday evenings on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]], restyled as a show in the 2003-04 season featuring a [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino-American]] family called ''The Ortegas'' and featuring [[Cheech Marin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/ustv/news/a11130/the-ortegas-to-air-on-fox-sunday-nights.html |title='The Ortegas' to air on Fox, Sunday nights - TV News |publisher=Digital Spy |date=17 May 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> However the program was dropped from Fox's post-baseball playoffs schedule to focus the network's schedule on the success of ''[[The O.C.]]'' at the time,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/10/06/business/media-fox-drops-the-ortegas-but-insists-the-show-has-not-been-canceled.html |title=MEDIA; Fox Drops 'The Ortegas' but Insists the Show Has Not Been Canceled - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=6 October 2003 |accessdate=4 August 2011}}</ref> and became another one of Fox's series which were scheduled, but never made it to air.

The protagonist, Detective Inspector [[Thomas Lynley|Thomas \"Tommy\" Lynley, 8th Earl of Asherton]] ([[Nathaniel Parker]]), who is assigned to [[Scotland Yard]], finds himself paired with Detective Sergeant [[Barbara Havers]] ([[Sharon Small]]). In addition to the tensions involved in solving murder cases, the series is built on clashes of personality, gender and class: Lynley is a polished man and a [[Peerage|peer of the realm]], and Havers is an untidy woman from a working-class background.\n\nIn August 2007, the [[BBC]] announced its intention to stop production of ''The Inspector Lynley Mysteries''. Fans of the series mounted a campaign to save it, with a [[petition]] and by contacting the [[BBC]], but to no avail. All six series have since been released on DVD, distributed by [[Acorn Media UK]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edel.de/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901021841/http://www.edel.de/ |archive-date=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAll episodes from the first two series and two from the third are based on novels by the American writer [[Elizabeth George]], though the plots and characters are often significantly altered. Later episodes are original stories for television based on her characters. The theme music for the series was composed by [[Debbie Wiseman]]. The first episode, ''A Great Deliverance'', was broadcast on 12 and 13 March 2001, becoming the only two-part episode throughout the series run. It was also based on the inaugural Inspector Lynley novel. The first full series began broadcasting on 8 April 2002, with the first episode based on and named after the third novel, ''[[Well-Schooled in Murder]]''. The first eleven episodes were based on, and named after, the eleven [[Inspector Lynley series|Inspector Lynley novels]] published from 1988 to 2001, beginning with the inaugural novel ''A Great Deliverance'', but subsequently departing from the print sequence. Eight more novels have since been published as of 2015.\n\n==Filming==\nExterior shots of Lynley and Havers' base were filmed at the Bircham Dyson Bell solicitors offices on Broadway, central London. The first episode of series five was notable for being shot in [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] in [[Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2006/07/the-inspector-lynley-mysteries-natural-causes/|title=Kent Film Office The Inspector Lynley Mysteries \u2013 Natural Causes Article}}</ref> In the first episode, Lynley drove a [[Peugeot 607]]; whereas in both series one and two he drove a [[Jensen Interceptor]]; and in later episodes a [[Bristol 410]]. Despite the frequently recurring remark in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[Mystery!]]'' presenter [[Diana Rigg]]'s introductions to the series that Lynley \"is the one with the [[Bentley]]\", he never drove a Bentley on TV. He does, however, drive one in the George novels. In the pilot episode, the character of Helen Clyde was played by [[Emma Fielding]]. She was later portrayed by [[Lesley Vickerage]] from series one through three (from series three she and Lynley had married and she was thus known as Helen Lynley) and by [[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]] in series five.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley\n* [[Sharon Small]] as Detective Sergeant [[Barbara Havers]]\n* [[Emma Fielding]] as Helen Clyde (Pilot)\n* [[Lesley Vickerage]] as Helen Clyde (Series 1-2) / Helen Lynley (Series 3)\n* [[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]] as Helen Lynley (Series 5)\n* Paul Hickey as Forensic Pathologist Lafferty (Series 4-6)\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as Detective Constable Winston Nkata (Series 5-6)\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Pilot (2001)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#fff;\"\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Top 30 Programmes \u2013 BARB|publisher=barb.co.uk|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 1\n |Title= A Great Deliverance (Part One)\n |Aux1= Lizzie Mickery\n |Aux2= Richard Laxton\n |Aux3= 8.37m\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2001|3|12|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= When a farmer, William Tey, is hacked to death with an axe in his barn on the Yorkshire Moors, Scotland Yard assigns Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers to the case.

The protagonist, Detective Inspector [[Thomas Lynley|Thomas \"Tommy\" Lynley, 8th Earl of Asherton]] ([[Nathaniel Parker]]), who is assigned to [[Scotland Yard]], finds himself paired with Detective Sergeant [[Barbara Havers]] ([[Sharon Small]]). In addition to the tensions involved in solving murder cases, the series is built on clashes of personality, gender and class: Lynley is a polished man and a [[Peerage|peer of the realm]], and Havers is an untidy woman from a working-class background.\n\nIn August 2007, the [[BBC]] announced its intention to stop production of ''The Inspector Lynley Mysteries''. Fans of the series mounted a campaign to save it, with a [[petition]] and by contacting the [[BBC]], but to no avail. All six series have since been released on DVD, distributed by [[Acorn Media UK]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.edel.de/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=31 August 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901021841/http://www.edel.de/ |archive-date=1 September 2009 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n==Production==\nAll episodes from the first two series and two from the third are based on novels by the American writer [[Elizabeth George]], though the plots and characters are often significantly altered. Later episodes are original stories for television based on her characters. The theme music for the series was composed by [[Debbie Wiseman]]. The first episode, ''A Great Deliverance'', was broadcast on 12 and 13 March 2001, becoming the only two-part episode throughout the series run. It was also based on the inaugural Inspector Lynley novel. The first full series began broadcasting on 8 April 2002, with the first episode based on and named after the third novel, ''[[Well-Schooled in Murder]]''. The first eleven episodes were based on, and named after, the eleven [[Inspector Lynley series|Inspector Lynley novels]] published from 1988 to 2001, beginning with the inaugural novel ''A Great Deliverance'', but subsequently departing from the print sequence. Eight more novels have since been published as of 2015.\n\n==Filming==\nExterior shots of Lynley and Havers' base were filmed at the Bircham Dyson Bell solicitors offices on Broadway, central London. The first episode of series five was notable for being shot in [[Dungeness (headland)|Dungeness]] in [[Kent]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Kent Film Office|url=http://kentfilmoffice.co.uk/2006/07/the-inspector-lynley-mysteries-natural-causes/|title=Kent Film Office The Inspector Lynley Mysteries \u2013 Natural Causes Article}}</ref> In the first episode, Lynley drove a [[Peugeot 607]]; whereas in both series one and two he drove a [[Jensen Interceptor]]; and in later episodes a [[Bristol 410]]. Despite the frequently recurring remark in [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] ''[[Mystery!]]'' presenter [[Diana Rigg]]'s introductions to the series that Lynley \"is the one with the [[Bentley]]\", he never drove a Bentley on TV. He does, however, drive one in the George novels. In the pilot episode, the character of Helen Clyde was played by [[Emma Fielding]]. She was later portrayed by [[Lesley Vickerage]] from series one through three (from series three she and Lynley had married and she was thus known as Helen Lynley) and by [[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]] in series five.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Nathaniel Parker]] as Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley\n* [[Sharon Small]] as Detective Sergeant [[Barbara Havers]]\n* [[Emma Fielding]] as Helen Clyde (Pilot)\n* [[Lesley Vickerage]] as Helen Clyde (Series 1-2) / Helen Lynley (Series 3)\n* [[Catherine Russell (actress)|Catherine Russell]] as Helen Lynley (Series 5)\n* Paul Hickey as Forensic Pathologist Lafferty (Series 4-6)\n* [[Shaun Parkes]] as Detective Constable Winston Nkata (Series 5-6)\n\n==Episode list==\n\n===Pilot (2001)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:#fff;\"\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Episode\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Title\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Written by\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Directed by\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Viewers<br />(millions)<ref name=\"barb\">{{cite web|url=http://www.barb.co.uk/whats-new/weekly-top-30?|title=Top 30 Programmes \u2013 BARB|publisher=barb.co.uk|accessdate=11 February 2016}}</ref>\n! style=\"background:#FFB90F;\"| Original airdate\n{{Episode list\n |EpisodeNumber= 1\n |Title= A Great Deliverance (Part One)\n |Aux1= Lizzie Mickery\n |Aux2= Richard Laxton\n |Aux3= 8.37m\n |OriginalAirDate= {{Start date|2001|3|12|df=y}}\n |ShortSummary= When a farmer, William Tey, is hacked to death with an axe in his barn on the Yorkshire Moors, Scotland Yard assigns Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley and Detective Sergeant Barbara Havers to the case.

She had recently quit and set off on her own. Andy had also put him away once, for 10 years, leading to the break-up of Reeve's marriage.
