Armenia has reached the top 10 on seven occasions, with the country's best result in the contest being two fourth-place finishes; achieved by [[Sirusho]] with the song \"[[Q\u00e9l\u00e9, Q\u00e9l\u00e9]]\" ({{escyr|2008}}), and [[Aram Mp3]] with \"[[Not Alone (Aram Mp3 song)|Not Alone]]\" ({{escyr|2014}}).  {{escyr|2011}} was the first year that Armenia failed to advance from the semi-final round. This was followed by the country withdrawing from the {{escyr|2012}} contest due to security concerns in the host city, [[Baku]]. In {{escyr|2018}} and {{escyr|2019}}, Armenia  consecutively failed to qualify from the semi-finals for the second and third time respectively.\n\n==History==\n[[Armenia]] debuted at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]] with the song \"[[Without Your Love (Andr\u00e9 song)|Without Your Love]]\" performed by one of Armenia's top artists, [[Andr\u00e9 (singer)|Andr\u00e9]], and produced by Anush Hovnanyan. Armenia had never entered the competition before, therefore, it had to compete in the semi-final. Andr\u00e9 was the first performer of the semi-final. The song reached the final of the contest on 20 May 2006 and gave Armenia a successful debut coming in 8th position.\n\nHaving reached the top ten in the final, Armenia didn't have to compete in the semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 Eurovision Song Contest]] and automatically reached the final on 12 May performing 23rd of the 24 finalists and came eighth again. \n\nIn 2008, Armenia reached the top five for the first time, with [[Sirusho]] finishing fourth with the song \"Q\u00e9l\u00e9, Q\u00e9l\u00e9\", which received the most 12 points in the final, with a total of eight. This result was followed by two more top ten placements in 2009 and 2010, making Armenia one of only three countries that had always placed in the top ten since the introduction of the semi-finals. This record was broken at the 2011 contest, when [[Emmy (Armenian singer)|Emmy]] and the song \"[[Boom Boom (Emmy song)|Boom Boom]]\" failed to qualify from the first semi-final by only one point.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Armenia announced that it would be withdrawing from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], because of security concerns.<ref name=\"Withdrawal\">{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Armenia withdraws from Eurovision 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=48413|work=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=7 March 2012|date=7 March 2012}}</ref> Despite their 2012 withdrawal, Armenia confirmed participation in the 2013 contest in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Armenia confirms participation|url=http://esctoday.com/38334/armenia-confirms-participation/|work=EscToday|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=31 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Armenia reached the top five for the second time, with Aram Mp3 and the song \"Not Alone\" placing fourth, matching the country's best-ever showing in the contest. Armenia has now reached the final in 10 out of 13 contests, failing to advance to the final for the second time in 2018, finishing 15th in semifinal one. In 2019 they failed to qualify for a third time, placing 16th in semifinal two. This is Armenia's worst result in the contest to date.\n\n[[AMPTV]] also has program called ''Eurovision Diary'', a program specifically designed for Armenian Eurovision entrants and their experiences.

The song reached the final of the contest on 20 May 2006 and gave Armenia a successful debut coming in 8th position.\n\nHaving reached the top ten in the final, Armenia didn't have to compete in the semi-final of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007|2007 Eurovision Song Contest]] and automatically reached the final on 12 May performing 23rd of the 24 finalists and came eighth again. \n\nIn 2008, Armenia reached the top five for the first time, with [[Sirusho]] finishing fourth with the song \"Q\u00e9l\u00e9, Q\u00e9l\u00e9\", which received the most 12 points in the final, with a total of eight. This result was followed by two more top ten placements in 2009 and 2010, making Armenia one of only three countries that had always placed in the top ten since the introduction of the semi-finals. This record was broken at the 2011 contest, when [[Emmy (Armenian singer)|Emmy]] and the song \"[[Boom Boom (Emmy song)|Boom Boom]]\" failed to qualify from the first semi-final by only one point.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Armenia announced that it would be withdrawing from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012]], because of security concerns.<ref name=\"Withdrawal\">{{cite web|last=Siim|first=Jarmo|title=Armenia withdraws from Eurovision 2012|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=48413|work=Eurovision.tv|accessdate=7 March 2012|date=7 March 2012}}</ref> Despite their 2012 withdrawal, Armenia confirmed participation in the 2013 contest in Sweden.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Armenia confirms participation|url=http://esctoday.com/38334/armenia-confirms-participation/|work=EscToday|accessdate=31 October 2012|date=31 October 2012}}</ref>\n\nIn 2014 Armenia reached the top five for the second time, with Aram Mp3 and the song \"Not Alone\" placing fourth, matching the country's best-ever showing in the contest. Armenia has now reached the final in 10 out of 13 contests, failing to advance to the final for the second time in 2018, finishing 15th in semifinal one. In 2019 they failed to qualify for a third time, placing 16th in semifinal two. This is Armenia's worst result in the contest to date.\n\n[[AMPTV]] also has program called ''Eurovision Diary'', a program specifically designed for Armenian Eurovision entrants and their experiences. The program begins every year when the artist is chosen and ends with the Eurovision final.\n\n== Contestants ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size:90%;\"\n|+Table key\n<!--|-\n|bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner-->\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n<!--|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place-->\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#A4EAA9\"|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n|-\n!width=30px|Year\n!

Russia won the {{Escyr|2008}} contest with [[Dima Bilan]] performing the song \"[[Believe (Dima Bilan song)|Believe]]\". One of the most successful countries in the contest in the 21st century with a total of ten top five placements, Russia finished second with [[Alsou]] in {{Escyr|2000}}, Dima Bilan in {{Escyr|2006}}, [[Buranovskiye Babushki]] in {{Escyr|2012}} and [[Polina Gagarina]] in {{Escyr|2015}}; third with [[t.A.T.u.]] in {{Escyr|2003}}, [[Serebro]]  in {{Escyr|2007}}, [[Sergey Lazarev]] in {{Escyr|2016}} and {{Escyr|2019}}, and fifth with [[Dina Garipova]] in {{Escyr|2013}}. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]], they failed to qualify for the final for the first time in their history.\n\n==Contest history==\nTheir debut was in the {{Escyr|1994}} contest after Russia became a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). Russia came second at four contests; in {{Escyr|2000}} with the song \"Solo\" performed by Alsou, in {{Escyr|2006}} with Dima Bilan's song \"Never Let You Go\", in {{Escyr|2012}} with the song \"Party for Everybody\" performed by Buranovskiye Babushki, and in {{Escyr|2015}} with Polina Gagarina's song \"A Million Voices\". They also achieved four third-place finishes; in {{Escyr|2003}} with t.A.T.u's song \"Ne Ver', Ne Boysia\", Serebro's in {{Escyr|2007}} with their entry \"Song #1\", and in {{Escyr|2016}} as well as {{Escyr|2019}} with Sergey Lazarev's song \"You Are the Only One\" and \"Scream\" respectively.\n\nIn 1996, Russia's entry was Andrey Kosinsky with the song \"Me is me\", but on the eve of competition (for the second time in their history), he scored an insufficient number of points in a special qualifying round and therefore missed the final.\n\nIn 1998, because Russia did not participate in the contest (due to lower average scores in participating in previous competitions), Russia refused to broadcast the competition and the European Broadcasting Union in return forbade the country to participate the following year. According to unconfirmed information, Russia was required to submit [[Tatyana Ovsiyenko]] with the song \"My Sun\".\n\nRussia won their first [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in {{Escyr|2008}}, when Dima Bilan, participating for the second time in the contest, won with the song \"Believe\", bringing the contest to Russia for 2009.\n\nRussia was the most successful country in Eurovision in 2000-2009, with one win, two second places, and two third places. However, in 2010 they finished 11th, and in 2011 they were 16th, which was the worst place for Russia since 1995. Interest in the competition fell, but in 2012 Buranovskiye Babushki finished in second place, increasing Russia's interest in the show. Russia holds the record for the most top five finishes in the 21st century, with ten, with Sergey Lazarev holding the record of the highest score of any Russian contestant, who finished third in 2016 with 491 points.\n\nIn 2018, for the very first time, a Russian contestant failed to reach the final. [[Yuliya Samoylova (singer)|Yulia Samoylova]], who represented the country with the song \"I Won't Break\", failed to qualify to the Grand Final from the second semi-final.\n\nIn February 2019, Sergey Lazarev was once again confirmed as the Russian representative for [[Eurovision 2019]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. Which makes Sergey the second return artist in Russian Eurovision participation history after Dima Bilan, who participated in 2006 and 2008 respectively. This time he represented his country with the song [[Scream (Sergey Lazarev song)|Scream]], managed to bring Russia back to grand final for the first time since 2016 and achieved the 10th top 5 result by finishing third once again.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe contest has been broadcast irregularly on two different public [[Television in Russia|state channels]] in Russia, both EBU members: for the 1994 and 1996 it was broadcast on [[Russia-1]] of [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company|VGTRK]], while in 1995, 1997 and from 1999 to 2007 the contest was broadcast on [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]]. Since 2008, there is an alternation on broadcast and selection, with Russia-1 on even years, and Channel One on odd ones. This however changed after not broadcasting 2017 contest, when Channel One started to do the broadcast and selection on even years, while Russia-1 on odd ones.\n\n==Contestants==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place<!-- \n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place -->\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n|{{Escyr|1994}}\n|[[Youddiph]]\n|[[Russian language|Russian]]\n|\"[[Vechny strannik|Vechni stranik]]\" {{small|(\u0412\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a)}}\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|70\n|rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n|{{Escyr|1995}}\n|[[Philipp Kirkorov]]\n|Russian\n|\"[[Kolybelnaya dlya vulkana]]\" {{small|(\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430)}}\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|17\n|-\n| {{N/A|[[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]]}}\n|Andrey Kosinsky\n|Russian\n|\"Ya eto ya\" {{small|(\u042f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u044f)}}\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|Failed to qualify}}{{efn|In 1996, Russia failed to qualify from the audio only pre-qualification round.

Russia won the {{Escyr|2008}} contest with [[Dima Bilan]] performing the song \"[[Believe (Dima Bilan song)|Believe]]\". One of the most successful countries in the contest in the 21st century with a total of ten top five placements, Russia finished second with [[Alsou]] in {{Escyr|2000}}, Dima Bilan in {{Escyr|2006}}, [[Buranovskiye Babushki]] in {{Escyr|2012}} and [[Polina Gagarina]] in {{Escyr|2015}}; third with [[t.A.T.u.]] in {{Escyr|2003}}, [[Serebro]]  in {{Escyr|2007}}, [[Sergey Lazarev]] in {{Escyr|2016}} and {{Escyr|2019}}, and fifth with [[Dina Garipova]] in {{Escyr|2013}}. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 2018|2018]], they failed to qualify for the final for the first time in their history.\n\n==Contest history==\nTheir debut was in the {{Escyr|1994}} contest after Russia became a member of the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU). Russia came second at four contests; in {{Escyr|2000}} with the song \"Solo\" performed by Alsou, in {{Escyr|2006}} with Dima Bilan's song \"Never Let You Go\", in {{Escyr|2012}} with the song \"Party for Everybody\" performed by Buranovskiye Babushki, and in {{Escyr|2015}} with Polina Gagarina's song \"A Million Voices\". They also achieved four third-place finishes; in {{Escyr|2003}} with t.A.T.u's song \"Ne Ver', Ne Boysia\", Serebro's in {{Escyr|2007}} with their entry \"Song #1\", and in {{Escyr|2016}} as well as {{Escyr|2019}} with Sergey Lazarev's song \"You Are the Only One\" and \"Scream\" respectively.\n\nIn 1996, Russia's entry was Andrey Kosinsky with the song \"Me is me\", but on the eve of competition (for the second time in their history), he scored an insufficient number of points in a special qualifying round and therefore missed the final.\n\nIn 1998, because Russia did not participate in the contest (due to lower average scores in participating in previous competitions), Russia refused to broadcast the competition and the European Broadcasting Union in return forbade the country to participate the following year. According to unconfirmed information, Russia was required to submit [[Tatyana Ovsiyenko]] with the song \"My Sun\".\n\nRussia won their first [[Eurovision Song Contest]] in {{Escyr|2008}}, when Dima Bilan, participating for the second time in the contest, won with the song \"Believe\", bringing the contest to Russia for 2009.\n\nRussia was the most successful country in Eurovision in 2000-2009, with one win, two second places, and two third places. However, in 2010 they finished 11th, and in 2011 they were 16th, which was the worst place for Russia since 1995. Interest in the competition fell, but in 2012 Buranovskiye Babushki finished in second place, increasing Russia's interest in the show. Russia holds the record for the most top five finishes in the 21st century, with ten, with Sergey Lazarev holding the record of the highest score of any Russian contestant, who finished third in 2016 with 491 points.\n\nIn 2018, for the very first time, a Russian contestant failed to reach the final. [[Yuliya Samoylova (singer)|Yulia Samoylova]], who represented the country with the song \"I Won't Break\", failed to qualify to the Grand Final from the second semi-final.\n\nIn February 2019, Sergey Lazarev was once again confirmed as the Russian representative for [[Eurovision 2019]] in [[Tel Aviv]]. Which makes Sergey the second return artist in Russian Eurovision participation history after Dima Bilan, who participated in 2006 and 2008 respectively. This time he represented his country with the song [[Scream (Sergey Lazarev song)|Scream]], managed to bring Russia back to grand final for the first time since 2016 and achieved the 10th top 5 result by finishing third once again.\n\n==Broadcast==\nThe contest has been broadcast irregularly on two different public [[Television in Russia|state channels]] in Russia, both EBU members: for the 1994 and 1996 it was broadcast on [[Russia-1]] of [[All-Russia State Television and Radio Broadcasting Company|VGTRK]], while in 1995, 1997 and from 1999 to 2007 the contest was broadcast on [[Channel One (Russia)|Channel One]]. Since 2008, there is an alternation on broadcast and selection, with Russia-1 on even years, and Channel One on odd ones. This however changed after not broadcasting 2017 contest, when Channel One started to do the broadcast and selection on even years, while Russia-1 on odd ones.\n\n==Contestants==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place<!-- \n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place -->\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Entry selected but did not compete\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{center|{{Escyr|1994}}}}\n|[[Youddiph]]\n|[[Russian language|Russian]]\n|\"[[Vechny strannik|Vechni stranik]]\" {{small|(\u0412\u0435\u0447\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u0441\u0442\u0440\u0430\u043d\u043d\u0438\u043a)}}\n|align=center|9\n|align=center|70\n|rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\" data-sort-value=\"99999\" {{N/A|No semi-finals}}\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{center|{{Escyr|1995}}}}\n|[[Philipp Kirkorov]]\n|Russian\n|\"[[Kolybelnaya dlya vulkana]]\" {{small|(\u041a\u043e\u043b\u044b\u0431\u0435\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0430\u044f \u0434\u043b\u044f \u0432\u0443\u043b\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430)}}\n|align=center|17\n|align=center|17\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{center|{{Escyr|1996}}}}\n|Andrey Kosinsky\n|Russian\n|\"Ya eto ya\" {{small|(\u042f \u044d\u0442\u043e \u044f)}}\n|colspan=\"2\" {{N/A|Failed to qualify}}{{efn|In 1996, Russia failed to qualify from the audio only pre-qualification round.

Serbia previously participated as part of {{Esccnty|Yugoslavia}} (both the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] from {{escyr|1961}} to {{escyr|1991}} and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] in {{escyr|1992}}) and as {{Esccnty|Serbia and Montenegro}} ({{escyr|2004}}\u2013{{escyr|2006}}). Serbia won the contest on its debut as an independent country in 2007, with \"[[Molitva]]\" performed by [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]. The country's only other top five result is their third place in {{escyr|2012}}, with \"[[Nije ljubav stvar]]\". Serbia's other top ten results are sixth place ({{escyr|2008}}) and tenth place ({{escyr|2015}}).\n\n==History==\n\nAs Serbia was at one time part of [[Yugoslavia]], it had the opportunity to participate in the Eurovision Song Contest after Yugoslavia's debut at the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1961|1961]]. It debuted the same year as Spain and Finland and became the first and, for three decades, only socialist country to participate in the competition. The best result of Yugoslavia occurred in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1989|1989]] when it won with \"[[Rock Me (Riva song)|Rock Me]]\", sung in Serbo-Croatian and English by [[Riva (music group)|Riva]]. Yugoslavia participated regularly until its breakup in 1991/1992.\n\nAfter a period of absence from 1993 until 2003, [[Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Serbia and Montenegro]] returned to the contest in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]]. They finished in second place with song \"[[Lane moje]]\" performed by [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]]. By 2006, Serbia and Montenegro split, and with Serbia making its debut entry as an independent nation with the [[ballad]] \"[[Molitva]]\" by [[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]. \"Molitva\" won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2007]], receiving 268 points, making Serbia the first country to win with debut entry after Switzerland's win at the first edition. Subsequently, Serbia was host of the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2008|2008 contest]] in its capital [[Belgrade]].\n\nThe second Serbian entry, performed in Belgrade was written by past entrant for Serbia as part of Serbia and Montenegro and contest host [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]]. The song \"[[Oro (song)|Oro]]\", an ethnic ballad, performed by [[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] came 6th and received 160 points in the overall rankings.\n\nIn 2009, Serbia selected [[Marko Kon]] and [[Milan Nikoli\u0107 (musician)|Milaan]] to represent them in the second semi-final on 14 May. The duo failed to qualify for the final, marking it the first time Serbia failed to qualify for the final since the introduction of semi-finals.\n\nIn 2010, [[Milan Stankovi\u0107]] was selected to represent the country in the contest with [[Ovo je Balkan]], an upbeat song with ethno elements, and is about a love story set in Belgrade. It qualified for the final and in the end achieved 13th place with 72 points.\n\nIn 2011, [[Nina Radoji\u010di\u0107|Nina]] was selected with her 1960s inspired song, [[\u010caroban]]. She was accompanied with three other singers who would be dancing throughout the performance. In the semi-finals She performed 6th and qualified for the final. In the final, she performed 24th and achieved 14th place.\n\nAfter finishing second in 2004 when representing Serbia and Montenegro, [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] was back in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] in Azerbaijan, Baku with the song [[Nije ljubav stvar]]. On the second semi-finals he took second place, while he finished third in the final, below second-placed Russia and the winner, Sweden.\n\n[[Moje 3]] represented Serbia in the Eurovision Song Contest 2013 in Malm\u00f6 with the song \"[[Ljubav je svuda]]\". They would finish 11th in the first semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the second time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Serbian broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) announced that it would withdraw from the 2014 contest due to financial difficulties and a lack of available sponsorship for a potential Serbian entry.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ervin|last=Juh\u00e1sz|title=Serbia: RTS not going to Copenhagen|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|work=escXtra.com|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125011758/http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|archivedate=25 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, Serbia announced that they will broadcast all three shows. In addition, they said that it is likely to return at 2015 and that they will probably hold a national selection to find their representative. On 26 September 2014, it was reported that Serbia had decided to return to the {{escyr|2015}} contest to be held in [[Austria]]n capital, [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Serbia: RTS confirms participation- opts for a national final|url=http://esctoday.com/87496/serbia-rts-opts-national-final/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=26 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 February 2015 Serbia chose their own representative in emission \"Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d\". Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d (English: Countdown for Vienna) is the national final organised by RTS in order to select the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. The selection featured three songs composed by Vladimir Grai\u0107, the composer of Serbia's winning entry \"Molitva\" in 2007. Two of the songs were performed by established Serbian artists Bojana Stamenov and Aleksa Jeli\u0107, while one was performed by Danica Krsti\u0107, a new talent chosen by Grai\u0107 through a scouting process.\n\n[[Bojana Stamenov]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Vienna through a 50:50 voting system, where both the audience and the jury voted for her song \"Ceo svet je moj\" (The whole world is mine) to represent Serbia in Austria. It was later announced that she would perform her song in English (a first for a Serbian entry) titled \"[[Beauty Never Lies]]\". Despite being low with the odds and fan votings, Bojana surprised everyone in the first semifinal and became one of the big press and fan favourites. She qualified to the final as the 9th (10 qualified), but managed to achieve another top 10 result for Serbia in the Grand Final, scoring 53 points and the 10th place.\n\nIn 2016 RTS selected [[Sanja Vu\u010di\u0107]]  and her song \"Goodbye (Shelter)\" internally as well. She qualified for the final placing 10th out of 18 and came 18th of 26 in the final receiving. She fared clearly better with the televoters, coming 11th in the final respectively.\n\n[[Tijana Bogi\u0107evi\u0107]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Kiev. with the song \"In Too Deep\". She would finish 11th in the second semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the third time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nIn 2018 RTS went back to an national final, ''Beovizija'' (which had been used to select their first entrants). [[Sanja Ili\u0107]] and [[Balkanika]] won with the song \"[[Nova deca]].\" They qualified for the final for the first time in a year, placing 9th out of 18 in their semi-final; they then came 19th of 26 in the final, receiving 113 points. They fared better with the televoters, finishing 12th. Following their success in making the final, RTS confirmed that ''Beovizija'' would be maintained as their selection method in 2019.

The song \"[[Oro (song)|Oro]]\", an ethnic ballad, performed by [[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] came 6th and received 160 points in the overall rankings.\n\nIn 2009, Serbia selected [[Marko Kon]] and [[Milan Nikoli\u0107 (musician)|Milaan]] to represent them in the second semi-final on 14 May. The duo failed to qualify for the final, marking it the first time Serbia failed to qualify for the final since the introduction of semi-finals.\n\nIn 2010, [[Milan Stankovi\u0107]] was selected to represent the country in the contest with [[Ovo je Balkan]], an upbeat song with ethno elements, and is about a love story set in Belgrade. It qualified for the final and in the end achieved 13th place with 72 points.\n\nIn 2011, [[Nina Radoji\u010di\u0107|Nina]] was selected with her 1960s inspired song, [[\u010caroban]]. She was accompanied with three other singers who would be dancing throughout the performance. In the semi-finals She performed 6th and qualified for the final. In the final, she performed 24th and achieved 14th place.\n\nAfter finishing second in 2004 when representing Serbia and Montenegro, [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] was back in [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]] in Azerbaijan, Baku with the song [[Nije ljubav stvar]].

They would finish 11th in the first semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the second time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nOn 22 November 2013, Serbian broadcaster [[Radio Television of Serbia]] (RTS) announced that it would withdraw from the 2014 contest due to financial difficulties and a lack of available sponsorship for a potential Serbian entry.<ref>{{cite web|first=Ervin|last=Juh\u00e1sz|title=Serbia: RTS not going to Copenhagen|url=http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|work=escXtra.com|accessdate=23 November 2013|date=22 November 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131125011758/http://escxtra.com/2013/11/rts-not-going-to-copenhagen/|archivedate=25 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn April 2014, Serbia announced that they will broadcast all three shows. In addition, they said that it is likely to return at 2015 and that they will probably hold a national selection to find their representative. On 26 September 2014, it was reported that Serbia had decided to return to the {{escyr|2015}} contest to be held in [[Austria]]n capital, [[Vienna]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Serbia: RTS confirms participation- opts for a national final|url=http://esctoday.com/87496/serbia-rts-opts-national-final/|website=esctoday.com|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=26 September 2014|date=26 September 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn 15 February 2015 Serbia chose their own representative in emission \"Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d\". Odbrojavanje za Be\u010d (English: Countdown for Vienna) is the national final organised by RTS in order to select the Serbian entry for the Eurovision Song Contest 2015. The selection featured three songs composed by Vladimir Grai\u0107, the composer of Serbia's winning entry \"Molitva\" in 2007. Two of the songs were performed by established Serbian artists Bojana Stamenov and Aleksa Jeli\u0107, while one was performed by Danica Krsti\u0107, a new talent chosen by Grai\u0107 through a scouting process.\n\n[[Bojana Stamenov]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Vienna through a 50:50 voting system, where both the audience and the jury voted for her song \"Ceo svet je moj\" (The whole world is mine) to represent Serbia in Austria. It was later announced that she would perform her song in English (a first for a Serbian entry) titled \"[[Beauty Never Lies]]\". Despite being low with the odds and fan votings, Bojana surprised everyone in the first semifinal and became one of the big press and fan favourites. She qualified to the final as the 9th (10 qualified), but managed to achieve another top 10 result for Serbia in the Grand Final, scoring 53 points and the 10th place.\n\nIn 2016 RTS selected [[Sanja Vu\u010di\u0107]]  and her song \"Goodbye (Shelter)\" internally as well. She qualified for the final placing 10th out of 18 and came 18th of 26 in the final receiving. She fared clearly better with the televoters, coming 11th in the final respectively.\n\n[[Tijana Bogi\u0107evi\u0107]] was selected as the Serbian representative for Kiev. with the song \"In Too Deep\". She would finish 11th in the second semi-final, therefore not qualifying for the final (only 10 contestants were to continue to the final). This was the third time that Serbia did not qualify for the final.\n\nIn 2018 RTS went back to an national final, ''Beovizija'' (which had been used to select their first entrants). [[Sanja Ili\u0107]] and [[Balkanika]] won with the song \"[[Nova deca]].\" They qualified for the final for the first time in a year, placing 9th out of 18 in their semi-final; they then came 19th of 26 in the final, receiving 113 points. They fared better with the televoters, finishing 12th. Following their success in making the final, RTS confirmed that ''Beovizija'' would be maintained as their selection method in 2019. In 2019, RTS decided to host the second edition of the national final. [[Nevena Bo\u017eovi\u0107]] won with her song [[Kruna (song)|''Kruna'']]. Placed 7th with 156 points, she qualified for the final, where she then performed 23rd and came 18th out of 26 acts, with 89 points in total.\n\n==Contestants==\n{{for|contestants prior to 2007|Serbia and Montenegro in the Eurovision Song Contest|Yugoslavia in the Eurovision Song Contest}}\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Table key\n|-\n|width=15px bgcolor=gold|{{center|1}}\n|Winner\n|-\n|bgcolor=silver|{{center|2}}\n|Second place\n|-\n|bgcolor=#c96|{{center|3}}\n|Third place<!-- \n|-\n|bgcolor=#FE8080|{{center|\u25c1}}\n|Last place -->\n|-\n|bgcolor=#A4EAA9|{{center|'''X'''}}\n|Withdrew/disqualified\n|}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%\"\n!width=30px|Year\n!Artist\n!Language\n!Title\n!width=50px|Final\n!width=50px|Points\n!width=50px|Semi\n!width=50px|Points\n|-bgcolor=\"gold\"\n!scope=\"row\"|{{center|{{Escyr|2007}}}}\n|[[Marija \u0160erifovi\u0107]]\n|[[Serbian language|Serbian]]\n|\"[[Molitva]]\" {{small|(\u041c\u043e\u043b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430)}}\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|268\n|align=center|1\n|align=center|298\n|-\n!scope=\"row\"|{{center|{{Escyr|2008}}}}\n|[[Jelena Toma\u0161evi\u0107]] feat.

Since the introduction of the semi-finals in {{escyr|2004}}, the only year that Turkey participated and failed to advance to the finals was in {{escyr|2011}}. Turkey won the contest once in {{escyr|2003}}, and hosted the {{escyr|2004}} contest in [[Istanbul]].\n\nTurkey finished last on its debut at the contest in 1975, and went on to finish last with \"[[nul points]]\" in {{escyr|1983}} and {{escyr|1987}}. They reached the top ten for the first time in 1986. [[\u015eebnem Paker]] achieved the country's first top five result in {{escyr|1997}}, finishing third with the song \"[[Dinle]]\".\n\nThey went on to achieve five more top five placements after the introduction of the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|free language rule]] and televoting, with [[Sertab Erener]] giving Turkey its first victory in {{escyr|2003}} with the song \"[[Everyway That I Can]]\", narrowly defeating [[Belgium in the Eurovision Song Contest|Belgium]] by two points.

As an intercontinental country (with lands in [[Eastern Thrace]] and [[Western Asia]]), Turkey takes part in a multitude of Western organizations including [[NATO]] as of 1952 and the [[European Economic Community]] as an [[Member State of the European Union#Related states|associate member]] as of 1959.\n\nTRT televised the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]], even during years in which Turkey was not participating in the contest.\n\n=== 1970s ===\nTurkey participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Eurovision Song Contest]] held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] did not take part in the 1975 Contest for \"unknown reasons\" according to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], but it was later revealed that the withdrawal was in protest of Turkey's debut and their [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaegreece.com/node/150|title=EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 1975|publisher=OGAE Greece|language=Greek|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Raycoff|first=Ivan|author2=Robert Deayom Tobin|title=A Song for Europe|date=July 2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 978-0-7546-5878-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+song+for+europe&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0r2r9IklIU3MfJf6wIZOWTlbgE4A#PPR18,M1|location=[[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]}}</ref> TRT organized a [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975|national final]] to select the first ever Turkish entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest. The final took place on 9 February 1975 in the studios of TRT and was hosted by [[B\u00fclend \u00d6zveren]]. The winning song, \"[[Seninle Bir Dakika]]\" (literally \"A minute with you\") by [[Semiha Yank\u0131]], was picked by averaging the ranks from the professional jury and people's jury. At the close of voting during the contest, the song received only 3 points from [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]] and placed last.\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]], Greece's entry to the contest aroused controversy due to its subject matter being the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Turkey withdrew from the contest to protest the political background of Greece's entry, called \"[[Panagia Mou, Panagia Mou]].\" Turkey televised the final on 3 April 1976 but censored the Greek entrant's performance. They played a nationalist Turkish song titled \"Memleketim\" (literally \"My motherland\", the Turkish cover of the Yiddish folk song \"Rabbi Elimelekh\"), which was one of the symbols of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in Turkey.\n\nTurkey did not take part in the contest again until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], placing 18th with the song \"[[Sevince]]\" performed by [[Nazar (band)|Nazar]] and [[Nil\u00fcfer Yumlu|Nil\u00fcfer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/paris-1978/final?sorting=rank&direction=asc|title=Final of Paris 1978 |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest |access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|The 1979 contest]] was held in [[Jerusalem]]. The Turkish entry selected was \"[[Seviyorum]]\" (literally \"I'm in love\") by [[Maria Rita Epik]]. However, Turkey withdrew from the contest due to pressure from neighboring countries to do so, which arose from ongoing controversy regarding the status of Jerusalem.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nTurkey participated in the Eurovision Song Contest consistently throughout the 1980s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]], Turkish superstar [[Ajda Pekkan]] and the song \"[[Pet'r Oil|Petrol]]\" was selected by TRT through a national final. Pekkan placed 15th with 23 points, including the first ever score 12 points received by Turkey, coming from [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]].\n\nTurkey had their best result (until 1997) in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 contest]] in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], when [[Klips ve Onlar]] placed ninth with a total of 53 points. The country scored \"nul points\" twice in the eighties, one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] (shared with [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983|Spain]]) and the other one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]. Several famous Turkish artists performed for the contest during the 1980s, including Ajda Pekkan, [[Neco (singer)|Neco]], [[Candan Er\u00e7etin]] and [[Mazhar-Fuat-\u00d6zkan|MF\u00d6]].\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe contest's popularity in Turkey suffered after [[Kayahan]], one of the most famous singers in the country, placed 17th out of 22 participating countries with 21 points. After Kayahan's poor result, Turkey's Eurovision entrants were mostly unknown or amateur singers until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]].\n\n[[\u015eebnem Paker]] represented the country in two consecutive years. The first time being in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] where she qualified for the final and placed 12th, and the second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] where she placed third, behind the UK and Ireland, with the song \"[[Dinle]]\" (\"Listen\"), sung in Turkish.\n\nAfter the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|free language rule was re-introduced in 1999]], the first Turkish entry to be partially sung in English was at the {{escyr|2000}} contest. Turkey reached the top 10 for a second time since 1986, and landed in the top three for the first time, making it the most successful result for the country until its victory in 2003. \u015eebnem Paker returned to the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998|Turkish national final]] in 1998, but placed fourth and did not qualify for the Contest as the Turkish participant for a third consecutive year. [[Tarkan T\u00fczmen|T\u00fczmen]] represented the country and placed 14th. Turkey participated all the series of the contest in the 1990s except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|the 1994 contest]], from which they were relegated due to their 21st-place finish in 1993.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, the contest became one of the most popular events in Turkey as a result of the participation of other Eastern European countries, and the victory of [[Sertab Erener]] with the song \"[[Everyway That I Can]]\". Following the introduction of [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|televoting in 1998]], (initially trialed in 1997 and first implemented in Turkey in 1999), Turkey went on to achieve eight top 10 results in the contest, having previously made the top 10 in 1986 and 1997.\n\nErener's song for [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] was the first Turkish entry in the contest to be sung completely in English. TRT selected the Turkish entry through an internal selection mainly organised by [[OGAE|OGAE Turkey]].\n\nThe 2004 contest was held  in the [[Abdi Ipekci Arena]], with the first ever semi-final held on Wednesday 12 May, followed by the final on Saturday 15 May. After Erener's victory (with the exception of the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] contest), Turkish entries to the Contest were picked internally. Turkey had always qualified to the grand final (except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|the 2011 Contest]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]) since introduction of the semi-finals in 2004 and always reached the top ten, except in 2005 and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], until the last contest they participated in (as of 2018) in 2012. From 2000, Turkey had seven songs sung in English and four sung in both English and Turkish, with just two ({{escyr|2005}} and {{escyr|2008}}) songs sung entirely in Turkish.\n\nAlong with Greece, Turkey brought the contest a new outlook with flashy stage performances and dresses alongside their oriental/Mediterranean-flavoured pop music acts (Sertab Erener, [[Sibel T\u00fcz\u00fcn]], [[Kenan Do\u011fulu]] and [[Hadise]]). In 2004, [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], the country was represented by bands, most being with rock-influenced songs with Ottoman, Eastern European and Balkan instruments. [[Athena (band)|Athena]] ranked fourth in 2004, when the contest was held in Istanbul; [[Mor ve \u00d6tesi]] ranked 7th with a song completely in Turkish in 2008 and the [[nu metal]] band [[Manga (band)|maNga]], which was named the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best European Act|Best European Act]] in the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2009]], ranked 2nd in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] respectively. Although [[Y\u00fcksek Sadakat]] in 2011 placed 13th in the first semi-final of the contest and failed to qualify, this was the first and only time that Turkey didn't qualify for the final. In 2012 Turkey participated to the Eurovision Song Contest for the last time as of 2018 with the song \"[[Love Me Back (Can Bonomo song)|Love Me Back]]\" completely sung in English by up-and-coming artist [[Can Bonomo]], which qualified for and placed seventh in the final with 112 points.\n\n==== Withdrawal and controversy ====\nTRT announced their withdrawal from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] on 14 December 2012, citing dissatisfaction with the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest|rules of the competition]]; they have yet to return.<ref name=\"wthdrw1\"/> The TRT cited the changes to the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|televote voting system]], in which a jury was introduced and the significance of televoting decreased by 50%.

As an intercontinental country (with lands in [[Eastern Thrace]] and [[Western Asia]]), Turkey takes part in a multitude of Western organizations including [[NATO]] as of 1952 and the [[European Economic Community]] as an [[Member State of the European Union#Related states|associate member]] as of 1959.\n\nTRT televised the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] between [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973|1973]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 2012|2012]], even during years in which Turkey was not participating in the contest.\n\n=== 1970s ===\nTurkey participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1975|1975 Eurovision Song Contest]] held in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest|Greece]] did not take part in the 1975 Contest for \"unknown reasons\" according to the [[European Broadcasting Union|EBU]], but it was later revealed that the withdrawal was in protest of Turkey's debut and their [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ogaegreece.com/node/150|title=EUROVISION SONG CONTEST 1975|publisher=OGAE Greece|language=Greek|accessdate=2008-08-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Raycoff|first=Ivan|author2=Robert Deayom Tobin|title=A Song for Europe|date=July 2007|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|isbn= 978-0-7546-5878-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eq7nilnv93cC&printsec=frontcover&dq=a+song+for+europe&client=firefox-a&sig=ACfU3U0r2r9IklIU3MfJf6wIZOWTlbgE4A#PPR18,M1|location=[[Aldershot]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]]}}</ref> TRT organized a [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1975|national final]] to select the first ever Turkish entrant to the Eurovision Song Contest. The final took place on 9 February 1975 in the studios of TRT and was hosted by [[B\u00fclend \u00d6zveren]]. The winning song, \"[[Seninle Bir Dakika]]\" (literally \"A minute with you\") by [[Semiha Yank\u0131]], was picked by averaging the ranks from the professional jury and people's jury. At the close of voting during the contest, the song received only 3 points from [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monaco]] and placed last.\n\nIn [[Eurovision Song Contest 1976|1976]], Greece's entry to the contest aroused controversy due to its subject matter being the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. Turkey withdrew from the contest to protest the political background of Greece's entry, called \"[[Panagia Mou, Panagia Mou]].\" Turkey televised the final on 3 April 1976 but censored the Greek entrant's performance. They played a nationalist Turkish song titled \"Memleketim\" (literally \"My motherland\", the Turkish cover of the Yiddish folk song \"Rabbi Elimelekh\"), which was one of the symbols of the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in Turkey.\n\nTurkey did not take part in the contest again until [[Eurovision Song Contest 1978|1978]], placing 18th with the song \"[[Sevince]]\" performed by [[Nazar (band)|Nazar]] and [[Nil\u00fcfer Yumlu|Nil\u00fcfer]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://eurovision.tv/event/paris-1978/final?sorting=rank&direction=asc|title=Final of Paris 1978 |publisher=Eurovision Song Contest |access-date=2019-09-03}}</ref>\n\n[[Eurovision Song Contest 1979|The 1979 contest]] was held in [[Jerusalem]]. The Turkish entry selected was \"[[Seviyorum]]\" (literally \"I'm in love\") by [[Maria Rita Epik]]. However, Turkey withdrew from the contest due to pressure from neighboring countries to do so, which arose from ongoing controversy regarding the status of Jerusalem.\n\n=== 1980s ===\nTurkey participated in the Eurovision Song Contest consistently throughout the 1980s. In [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980]], Turkish superstar [[Ajda Pekkan]] and the song \"[[Pet'r Oil|Petrol]]\" was selected by TRT through a national final. Pekkan placed 15th with 23 points, including the first ever score 12 points received by Turkey, coming from [[Morocco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Morocco]].\n\nTurkey had their best result (until 1997) in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1986|1986 contest]] in [[Bergen]], [[Norway]], when [[Klips ve Onlar]] placed ninth with a total of 53 points. The country scored \"nul points\" twice in the eighties, one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1983|1983]] (shared with [[Spain in the Eurovision Song Contest 1983|Spain]]) and the other one in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1987|1987]]. Several famous Turkish artists performed for the contest during the 1980s, including Ajda Pekkan, [[Neco (singer)|Neco]], [[Candan Er\u00e7etin]] and [[Mazhar-Fuat-\u00d6zkan|MF\u00d6]].\n\n=== 1990s ===\nThe contest's popularity in Turkey suffered after [[Kayahan]], one of the most famous singers in the country, placed 17th out of 22 participating countries with 21 points. After Kayahan's poor result, Turkey's Eurovision entrants were mostly unknown or amateur singers until [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]].\n\n[[\u015eebnem Paker]] represented the country in two consecutive years. The first time being in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]] where she qualified for the final and placed 12th, and the second in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1997|1997]] where she placed third, behind the UK and Ireland, with the song \"[[Dinle]]\" (\"Listen\"), sung in Turkish.\n\nAfter the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|free language rule was re-introduced in 1999]], the first Turkish entry to be partially sung in English was at the {{escyr|2000}} contest. Turkey reached the top 10 for a second time since 1986, and landed in the top three for the first time, making it the most successful result for the country until its victory in 2003. \u015eebnem Paker returned to the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 1998|Turkish national final]] in 1998, but placed fourth and did not qualify for the Contest as the Turkish participant for a third consecutive year. [[Tarkan T\u00fczmen|T\u00fczmen]] represented the country and placed 14th. Turkey participated all the series of the contest in the 1990s except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994|the 1994 contest]], from which they were relegated due to their 21st-place finish in 1993.\n\n=== 2000s and 2010s ===\nIn the late 1990s to early 2000s, the contest became one of the most popular events in Turkey as a result of the participation of other Eastern European countries, and the victory of [[Sertab Erener]] with the song \"[[Everyway That I Can]]\". Following the introduction of [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest#Rule changes by year|televoting in 1998]], (initially trialed in 1997 and first implemented in Turkey in 1999), Turkey went on to achieve eight top 10 results in the contest, having previously made the top 10 in 1986 and 1997.\n\nErener's song for [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] was the first Turkish entry in the contest to be sung completely in English. TRT selected the Turkish entry through an internal selection mainly organised by [[OGAE|OGAE Turkey]].\n\nThe 2004 contest was held  in the [[Abdi Ipekci Arena]], with the first ever semi-final held on Wednesday 12 May, followed by the final on Saturday 15 May. After Erener's victory (with the exception of the [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|2005]] contest), Turkish entries to the Contest were picked internally. Turkey had always qualified to the grand final (except for [[Eurovision Song Contest 2011|the 2011 Contest]] in [[D\u00fcsseldorf]]) since introduction of the semi-finals in 2004 and always reached the top ten, except in 2005 and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2006|2006]], until the last contest they participated in (as of 2018) in 2012. From 2000, Turkey had seven songs sung in English and four sung in both English and Turkish, with just two ({{escyr|2005}} and {{escyr|2008}}) songs sung entirely in Turkish.\n\nAlong with Greece, Turkey brought the contest a new outlook with flashy stage performances and dresses alongside their oriental/Mediterranean-flavoured pop music acts (Sertab Erener, [[Sibel T\u00fcz\u00fcn]], [[Kenan Do\u011fulu]] and [[Hadise]]). In 2004, [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2009|2009]], [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2010|2010]] and [[Turkey in the Eurovision Song Contest 2011|2011]], the country was represented by bands, most being with rock-influenced songs with Ottoman, Eastern European and Balkan instruments. [[Athena (band)|Athena]] ranked fourth in 2004, when the contest was held in Istanbul; [[Mor ve \u00d6tesi]] ranked 7th with a song completely in Turkish in 2008 and the [[nu metal]] band [[Manga (band)|maNga]], which was named the [[MTV Europe Music Award for Best European Act|Best European Act]] in the [[MTV Europe Music Awards 2009]], ranked 2nd in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2010]] respectively. Although [[Y\u00fcksek Sadakat]] in 2011 placed 13th in the first semi-final of the contest and failed to qualify, this was the first and only time that Turkey didn't qualify for the final. In 2012 Turkey participated to the Eurovision Song Contest for the last time as of 2018 with the song \"[[Love Me Back (Can Bonomo song)|Love Me Back]]\" completely sung in English by up-and-coming artist [[Can Bonomo]], which qualified for and placed seventh in the final with 112 points.\n\n==== Withdrawal and controversy ====\nTRT announced their withdrawal from the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]] on 14 December 2012, citing dissatisfaction with the [[Rules of the Eurovision Song Contest|rules of the competition]]; they have yet to return.<ref name=\"wthdrw1\"/> The TRT cited the changes to the [[Voting at the Eurovision Song Contest|televote voting system]], in which a jury was introduced and the significance of televoting decreased by 50%.

It had attempted to debut in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], but did not pass through the qualifying round. In the first three finals that Slovakia participated in, it placed no better than 18th, which it achieved in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]]. Because of its poor results, it was forced to miss a year after each contest and then the country opted not to return for a number of years. It did eventually return to the Contest eleven years later, in 2009, although they withdrew again within 4 years, having failed to qualify to the final every year since their return.\n\n==History==\n===1994\u20131998===\nSlovakia had planned on entering the contest at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]] contest, but with the introduction of many new countries, a preliminary round was held to trim down the number of new entries. ''[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]'' featured seven countries competing for only three places in the final. Slovakia came fourth in the contest, represented by [[El\u00e1n (band)|El\u00e1n]] with \"Amnestia na neveru\", and therefore had to wait another year before entering again.\n\nSlovakia's Eurovision entries in the 1990s weren't very successful, finishing 19th (1994), 18th (1996) and 21st (1998). After the 1998 contest, STV decided not to enter again for a number of years.\n\n===2009===\nFrom 1994 to 1998, STV used an internal selection to select the Slovak entry for the contest. In 2009, Slovakia organised a televised national final for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12410/slovakia_televoting_to_select_national_winner/|title=Slovakia: Televoting to select national winner|last=Stella|first=Floras|date=2008-10-22|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> A number of heats preceded a grand final, held on March 8, 2009 and [[Kamil Mikul\u010d\u00edk]] and [[Nela Pociskov\u00e1]] were chosen with their song \"[[Le\u0165 tmou]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12550/slovakia_national_final_on_8_march/|title=Slovakia: National final on 8 March|last=Stella|first=Floras|date=2008-11-20|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> They finished on 18th place out of 19 in semi-final.\n\n===2010===\nSlovakia tried again in 2010 contest with \"Horehronie\" by Kristina with similar result (16th out of 17 places in the Semi Final), despite being a fan and bookmakers favourite.\n\n===2011===\nThough STV originally stated that Slovakia would not take part in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2011, it eventually did appear in D\u00fcsseldorf represented by the new national public broadcaster [[Rozhlas a telev\u00edzia Slovenska|RTVS]], which had been created on 1 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three acts shortlisted to represent Slovakia|url=http://www.escdaily.com/three-acts-shortlisted-to-represent-slovakia/|publisher=ESCDaily|accessdate=13 March 2014|author=Dennis Van Eersel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|title=43 nations on 2011 participants list!|date=2010-12-31|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>  On 18 February 2011, RTVS revealed their choice for Slovakia's Eurovision 2011 entry. The song was \"I'm Still Alive\" and was performed by twin sisters Daniela and Veronika N\u00edzlov\u00e1 better known as the pop duo [[TWiiNS]]. They already had some experience at Eurovision before as backing singers and dancers for Tereza Kerndlov\u00e1, the Czech entry in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The 2011 entry was the first Slovak entry performed in English.  TWiiNS eventually finished 12th in their Semi Final, which meant they did not qualify for the Grand Final, due to the televote that counterbalanced the good jury rehearsal. They provided the best result for their country in many years.\n\n===2012===\nRTVS sent an artist once again to the Contest in 2012, with a song that was selected internally by RTVS. At a press conference on 7 March 2012, the Slovak entry for the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest was announced: [[Max Jason Mai]] with a song called \"Don't Close Your Eyes\".\n\nHe performed in the second semi final, that was held on Thursday, May 24, 2012. The song did not qualify in the finals. It was later revealed that the song finished in last place with 22 points.\n\n===2013 onwards===\nOn 4 December 2012, RTVS announced its withdrawal from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Slovakia will not be in Malm\u00f6|url=http://www.esctoday.com/39448/slovakia-will-not-be-in-malmo/|work=ESCToday|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=4 December 2012}}</ref> and on 9 September 2013 it announced that it wouldn't return at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Slovakia: RTVS will not return to Eurovision in 2014|url=http://www.esctoday.com/67846/slovakia-rtvs-will-return-eurovision-2014/|work=ESCToday|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> It had also been announced that Slovakia would not return at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]], citing financial constraints and an incompatibility between the contest and the programming goals of RTVS.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Slovakia: RTVS will not return to Eurovision in 2015|url=http://esctoday.com/86385/slovakia/|work=ESCToday|accessdate=26 August 2014|date=26 August 2014}}</ref> However RTVS returned to the [[Eurovision Young Dancers]] in [[Eurovision Young Dancers 2015|2015]], with RTVS explaining that the return of Slovakia to EYD supported domestic production and promoted national culture at a European level.

It had attempted to debut in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]], but did not pass through the qualifying round. In the first three finals that Slovakia participated in, it placed no better than 18th, which it achieved in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1996|1996]]. Because of its poor results, it was forced to miss a year after each contest and then the country opted not to return for a number of years. It did eventually return to the Contest eleven years later, in 2009, although they withdrew again within 4 years, having failed to qualify to the final every year since their return.\n\n==History==\n===1994\u20131998===\nSlovakia had planned on entering the contest at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1993|1993]] contest, but with the introduction of many new countries, a preliminary round was held to trim down the number of new entries. ''[[Kvalifikacija za Millstreet]]'' featured seven countries competing for only three places in the final. Slovakia came fourth in the contest, represented by [[El\u00e1n (band)|El\u00e1n]] with \"Amnestia na neveru\", and therefore had to wait another year before entering again.\n\nSlovakia's Eurovision entries in the 1990s weren't very successful, finishing 19th (1994), 18th (1996) and 21st (1998). After the 1998 contest, STV decided not to enter again for a number of years.\n\n===2009===\nFrom 1994 to 1998, STV used an internal selection to select the Slovak entry for the contest. In 2009, Slovakia organised a televised national final for the first time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12410/slovakia_televoting_to_select_national_winner/|title=Slovakia: Televoting to select national winner|last=Stella|first=Floras|date=2008-10-22|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> A number of heats preceded a grand final, held on March 8, 2009 and [[Kamil Mikul\u010d\u00edk]] and [[Nela Pociskov\u00e1]] were chosen with their song \"[[Le\u0165 tmou]]\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/12550/slovakia_national_final_on_8_march/|title=Slovakia: National final on 8 March|last=Stella|first=Floras|date=2008-11-20|publisher=ESCToday|accessdate=2008-12-01}}</ref> They finished on 18th place out of 19 in semi-final.\n\n===2010===\nSlovakia tried again in 2010 contest with \"Horehronie\" by Kristina with similar result (16th out of 17 places in the Semi Final), despite being a fan and bookmakers favourite.\n\n===2011===\nThough STV originally stated that Slovakia would not take part in the Eurovision Song Contest in 2011, it eventually did appear in D\u00fcsseldorf represented by the new national public broadcaster [[Rozhlas a telev\u00edzia Slovenska|RTVS]], which had been created on 1 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Three acts shortlisted to represent Slovakia|url=http://www.escdaily.com/three-acts-shortlisted-to-represent-slovakia/|publisher=ESCDaily|accessdate=13 March 2014|author=Dennis Van Eersel}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=22833&_t=43+nations+on+2011+participants+list!|title=43 nations on 2011 participants list!|date=2010-12-31|publisher=European Broadcasting Union|accessdate=2010-12-31}}</ref>  On 18 February 2011, RTVS revealed their choice for Slovakia's Eurovision 2011 entry. The song was \"I'm Still Alive\" and was performed by twin sisters Daniela and Veronika N\u00edzlov\u00e1 better known as the pop duo [[TWiiNS]]. They already had some experience at Eurovision before as backing singers and dancers for Tereza Kerndlov\u00e1, the Czech entry in the 2008 Eurovision Song Contest. The 2011 entry was the first Slovak entry performed in English.  TWiiNS eventually finished 12th in their Semi Final, which meant they did not qualify for the Grand Final, due to the televote that counterbalanced the good jury rehearsal. They provided the best result for their country in many years.\n\n===2012===\nRTVS sent an artist once again to the Contest in 2012, with a song that was selected internally by RTVS. At a press conference on 7 March 2012, the Slovak entry for the 2012 Eurovision Song Contest was announced: [[Max Jason Mai]] with a song called \"Don't Close Your Eyes\".\n\nHe performed in the second semi final, that was held on Thursday, May 24, 2012. The song did not qualify in the finals. It was later revealed that the song finished in last place with 22 points.\n\n===2013 onwards===\nOn 4 December 2012, RTVS announced its withdrawal from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2013]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Slovakia will not be in Malm\u00f6|url=http://www.esctoday.com/39448/slovakia-will-not-be-in-malmo/|work=ESCToday|accessdate=4 December 2012|date=4 December 2012}}</ref> and on 9 September 2013 it announced that it wouldn't return at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2014]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Slovakia: RTVS will not return to Eurovision in 2014|url=http://www.esctoday.com/67846/slovakia-rtvs-will-return-eurovision-2014/|work=ESCToday|accessdate=9 September 2013|date=9 September 2013}}</ref> It had also been announced that Slovakia would not return at [[Eurovision Song Contest 2015]], citing financial constraints and an incompatibility between the contest and the programming goals of RTVS.<ref>{{cite web|last=Jiandani|first=Sanjay|title=Slovakia: RTVS will not return to Eurovision in 2015|url=http://esctoday.com/86385/slovakia/|work=ESCToday|accessdate=26 August 2014|date=26 August 2014}}</ref> However RTVS returned to the [[Eurovision Young Dancers]] in [[Eurovision Young Dancers 2015|2015]], with RTVS explaining that the return of Slovakia to EYD supported domestic production and promoted national culture at a European level.

The peroxide, it is presumed, acts as a weapon to exclude competing bacteria from the food source. In place of the protective enzyme [[superoxide dismutase]] present in almost all other oxygen-tolerant cells, this organism accumulates millimolar quantities of [[manganese]] [[polyphosphate]]. Manganese is also used by ''L. plantarum'' in a [[catalase|pseudo-catalase]] to lower reactive oxygen levels. Because the chemistry by which manganese complexes protect the cells from oxygen damage is subverted by [[iron]], these cells contain virtually no iron atoms; in contrast, a cell of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' of comparable volume contains over one-million iron atoms.

In the opening scene, we see Mara, a six-month-old lion cub, with her mother Layla, who both belong to the River pride, which lives in the south of the [[national park|park]]. The pride's leader is named Fang, an old male lion, who has a distinctive broken [[tooth]] because of an earlier fight. In the north of the Maasai Mara, Sita and her cubs coexist with another lion pride led by a large male named Kali, who wishes to expand his pride and territory by taking over Fang's southern pride and territory, which however he cannot reach as the Pride Lands are divided by a [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] infested [[Mara River|river]].\n\nSita's cubs are playing while Kali and his four sons are on patrol. Sita, seeing them as a serious danger to her cubs, goads Kali and the largest of his sons, so as to lure them away. However, after the confrontation, the cubs have scattered. Sita desperately calls for them. As it gets darker, [[spotted hyena|hyena]]s are seen and heard. In the morning, three of her five cubs return to Sita. Although she continues to call for the other two cubs, it's clear that they have been killed by hyenas.\n\nLayla is injured by a [[zebra]]'s kick while [[hunting]]. As the [[wildebeest]] begin to migrate to greener pastures, so does the River pride. However, due to her injury and old age, Layla has trouble keeping up. Mara stays alongside her mother and tries to help on her way. Soon, they begin to lose track of the pride. Knowing that Mara needs her family for her survival, Layla forces through her injury, and they soon find themselves within the River pride once more.\n\nAs time passes, Sita's cubs have thrived, and begin to show more of their cheetah nature. One day, a gang of three adult cheetah brothers roaming about zone in on Sita. Again, Sita finds herself having to divert attention from rivals so that they do not find her cubs. However, being fellow cheetahs, they do not tire as easily as lions do; and soon, the brothers separate Sita from her cubs. As they circle them, the cubs stand their ground and hiss at the [[bullying|bullies]], meaning they have inherited their mother's prowess and [[courage|bravery]]. Before the cheetah brothers can do anything, a passing [[African elephant|elephant]] chases them away \u2013 meaning that in the savanna, even bullies get bullied.\n\nSome time later, the river has lessened. Kali and his largest son take advantage of it so they can cross and begin their [[assault]] on the River pride. They head towards the southern territory. Fang, upon seeing them approaching, runs for his life, but Layla does not back away \u2013 knowing that Mara could be killed should the assault succeed, she fearlessly attacks the rivals. Soon, the other lionesses, inspired by Layla's courage, join in the fight. Kali and his son are defeated, and leave the area in defeat, but they remain on the southern side of the river. Victory completed, Fang returns, and life returns to usual for the pride as well. Meanwhile, hyenas approach Sita and her cubs, but the brave mother cheetah, having already lost two cubs to them, does not back away; sure enough, she attacks them fearlessly, not letting them anywhere near her cubs. Finally, the hyenas give up the fight and leave \u2013 Sita's bravery has kept the remaining cubs alive and free from danger.\n\nLayla was injured ever further during the fight. Seeing that she might not make it, on a rainy day \u2013 which the lions take advantage of to bond with each other \u2013 for Mara's sake, she goes to her sister Malayka \u2013 who has cubs of her own \u2013 and reconnects with her so as to maintain a spot in the pride for Mara. Once she sees that Mara is accepted by Malayka, Layla slips away from the pride to find a quiet place to die.\n\nAs time goes by, Kali reunites with his four sons. Although they have shown signs of [[betrayal]] with ideas of dethroning him, Kali is still strong, and reminds them that as their father, he's still the boss and that only he will wear the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]. Together, they are the most powerful force in the land. They return to the River pride for another assault. Upon seeing them, Fang runs, never-to-be- seen or heard from again \u2013 if he is to ever return again, he would be shown no mercy.\n\nKali takes over the pride and exiles Fang's cubs, including Mara \u2013 now a young adult. Her male cousins are seen as the number one threat to Kali and his sons, so they hunt them down. Seeing that they can no longer stay within their pride, Fang's sons have no choice but to cross the river, even though its level has grown and it is infested with [[crocodile]]s. As they get near the northern bank, one of them is nearly caught in the [[jaw]]s of a crocodile; nonetheless, they reach land unscathed. The lionesses initially refuse to admit Kali as their leader, the wound of losing their cubs still far too fresh in their minds.\n\nMara, banished from her pride, tries to live on her own and fend for herself. However, she was banished before she was taught to hunt, and finds her first attempts at catching meals on her own, even small [[warthog]]s and especially big [[black rhinoceros|rhinos]] and [[African buffalo|buffaloes]], humiliatingly unsuccessful. She learns that there are benefits in belonging to a pride.\n\nSoon the wildebeest return, and the lionesses begin to hunt for their new cubs \u2013 Kali's offspring, having made peace with him and his sons. Mara successfully hunts and feasts. Soon after, she proves herself to the pride, and is at last welcomed back \u2013 Layla's sacrifice for raising her cub was not in vain.\n\nSita's cubs are now young adults, and they're thriving. They hone their hunting skills, they practice on a [[serval]] and a [[golden jackal|jackal]], and even get to cross the river. Afterwards, they encounter hyenas then Kali's pride, and learn to stand up to hyenas like a true brave cheetah does, and to avoid and outrun lions (instead of hunting them!). Finally, they successfully hunt an [[antelope]] for food. Sita, seeing that her cubs are now ready to forge their own path, leaves them and returns to the solitary life of a cheetah.\n\nAt the end of the film, the narrator ([[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the [[United States|US]] version, [[Patrick Stewart]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] version) shows Mara and Sita's cubs as the finest examples of a mother's love.\n\nDuring the credits, it is shown that Sita has become one of the most successful cheetah mothers to roam the plains, that her cubs went their separate ways, that Mara has been accepted by her pride and is now ready for [[mother]]hood herself, that Kali still reigns supreme on both sides of the river, and that the filmmakers are still looking for Fang.\n\n==Marketing==\nA trailer for the film has appeared in several movies.

In the opening scene, we see Mara, a six-month-old lion cub, with her mother Layla, who both belong to the River pride, which lives in the south of the [[national park|park]]. The pride's leader is named Fang, an old male lion, who has a distinctive broken [[tooth]] because of an earlier fight. In the north of the Maasai Mara, Sita and her cubs coexist with another lion pride led by a large male named Kali, who wishes to expand his pride and territory by taking over Fang's southern pride and territory, which however he cannot reach as the Pride Lands are divided by a [[Nile crocodile|crocodile]] infested [[Mara River|river]].\n\nSita's cubs are playing while Kali and his four sons are on patrol. Sita, seeing them as a serious danger to her cubs, goads Kali and the largest of his sons, so as to lure them away. However, after the confrontation, the cubs have scattered. Sita desperately calls for them. As it gets darker, [[spotted hyena|hyena]]s are seen and heard. In the morning, three of her five cubs return to Sita. Although she continues to call for the other two cubs, it's clear that they have been killed by hyenas.\n\nLayla is injured by a [[zebra]]'s kick while [[hunting]]. As the [[wildebeest]] begin to migrate to greener pastures, so does the River pride. However, due to her injury and old age, Layla has trouble keeping up. Mara stays alongside her mother and tries to help on her way. Soon, they begin to lose track of the pride. Knowing that Mara needs her family for her survival, Layla forces through her injury, and they soon find themselves within the River pride once more.\n\nAs time passes, Sita's cubs have thrived, and begin to show more of their cheetah nature. One day, a gang of three adult cheetah brothers roaming about zone in on Sita. Again, Sita finds herself having to divert attention from rivals so that they do not find her cubs. However, being fellow cheetahs, they do not tire as easily as lions do; and soon, the brothers separate Sita from her cubs. As they circle them, the cubs stand their ground and hiss at the [[bullying|bullies]], meaning they have inherited their mother's prowess and [[courage|bravery]]. Before the cheetah brothers can do anything, a passing [[African elephant|elephant]] chases them away \u2013 meaning that in the savanna, even bullies get bullied.\n\nSome time later, the river has lessened. Kali and his largest son take advantage of it so they can cross and begin their [[assault]] on the River pride. They head towards the southern territory. Fang, upon seeing them approaching, runs for his life, but Layla does not back away \u2013 knowing that Mara could be killed should the assault succeed, she fearlessly attacks the rivals. Soon, the other lionesses, inspired by Layla's courage, join in the fight. Kali and his son are defeated, and leave the area in defeat, but they remain on the southern side of the river. Victory completed, Fang returns, and life returns to usual for the pride as well. Meanwhile, hyenas approach Sita and her cubs, but the brave mother cheetah, having already lost two cubs to them, does not back away; sure enough, she attacks them fearlessly, not letting them anywhere near her cubs. Finally, the hyenas give up the fight and leave \u2013 Sita's bravery has kept the remaining cubs alive and free from danger.\n\nLayla was injured ever further during the fight. Seeing that she might not make it, on a rainy day \u2013 which the lions take advantage of to bond with each other \u2013 for Mara's sake, she goes to her sister Malayka \u2013 who has cubs of her own \u2013 and reconnects with her so as to maintain a spot in the pride for Mara. Once she sees that Mara is accepted by Malayka, Layla slips away from the pride to find a quiet place to die.\n\nAs time goes by, Kali reunites with his four sons. Although they have shown signs of [[betrayal]] with ideas of dethroning him, Kali is still strong, and reminds them that as their father, he's still the boss and that only he will wear the [[crown (heraldry)|crown]]. Together, they are the most powerful force in the land. They return to the River pride for another assault. Upon seeing them, Fang runs, never-to-be- seen or heard from again \u2013 if he is to ever return again, he would be shown no mercy.\n\nKali takes over the pride and exiles Fang's cubs, including Mara \u2013 now a young adult. Her male cousins are seen as the number one threat to Kali and his sons, so they hunt them down. Seeing that they can no longer stay within their pride, Fang's sons have no choice but to cross the river, even though its level has grown and it is infested with [[crocodile]]s. As they get near the northern bank, one of them is nearly caught in the [[jaw]]s of a crocodile; nonetheless, they reach land unscathed. The lionesses initially refuse to admit Kali as their leader, the wound of losing their cubs still far too fresh in their minds.\n\nMara, banished from her pride, tries to live on her own and fend for herself. However, she was banished before she was taught to hunt, and finds her first attempts at catching meals on her own, even small [[warthog]]s and especially big [[black rhinoceros|rhinos]] and [[African buffalo|buffaloes]], humiliatingly unsuccessful. She learns that there are benefits in belonging to a pride.\n\nSoon the wildebeest return, and the lionesses begin to hunt for their new cubs \u2013 Kali's offspring, having made peace with him and his sons. Mara successfully hunts and feasts. Soon after, she proves herself to the pride, and is at last welcomed back \u2013 Layla's sacrifice for raising her cub was not in vain.\n\nSita's cubs are now young adults, and they're thriving. They hone their hunting skills, they practice on a [[serval]] and a [[golden jackal|jackal]], and even get to cross the river. Afterwards, they encounter hyenas then Kali's pride, and learn to stand up to hyenas like a true brave cheetah does, and to avoid and outrun lions (instead of hunting them!). Finally, they successfully hunt an [[antelope]] for food. Sita, seeing that her cubs are now ready to forge their own path, leaves them and returns to the solitary life of a cheetah.\n\nAt the end of the film, the narrator ([[Samuel L. Jackson]] in the [[United States|US]] version, [[Patrick Stewart]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] version) shows Mara and Sita's cubs as the finest examples of a mother's love.\n\nDuring the credits, it is shown that Sita has become one of the most successful cheetah mothers to roam the plains, that her cubs went their separate ways, that Mara has been accepted by her pride and is now ready for [[mother]]hood herself, that Kali still reigns supreme on both sides of the river, and that the filmmakers are still looking for Fang.\n\n==Marketing==\nA trailer for the film has appeared in several movies. Some prints of the movie contain the short \"[[Regular Show|Mordecai and Rigby: Ringtoneers]]\".\nThe first trailer aired on Beauty and the Beast: Diamond Edition.\n\n==Production==\nThe families of the animals in African Cats were filmed on the [[Maasai Mara|Maasai Mara National Reserve]], a major game region in southwestern Kenya.<ref name=\"Emanuel Levy\" /> The Maasai Mara is one of the few remaining places in Africa where lions, cheetahs and leopards live in large numbers and in close proximity.<ref name=\"Massai Mara\">{{cite web|title=Massai Mara Official Web Site|url=http://www.maasaimara.com/ |website=Massai Mara|accessdate=14 April 2011}}</ref> To help achieve scientific accuracy, the directors recruited Dr. Sarah Durant of the Zoological Society of London.
