The decision to name the new car the \"Ford Focus\" was made in early 1998, as Ford's senior management had been planning to keep the \"Escort\" nameplate for its new generation of small family cars. A last-minute problem arose in July 1998 when a [[Cologne]] court, responding to a case brought by the publisher [[Hubert Burda Media|Burda]], ordered Ford to avoid the name \"Focus\" for the cars in the German market since the name was already taken by one of its magazines (''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'').<ref name=AutoMotorundSport199815>{{cite journal|editor-first=Bernd |editor-last=Ostmann |title=Focus nur fuer Auslands-Modelle: Gerichtsurteil gegen Ford |journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=15 |issue=9 |date=July 15, 1998 |language=German}}</ref> This eleventh-hour dispute was resolved, however, and the car was launched with the name ''Focus''.

It came with a 2.0-litre turbocharged ''Duratec RS'' engine, a Quaife ATB [[limited-slip differential]], [[Brembo]] brakes, and a host of other performance changes, combined with a much more aggressive appearance, and was available only in Ford's Imperial blue. 70% of the components found on the Focus RS were unique, revised or uprated. This original Focus RS was only available in Europe with a limited run of 4501 cars being built; just under half (2147) of these were sold in the UK.\n\nFor decades, in the U.S., small cars like the Focus were seen as a tool to draw in younger buyers looking for a cheap basic transportation and to increase auto makers' fleet average fuel economies to meet U.S. federal standards.<ref name=\"Cleveland\">{{cite web|last1=Schoenberger|first1=Robert|title=As buyers shun SUVs, expect to pay more for that small car|url=http://www.cleveland.com/autonews/index.ssf/2008/06/as_buyers_shun_suvs_expect_to.html|website=Cleveland.com|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Ford was said not to concern about losing money on the Focus so the company could sell gas guzzlers for big profits.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/> However, recent sales of new Focus's have been able to maintain lower or overall discounting incentive rates than many competing vehicles in its class.<ref>{{cite news|title=Customer Incentives.

Along with a 10 percent stiffer bodyshell, according to Ford this offers a better ride, but critics claimed the car lacked the precise and poised handling of the Mk 1. The same body styles as the Mk 1 Focus were offered, though the sedan did not appear until mid-2005. A two-door coup\u00e9-cabriolet with a [[retractable hardtop]] was added to the line-up in 2007.\n\nThe Focus Mk 2 is larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor: it has a {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} increase in wheelbase, and is {{convert|168|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} taller, and {{convert|138|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider. As a result, the interior and boot space have increased. New technologies include a KeyFree system, a solar-reflect windshield, adaptive front lighting, Bluetooth hands-free phones and voice control for audio, telephone, and climate control systems.\n\nStylistically, the Mk 2 features the same [[design language]] found in the Mondeo and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]]. Although still recognisable as a Focus, the new car uses styling features from the abandoned B-Proposal for the ''original'' Focus which never reached production.\n\nIn 2005, Ford released a MK.II version of Ford's sports division of Focus, the Focus ST. This one produced {{convert|225|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and could achieve a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} time of just 6.4 seconds, and a {{convert|152|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed, using a 2.5-litre, five-cylinder turbocharged engine originating from [[Volvo]].\n\n2007\u20132008 saw a minor facelifted version introduced, featuring [[Ford Kinetic Design|Ford's Kinetic Design philosophy]]. Major changes included a new bonnet with more creases, the removal of all mouldings along the doors and sides, new sculpted pull back headlights, and the big trapezoidal lower grille.\n\nIn 2009, the new Focus RS was launched, with a modified version of the 2.5-litre engine found in the ST.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===North America===\n{{Main|Ford Focus (second generation, North America)}}\n[[File:2009 ford focus SES sedan.JPG|thumb|left|Ford Focus (North America second generation)]]\n[[File:Ford Focus 2009 SES back2.JPG|thumb|right|Ford Focus (North America second generation)]]\n\nFor the North American market, development followed a separate path. Since debuting at the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]], the restyled 2008\u20132011 generation was available as a two-door [[coupe]] and four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]; the [[hatchback]]s and [[station wagon|wagon]] were discontinued. The interior was redesigned, including new seats, a new dashboard design with message center on top of the dashboard, ambient lighting, dashboard panels that simulate brushed aluminum, and Ford's voice-controlled [[Ford Sync|Sync]] audio/Bluetooth system. Also included in the redesign was a support beam behind the dashboard for extra structural rigidity.\n\nThough informally considered as the second generation, it was never officially referred to as such by Ford since its platform was the same as the first generation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Third generation (2011\u20132018)==\n{{Main|Ford Focus (third generation)}}\n[[File:Ford Focus Trend (III) \u2013 Frontansicht, 17.

Other issues included rust developing on the trunk lid of the hatchback model due to vibrations of a plastic insert creating friction and wearing out the paint on the metal skin of the lid.  Later models included a relocated park brake lever, redesigned adjustable front head rest and a redesigned accessory 12v plug that is more ergonomic.\n\nFord previewed the third generation facelifted model at the 2014 Geneva Motor Show.<ref>[http://www.ford.co.uk/experience-ford/MotorShows/GenevaMotorShow Ford at Geneva Motor Show 2014, www.ford.co.uk] Retrieved September 16, 2016</ref> The updated version features a new redesigned front end design, incorporating Ford's new family grille and slimline headlights.

The decision to name the new car the \"Ford Focus\" was made in early 1998, as Ford's senior management had been planning to keep the \"Escort\" nameplate for its new generation of small family cars. A last-minute problem arose in July 1998 when a [[Cologne]] court, responding to a case brought by the publisher [[Hubert Burda Media|Burda]], ordered Ford to avoid the name \"Focus\" for the cars in the German market since the name was already taken by one of its magazines (''[[Focus (German magazine)|Focus]]'').<ref name=AutoMotorundSport199815>{{cite journal|editor-first=Bernd |editor-last=Ostmann |title=Focus nur fuer Auslands-Modelle: Gerichtsurteil gegen Ford |journal=Auto, Motor und Sport |volume=15 |issue=9 |date=July 15, 1998 |language=German}}</ref> This eleventh-hour dispute was resolved, however, and the car was launched with the name ''Focus''.

It came with a 2.0-litre turbocharged ''Duratec RS'' engine, a Quaife ATB [[limited-slip differential]], [[Brembo]] brakes, and a host of other performance changes, combined with a much more aggressive appearance, and was available only in Ford's Imperial blue. 70% of the components found on the Focus RS were unique, revised or uprated. This original Focus RS was only available in Europe with a limited run of 4501 cars being built; just under half (2147) of these were sold in the UK.\n\nFor decades, in the U.S., small cars like the Focus were seen as a tool to draw in younger buyers looking for a cheap basic transportation and to increase auto makers' fleet average fuel economies to meet U.S. federal standards.<ref name=\"Cleveland\">{{cite web|last1=Schoenberger|first1=Robert|title=As buyers shun SUVs, expect to pay more for that small car|url=http://www.cleveland.com/autonews/index.ssf/2008/06/as_buyers_shun_suvs_expect_to.html|website=Cleveland.com|accessdate=October 19, 2016}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Ford was said not to concern about losing money on the Focus so the company could sell gas guzzlers for big profits.<ref name=\"Cleveland\"/> However, recent sales of new Focus's have been able to maintain lower or overall discounting incentive rates than many competing vehicles in its class.<ref>{{cite news|title=Customer Incentives.

Along with a 10 percent stiffer bodyshell, according to Ford this offers a better ride, but critics claimed the car lacked the precise and poised handling of the Mk 1. The same body styles as the Mk 1 Focus were offered, though the sedan did not appear until mid-2005. A two-door coup\u00e9-cabriolet with a [[retractable hardtop]] was added to the line-up in 2007.\n\nThe Focus Mk 2 is larger and considerably heavier than its predecessor: it has a {{convert|25|mm|in|abbr=on}} increase in wheelbase, and is {{convert|168|mm|in|abbr=on}} longer, {{convert|8|mm|in|abbr=on}} taller, and {{convert|138|mm|in|abbr=on}} wider. As a result, the interior and boot space have increased. New technologies include a KeyFree system, a solar-reflect windshield, adaptive front lighting, Bluetooth hands-free phones and voice control for audio, telephone, and climate control systems.\n\nStylistically, the Mk 2 features the same [[design language]] found in the Mondeo and [[Ford Fiesta|Fiesta]]. Although still recognisable as a Focus, the new car uses styling features from the abandoned B-Proposal for the ''original'' Focus which never reached production.\n\nIn 2005, Ford released a MK.II version of Ford's sports division of Focus, the Focus ST. This one produced {{convert|225|bhp|kW|abbr=on}} and could achieve a {{convert|0|-|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} time of just 6.4 seconds, and a {{convert|152|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} top speed, using a 2.5-litre, five-cylinder turbocharged engine originating from [[Volvo]].\n\n2007\u20132008 saw a minor facelifted version introduced, featuring [[Ford Kinetic Design|Ford's Kinetic Design philosophy]]. Major changes included a new bonnet with more creases, the removal of all mouldings along the doors and sides, new sculpted pull back headlights, and the big trapezoidal lower grille.\n\nIn 2009, the new Focus RS was launched, with a modified version of the 2.5-litre engine found in the ST.\n{{Clear}}\n\n===North America===\n{{Main|Ford Focus (second generation, North America)}}\n[[File:2009 ford focus SES sedan.JPG|thumb|left|Ford Focus (North America second generation)]]\n[[File:Ford Focus 2009 SES back2.JPG|thumb|right|Ford Focus (North America second generation)]]\n\nFor the North American market, development followed a separate path. Since debuting at the 2007 [[North American International Auto Show]], the restyled 2008\u20132011 generation was available as a two-door [[coupe]] and four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]]; the [[hatchback]]s and [[station wagon|wagon]] were discontinued. The interior was redesigned, including new seats, a new dashboard design with message center on top of the dashboard, ambient lighting, dashboard panels that simulate brushed aluminum, and Ford's voice-controlled [[Ford Sync|Sync]] audio/Bluetooth system. Also included in the redesign was a support beam behind the dashboard for extra structural rigidity.\n\nThough informally considered as the second generation, it was never officially referred to as such by Ford since its platform was the same as the first generation.\n{{Clear}}\n\n==Third generation (2011\u20132018)==\n{{Main|Ford Focus (third generation)}}\n[[File:Ford Focus Trend (III) \u2013 Frontansicht, 17.

Other issues included rust developing on the trunk lid of the hatchback model due to vibrations of a plastic insert creating friction and wearing out the paint on the metal skin of the lid.
