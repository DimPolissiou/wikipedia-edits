One track is about the clearing of poor neighborhoods to make way for expensive skyscrapers. Grup Yorum was also the first band in Turkey to have a Kurdish song on an album. In 1993, a lorry containing their album \"Cesaret\" was on the way to [[Diyarbakir]] when it was stopped by [[Turkish Gendarmerie]] and the boxes containing the albums were shot at with live ammunition.\n\nThe group's composition has been in a constant state of change since its inception, and its members have continuously experienced political oppression, including over 400 arrests and trials (approximately 400). Their albums have been seized by police and their concerts banned, but despite this Grup Yorum has been one of the top-selling groups in the history of Turkey. The band gave their 25th anniversary concert on 12 June 2010 in [[BJK \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc Stadium|\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc Stadium]], home to sports club [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]].

One track is about the clearing of poor neighborhoods to make way for expensive skyscrapers. Grup Yorum was also the first band in Turkey to have a Kurdish song on an album. In 1993, a lorry containing their album \"Cesaret\" was on the way to [[Diyarbakir]] when it was stopped by [[Turkish Gendarmerie]] and the boxes containing the albums were shot at with live ammunition.\n\nThe group's composition has been in a constant state of change since its inception, and its members have continuously experienced political oppression, including over 400 arrests and trials (approximately 400). Their albums have been seized by police and their concerts banned, but despite this Grup Yorum has been one of the top-selling groups in the history of Turkey. The band gave their 25th anniversary concert on 12 June 2010 in [[BJK \u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc Stadium|\u0130n\u00f6n\u00fc Stadium]], home to sports club [[Be\u015fikta\u015f J.K.]].
