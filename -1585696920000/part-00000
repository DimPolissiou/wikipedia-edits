The team's [[Akademik Stadium|stadium]] is located in the [[Slatina, Bulgaria|Slatina]] municipality of Sofia and its capacity is 10,000.\n\nAkademik debuted in [[A PFG]] in 1949 and would quickly establish themselves as a top-flight team in Bulgarian football from then on. The team became one of the top Bulgarian teams in the 1950s and 1970s, especially in the domestic and European Cup competitions, having been crowned [[Balkans Cup]] champions. Akademik's last appearance in the Bulgarian First League came in 2010, after which the team experienced financial problems and folded after the 2011-12 season. It was refounded in 2013, starting from the fourth division.\n\n==History==\nAkademik was founded in the 1947, by [[Sofia University]] (the oldest higher education institution in Bulgaria, founded on 1 October 1888) students as a football club. A two years later, Akademik were promoted for the first time to [[Bulgarian A Football Group|Bulgarian A Group]]. The [[1950 A Group|1950 season]] in the domestic league was very successful for the team, which finished 3rd in the top division. In the next campaign Akademik finished fourth and reached the final of [[Bulgarian Cup]], losing 0\u20131 to [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]. In 1952 the club's form dropped, however, and they were relegated to [[B PFG]] finishing before the last [[PFC Spartak 1918|Spartak Varna]]. In 1963\u201364 season they won a second promotion to the top division by winning the B PFG. However, the next year they were relegated again.\n\nThe third promotion to A Group in 1969 marked the beginning of Akademik's golden age. From 1969 to 1979 they spent their longest ever period in the top division. In 1974 Akademik won first international throphy, beating [[FK Vardar|Vardar Skopje]] 2\u20130 on aggregate in the final of [[Balkans Cup]]. In the 1975\u201376 season the team finished 3rd in the domestic league and qualified for first time in [[UEFA Cup]]. At the European level Akademik made a memorable appearance in the second round against Italian giants [[A.C. Milan]], winning 4\u20133 at home on 20 October 1976. Before reaching the second round of the football competition, the Students eliminated the Czech [[Slavia Prague]] respectively. In this period two players from Akademik have played for the Bulgarian national squad at a[[FIFA World Cup]]: Ivan Dimitrov in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[Mladen Vasilev]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]].\n[[File:Akademik 2010.jpg|thumb|280px|right|2009\u201310 team, which won promotion to [[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Group]].]]\nIn the 1978\u201379 season Akademik won just six games in the campaign and were relegated. In the next season the team won promotion back to the top division, scoring 100 goals in the campaign. In 1981 the Students qualified for second time in [[UEFA Cup]], where they lost 1\u20133 on aggregate in the first round against [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]]. In the same 1981\u201382 season Akademik again relegated. From 1982 to 2010 they spent their longest ever period out of the top division.\n\nAfter 28 years in the lowers divisions of Bulgarian football, in 2009\u201310 Akademik finished 2nd in [[B PFG]] and the club managed to participate in the play-off for promotion in the [[A PFG]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Livescore|title=Akademik's 2009\u201310 results and fixtures|url=http://www.livescore.cz/team.php?teamid=187879|accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref> On May 23, 2010, Akademik surprisingly won the play-off against [[PFC Nesebar|Nesebar]] with a result of 2:1 and finally qualified again for the top division.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, Akademik announced that they will play their home games at the [[Slavia Stadium]], home of [[Slavia Sofia]], instead of their usual stadium, [[Akademik Stadium]]. This was because Akademik Stadium did not obtain approval from the [[Bulgarian Football Union|BFU]]. The return to the elite proved to be hard. Academic won only 5 games, and drew 5 more, out of 30 games in total. This only earned the team 20 points, which was 5 points below [[Vidima-Rakovski Sevlievo]], who qualified for the relegation playoffs. Despite the bad results, Akademik was above the relegation zone up until round 25 of the season. The biggest highlight for Akademik was probably when the team managed to draw 1-1 against [[CSKA Sofia]], the most decorated team in Bulgarian football. However, Akademik were relegated from [[A PFG]] at the end of the 2010/2011 season after finishing in 15th place. The team finished 7th in the [[2011-12 B Group]], meaning they were relegated to the [[V AFG]]. However, the team decided not to play the following season, citing financial problems. The team was subsequently dissolved in 2012, only remaining active at youth levels.\n\n===League positions===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:60\nPlotArea  = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2020\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2008\nColors =\n  id:bl1  value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5)\n  id:bl2  value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3)\n  id:rs  value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6)\n  id:rn  value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1)\n\nPlotData=\n  bar:Position width:16 color:white align:center\n  from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2008  shift:(0,-4) text:10\n  from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2009  shift:(0,-4) text:8\n  from:01/07/2009 till:01/07/2010  shift:(0,-4) text:2\n  from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2010  color:white  shift:(0,14)  text: \"[[Bulgarian B Football Group|B Group]]\"\n  from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2011  shift:(0,-4) text:15\n  from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2011  color:green  shift:(0,14)  text: \"[[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Group]]\"\n  from:01/07/2011 till:01/07/2012  shift:(0,-4) text:7\n  from:01/07/2011 till:01/07/2012  color:white  shift:(0,14)  text: \"[[Bulgarian B Football Group|B Group]]\"\n  from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2013  color:black  shift:(0,14)  text: Dissolved\n  from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2014  shift:(0,-4) text:5\n  from:01/07/2014 till:01/07/2015  shift:(0,-4) text:2\n  from:01/07/2015 till:01/07/2016  shift:(0,-4) text:7\n  from:01/07/2016 till:01/07/2017  shift:(0,-4) text:6\n  from:01/07/2017 till:01/07/2018  shift:(0,-4) text:5\n  from:01/07/2018 till:01/07/2019  shift:(0,-4) text:4\n  from:01/07/2019 till:01/07/2020  shift:(0,-4) text:\n  from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2020  color:yellow  shift:(0,14)  text: [[Regional Amateur Football Groups (Bulgaria)|Regional]]\n</timeline>\n\n==Honours==\n===Domestic===\n'''[[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Group]]:'''\n* [[Image:Bronze medal icon.svg|15px]] Third place (2): [[1950 A Group|1950]], [[1975\u201376 A Group|1975\u201376]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|B Group]]:'''\n* [[Image:Gold medal icon.svg|15px]] '''Winners (2):''' 1963\u201364, 1979\u201380\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): [[2009\u201310 B Group|2009\u201310]]\n\n'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n* [[Image:Silver medal icon.svg|15px]] Runners-up (1): [[1951 Bulgarian Cup Final|1951]]\n\n===European===\n;'''[[Balkans Cup]]'''\n* Winners: [[Balkans Cup|1974]]\n;'''[[UEFA Cup]]'''\n* 1/16 finalist: [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup|1976\u201377]]\n\n===European cup history=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The team's [[Akademik Stadium|stadium]] is located in the [[Slatina, Bulgaria|Slatina]] municipality of Sofia and its capacity is 10,000.\n\nAkademik debuted in [[A PFG]] in 1949 and would quickly establish themselves as a top-flight team in Bulgarian football from then on. The team became one of the top Bulgarian teams in the 1950s and 1970s, especially in the domestic and European Cup competitions, having been crowned [[Balkans Cup]] champions. Akademik's last appearance in the Bulgarian First League came in 2010, after which the team experienced financial problems and folded after the 2011-12 season. It was refounded in 2013, starting from the fourth division.\n\n==History==\nAkademik was founded in the 1947, by [[Sofia University]] (the oldest higher education institution in Bulgaria, founded on 1 October 1888) students as a football club. A two years later, Akademik were promoted for the first time to [[Bulgarian A Football Group|Bulgarian A Group]]. The [[1950 A Group|1950 season]] in the domestic league was very successful for the team, which finished 3rd in the top division. In the next campaign Akademik finished fourth and reached the final of [[Bulgarian Cup]], losing 0\u20131 to [[PFC CSKA Sofia|CSKA Sofia]]. In 1952 the club's form dropped, however, and they were relegated to [[B PFG]] finishing before the last [[PFC Spartak 1918|Spartak Varna]]. In 1963\u201364 season they won a second promotion to the top division by winning the B PFG. However, the next year they were relegated again.\n\nThe third promotion to A Group in 1969 marked the beginning of Akademik's golden age. From 1969 to 1979 they spent their longest ever period in the top division. In 1974 Akademik won first international throphy, beating [[FK Vardar|Vardar Skopje]] 2\u20130 on aggregate in the final of [[Balkans Cup]]. In the 1975\u201376 season the team finished 3rd in the domestic league and qualified for first time in [[UEFA Cup]]. At the European level Akademik made a memorable appearance in the second round against Italian giants [[A.C. Milan]], winning 4\u20133 at home on 20 October 1976. Before reaching the second round of the football competition, the Students eliminated the Czech [[Slavia Prague]] respectively. In this period two players from Akademik have played for the Bulgarian national squad at a[[FIFA World Cup]]: Ivan Dimitrov in [[1970 FIFA World Cup|1970]] and [[Mladen Vasilev]] in [[1974 FIFA World Cup|1974]].\n[[File:Akademik 2010.jpg|thumb|280px|right|2009\u201310 team, which won promotion to [[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Group]].]]\nIn the 1978\u201379 season Akademik won just six games in the campaign and were relegated. In the next season the team won promotion back to the top division, scoring 100 goals in the campaign. In 1981 the Students qualified for second time in [[UEFA Cup]], where they lost 1\u20133 on aggregate in the first round against [[1. FC Kaiserslautern]]. In the same 1981\u201382 season Akademik again relegated. From 1982 to 2010 they spent their longest ever period out of the top division.\n\nAfter 28 years in the lowers divisions of Bulgarian football, in 2009\u201310 Akademik finished 2nd in [[B PFG]] and the club managed to participate in the play-off for promotion in the [[A PFG]].<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Livescore|title=Akademik's 2009\u201310 results and fixtures|url=http://www.livescore.cz/team.php?teamid=187879|accessdate=4 January 2011}}</ref> On May 23, 2010, Akademik surprisingly won the play-off against [[PFC Nesebar|Nesebar]] with a result of 2:1 and finally qualified again for the top division.\n\nDuring the summer of 2010, Akademik announced that they will play their home games at the [[Slavia Stadium]], home of [[Slavia Sofia]], instead of their usual stadium, [[Akademik Stadium]]. This was because Akademik Stadium did not obtain approval from the [[Bulgarian Football Union|BFU]]. The return to the elite proved to be hard. Academic won only 5 games, and drew 5 more, out of 30 games in total. This only earned the team 20 points, which was 5 points below [[Vidima-Rakovski Sevlievo]], who qualified for the relegation playoffs. Despite the bad results, Akademik was above the relegation zone up until round 25 of the season. The biggest highlight for Akademik was probably when the team managed to draw 1-1 against [[CSKA Sofia]], the most decorated team in Bulgarian football. However, Akademik were relegated from [[A PFG]] at the end of the 2010/2011 season after finishing in 15th place. The team finished 7th in the [[2011-12 B Group]], meaning they were relegated to the [[V AFG]]. However, the team decided not to play the following season, citing financial problems. The team was subsequently dissolved in 2012, only remaining active at youth levels.\n\n===League positions===\n<timeline>\nImageSize = width:900 height:60\nPlotArea  = left:10 right:10 bottom:30 top:10\nTimeAxis = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nDateFormat = dd/mm/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2020\nScaleMajor = unit:year increment:1 start:2008\nColors =\n  id:bl1  value:rgb(0.5,0.8,0.5)\n  id:bl2  value:rgb(0.9,0.9,0.3)\n  id:rs  value:rgb(0.8,0.6,0.6)\n  id:rn  value:rgb(0.9,0.1,0.1)\n\nPlotData=\n  bar:Position width:16 color:white align:center\n  from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2008  shift:(0,-4) text:10\n  from:01/07/2008 till:01/07/2009  shift:(0,-4) text:8\n  from:01/07/2009 till:01/07/2010  shift:(0,-4) text:2\n  from:01/07/2007 till:01/07/2010  color:white  shift:(0,14)  text: \"[[Bulgarian B Football Group|B Group]]\"\n  from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2011  shift:(0,-4) text:15\n  from:01/07/2010 till:01/07/2011  color:green  shift:(0,14)  text: \"[[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Group]]\"\n  from:01/07/2011 till:01/07/2012  shift:(0,-4) text:7\n  from:01/07/2011 till:01/07/2012  color:white  shift:(0,14)  text: \"[[Bulgarian B Football Group|B Group]]\"\n  from:01/07/2012 till:01/07/2013  color:black  shift:(0,14)  text: Dissolved\n  from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2014  shift:(0,-4) text:5\n  from:01/07/2014 till:01/07/2015  shift:(0,-4) text:2\n  from:01/07/2015 till:01/07/2016  shift:(0,-4) text:7\n  from:01/07/2016 till:01/07/2017  shift:(0,-4) text:6\n  from:01/07/2017 till:01/07/2018  shift:(0,-4) text:5\n  from:01/07/2018 till:01/07/2019  shift:(0,-4) text:4\n  from:01/07/2019 till:01/07/2020  shift:(0,-4) text:\n  from:01/07/2013 till:01/07/2020  color:yellow  shift:(0,14)  text: [[Regional Amateur Football Groups (Bulgaria)|Regional]]\n</timeline>\n\n==Honours==\n===Domestic===\n;'''[[Bulgarian A Football Group|A Group]]:'''\n* Third place (2): [[1950 A Group|1950]], [[1975\u201376 A Group|1975\u201376]]\n;'''[[Bulgarian B Professional Football Group|B Group]]:'''\n* Champions: 1963\u201364, 1979\u201380\n* Runners-up: [[2009\u201310 B Group|2009\u201310]]\n;'''[[Bulgarian Cup]]:'''\n* Runners-up (1): [[1951 Bulgarian Cup Final|1951]]\n\n===European===\n;'''[[Balkans Cup]]'''\n* Winners: [[Balkans Cup|1974]]\n;'''[[UEFA Cup]]'''\n* 1/16 finalist: [[1976\u201377 UEFA Cup|1976\u201377]]\n\n===European cup history=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\".

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

In 1559, the church became Protestant with [[John Knox]], the foremost figure of the [[Scottish Reformation]], as its minister. After the Reformation, St Giles' was internally partitioned to serve multiple congregations as well as secular purposes, including as a prison, and as meeting places for the [[Court of Session]] and the [[Parliament of Scotland]]. During periods of [[episcopacy]] within the Church of Scotland, St Giles' briefly served as a [[cathedral]] in the 17th century. In 1637, a riot at St Giles' against the religious reforms of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] precipitated the formation of the [[Covenanters]] and the beginnings of the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms]]. In the 19th century, St Giles' was restored and the internal partitions were removed.\n\nThe current church building dates from the 14th century onwards and its distinctive [[crown steeple]] is one of Edinburgh's best-known landmarks. Since the medieval period, St Giles' has been the site of nationally important events and services and the [[Thistle Chapel| chapel of the Order of the Thistle]] is located here. The church's role in the Scottish Reformation and the Covenanters' Rebellion has led to its being called \"the Mother Church of World Presbyterianism\". Alongside housing an active congregation, the church is one of Scotland's most popular visitor sites, welcoming over a million visitors in 2018.\n\n==Name and dedication==\n[[File:Saint Giles, Thistle Chapel.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Saint Giles depicted in a [[Boss (architecture)|boss]] in the ceiling of the Thistle Chapel]]\n[[Saint Giles]] is the patron saint of [[leprosy|lepers]].

At [[Glorious Revolution|James' deposition]] the following year, a mob destroyed the Chapel's interior before the Knights ever met there. In the 19th and early and early 20th centuries, multiple proposals were made either to refurbish Holyrood Abbey for the Order of the Thistle or to create a chapel within St Giles' Cathedral. In 1906, after the sons [[Ronald Leslie-Melville, 11th Earl of Leven]] donated \u00a324,000 from their late father's estate, [[Edward VII]] ordered a new Chapel to be constructed on the south side of St Giles'.\n\nThe Trustees appointed by the King to oversee the Chapel's construction appointed [[Robert Lorimer]] as architect. The Trustees insisted the choice of craftspeople should reflect the national character of the Chapel. Lorimer assembled a team of leading figures in the Scottish [[Arts and Crafts movement]], including [[Phoebe Anna Traquair]] for [[Vitreous enamel|enamelwork]], [[Douglas Strachan]] for [[stained glass]], Joseph Hayes for stonework, and the brothers William and Alexander Clow for woodwork. [[Louis Davis]] \u2013 who supplied  stained glass \u2013 and the [[Bromsgrove Guild of Applied Arts|Bromsgrove Guild]] \u2013 who supplied [[bronze]] fittings \u2013 were the only major contributors based outside Scotland. Construction began in November 1909 and the Chapel was completed a little over a year later. After its official opening in July 1911, [[George V]] knighted Lorimer for his work. Through the continuing addition of stall plates, [[Crest (heraldry)|crests]], and [[banner]]s for new Knights, the Chapel's tradition of craftsmanship persists to the present day. The Knights of the Thistle meet in the Chapel at least once a year.\n\nArchitectural critics have noted Lorimer's successful use of a limited site to create a soaring work of [[Gothic architecture]], rich with architectural details. A number of critics have emphasised the Chapel's importance as a product of the [[Arts and Crafts movement]], in which the collaborative craftsmanship of individual artisans defines the overall effect. Some critics have also emphasised the Chapel's political role as an expression of Scottish patriotism, [[British Empire|British imperialism]], and monarchism.\n\n==Ministry==\nJ.

Osteoid osteomas tend to be less than 1.5&nbsp;cm in size. The tumor can be in any bone in the body but are most common in long bones, such as the femur and tibia. They account for 10 to 12 percent of all benign bone tumors. \"Osteoid osteomas may occur at any age, and are most common in patients between the ages of 4 and 25 years old.

Osteoid osteomas tend to be less than 1.5&nbsp;cm in size. The tumor can be in any bone in the body but are most common in long bones, such as the femur and tibia. They account for 10 to 12 percent of all benign bone tumors. \"Osteoid osteomas may occur at any age, and are most common in patients between the ages of 4 and 25 years old.

Large cystic changes in the left lung, leading to a mediastinal shift to the right due to their mass effect.]]\nCPAMs are often identified during routine prenatal [[ultrasonography]]. Identifying characteristics on the sonogram include: an echogenic (bright) mass appearing in the chest of the fetus, displacement of the heart from its normal position, a flat or everted (pushed downward) diaphragm, or the absence of visible lung tissue.\n\nCPAMs are classified into three different types based largely on their gross appearance.  Type I has a large (>2&nbsp;cm) multiloculated cysts.  Type II has smaller uniform cysts.  Type III is not grossly cystic, referred to as the \"adenomatoid\" type.  Microscopically, the lesions are not true cysts, but communicate with the surrounding parenchyma. Some lesions have an abnormal connection to a blood vessel from an aorta and are referred to as \"hybrid lesions.\"\n\n===Imaging===\n[[File:Congenital pulmonary airway malformation sagittal.jpg|thumb|Congenital pulmonary airway malformation in a fetus, ultrasound at 19 weeks -sagittal.

The classic description is of an [[echogenicity|echogenic]] lung mass that gradually disappears over subsequent ultrasounds. The disappearance is due to the malformation becoming filled with fluid over the course of the gestation, allowing the ultrasound waves to penetrate it more easily and rendering it invisible on sonographic imaging. When a CPAM is rapidly growing, either solid or with a dominant cyst, they have a higher incidence of developing venous outflow [[stenosis|obstruction]], [[cardiac failure]] and ultimately ''[[hydrops fetalis]]''. If ''hydrops'' is not present, the fetus has a 95% chance of survival. When hydrops is present, risk of fetal demise is much greater without ''[[in utero]]'' [[surgery]] to correct the pathophysiology. The greatest period of growth is during the end of the second [[Pregnancy|trimester]], between 20\u201326 weeks.\n\nA measure of mass volume divided by head circumference, termed cystic adenomatoid malformation volume ratio (CVR) has been developed to predict the risk of ''hydrops''. The lung mass volume is determined using the formula (length \u00d7 width \u00d7 anteroposterior diameter \u00f7 2), divided by head circumference. With a CVR greater than 1.6 being considered high risk. Fetuses with a CVR less than 1.6 and without a dominant cyst have less than a 3% risk of hydrops. After delivery, if the patient is symptomatic, resection is mandated. If the infant is asymptomatic, the need for resection is a subject of debate, though it is usually recommended.

This agreement was signed on 12 September 1998 in [[Estella-Lizarra]] by every political party linked to [[Basque nationalism]] in the [[Southern Basque Country]], and [[United Left-Greens|Ezker Batua]] (EB), the Basque branch of the Spanish [[United Left (Spain)|Izquierda Unida]] (United Left).<ref name=\"elmundo1\">[http://www.elmundo.es/eta/documentos/pacto_lizarra.html Acuerdo de Lizarra, Especial El Mundo], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''{{in lang|es}}</ref> These groups worked together under the understanding that \"discussions would only take place while there was a total absence of all expressions of violence connected to the conflict\".<ref name=\"elmundo1\"/>\n\nThis agreement proposed a common position on the defense of Basque self-determination. In the chapter ''Keys to the resolution'' it says:\n\n<blockquote>\"A resolution will not involve any specific impositions, will respect the plurality of Basque society, will place every project on equal terms, will deepen democracy in the sense of giving to the citizens of the Basque Country the last word on the shaping of their future, and that their decision should be respected by the countries involved. The Basque Country should have the final word and the decision.\"<ref name=\"elmundo1\"/></blockquote>\n\n[[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] declared an \"indefinite [[ceasefire]]\" four days later,<ref>[http://www.elmundo.es/eta/documentos/pacto_lizarra.html ETA declara una tregua indefinida], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]''{{in lang|es}}</ref> the second in the history of the organization.

The Lizarra-Garazi agreements helped give ''Euskal Herritarrok'' their best electoral results in ten years, and they became the third-largest political party in Basque Country and the adjacent region of [[Navarre]]. This popularity in terms of votes was reversed when in 1999 ETA decided to end the ceasefire, and, in 2000, killed [[Pedro Antonio Blanco]]. ETA blamed the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) for not implementing the Lizarra-Garazi agreements, and the PNV blamed ETA. The cessation of the ceasefire was condemned by every signatory to the Lizarra-Garazi agreements with the exception of Herri Batasuna.  This refusal to condemn violence brought the agreements to an end.\n\n=== Glorifying terrorism charges ===\n[[File:Otegi.ogv|thumb|300px|Interview with Arnaldo Otegi (English subtitles)]]\nIn August 2000, a senior Basque court accused him of \"glorifying terrorism\", after he allegedly shouted \"''Gora Euskadi ta Askatasuna!''\" (\"''Up Euskadi and freedom!''\"), in France in reference to [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] who were banned as a terrorist group by the Spanish and French governments.<ref>{{cite news|title=La Fiscal\u00eda de Bilbao se querella contra Otegi por apologia del terrorismo|url=http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2000/08/10/023.html|accessdate=16 November 2015|publisher=ABC Sevilla|date=10 August 2000}}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court (Spain)|Spanish Supreme Court]] closed the case, stating that crimes such as \"glorifying terrorism\" could not be pursued if committed abroad.<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/OTEGI_MONDRAGON/_ARNALDO/TRIBUNAL_SUPREMO/Supremo/actuara/Otegi/vitoreo/ETA/fuera/Espana/elpepipor/20020528elpepinac_1/Tes/  El Supremo no actuar\u00e1 contra Otegi porque vitore\u00f3 a ETA fuera de Espa\u00f1a], ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'', 28 May 2002 {{in lang|es}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Terror Case Thrown Out | author = | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C01EED8133BF93BA15756C0A9649C8B63 | work =[[The New York Times]] | date = 28 May 2002 | accessdate = 2007-10-28}}</ref> This precedent was then called forth by the ''[[Audiencia Nacional]]'' concerning the [[Carmelo Soria]] case.<ref>[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/Archivan/caso/asesinato/Carmelo/Soria/Chile/precedente/Otegi/elpeputec/20020531elpepunac_8/Tes Archivan el caso del asesinato de Carmelo Soria en Chile por el precedente de Otegi], ''[[El Pa\u00eds]]'', 31 May 2002 {{in lang|es}}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005 Arnaldo Otegi was put on trial for belonging to ETA, but was released after posting bail for \u20ac400,000.

The Lizarra-Garazi agreements helped give ''Euskal Herritarrok'' their best electoral results in ten years, and they became the third-largest political party in Basque Country and the adjacent region of [[Navarre]]. This popularity in terms of votes was reversed when in 1999 ETA decided to end the ceasefire, and, in 2000, killed [[Pedro Antonio Blanco]]. ETA blamed the [[Basque Nationalist Party]] (PNV) for not implementing the Lizarra-Garazi agreements, and the PNV blamed ETA. The cessation of the ceasefire was condemned by every signatory to the Lizarra-Garazi agreements with the exception of Herri Batasuna.

It causes the [[esophagus]] to end in a blind-ended pouch rather than connecting normally to the [[stomach]]. It comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus. It is characterized anatomically by a congenital obstruction of the [[esophagus]] with interruption of the continuity of the esophageal wall.{{Clarify|reasontjwetWERHSAERGsentence makes little to no sense|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Image:Pouch atresia.jpg|thumb|Plain X-ray of the chest and abdomen showing a feeding tube unable to move beyond an upper esophageal pouch.]]\n[[Image:Esophageal atresia contrast.png|thumb|Plain x-ray with contrast in the upper esophagus above the atresia.]]\n[[Image:Esophageal Atresia for Website.jpg|thumb|Surgical treatment of the condition.]]\n[[Image:Atrezja op.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation.]]\nThis birth defect arises in the fourth fetal week, when the trachea and esophagus should begin to separate from each other.\n\nIt can be associated with disorders of the [[tracheoesophageal septum]].<ref name=\"Clark1999\">{{cite journal |author=Clark DC |title=Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=910\u20136, 919\u201320 |date=February 1999 |pmid=10068713  |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990215ap/910.html }}</ref>\n===Complications===\nAny attempt at feeding could cause [[aspiration pneumonia]] as the milk collects in the blind pouch and overflows into the trachea and lungs. Furthermore, a fistula between the lower esophagus and trachea may allow stomach acid to flow into the lungs and cause damage. Because of these dangers, the condition must be treated as soon as possible after birth.\n\n===Associated birth defects===\nOther birth defects may co-exist, particularly in the [[heart]], but sometimes also in the anus, spinal column, or kidneys. This is known as [[VACTERL association]] because of the involvement of Vertebral column, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheal, Esophageal, Renal, and Limbs. It is associated with [[polyhydramnios]] in the third trimester.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThis condition may be visible, after about 26 weeks, on an [[ultrasound]]. On antenatal USG, the finding of an absent or small stomach in the setting of polyhydramnios was considered a potential symptom of esophageal atresia. However, these findings have a low positive predictive value. The upper neck pouch sign is another sign that helps in the antenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and it may be detected soon after birth as the affected infant will be unable to swallow its own [[saliva]].  Also, the newborn can present with gastric distention, cough, apnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis. In many types of esophageal atresia, a feeding tube will not pass through the esophagus.\n\n===Classification===\nThis condition takes several different forms, often involving one or more [[fistula]]s connecting the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the [[esophagus]] ([[tracheoesophageal fistula]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Instead, it ends as a blind pouch. [[Tracheoesophageal fistula]] (TEF) represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus. EA and TEF can occur separately or together. EA and TEF are diagnosed in the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] at birth and treated immediately.\n\nThe presence of EA is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation (drooling) and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking, coughing and sneezing. When fed, these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth. The infant may become cyanotic (turn bluish due to lack of oxygen) and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated (sucked into) the trachea. The cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm (a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea). Over time respiratory distress will develop.\n\nIf any of the above signs/symptoms are noticed, a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance. If resistance is noted, other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular x-ray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending. Sometimes a small amount of [[barium sulfate|barium]] (chalk-like liquid) is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems.\n\nTreatment of EA and TEF is surgery to repair the defect. If EA or TEF is suspected, all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started. The infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration. Babies with EA may sometimes have other problems. Studies will be done to look at the heart, spine and kidneys.\n\nSurgery to repair EA is essential as the baby will not be able to feed and is highly likely to develop pneumonia. Once the baby is in condition for surgery, an incision is made on the side of the chest. The esophagus can usually be sewn together. Following surgery, the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time. Care for each infant is individualized.\n\nIts very commonly seen in a newborn with [[imperforate anus]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Harmon C.M. |author2=Coran A.G. | title=''Congenital anomalies of the esophagus''.

It causes the [[esophagus]] to end in a blind-ended pouch rather than connecting normally to the [[stomach]]. It comprises a variety of congenital anatomic defects that are caused by an abnormal embryological development of the esophagus. It is characterized anatomically by a congenital obstruction of the [[esophagus]] with interruption of the continuity of the esophageal wall.{{Clarify|reasontjwetWERHSAERGsentence makes little to no sense|date=August 2011}}\n\n==Signs and symptoms==\n[[Image:Pouch atresia.jpg|thumb|Plain X-ray of the chest and abdomen showing a feeding tube unable to move beyond an upper esophageal pouch.]]\n[[Image:Esophageal atresia contrast.png|thumb|Plain x-ray with contrast in the upper esophagus above the atresia.]]\n[[Image:Esophageal Atresia for Website.jpg|thumb|Surgical treatment of the condition.]]\n[[Image:Atrezja op.jpg|thumb|Schematic representation.]]\nThis birth defect arises in the fourth fetal week, when the trachea and esophagus should begin to separate from each other.\n\nIt can be associated with disorders of the [[tracheoesophageal septum]].<ref name=\"Clark1999\">{{cite journal |author=Clark DC |title=Esophageal atresia and tracheoesophageal fistula |journal=Am Fam Physician |volume=59 |issue=4 |pages=910\u20136, 919\u201320 |date=February 1999 |pmid=10068713  |url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/990215ap/910.html }}</ref>\n===Complications===\nAny attempt at feeding could cause [[aspiration pneumonia]] as the milk collects in the blind pouch and overflows into the trachea and lungs. Furthermore, a fistula between the lower esophagus and trachea may allow stomach acid to flow into the lungs and cause damage. Because of these dangers, the condition must be treated as soon as possible after birth.\n\n===Associated birth defects===\nOther birth defects may co-exist, particularly in the [[heart]], but sometimes also in the anus, spinal column, or kidneys. This is known as [[VACTERL association]] because of the involvement of Vertebral column, Anorectal, Cardiac, Tracheal, Esophageal, Renal, and Limbs. It is associated with [[polyhydramnios]] in the third trimester.\n\n==Diagnosis==\nThis condition may be visible, after about 26 weeks, on an [[ultrasound]]. On antenatal USG, the finding of an absent or small stomach in the setting of polyhydramnios was considered a potential symptom of esophageal atresia. However, these findings have a low positive predictive value. The upper neck pouch sign is another sign that helps in the antenatal diagnosis of esophageal atresia and it may be detected soon after birth as the affected infant will be unable to swallow its own [[saliva]].  Also, the newborn can present with gastric distention, cough, apnea, tachypnea, and cyanosis. In many types of esophageal atresia, a feeding tube will not pass through the esophagus.\n\n===Classification===\nThis condition takes several different forms, often involving one or more [[fistula]]s connecting the [[vertebrate trachea|trachea]] to the [[esophagus]] ([[tracheoesophageal fistula]]).\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Instead, it ends as a blind pouch. [[Tracheoesophageal fistula]] (TEF) represents an abnormal opening between the trachea and esophagus. EA and TEF can occur separately or together. EA and TEF are diagnosed in the [[Intensive care unit|ICU]] at birth and treated immediately.\n\nThe presence of EA is suspected in an infant with excessive salivation (drooling) and in a newborn with drooling that is frequently accompanied by choking, coughing and sneezing. When fed, these infants swallow normally but begin to cough and struggle as the fluid returns through the nose and mouth. The infant may become cyanotic (turn bluish due to lack of oxygen) and may stop breathing as the overflow of fluid from the blind pouch is aspirated (sucked into) the trachea. The cyanosis is a result of laryngospasm (a protective mechanism that the body has to prevent aspiration into the trachea). Over time respiratory distress will develop.\n\nIf any of the above signs/symptoms are noticed, a catheter is gently passed into the esophagus to check for resistance. If resistance is noted, other studies will be done to confirm the diagnosis. A catheter can be inserted and will show up as white on a regular x-ray film to demonstrate the blind pouch ending. Sometimes a small amount of [[barium sulfate|barium]] (chalk-like liquid) is placed through the mouth to diagnose the problems.\n\nTreatment of EA and TEF is surgery to repair the defect. If EA or TEF is suspected, all oral feedings are stopped and intravenous fluids are started. The infant will be positioned to help drain secretions and decrease the likelihood of aspiration. Babies with EA may sometimes have other problems. Studies will be done to look at the heart, spine and kidneys.\n\nSurgery to repair EA is essential as the baby will not be able to feed and is highly likely to develop pneumonia. Once the baby is in condition for surgery, an incision is made on the side of the chest. The esophagus can usually be sewn together. Following surgery, the baby may be hospitalized for a variable length of time. Care for each infant is individualized.\n\nIts very commonly seen in a newborn with [[imperforate anus]].\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n*{{cite book|author1=Harmon C.M. |author2=Coran A.G. | title=''Congenital anomalies of the esophagus''.
