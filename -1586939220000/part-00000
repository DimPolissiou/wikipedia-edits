It is one of the dialects of the [[Western Desert Language]] and is very similar to its close neighbour [[Ngaatjatjarra language|Ngaatjatjarra]], with which it is highly mutually intelligible.\n\nMost Ngaanyatjarra people live in one of the communities of [[Warburton, Western Australia|Warburton]], [[Warakurna]], Tjukurla, [[Papulankutja]] ([[Blackstone, Western Australia|Blackstone]]), [[Mantamaru]] (Jameson) or [[Kaltukatjara, Northern Territory|Kaltukatjara (Docker River)]]. Some have moved to [[Cosmo Newbery (Yilka)|Cosmo Newbery]] and [[Laverton, Western Australia|Laverton]] in the [[Eastern Goldfields]] area of [[Western Australia]].\n\n==Origin of the name==\nThe name ''Ngaanyatjarra'' derives from the word ''ngaanya'' 'this' which, combined with the [[comitative suffix]] ''-tjarra'' means \"having ''ngaanya'' (as the word for 'this')\". This distinguishes it from its near neighbour Ngaatjatjarra, which has ''ngaatja'' for 'this'.\n\n==Phonology==\n===Vowels===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n!\n![[Front vowel|Front]]\n![[Back vowel|Back]]\n|-\n![[High vowel|High]]\n|'''i''' {{IPA|[i]}} '''ii''' {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}}\n|'''u''' {{IPA|[\u028a]}} '''uu''' {{IPA|[u\u02d0]}}\n|-\n![[Low vowel|Low]]\n|'''a''' {{IPA|[a]}} '''aa''' {{IPA|[a\u02d0]}}\n|\n|}\n\n* Before alveolar consonants, the three vowels {{IPA|/i, a, u/}} are pronounced as {{IPA|[\u026a, \u0250, \u028a]}}.\n* Before velar consonants, the three vowels {{IPA|/i, a, u/}} are pronounced as {{IPA|[\u026a, \u0252, o]}}.\n* Vowel sounds are rhoticized when preceding retroflex consonants.\n\n*\n\n===Consonants===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=text-align:center\n! rowspan=\"2\" |\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Peripheral consonant|Peripheral]]\n![[Laminal consonant|Laminal]]\n! colspan=\"2\" |[[Apical consonant|Apical]]\n|-\n![[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n![[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n![[Dental consonant|Dental]]/<br>[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n![[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n![[Retroflex consonant|Retroflex]]\n|-\n![[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n|'''p''' {{IPA|[p]}}\n|'''k''' {{IPA|[k]}}\n|'''tj''' {{IPA|[t\u032a]}}\n|'''t''' {{IPA|[t]}}\n|'''\u1e6f''' {{IPA|[\u0288]}}\n|-\n![[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|'''m''' {{IPA|[m]}}\n|'''ng''' {{IPA|[\u014b]}}\n|'''ny''' {{IPA|[n\u032a]}}\n|'''n''' {{IPA|[n]}}\n|'''\u1e49''' {{IPA|[\u0273]}}\n|-\n![[Lateral consonant|Lateral]]\n|\n|\n|'''ly''' {{IPA|[l\u032a]}}\n|'''l''' {{IPA|[l]}}\n|'''\u1e3b''' {{IPA|[\u026d]}}\n|-\n![[Rhotic consonant|Rhotic]]\n|\n|\n|\n|'''r''' {{IPA|[\u027e~r]}}\n|\n|-\n![[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n| colspan=\"2\" |'''w''' {{IPA|[w]}}\n|'''y''' {{IPA|[j]}}\n|\n|'''\u1e5f''' {{IPA|[\u027b]}}\n|}\n\n* Laminal stop sounds are different in the Ngaanyatjarra dialect, in that they are not palatal, but dental, yet they are still orthographically transcribed the same as the other dialects.\n*When occurring after nasal sounds, stop consonants become slightly voiced.\n\n==Notes==\n{{notelist}}\n\n===Citations===\n{{Reflist|35em}}\n<!-- Note the ususually large width.

coronavirus pandemic|ongoing pandemic]] of [[COVID-19|coronavirus disease 2019]] (COVID-19), caused by [[severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2]] (SARS-CoV-2), was confirmed to have reached [[Sweden]] on 31 January 2020, when a woman returning from [[Wuhan]] tested positive. On 26 February, following outbreaks [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Italy|in Italy]] and [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in Iran|in Iran]], multiple travel-related clusters appeared in Sweden. [[Transmission (medicine)#Definition and related terms|Community transmission]] was confirmed on 9 March in the [[Stockholm Regional Council|Stockholm region]]. Since then, individuals in every [[Counties of Sweden|l\u00e4n (county)]] have tested positive for COVID-19.

The government can follow agency recommendations, as it has with legislation limiting [[freedom of assembly]], temporarily banning gatherings of over 50 individuals, banning people from visiting nursing homes, as well as physically closing [[secondary school]]s and [[University|universities]].<!--Reference in text--> Primary schools have remained open, in part to avoid healthcare workers staying home with their children.<!-- References in main text, not lead--><!-- Recommendations and health care changes -->\n\nThe Public Health Agency and government issued recommendations to: if possible, work from home; avoid unnecessary travel within the country; to engage in [[social distancing]]; and for people above 70 to stay at home, as much as possible.

The '[[Sick leave#Sweden|''karensdag'']]' or initial day without paid [[Sick leave|sick-leave]] has been removed by the government and the length of time one can stay home with pay without a doctor's note has been raised from 7 to 21 days.<!-- References in main text, not lead--><!-- Case number-->\n\n{{As of|2020|4|14|df=EU}}, there were 11,445 confirmed cases, of which 915 received intensive care, and 1,033 deaths related to the newly found virus in Sweden, with [[Stockholm County]] being the most affected.<ref name=\"FHM_Official_stats\">{{Cite web|url=https://experience.arcgis.com/experience/09f821667ce64bf7be6f9f87457ed9aa|title=Antal fall av covid-19 i Sverige - data uppdateras dagligen kl 11.30|last=|first=|date=2020-03-30|website=Public Health Agency of Sweden \u2014 Official statistics at arcgis|publisher=[[Public Health Agency of Sweden]] (Folkh\u00e4lsomyndigheten)|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-09|layurl=https://www.folkhalsomyndigheten.se/smittskydd-beredskap/utbrott/aktuella-utbrott/covid-19/aktuellt-epidemiologiskt-lage/|laysource=Antal fall av covid-19 \u2014 Statistik \u2013 antal fall covid-19|language=Swedish|quote=\"Data updated daily at 11:30 [CET]\"}}</ref><!-- Reference added for statement that is subject to frequent change-->\n\n==Background==\n{{Further|2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic#History}}\nOn 12 January, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) confirmed that a [[novel coronavirus]] (nCoV) was the cause of a [[COVID-19|respiratory illness]] in a cluster of people in [[Wuhan]], in [[Hubei|Hubei province]], [[China]], who had initially come to the WHO's attention on 31 December 2019.

Shoebury Common Beach is the site of many [[beach hut]]s located on both the promenade and the beach. A [[Coast Guard]] watch tower at the eastern end of the beach keeps watch over the sands and mudflats while listening out for distress calls over the radio. A cycle path skirts around the sea-front linking the East Beach to Shoebury Common Beach, and thence into Southend and a number of other towns, including Leigh-on-Sea.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n==In popular culture==\n[[File:Joseph Mallord William Turner 033.jpg|thumb|right|''Shoeburyness Fisherman Hailing a Whitstable Hoy'' by [[J.
