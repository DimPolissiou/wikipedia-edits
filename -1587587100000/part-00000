Other popular examples of online auction sites include WebStore, OnlineAuction and Overstock.\n\n==History==\n[[World Wide Web|Web]]-based [[e-commerce|online commercial]] activity for online auctions dates back to 1995, when two auction sites were founded independently with alternative business models.<ref name=\"Bunnell\">{{cite book |last1=Bunnell |first1=David |title=The ebay Phenomenon: Business Secrets Behind the World's Hottest Internet Company |date=2001 |publisher=[[John Wiley & Sons]] |isbn=9780471436799 |pages=71\u201381 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pnict8L-_iYC&pg=PA71 |chapter=The eBay Business Model}}</ref> The first online auction site was [[Onsale.com]], founded by [[Jerry Kaplan]] in May 1995.<ref>{{cite news |title=Auction of Collectibles on the Internet |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/05/23/business/company-news-auction-of-collectibles-on-the-internet.html |accessdate=18 September 2019 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 23, 1995}}</ref> In September that same year, [[eBay]] was founded by French-Iranian computer scientist [[Pierre Omidyar]]. Both of these companies used ascending bid. The Web offered new advantages such as the use of automated bids via electronic forms, a search engine to be able to quickly find items, and the ability to allow users to view items by categories. In contrast to Onsale where the company itself was acting as the seller, eBay was the first online auction site to support person-to-person transactions. This led to eBay becoming the first online auction to draw a mass volume of [[online transactions]], and it had the largest [[e-commerce]] userbase of any site into the 2000s.<ref name=\"Bunnell\"/>\n\nOnline auctions have greatly increased the variety of goods and services that can be bought and sold using auction mechanisms along with expanding the possibilities for the ways auctions can be conducted and in general created new uses for auctions. In the current web environment there are hundreds, if not thousands, of websites dedicated to online auction practices.\n\nHowever, online auctions on websites weren't the first type of online auctions. In fact, before them, online auctions took place through email and bulletin boards. The auctioneer/seller would post a notice on a system bulletin board, describing the item for sale and setting a minimum bid and closing time.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y206/m08/abu0173/s04|title=The Very First Online Auctions|last=Banks|first=Michael|date=August 20, 2006|website=Ecommerce bytes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref> CompuServe was sponsoring such auctions through its classified ad system in 1980. But individuals ran their own online auctions as early as 1979 on both CompuServe and The Source, which were in beta the first part of that year. Such auctions were also run on the earliest public BBSes, going back to 1978. <ref name=\":1\" />\n\n==Types==\n{{See also|Auction#Types}}\n\n===English auctions===\n\nIn live terms, [[English auction]]s are where bids are announced by either an auctioneer or by the bidders and winners pay what they bid to receive the object. English auctions are claimed to be the most common form of third-party on-line auction format used and is deemed to appear the most simplistic of all the forms.<ref name='managing_online_auctions'>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = E.

The winner is the highest bidder and the price is the highest bid.<ref name='managing_online_auctions' /> The popularity of the English auction is due to the fact that it uses a mechanism that people find familiar and intuitive and therefore reduces transaction costs. It also transcends the boundaries of a traditional English auction where physical presence is required by the bidders, making it increasingly popular even though there is a susceptibility to various forms of cheating.<ref name='managing_online_auctions' /> In the ascending-price auction, it is a \u2018dominant strategy\u2019 to stay in the auction until the price reaches the bidder's value.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ockenfels|first=Axel|last2=Reiley|first2=David|last3=Sadrieh|first3=Abdolkarim|date=December 2006|title=Online Auctions|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12785}}</ref>\n\n===Dutch auctions===\n[[Dutch auction]]s are the reverse of English auctions whereby the price begins high and is systematically lowered until a buyer accepts the price. Dutch auction services are usually misleading and the term 'Dutch' tends to have become common usage for the use of a [[multiunit auction]] in a single unit auction as opposed to how it is originally intended for that of a declining price auction. However, with actual on-line Dutch auctions where the price is descending, it was found that auctions have on average a 30% higher ending price than first-price auctions with speculation pointing to bidder impatience or the effect of endogenous entry on the Dutch auction.\n\n===First-price sealed-bid===\n[[First-price sealed-bid auction|First-price sealed-bid]] auctions are when a single bid is made by all bidding parties and the single highest bidder wins, and pays what they bid. The main difference between this and [[#English auctions|English auctions]] is that bids are not openly viewable or announced as opposed to the competitive nature which is generated by public bids. From the [[game theory|game-theoretic]] point of view, the first-price sealed-bid auction is strategically equivalent to the [[Dutch auction]]; that is, in both auctions the players will be using the same bidding strategies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Milgrom|first1=P.|last2=Weber|first2=R.|year=1982|title=A theory of auctions and competitive bidding|journal=Econometrica|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1089&ndash;1122|jstor=1911865|doi=10.2307/1911865|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/447.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Vickrey auction===\nA [[Vickrey auction]], sometimes known as a ''second-price sealed-bid auction'', uses very much the same principle as a first-price sealed bid. However, the highest bidder and winner will only pay what the second highest bidder had bid.   \nThe Vickrey auction is suggested to prevent the incentive for buyers to bid strategically, due to the fact it requires them to speak the truth by giving their true value of the item. If a bidder makes a very high bid, they may have to pay that price, but if they make a low bid there is a chance that they will lose the item. Therefore, the winner is the person who values the item the highest. It's a win-win situation for both the seller and the winner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Amit|first1=Alon|title=What Is a Vickrey Auction, and How Does It Work?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/09/09/vickrey_auction_what_is_it_and_why_does_the_winner_pay_the_second_highest.html|website=Slate|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Reverse auction===\n[[Reverse auction]]s are where the roles of buyer and seller are reversed. Multiple sellers compete to obtain the buyer's business and prices typically decrease over time as new offers are made. They do not follow the typical auction format in that the buyer can see all the offers and may choose which they would prefer. Reverse auctions are used predominantly in a business context for [[procurement]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor= 30040539|date=3 July 2003|author=Jap, Sandy|title=An Exploratory Study of the Introduction of Online Reverse Auctions|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=67|issue=3|pages=96\u2013107|doi=10.1509/jmkg.67.3.96.18651|citeseerx=10.1.1.196.9582}}</ref> Reverse auctions bring buyers and sellers together in a transparent marketplace. The practice has even been implemented for private jet travel on the online auction site [[Marmalade Skies]].\nIP\nThe term reverse auction is often confused with [[unique bid auction]]s, which are more akin to traditional auctions as there is only one seller and multiple buyers.

Both of these companies used ascending bid. The Web offered new advantages such as the use of automated bids via electronic forms, a search engine to be able to quickly find items, and the ability to allow users to view items by categories. In contrast to Onsale where the company itself was acting as the seller, eBay was the first online auction site to support person-to-person transactions. This led to eBay becoming the first online auction to draw a mass volume of [[online transactions]], and it had the largest [[e-commerce]] userbase of any site into the 2000s.<ref name=\"Bunnell\"/>\n\nOnline auctions have greatly increased the variety of goods and services that can be bought and sold using auction mechanisms along with expanding the possibilities for the ways auctions can be conducted and in general created new uses for auctions. In the current web environment there are hundreds, if not thousands, of websites dedicated to online auction practices.\n\nHowever, online auctions on websites weren't the first type of online auctions. In fact, before them, online auctions took place through email and bulletin boards. The auctioneer/seller would post a notice on a system bulletin board, describing the item for sale and setting a minimum bid and closing time.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecommercebytes.com/cab/abu/y206/m08/abu0173/s04|title=The Very First Online Auctions|last=Banks|first=Michael|date=August 20, 2006|website=Ecommerce bytes|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-14}}</ref> CompuServe was sponsoring such auctions through its classified ad system in 1980. But individuals ran their own online auctions as early as 1979 on both CompuServe and The Source, which were in beta the first part of that year.

English auctions are claimed to be the most common form of third-party on-line auction format used and is deemed to appear the most simplistic of all the forms.<ref name='managing_online_auctions'>{{Cite journal | last1 = Pinker | first1 = E.

The winner is the highest bidder and the price is the highest bid.<ref name='managing_online_auctions' /> The popularity of the English auction is due to the fact that it uses a mechanism that people find familiar and intuitive and therefore reduces transaction costs. It also transcends the boundaries of a traditional English auction where physical presence is required by the bidders, making it increasingly popular even though there is a susceptibility to various forms of cheating.<ref name='managing_online_auctions' /> In the ascending-price auction, it is a \u2018dominant strategy\u2019 to stay in the auction until the price reaches the bidder's value.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Ockenfels|first=Axel|last2=Reiley|first2=David|last3=Sadrieh|first3=Abdolkarim|date=December 2006|title=Online Auctions|url=http://www.nber.org/papers/w12785}}</ref>\n\n===Dutch auctions===\n[[Dutch auction]]s are the reverse of English auctions whereby the price begins high and is systematically lowered until a buyer accepts the price. Dutch auction services are usually misleading and the term 'Dutch' tends to have become common usage for the use of a [[multiunit auction]] in a single unit auction as opposed to how it is originally intended for that of a declining price auction. However, with actual on-line Dutch auctions where the price is descending, it was found that auctions have on average a 30% higher ending price than first-price auctions with speculation pointing to bidder impatience or the effect of endogenous entry on the Dutch auction.\n\n===First-price sealed-bid===\n[[First-price sealed-bid auction|First-price sealed-bid]] auctions are when a single bid is made by all bidding parties and the single highest bidder wins, and pays what they bid. The main difference between this and [[#English auctions|English auctions]] is that bids are not openly viewable or announced as opposed to the competitive nature which is generated by public bids. From the [[game theory|game-theoretic]] point of view, the first-price sealed-bid auction is strategically equivalent to the [[Dutch auction]]; that is, in both auctions the players will be using the same bidding strategies.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Milgrom|first1=P.|last2=Weber|first2=R.|year=1982|title=A theory of auctions and competitive bidding|journal=Econometrica|volume=50|issue=5|pages=1089&ndash;1122|jstor=1911865|doi=10.2307/1911865|url=http://www.kellogg.northwestern.edu/research/math/papers/447.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===Vickrey auction===\nA [[Vickrey auction]], sometimes known as a ''second-price sealed-bid auction'', uses very much the same principle as a first-price sealed bid. However, the highest bidder and winner will only pay what the second highest bidder had bid.   \nThe Vickrey auction is suggested to prevent the incentive for buyers to bid strategically, due to the fact it requires them to speak the truth by giving their true value of the item. If a bidder makes a very high bid, they may have to pay that price, but if they make a low bid there is a chance that they will lose the item. Therefore, the winner is the person who values the item the highest. It's a win-win situation for both the seller and the winner.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Amit|first1=Alon|title=What Is a Vickrey Auction, and How Does It Work?|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/quora/2013/09/09/vickrey_auction_what_is_it_and_why_does_the_winner_pay_the_second_highest.html|website=Slate|accessdate=27 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Reverse auction===\n[[Reverse auction]]s are where the roles of buyer and seller are reversed. Multiple sellers compete to obtain the buyer's business and prices typically decrease over time as new offers are made. They do not follow the typical auction format in that the buyer can see all the offers and may choose which they would prefer. Reverse auctions are used predominantly in a business context for [[procurement]].<ref>{{cite journal|jstor= 30040539|date=3 July 2003|author=Jap, Sandy|title=An Exploratory Study of the Introduction of Online Reverse Auctions|journal=Journal of Marketing|volume=67|issue=3|pages=96\u2013107|doi=10.1509/jmkg.67.3.96.18651|citeseerx=10.1.1.196.9582}}</ref> Reverse auctions bring buyers and sellers together in a transparent marketplace. The practice has even been implemented for private jet travel on the online auction site [[Marmalade Skies]].\nIP\nThe term reverse auction is often confused with [[unique bid auction]]s, which are more akin to traditional auctions as there is only one seller and multiple buyers. However, they follow a similar price reduction concept except the lowest unique bid always wins, and each bid is confidential.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prl.aps.org/abstract/PRL/v108/i8/e088701|title=Equilibrium strategy and population-size effects in lowest unique bid auctions|author1=Simone Pigolotti |author2=Sebastian Bernhardsson |author3=Jeppe Juul |author4=Gorm Galster |author5=Pierpaolo Vivo |year=2012|accessdate=2012-10-25}}</ref>\n\n===Bidding fee auction===\nA [[bidding fee auction]] (also known as a penny auction) requires customers to pay for bids, which they can increment an auction price one unit of currency at a time.

If there is someone suspicious like that, it is most probably a shill using the account to increase the price.\n\nA shield can be spotted similarly to a shill. By doing a search of a person's all won auctions it can be found out whether there is another account participating in exactly the same auctions without ever winning anything, or not. If there is, it is possible that the person is using a shield to help him be successful in auctions.\n\n===Fraud===\nThe increasing popularity of using online auctions has led to an increase in fraudulent activity.<ref name=\"Auction Fraud\"/> This is usually performed on an auction website by creating a very appetizing auction, such as a low starting amount. Once a buyer wins an auction and pays for it, the fraudulent seller will either not pursue with the delivery,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.onlineauctionreviews.org/penny-auction-scams/|title=Auction Scams|publisher=OnlineAuctionReviews.org}}</ref> or send a less valuable version of the purchased item (replicated, used, refurbished, etc.).

Jay Keyser]] titled \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations,\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Kenneth|first2=S.

Jay|editor-last2=Keyser|pp=53-109|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|ISBN=978-0-262-58124-0}}</ref> which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.\n\n==Nanosyntactic Operations==\nNanosyntax is a theory that seeks to fill in holes left by other theories when they seek to explain phenomena in language. The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation.<ref name=\":1\"/> For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cinque |first1=Guglielmo |last2=Rizzi |first2=Luigi |title=The cartography of syntactic structures |journal=Oxford Handbook of linguistic analysis |date=2010}}</ref>. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Halle |last2=Marantz |first2=Alec |title=Distributed morphology and the pieces of inflection. Hale, K. & SJ Keyser (eds.), The View from Building 20. |journal=Morphology: Critical Concepts in Linguistics |date=1993 |pages=111-176}}</ref>. In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on two principles: phrasal lexicalisation and the Elsewhere principle.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>. When this principle is applied, we can say that in regular plural nouns, there is no special lexicalisation (denoted in the below example using X) that needs to apply, and so standard pluralisation rules apply. The following is an example using \"duck\" where because there is no additional lexicalisation of the plural noun, an -s is added to pluralise the noun:\n\nX \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK] [ Pl ]]\u2003\nduck \u2194 [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK](8)\u2003s \u2194 Pl\n\nThis principle also allows for a word like \"geese\" to lexicalise [goose[Pl<sup>0</sup>]. When an additional lexicalisation is present, instead of following the standard addition of -s to pluralise the noun, instead the lexicalisation rule takes over in the following manner: \n\ngeese \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> GOOSE] [ Pl ]].\n\n====Elsewhere Principle====\nThe Elsewhere Principle seeks to provide a solution to the question of which lexicalisation applies to the noun in question. In simple terms, the lexicalisation that is more specific will always take precedence over a more general lexicalisation.\n\nAs illustrated, syntactic structure S seeks either lexicalisation from  A \u2194 [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]] or B \u2194 [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]], B will win out over A because B lexicalises in a more specific situation whereas A lexicalises more generally. This solves the problem that distributive morphology faces when determining optimal pluralisation for irregular nouns.\n\n====Observable Consequences====\nCaha proposed that there is a hierarchy in case as follows from broadest to narrowest: Dative, Genetive, Accusative, Nominative<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Caha |first1=Pavel |title=The nanosyntax of case (Ph. D. thesis) |journal=University of Troms\u00f8 |date=2009}}</ref>. Caha also suggested that each of these cases could be broken down into its most basic structures, each of which is a syntactic terminal, as follows:\n\nDative = [<sub>WP</sub> W [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]]\nGenitive = [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]\nAccusative = [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]\nNominative = [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]\n\nThis is further outlined in the Morphological Containment/Nesting portion of this Wikipedia article. \n\nAs each is formed with sets within, it is possible for portions of the tense to be lexicalised by a separate noun. Therefore, there are several possibilities in syncretism patterns, namely AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, AABC, ABBC and ABCC. Some arrangements do not appear as possibilities because of the constraints laid on by the Elsewhere Principle. Notably, once there has been a switch to a separate lexicalisation, the lexicalisations from prior cannot return. In other words, there are no occurrences where once A turns to B or B to C, A or B reappears respectively. The Elsewhere Principle says that narrower lexicalisations win over broader lexicalisations, and once a narrower lexicalisation has been selected for, the broader lexicalisation will not reappear.\n\n==Nanosyntax in Relation to Other Linguistic Aspects==\n\n== Tools of Nanosyntax ==\nNanosyntax uses a handful of tools in order to map out fine-grained elements of the language being analyzed. Beyond Spellout Principles, there are three main tools for this system, who's uses are outlined as such, based of the writings of Baunaz, Haegeman, De Clercq, and Lander in ''Exploring Nanosyntax'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-21|editor-last=Baunaz|editor-first=Lena|editor2-last=Haegeman|editor2-first=Liliane|editor3-last=De Clercq|editor3-first=Karen|editor4-last=Lander|editor4-first=Eric|title=Exploring Nanosyntax|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001}}</ref>\n\n====[[Semantics]]====\nThe universal structure of compositionality is used in order for mapping structure within sentences semantically. This deals with mapping which features words are composed of such as which structures a given word is semantically \"constructed on\". Semantic considerations impact the parameters of structural seize of a sentence, based on semantic categories of things such as verbs.

Oxford: Oxford University Press.</ref>\n\nThe beginnings of nanosyntax can be traced to a 1993 article by [[Kenneth L. Hale|Kenneth Hale]] and [[Samuel Jay Keyser|S. Jay Keyser]] titled \"On Argument Structure and the Lexical Representation of Syntactic Relations,\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Hale|first1=Kenneth|first2=S.

Jay|editor-last2=Keyser|pp=53-109|location=Cambridge, MA|publisher=MIT Press|ISBN=978-0-262-58124-0}}</ref> which first introduced the concept of l-syntax.\n\n==Nanosyntactic Operations==\nNanosyntax is a theory that seeks to fill in holes left by other theories when they seek to explain phenomena in language. The most notable phenomena that nanosyntax tackles is that of irregular conjugation.<ref name=\":1\"/> For example, \"[[goose]]\" is irregular in that its plural form is not \"gooses\", but rather, \"geese\". This poses a problem to simple syntax, as without additional rules and allowances, \"geese\" should be found to be a suboptimal candidate for the plural of \"goose\" in comparison to \"gooses\".\n\n====Possible Solutions====\n\nThere are three manners by which syntacticians may attempt to resolve this. The first is a word-based treatment. In the above examples, \u201cduck\u201d, \u201cducks\u201d, \u201cgoose\u201d, and \u201cgeese\u201d are all counted as separate heads under the category of [[nouns]]<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Cinque |first1=Guglielmo |last2=Rizzi |first2=Luigi |title=The cartography of syntactic structures |journal=Oxford Handbook of linguistic analysis |date=2010}}</ref>. Whether a word denotes a singular or plural is then marked in the lexical entry, and there does not exist a Number head with which [[affixes]] can be included to modify the root word. This theory requires significant work on the part of the speaker to retrieve the correct word. It is also considered lacking in the face of [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] concepts such as that displayed by the [[Wug test]] wherein children are able to correctly conjugate a previously unheard nonsense noun from its singular to its plural.\n\n[[Distributed morphology]] attempts to tackle the question through the process of fusion. Fusion is the process in which a noun head and its numeral head may fuse together under certain parameters to derive an irregular plural<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Morris |first1=Halle |last2=Marantz |first2=Alec |title=Distributed morphology and the pieces of inflection. Hale, K. & SJ Keyser (eds.), The View from Building 20. |journal=Morphology: Critical Concepts in Linguistics |date=1993 |pages=111-176}}</ref>. In the above example, the plural of \u201cduck\u201d would simply select its plural allomorph \u201cducks\u201d, and the plural of \u201cgoose\u201d would select its plural allomorph \u201cgeese\u201d, created through the fusion of \u201cgoose\u201d and \u201c-s\u201d. In this way, distributed morphology is head-based. However, this theory still does not provide a reason as to why \"geese\" is preferable and a more optimal candidate for a plurality of geese over \"gooses\".\n\nNanosyntax goes about this dilemma by suggesting that rather than each word being a head, it is instead a phrase and can therefore be made into a subtree. Within the tree, heads can be assigned to override other heads in specific contexts. For example, if there is a head that says \"-s\" is added to a noun to turn it from a singular noun to a plural noun, but a head overrides it in the case of an irregularly conjugated plural noun such as \"goose\", it will select for the operation of the superseding head. Since it uses a formula and not rote memorisation of lexical items, it bypasses the challenges brought forth by a word-based treatment, and due to the arrangement of heads and their precedence, also provides a solution to the optimality concerns of distributed morphology.\n\nNanosyntax functions based on two principles: phrasal lexicalisation and the Elsewhere principle.\n\n====Phrasal Lexicalisation====\n\nPhrasal lexicalisation is the concept that proposes that only lexical items can constitute terminal nodes<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Michal |title=Nanosyntax: A short primer to a new approach to language |journal=Nordlyd |date=2010 |volume=36 |issue=1 |pages=1-6}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Starke |first1=Mical |title=Towards elegant parameters: Language variation reduces to the size of lexically stored trees. |journal=Ms. Troms\u00f8 University. |date=2011}}</ref>. When this principle is applied, we can say that in regular plural nouns, there is no special lexicalisation (denoted in the below example using X) that needs to apply, and so standard pluralisation rules apply. The following is an example using \"duck\" where because there is no additional lexicalisation of the plural noun, an -s is added to pluralise the noun:\n\nX \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK] [ Pl ]]\u2003\nduck \u2194 [<sub>NP</sub> DUCK](8)\u2003s \u2194 Pl\n\nThis principle also allows for a word like \"geese\" to lexicalise [goose[Pl<sup>0</sup>]. When an additional lexicalisation is present, instead of following the standard addition of -s to pluralise the noun, instead the lexicalisation rule takes over in the following manner: \n\ngeese \u2194 [<sub>PlP</sub> [<sub>NP</sub> GOOSE] [ Pl ]].\n\n====Elsewhere Principle====\nThe Elsewhere Principle seeks to provide a solution to the question of which lexicalisation applies to the noun in question. In simple terms, the lexicalisation that is more specific will always take precedence over a more general lexicalisation.\n\nAs illustrated, syntactic structure S seeks either lexicalisation from  A \u2194 [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]] or B \u2194 [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]], B will win out over A because B lexicalises in a more specific situation whereas A lexicalises more generally. This solves the problem that distributive morphology faces when determining optimal pluralisation for irregular nouns.\n\n====Observable Consequences====\nCaha proposed that there is a hierarchy in case as follows from broadest to narrowest: Dative, Genetive, Accusative, Nominative<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Caha |first1=Pavel |title=The nanosyntax of case (Ph. D. thesis) |journal=University of Troms\u00f8 |date=2009}}</ref>. Caha also suggested that each of these cases could be broken down into its most basic structures, each of which is a syntactic terminal, as follows:\n\nDative = [<sub>WP</sub> W [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]]\nGenitive = [<sub>XP</sub> X [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]]\nAccusative = [<sub>YP</sub> Y [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]]\nNominative = [<sub>ZP</sub> Z ]\n\nThis is further outlined in the Morphological Containment/Nesting portion of this Wikipedia article. \n\nAs each is formed with sets within, it is possible for portions of the tense to be lexicalised by a separate noun. Therefore, there are several possibilities in syncretism patterns, namely AAAA, AAAB, AABB, ABBB, AABC, ABBC and ABCC. Some arrangements do not appear as possibilities because of the constraints laid on by the Elsewhere Principle. Notably, once there has been a switch to a separate lexicalisation, the lexicalisations from prior cannot return. In other words, there are no occurrences where once A turns to B or B to C, A or B reappears respectively. The Elsewhere Principle says that narrower lexicalisations win over broader lexicalisations, and once a narrower lexicalisation has been selected for, the broader lexicalisation will not reappear.\n\n==Nanosyntax in Relation to Other Linguistic Aspects==\n\n== Tools of Nanosyntax ==\nNanosyntax uses a handful of tools in order to map out fine-grained elements of the language being analyzed. Beyond Spellout Principles, there are three main tools for this system, who's uses are outlined as such, based of the writings of Baunaz, Haegeman, De Clercq, and Lander in ''Exploring Nanosyntax'' <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|date=2018-06-21|editor-last=Baunaz|editor-first=Lena|editor2-last=Haegeman|editor2-first=Liliane|editor3-last=De Clercq|editor3-first=Karen|editor4-last=Lander|editor4-first=Eric|title=Exploring Nanosyntax|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190876746.001.0001}}</ref>\n\n====[[Semantics]]====\nThe universal structure of compositionality is used in order for mapping structure within sentences semantically. This deals with mapping which features words are composed of such as which structures a given word is semantically \"constructed on\".

The living conditions are difficult, having to deal with the cold, the hunger and the thirst. Physical endurance as well as the capacity to live with strangers are essential to survive this adventure.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/01/20/espectaculos/c-00811.htm Adrenalin in the south of Argentina], ''Clar\u00edn'', 20 February 2008.</ref>\n\n== Program characteristics ==\nIts contestants are divided in two groups that compete between them with different events apart from the climate, hunger, thirst and so on. The physical condition and the capability to live with strangers are also very important in order to win this competition.\nThis program is based on other previous ones like Basetxea and Conquistadores del fin del mundo.\nIn its first shot in 2005, twelve out of its sixteen contestants where from the Basque Country and the other four from Argentina, but with basque roots. The goal is to bring the ikurri\u00f1a (Basque flag), to the Les \u00c9claireus lighthouse in the Bah\u00eda de Ushuaia. \nEarly in the year 2008, it was shot exclusively for Argentinian spectators. In 2014, the scene was the Iguazu waterfall's rainforest.

(ETB).<ref>[http://www.eitb.com/es/television/programas/el-conquistador/detalle/1893734/estreno-el-conquistador-2014--el-conquistador-fin-mundo-10/ 'El Conquistador del Fin del Mundo 10' starts with double broadcast], ''EiTB'', 10 January 2014.</ref>\n\nIts contestants are divided into teams that fight not only against the roughness of the land and the climate but also against the different events which they encounter. The living conditions are difficult, having to deal with the cold, the hunger and the thirst. Physical endurance as well as the capacity to live with strangers are essential to survive this adventure.<ref>[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2008/01/20/espectaculos/c-00811.htm Adrenalin in the south of Argentina], ''Clar\u00edn'', 20 February 2008.</ref>\n\n== Program characteristics ==\nIts contestants are divided in two groups that compete between them with different events apart from the climate, hunger, thirst and so on. The physical condition and the capability to live with strangers are also very important in order to win this competition.\nThis program is based on other previous ones like Basetxea and Conqusitadores del fin del mundo.\nIn its first shot in 2005, twelve out of its sixteen contestants where from the Basque Country and the other four from Argentina, but with basque roots. The goal is to bring the ikurri\u00f1a (Basque flag), to the Les \u00c9claireus lighthouse in the Bah\u00eda de Ushuaia. \nEarly in the year 2008, it was shot exclusively for Argentinian spectators. In 2014, the scene was the Iguazu waterfall's rainforest. In 2016 it took part in the Amazonas rainforest.\n\n==Repercussion==\n\nIt was awarded as the Best Entertainment Autonomic Program of 2008 by the Academy of Spanish Television.\nIt is usually considered one of the most extreme shows on television because of the combination of extreme events, survival and cohabitation, and also because of the format of the reality, that changes every year surprising the contestants and the audience. For all of that, each edition gathers more followers, not only in the Basque Country, but also in other provinces, achieving assessments 25% higher than the average of the channel.\n\n== Controversies ==\nSome groups pro animal rights reported that the program encourages animal mistreatment in some of its events by killing chickens, frogs, worms and fish or even for feeding an animal until it threw up. The Aranzadi Science Society has also reported that an inoffensive protected species of snake was killed, as well as some other animals under the same circumstances.\n\n== List of Winners ==\n{{Main

This is consistent with the widely reported refusal of Julian Robertson, manager of the Tiger Fund, to buy into the internet bubble.\"<ref name=\"investopedia_2015\">{{citation |author=Loth, Richard |url=http://www.investopedia.com/university/greatest/julianrobertson.asp |title=The Greatest Investors: Julian Robertson |work=[[Investopedia]] |accessdate=2015-11-19 }}</ref>\n\nTiger's largest equity holding at that time was [[U.S. Airways]], whose troubles dragged down the value of his holdings. Such missteps ultimately led him to close his investment company in March 2000 and return all outside capital to investors. Tiger earlier made $2 billion in gains but then gave most of them back during a huge one-day move in the yen in 1998. In September 2001, Robertson distributed 24.8 million greatly devalued U.S. Airways shares to former Tiger investors. Robertson declared his intent to hold onto his own stock in the airline.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/23/business/investing-diary-left-holding-the-bag-on-us-airways-stock.html \"Investing Diary; Left Holding the Bag On US Airways Stock\"], by Laurence Zuckerman, September 23, 2001</ref>\n\n==After Tiger==\n[[File:Flickr - RalphJB - Kauri Cliffs Lodge (6).jpg|thumb|Kauri Cliffs Lodge near [[Matauri Bay]]]]\nAfter closing his fund in 2000, Robertson kept his hand in the hedge fund business by supporting and financing upcoming hedge fund managers (38 in total as of September 2009), in return for a stake in their fund  management companies.

He is  best known for temporarily replacing [[Ringo Starr]] in [[the Beatles]] for a series of concerts during the height of [[Beatlemania]] in 1964, elevating him from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and then back again in the space of a fortnight.<ref>He used the spelling \"Jimmie Nicol\" on his own bass drum. See the {{cite web|url=http://www.pmouse.nl/nicol |title=Jimmie Nicol page from pmouse.nl |accessdate=2006-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111091533/http://www.pmouse.nl/nicol |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}</ref> Nicol had hoped that his association with the Beatles would greatly enhance his career but instead found that the spotlight moved away from him once Starr returned to the group, and in 1965 his subsequent lack of commercial success culminated in bankruptcy. In 1967, after having worked with a number of different bands which included a successful relationship with [[the Spotnicks]], he left the music business to pursue a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. Over the decades, Nicol increasingly shied away from media attention, preferring not to discuss his connection to the Beatles nor seeking financial gain from it. He has a son, Howard, who is a [[BAFTA]] award-winning sound engineer.\n\n==Early career==\nJimmie Nicol's career break came in 1957 when he was talent spotted by [[Larry Parnes]] whilst drumming with various bands in London's [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]], a time that saw Britain's [[skiffle]]-dominated music scene giving way to [[rock and roll]] which  was being popularised by its [[Teddy Boy]] youth. Parnes invited Nicol to join [[Colin Hicks & The Cabin Boys]] whom Parnes co-managed with John Kennedy (Colin Hicks is the younger brother of English entertainer [[Tommy Steele]], whom Parnes also managed). After taking a temporary break from the group to be a member of the original [[pit band]] in the [[Lionel Bart]] musical ''[[Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] Nicol rejoined Hicks's band for their appearance in the 1958 Italian film documentary ''Europa Di Notte'', breaking them in Italy and subsequently allowing them to tour there extensively.{{sfn|Norman|2009|pp=180}} During the early sixties, Nicol went on to play for a number of artists, including [[Vince Eager]], [[Oscar Rabin]], and [[Cyril Stapleton]] and was kept in regular work through Charlie Katz, a well-known session fixer during that period. Nicol has cited drummer [[Phil Seamen]] and saxophonist [[Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley]] as being his main influences.{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}\n\nIn 1964 Nicol helped to form The Shubdubs with former [[The Merseybeats|Merseybeats]] bassist Bob Garner, a jazz line-up similar in musical style to [[Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames]], a group with whom Nicol had sat-in with when they were the resident house band at London's now defunct [[Flamingo Jazz Club]]. Other members of The Shubdubs were [[Tony Allen (vocalist)|Tony Allen]] (vocals), [[Johnny Harris (musician)|Johnny Harris]] (trumpet), Quincy Davis (tenor saxophone), and [[Roger Coulam]] (organ \u2013 went on to form [[Blue Mink]]). It was at this point that he received a telephone call from [[the Beatles]]' producer, [[George Martin]]. Nicol recalled: \"I was having a bit of a lie down after lunch when the phone rang.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}}\n\n==With the Beatles==\nWhen [[Ringo Starr]] collapsed with [[tonsillitis]] and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, the eve of the Beatles' 1964 [[Australasia]]n tour, the band's manager [[Brian Epstein]] and their producer [[George Martin]] urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour. Martin suggested Jimmie Nicol as he had recently used him on a recording session with [[Tommy Quickly]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Nicol had also drummed on a 'Top Six' budget label album as part of an uncredited session band, as well as an [[extended play]] single (with three tracks on each side) of Beatles [[cover versions]] (marketed as 'Teenagers Choice' and titled ''Beatlemania'') which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements. Producer Bill Wellings and Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris (freelancing as an arranger and composer) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British [[Hit Parade]] aimed at cash-strapped teenagers. Harris said: \"The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead. I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record 'sound a-likes'; the first EP (extended play) released got to number 30 in the charts. Jimmie was on drums and, as you can imagine, we covered a lot of the Beatles' songs.\"{{sfn|Darren Stuart 2012}} Although [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] quickly accepted the idea of using an understudy, [[George Harrison]] threatened to pull out of the tour telling Epstein and Martin: \"If Ringo's not going, then neither am I. You can find two replacements.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=101}} Martin recalled: \"They nearly didn't do the Australia tour. George is a very loyal person. It took all of Brian's and my persuasion to tell George that if he didn't do it he was letting everybody down.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} [[Tony Barrow]], who was the Beatles' press officer at the time, later commented: \"Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Ringo stated that \"it was very strange, them going off without me. They'd taken Jimmie Nicol and I thought they didn't love me any more \u2013 all that stuff went through my head.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} The arrangements were made very quickly, from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition/rehearsal at [[Abbey Road Studios]],{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=45}} to packing his bags, all in the same day.{{sfn|Norman|1993|pp=231}} At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why [[Pete Best]], who had been the Beatles' previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom, was not being given the opportunity of replacing Ringo, to which Lennon replied: \"He's got his own group [Pete Best & the All Stars], and it might have looked as if we were taking him back, which is not good for him.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=103}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles (with Jimmy Nicol) 1964 001.png|thumb|left|McCartney, Harrison, Lennon, and Nicol in the [[Netherlands]] on 5 June 1964]]\nNicol's first concert with the Beatles took place just 27 hours later on 4 June at the KB Hallen in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. He was given the distinctive Beatle [[moptop]] hairstyle, put on Ringo's suit and went on stage to an audience of 4,500 Beatles fans. McCartney recalled: \"He was sitting up on this rostrum just eyeing up all the women. We'd start '[[She Loves You]]': [counting in] 'one, two', nothing, 'one, two', and still nothing!\" Their set was reduced from eleven songs to ten, dropping Ringo's vocal spot of \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\".{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} McCartney teasingly sent Starr a telegram saying: \"Hurry up and get well Ringo, Jimmy is wearing out all your suits.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Commenting later on the fickle nature of his brief celebrity, Nicol reflected: \"The day before I was a Beatle, girls weren't interested in me at all. The day after, with the suit and the Beatle cut, riding in the back of the limo with John and Paul, they were dying to get a touch of me. It was very strange and quite scary.\" He was also able to shed some light on how they passed the time between shows: \"I thought I could drink and lay women with the best of them until I caught up with these guys.\"{{sfn|Q|2010|pp=56}}\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], Nicol and Lennon allegedly spent a whole night at a brothel.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Lennon said: \"It was some kind of scene on the road. [[Satyricon]]! There's photographs of me grovelling about, crawling about Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses, and people saying 'Good morning John'. The police escorted me to these places because they never wanted a big scandal. When we hit town, we hit it \u2013 we were not pissing about. We had [the women]. They were great. We didn't call them groupies, then; I've forgotten what we called them, something like 'slags'.\"{{sfn|Q|2010|pp=56}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} By then the Beatles were becoming more restricted by their increasing fame and spending most of their free time inside hotel suites. But Nicol discovered that, aside from acting as a Beatle, he could behave much as any tourist could: \"I often went out alone. Hardly anybody recognised me and I was able to wander around. In Hong Kong, I went to see the thousands of people who live on little boats in the harbour. I saw the refugees in [[Kowloon]], and I visited a nightclub. I like to see life. A Beatle could never really do that.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=110}}\n\nNicol played a total of eight shows until Starr rejoined the group in Melbourne, Australia, on 14 June. He was unable to say goodbye to the Beatles as they were still asleep when he left, and he did not want to disturb them. At Melbourne Airport, Epstein presented him with a cheque for \u00a3500 and a gold [[Eterna|Eterna-matic]] wrist watch inscribed: \"From the Beatles and Brian Epstein to Jimmy \u2013 with appreciation and gratitude.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} George Martin later paid tribute to Nicol whilst recognising the problems he experienced in trying to readjust to a normal life again: \"Jimmie Nicol was a very good drummer who came along and learnt Ringo's parts very well. He did the job excellently, and faded into obscurity immediately afterwards.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} Paul McCartney acknowledged: \"It wasn't an easy thing for Jimmy to stand in for Ringo, and have all that fame thrust upon him. And the minute his tenure was over, he wasn't famous any more.\" Nicol himself expressed his disillusionment several years later: \"Standing in for Ringo was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Until then I was quite happy earning \u00a330 or \u00a340 a week. After the headlines died, I began dying too.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} He resisted the temptation to sell his story, stating in a rare 1987 interview: \"After the money ran low, I thought of cashing-in in some way or other. But the timing wasn't right. And I didn't want to step on the Beatles' toes. They had been damn good for me and to me.\"\n\n==Later career and life==\nNicol reformed the Shubdubs, renaming themselves Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs. They released two singles \"Husky\"/\"Don't Come Back\", followed by \"Humpty Dumpty\"/\"Night Train\"; neither of which was a commercial success. He was later called upon to again stand in for an ailing drummer when Dave Clark of [[The Dave Clark Five]] fell ill and Nicol's band, Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs, filled in for The Dave Clark Five in [[Blackpool, Lancashire]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Whilst there Nicol was reminded of just how popular, albeit briefly, he had been as a stand-in Beatle; receiving a bundle of 5,000 fan letters passed on to him from an Australian radio disc jockey. Nicol sent a message back thanking the fans, promising that he would one day return to Australia permanently.{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} He was later reunited with the Beatles when his band appeared on the same bill as them and [[The Fourmost]] on 12 July 1964 at the [[Brighton Hippodrome|Hippodrome]] in [[Brighton]]. In 1965 Nicol declared bankruptcy with debts of \u00a34,066, nine months after being a temporary Beatle.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Later that year he joined the successful Swedish group [[the Spotnicks]], recording with them and twice touring the world. He left them in 1967, spending time in Mexico studying [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] rhythms, whilst also diversifying into business. In 1975 he returned to England and became involved with housing renovations. In 1988 it was rumoured that Nicol had died,{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}, the year after making his final interview and four years after his 1984 appearance at a Beatles convention in [[Amsterdam]], but an article in 2005 by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed that he was still alive and living in London, refusing to do any interviews or talk about his tenure with the Beatles. It was later asserted by the same source that he had moved to [[Mexico]] in 2013 with his then-wife and was still living there as of 2017, despite family and friends having no contact with him.<ref>Daily Mail, 2017</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring Nicol's brief time with the Beatles both Lennon and McCartney would often ask him how he felt he was coping, to which his reply would usually be \"It's getting better\". Three years later McCartney was walking his dog, Martha, with [[Hunter Davies]], the Beatles official biographer, when the sun came out. McCartney remarked that the weather was \"getting better\" and began to laugh, remembering Nicol. This event inspired the song \"[[Getting Better]]\" on 1967's ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Miles|1998|pp=313}} McCartney again makes reference to Nicol on the ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' tapes from 1969, saying: \"I think you'll find we're not going abroad 'cause Ringo just said he doesn't want to go abroad.

He is  best known for temporarily replacing [[Ringo Starr]] in [[the Beatles]] for a series of concerts during the height of [[Beatlemania]] in 1964, elevating him from relative obscurity to worldwide fame and then back again in the space of a fortnight.<ref>He used the spelling \"Jimmie Nicol\" on his own bass drum. See the {{cite web|url=http://www.pmouse.nl/nicol |title=Jimmie Nicol page from pmouse.nl |accessdate=2006-12-30 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120111091533/http://www.pmouse.nl/nicol |archivedate=11 January 2012 }}</ref> Nicol had hoped that his association with the Beatles would greatly enhance his career but instead found that the spotlight moved away from him once Starr returned to the group, and in 1965 his subsequent lack of commercial success culminated in bankruptcy. In 1967, after having worked with a number of different bands which included a successful relationship with [[the Spotnicks]], he left the music business to pursue a variety of entrepreneurial ventures. Over the decades, Nicol increasingly shied away from media attention, preferring not to discuss his connection to the Beatles nor seeking financial gain from it. He has a son, Howard, who is a [[BAFTA]] award-winning sound engineer.\n\n==Early career==\nJimmie Nicol's career break came in 1957 when he was talent spotted by [[Larry Parnes]] whilst drumming with various bands in London's [[The 2i's Coffee Bar]], a time that saw Britain's [[skiffle]]-dominated music scene giving way to [[rock and roll]] which  was being popularised by its [[Teddy Boy]] youth. Parnes invited Nicol to join [[Colin Hicks & The Cabin Boys]] whom Parnes co-managed with John Kennedy (Colin Hicks is the younger brother of English entertainer [[Tommy Steele]], whom Parnes also managed). After taking a temporary break from the group to be a member of the original [[pit band]] in the [[Lionel Bart]] musical ''[[Fings Ain't Wot They Used T'Be]]'' at the [[Theatre Royal Stratford East]] Nicol rejoined Hicks's band for their appearance in the 1958 Italian film documentary ''Europa Di Notte'', breaking them in Italy and subsequently allowing them to tour there extensively.{{sfn|Norman|2009|pp=180}} During the early sixties, Nicol went on to play for a number of artists, including [[Vince Eager]], [[Oscar Rabin]], and [[Cyril Stapleton]] and was kept in regular work through Charlie Katz, a well-known session fixer during that period. Nicol has cited drummer [[Phil Seamen]] and saxophonist [[Julian \"Cannonball\" Adderley]] as being his main influences.{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}\n\nIn 1964 Nicol helped to form The Shubdubs with former [[The Merseybeats|Merseybeats]] bassist Bob Garner, a jazz line-up similar in musical style to [[Georgie Fame and the Blue Flames]], a group with whom Nicol had sat-in with when they were the resident house band at London's now defunct [[Flamingo Jazz Club]]. Other members of The Shubdubs were [[Tony Allen (vocalist)|Tony Allen]] (vocals), [[Johnny Harris (musician)|Johnny Harris]] (trumpet), Quincy Davis (tenor saxophone), and [[Roger Coulam]] (organ \u2013 went on to form [[Blue Mink]]). It was at this point that he received a telephone call from [[the Beatles]]' producer, [[George Martin]]. Nicol recalled: \"I was having a bit of a lie down after lunch when the phone rang.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}}\n\n==With the Beatles==\nWhen [[Ringo Starr]] collapsed with [[tonsillitis]] and was hospitalised on 3 June 1964, the eve of the Beatles' 1964 [[Australasia]]n tour, the band's manager [[Brian Epstein]] and their producer [[George Martin]] urgently discussed the feasibility of using a stand-in drummer rather than cancelling part of the tour. Martin suggested Jimmie Nicol as he had recently used him on a recording session with [[Tommy Quickly]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Nicol had also drummed on a 'Top Six' budget label album as part of an uncredited session band, as well as an [[extended play]] single (with three tracks on each side) of Beatles [[cover versions]] (marketed as 'Teenagers Choice' and titled ''Beatlemania'') which meant that he already knew the songs and their arrangements. Producer Bill Wellings and Shubdubs trumpeter Johnny Harris (freelancing as an arranger and composer) were responsible for putting together alternative budget cover versions of songs taken from the British [[Hit Parade]] aimed at cash-strapped teenagers. Harris said: \"The idea was for me to try and guess which six songs would be topping the charts about a month ahead. I would do the arrangements and then go into the studio and record 'sound a-likes'; the first EP (extended play) released got to number 30 in the charts. Jimmie was on drums and, as you can imagine, we covered a lot of the Beatles' songs.\"{{sfn|Darren Stuart 2012}} Although [[John Lennon]] and [[Paul McCartney]] quickly accepted the idea of using an understudy, [[George Harrison]] threatened to pull out of the tour telling Epstein and Martin: \"If Ringo's not going, then neither am I. You can find two replacements.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=101}} Martin recalled: \"They nearly didn't do the Australia tour. George is a very loyal person. It took all of Brian's and my persuasion to tell George that if he didn't do it he was letting everybody down.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} [[Tony Barrow]], who was the Beatles' press officer at the time, later commented: \"Brian saw it as the lesser of two evils; cancel the tour and upset thousands of fans or continue and upset the Beatles.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Ringo stated that \"it was very strange, them going off without me. They'd taken Jimmie Nicol and I thought they didn't love me any more \u2013 all that stuff went through my head.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} The arrangements were made very quickly, from a telephone call to Nicol at his home in West London inviting him to attend an audition/rehearsal at [[Abbey Road Studios]],{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=45}} to packing his bags, all in the same day.{{sfn|Norman|1993|pp=231}} At a press conference a reporter mischievously asked John Lennon why [[Pete Best]], who had been the Beatles' previous drummer for two years but dismissed by the group on the eve of stardom, was not being given the opportunity of replacing Ringo, to which Lennon replied: \"He's got his own group [Pete Best & the All Stars], and it might have looked as if we were taking him back, which is not good for him.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=103}}\n\n[[File:The Beatles (with Jimmy Nicol) 1964 001.png|thumb|left|McCartney, Harrison, Lennon, and Nicol in the [[Netherlands]] on 5 June 1964]]\nNicol's first concert with the Beatles took place just 27 hours later on 4 June at the KB Hallen in [[Copenhagen, Denmark]]. He was given the distinctive Beatle [[moptop]] hairstyle, put on Ringo's suit and went on stage to an audience of 4,500 Beatles fans. McCartney recalled: \"He was sitting up on this rostrum just eyeing up all the women. We'd start '[[She Loves You]]': [counting in] 'one, two', nothing, 'one, two', and still nothing!\" Their set was reduced from eleven songs to ten, dropping Ringo's vocal spot of \"[[I Wanna Be Your Man]]\".{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} McCartney teasingly sent Starr a telegram saying: \"Hurry up and get well Ringo, Jimmy is wearing out all your suits.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Commenting later on the fickle nature of his brief celebrity, Nicol reflected: \"The day before I was a Beatle, girls weren't interested in me at all. The day after, with the suit and the Beatle cut, riding in the back of the limo with John and Paul, they were dying to get a touch of me. It was very strange and quite scary.\" He was also able to shed some light on how they passed the time between shows: \"I thought I could drink and lay women with the best of them until I caught up with these guys.\"{{sfn|Q|2010|pp=56}}\n\nIn the [[Netherlands]], Nicol and Lennon allegedly spent a whole night at a brothel.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Lennon said: \"It was some kind of scene on the road. [[Satyricon]]! There's photographs of me grovelling about, crawling about Amsterdam on my knees, coming out of whorehouses, and people saying 'Good morning John'. The police escorted me to these places because they never wanted a big scandal. When we hit town, we hit it \u2013 we were not pissing about. We had [the women]. They were great. We didn't call them groupies, then; I've forgotten what we called them, something like 'slags'.\"{{sfn|Q|2010|pp=56}}{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} By then the Beatles were becoming more restricted by their increasing fame and spending most of their free time inside hotel suites. But Nicol discovered that, aside from acting as a Beatle, he could behave much as any tourist could: \"I often went out alone. Hardly anybody recognised me and I was able to wander around. In Hong Kong, I went to see the thousands of people who live on little boats in the harbour. I saw the refugees in [[Kowloon]], and I visited a nightclub. I like to see life. A Beatle could never really do that.\"{{sfn|Badman|2000|pp=110}}\n\nNicol played a total of eight shows until Starr rejoined the group in Melbourne, Australia, on 14 June. He was unable to say goodbye to the Beatles as they were still asleep when he left, and he did not want to disturb them. At Melbourne Airport, Epstein presented him with a cheque for \u00a3500 and a gold [[Eterna|Eterna-matic]] wrist watch inscribed: \"From the Beatles and Brian Epstein to Jimmy \u2013 with appreciation and gratitude.\"{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} George Martin later paid tribute to Nicol whilst recognising the problems he experienced in trying to readjust to a normal life again: \"Jimmie Nicol was a very good drummer who came along and learnt Ringo's parts very well. He did the job excellently, and faded into obscurity immediately afterwards.\"{{sfn|The Beatles|2000|pp=139}} Paul McCartney acknowledged: \"It wasn't an easy thing for Jimmy to stand in for Ringo, and have all that fame thrust upon him. And the minute his tenure was over, he wasn't famous any more.\" Nicol himself expressed his disillusionment several years later: \"Standing in for Ringo was the worst thing that ever happened to me. Until then I was quite happy earning \u00a330 or \u00a340 a week. After the headlines died, I began dying too.\"{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} He resisted the temptation to sell his story, stating in a rare 1987 interview: \"After the money ran low, I thought of cashing-in in some way or other. But the timing wasn't right. And I didn't want to step on the Beatles' toes. They had been damn good for me and to me.\"\n\n==Later career and life==\nNicol reformed the Shubdubs, renaming themselves Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs. They released two singles \"Husky\"/\"Don't Come Back\", followed by \"Humpty Dumpty\"/\"Night Train\"; neither of which was a commercial success. He was later called upon to again stand in for an ailing drummer when Dave Clark of [[The Dave Clark Five]] fell ill and Nicol's band, Jimmy Nicol and the Shubdubs, filled in for The Dave Clark Five in [[Blackpool, Lancashire]].{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} Whilst there Nicol was reminded of just how popular, albeit briefly, he had been as a stand-in Beatle; receiving a bundle of 5,000 fan letters passed on to him from an Australian radio disc jockey. Nicol sent a message back thanking the fans, promising that he would one day return to Australia permanently.{{sfn|Harry|1992|pp=484}} He was later reunited with the Beatles when his band appeared on the same bill as them and [[The Fourmost]] on 12 July 1964 at the [[Brighton Hippodrome|Hippodrome]] in [[Brighton]]. In 1965 Nicol declared bankruptcy with debts of \u00a34,066, nine months after being a temporary Beatle.{{sfn|Mojo|2002|pp=108}} Later that year he joined the successful Swedish group [[the Spotnicks]], recording with them and twice touring the world. He left them in 1967, spending time in Mexico studying [[samba]] and [[bossa nova]] rhythms, whilst also diversifying into business. In 1975 he returned to England and became involved with housing renovations. In 1988 it was rumoured that Nicol had died,{{sfn|pmouse.nl|2010}}, the year after making his final interview and four years after his 1984 appearance at a Beatles convention in [[Amsterdam]], but an article in 2005 by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' claimed that he was still alive and living in London, refusing to do any interviews or talk about his tenure with the Beatles. It was later asserted by the same source that he had moved to [[Mexico]] in 2013 with his then-wife and was still living there as of 2017, despite family and friends having no contact with him.<ref>Daily Mail, 2017</ref>\n\n==Legacy==\nDuring Nicol's brief time with the Beatles both Lennon and McCartney would often ask him how he felt he was coping, to which his reply would usually be \"It's getting better\". Three years later McCartney was walking his dog, Martha, with [[Hunter Davies]], the Beatles official biographer, when the sun came out. McCartney remarked that the weather was \"getting better\" and began to laugh, remembering Nicol. This event inspired the song \"[[Getting Better]]\" on 1967's ''[[Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band]]''.{{sfn|Miles|1998|pp=313}} McCartney again makes reference to Nicol on the ''[[Let It Be (Beatles album)|Let It Be]]'' tapes from 1969, saying: \"I think you'll find we're not going abroad 'cause Ringo just said he doesn't want to go abroad. You know, he put his foot down.

Microcode is used in general-purpose [[central processing unit]]s, although in current desktop CPUs it is only a fallback path for cases that the faster [[hardwired control unit]] cannot handle.<ref name=FogMicro>{{cite web|last1=Fog |first1=Agner |title=The microarchitecture of Intel, AMD and VIA CPUs |publisher=Technical University of Denmark |date=2017-05-02 |url=http://www.agner.org/optimize/microarchitecture.pdf }}</ref>\n\nMicrocode typically resides in special high-speed memory and translates machine instructions, [[state machine]] data or other input into sequences of detailed circuit-level operations. It separates the machine instructions from the underlying [[electronics]] so that instructions can be designed and altered more freely. It also facilitates the building of complex multi-step instructions, while reducing the complexity of computer circuits. Writing microcode is often called '''microprogramming''' and the microcode in a particular processor implementation is sometimes called a '''microprogram'''.\n\nMore extensive microcoding allows small and simple [[microarchitecture]]s to [[Emulator|emulate]] more powerful architectures with wider [[word length]], more [[execution unit]]s and so on, which is a relatively simple way to achieve software compatibility between different products in a processor family.\n\nSome hardware vendors, especially [[IBM]], use the term ''microcode'' as a synonym for ''[[firmware]]''. In that way, all code within a device is termed ''microcode'' regardless of it being microcode or [[machine code]]; for example, [[hard disk drive]]s are said to have their microcode updated, though they typically contain both microcode and firmware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/server/firmware/73lzx.html |title=IBM pSeries Servers - Microcode Update for Ultrastar 73LZX (US73) 18/36 GB| website=ibm.com |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe lowest layer in a computer's software stack is traditionally raw binary [[machine code]] instructions for the processor. Microcode sits one level below this. To avoid confusion, each microprogram-related element is differentiated by the ''micro'' prefix: microinstruction, microassembler, microprogrammer, [[microarchitecture]], etc.\n\nEngineers normally write the microcode during the design phase of a processor, storing it in a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) or [[programmable logic array]] (PLA)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Manning |first1=B.M. |last2=Mitby |first2=J.S |last3=Nicholson |first3=J.O. |title=Microprogrammed Processor Having PLA Control Store |journal=IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin |volume=22 |issue=6 |date=November 1979 |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102660026}}</ref> structure, or in a combination of both.<ref>Often denoted a ROM/PLA control store in the context of usage in a CPU; {{cite web|title=J-11: DEC's fourth and last PDP-11 microprocessor design ... features ... ROM/PLA control store|url=http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/j11.html}}</ref> However, machines also exist that have some or all microcode stored in [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] or [[flash memory]]. This is traditionally denoted as ''writeable [[control store]]'' in the context of computers, which can be either read-only or [[read-write memory]]. In the latter case, the CPU initialization process loads microcode into the control store from another storage medium, with the possibility of altering the microcode to correct bugs in the instruction set, or to implement new machine instructions.\n\nComplex digital processors may also employ more than one (possibly microcode-based) [[control unit]] in order to delegate sub-tasks that must be performed essentially asynchronously in parallel. A high-level programmer, or even an [[Assembly language|assembly]] programmer, does not normally see or change microcode. Unlike machine code, which often retains some [[backward compatibility]] among different processors in a family, microcode only runs on the exact [[electronic circuit]]ry for which it is designed, as it constitutes an inherent part of the particular processor design itself.\n\nMicroprograms consist of series of microinstructions, which control the CPU at a very fundamental level of hardware circuitry. For example, a single typical ''horizontal'' microinstruction might specify the following operations:\n* Connect register 1 to the ''A'' side of the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]\n* Connect register 7 to the ''B'' side of the ALU\n* Set the ALU to perform [[two's-complement]] addition\n* Set the ALU's carry input to zero\n* Store the result value in register 8\n* Update the condition codes from the ALU status flags (''negative'', ''zero'', ''overflow'', and ''carry'')\n* Microjump to micro[[program counter|PC]] nnn for the next microinstruction\n\nTo simultaneously control all processor's features in one cycle, the microinstruction is often wider than 50 bits; e.g., 128 bits on a 360/85 with an emulator feature. Microprograms are carefully designed and optimized for the fastest possible execution, as a slow microprogram would result in a slow machine instruction and degraded performance for related application programs that use such instructions.\n\n==Justification==\nMicrocode was originally developed as a simpler method of developing the control logic for a computer. Initially, CPU [[instruction set]]s were [[hardwired control unit|hardwired]]. Each step needed to fetch, decode, and execute the machine instructions (including any operand address calculations, reads, and writes) was controlled directly by [[combinational logic]] and rather minimal [[sequential circuit|sequential]] state machine circuitry. While such hard-wired processors were very efficient, the need for powerful instruction sets with multi-step addressing and complex operations (''see below'') made them difficult to design and debug; highly encoded and varied-length instructions can contribute to this as well, especially when very irregular encodings are used.\n\nMicrocode simplified the job by allowing much of the processor's behaviour and programming model to be defined via microprogram routines rather than by dedicated circuitry. Even late in the design process, microcode could easily be changed, whereas hard-wired CPU designs were very cumbersome to change. Thus, this greatly facilitated CPU design.\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, a large portion of programming was done in [[assembly language]]; higher-level instructions mean greater programmer productivity, so an important advantage of microcode was the relative ease by which powerful machine instructions can be defined. The ultimate extension of this are \"Directly Executable High Level Language\" designs, in which each statement of a high-level language such as [[PL/I]] is entirely and directly executed by microcode, without compilation. The [[IBM Future Systems project]] and [[Data General]] Fountainhead Processor are examples of this. During the 1970s, CPU speeds grew more quickly than memory speeds and numerous techniques such as [[Direct memory access|memory block transfer]], [[Prefetching|memory pre-fetch]] and [[multi-level cache]]s were used to alleviate this. High-level machine instructions, made possible by microcode, helped further, as fewer more complex machine instructions require less memory bandwidth. For example, an operation on a character string can be done as a single machine instruction, thus avoiding multiple instruction fetches.\n\nArchitectures with instruction sets implemented by complex microprograms included the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX]]. The approach of increasingly complex microcode-implemented instruction sets was later called [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]]. An alternate approach, used in many [[microprocessor]]s, is to use [[Programmable logic array|PLAs]] or [[Read-only memory|ROMs]] (instead of combinational logic) mainly for instruction decoding, and let a simple state machine (without much, or any, microcode) do most of the sequencing. The [[MOS Technology 6502]] is an example of a microprocessor using a PLA for instruction decode and sequencing. The PLA is visible in photomicrographs of the chip,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual6502.org/images/6502/|title=6502 Images|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> and its operation can be seen in the transistor-level simulation.\n\nMicroprogramming is still used in modern CPU designs. In some cases, after the microcode is debugged in simulation, logic functions are substituted for the control store.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Logic functions are often faster and less expensive than the equivalent microprogram memory.\n\n===Benefits===\nA processor's microprograms operate on a more primitive, totally different, and much more hardware-oriented architecture than the assembly instructions visible to normal programmers. In coordination with the hardware, the microcode implements the programmer-visible architecture. The underlying hardware need not have a fixed relationship to the visible architecture. This makes it easier to implement a given instruction set architecture on a wide variety of underlying hardware micro-architectures.\n\nThe IBM System/360 has a 32-bit architecture with 16 general-purpose registers, but most of the System/360 implementations actually use hardware that implemented a much simpler underlying microarchitecture; for example, the [[IBM System/360 Model 30|System/360 Model 30]] has 8-bit data paths to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and main memory and implemented the general-purpose registers in a special unit of higher-speed [[Magnetic-core memory|core memory]], and the [[IBM System/360 Model 40|System/360 Model 40]] has 8-bit data paths to the ALU and 16-bit data paths to main memory and also implemented the general-purpose registers in a special unit of higher-speed core memory. The [[IBM System/360 Model 50|Model 50]] has full 32-bit data paths and implements the general-purpose registers in a special unit of higher-speed core memory.<ref>{{cite book|title=IBM System/360 Model 50 Functional Characteristics|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/funcChar/A22-6898-1_360-50_funcChar_1967.pdf|publisher=[[IBM]]|page=7|year=1967|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref> The Model 65 through the Model 195 have larger data paths and implement the general-purpose registers in faster transistor circuits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In this way, microprogramming enabled IBM to design many System/360 models with substantially different hardware and spanning a wide range of cost and performance, while making them all architecturally compatible. This dramatically reduces the number of unique system software programs that must be written for each model.\n\nA similar approach was used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in their VAX family of computers. As a result, different VAX processors use different microarchitectures, yet the programmer-visible architecture does not change.\n\nMicroprogramming also reduces the cost of field changes to correct defects ([[Computer bug|bugs]]) in the processor; a bug can often be fixed by replacing a portion of the microprogram rather than by changes being made to [[hardware logic]] and wiring.\n\n==History==\nIn 1947, the design of the [[Whirlwind (computer)|MIT Whirlwind]] introduced the concept of a control store as a way to simplify computer design and move beyond ''[[ad hoc]]'' methods. The control store is a [[diode matrix]]: a two-dimensional lattice, where one dimension accepts \"control time pulses\" from the CPU's internal clock, and the other connects to control signals on gates and other circuits. A \"pulse distributor\" takes the pulses generated by the CPU clock and breaks them up into eight separate time pulses, each of which activates a different row of the lattice. When the row is activated, it activates the control signals connected to it.<ref>{{Cite journal | author1=Everett, R.R. | author2=Swain, F.E. | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Whirlwind I Computer Block Diagrams | publisher=MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory | year=1947 | version=Report R-127 | url=http://www.cryptosmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/whirlwindr-127.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=June 21, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617112919/http://www.cryptosmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/whirlwindr-127.pdf | archivedate=June 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDescribed another way, the signals transmitted by the control store are being played much like a [[player piano]] roll. That is, they are controlled by a sequence of very wide words constructed of [[bit]]s, and they are \"played\" sequentially. In a control store, however, the \"song\" is short and repeated continuously.\n\nIn 1951, [[Maurice Wilkes]] enhanced this concept by adding ''conditional execution'', a concept akin to a [[Conditional (programming)|conditional]] in computer software. His initial implementation consisted of a pair of matrices: the first one generated signals in the manner of the Whirlwind control store, while the second matrix selected which row of signals (the microprogram instruction word, so to speak) to invoke on the next cycle. Conditionals were implemented by providing a way that a single line in the control store could choose from alternatives in the second matrix. This made the control signals conditional on the detected internal signal. Wilkes coined the term '''microprogramming''' to describe this feature and distinguish it from a simple control store.\n\n==Examples==\n* The [[EMIDEC 1100]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emidec.org.uk/ |title=EMIDEC 1100 computer |publisher=Emidec.org.uk |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> reputedly uses a hard-wired control store consisting of wires threaded through ferrite cores, known as \"the laces\".\n* Most models of the IBM System/360 series are microprogrammed:\n** The [[IBM System/360 Model 25|Model 25]] is unique among System/360 models in using the top 16&nbsp;K bytes of core storage to hold the control storage for the microprogram. The 2025 uses a 16-bit microarchitecture with seven control words (or microinstructions). After system maintenance or when changing operating mode, the microcode is loaded from the card reader, tape, or other device.<ref>{{cite book |title=IBM System/360 Model 25 Functional Characteristics |date=January 1968 |publisher=IBM |page=22 |url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/funcChar/A24-3510-0_360-25_funcChar_Jan68.pdf}}</ref> The [[IBM 1410]] emulation for this model is loaded this way.\n** The [[IBM 2030|Model 30]] uses an 8-bit microarchitecture with only a few hardware registers; everything that the programmer saw is emulated by the microprogram.

The 2040 box implements both the System/360 main processor and the multiplex channel (the I/O processor). This model uses \"TROS\" dedicated readers similar to \"CROS\" units, but with an inductive pickup (Transformer Read-only Store).\n** The [[IBM System/360 Model 50|Model 50]] has two internal datapaths which operated in parallel: a 32-bit datapath used for arithmetic operations, and an 8-bit data path used in some logical operations. The control store uses 90-bit microinstructions.\n** The [[IBM System/360 Model 85|Model 85]] has separate instruction fetch (I-unit) and execution (E-unit) to provide high performance. The I-unit is hardware controlled. The E-unit is microprogrammed; the control words are 108 bits wide on a basic 360/85 and wider if an emulator feature is installed.\n* The [[NCR 315]] is microprogrammed with hand wired ferrite cores (a [[Read-only memory|ROM]]) pulsed by a sequencer with conditional execution. Wires routed through the cores are enabled for various data and logic elements in the processor.\n* The Digital Equipment Corporation [[PDP-11]] processors, with the exception of the PDP-11/20, are microprogrammed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/computerstructur01siew/page/671|chapter-url=http://gordonbell.azurewebsites.net/computer_structures_principles_and_examples/csp0687.htm|editor1=Daniel P.

The task of writing microcode for the [[Data General Eclipse MV/8000|Eclipse MV/8000]] is detailed in the Pulitzer Prize-winning book titled ''[[The Soul of a New Machine]]''.\n* Many systems from [[Burroughs Corporation|Burroughs]] are microprogrammed:\n:* The B700 \"microprocessor\" execute application-level opcodes using sequences of 16-bit microinstructions stored in main memory; each of these is either a register-load operation or mapped to a single 56-bit \"nanocode\" instruction stored in read-only memory. This allows comparatively simple hardware to act either as a mainframe peripheral controller or to be packaged as a standalone computer.\n:* The [[B1700]] is implemented with radically different hardware including bit-addressable main memory but has a similar multi-layer organisation. The operating system preloads the interpreter for whatever language is required. These interpreters present different virtual machines for [[COBOL]], [[Fortran]], etc.\n* [[Microdata Corporation|Microdata]] produced computers in which the microcode is accessible to the user; this allows the creation of custom assembler level instructions.

The advantage over a hard-wired CPU is that internal CPU control becomes a specialized form of a computer program. Microcode thus transforms a complex electronic design challenge (the control of a CPU) into a less complex programming challenge. To take advantage of this, a CPU is divided into several parts:\n* A [[microsequencer]] picks the next word of the control store. A sequencer is mostly a counter, but usually also has some way to jump to a different part of the control store depending on some data, usually data from the [[instruction register]] and always some part of the control store. The simplest sequencer is just a register loaded from a few bits of the control store.\n* A [[processor register|register]] set is a fast memory containing the data of the central processing unit. It may include the program counter, stack pointer, and other numbers that are not easily accessible to the application programmer. Often the register set is a triple-ported [[register file]]; that is, two registers can be read, and a third written at the same time.\n* An [[arithmetic and logic unit]] performs calculations, usually addition, logical negation, a right shift, and logical AND. It often performs other functions, as well.\n\nThere may also be a [[memory address register]] and a [[memory data register]], used to access the main [[computer storage]]. Together, these elements form an \"[[execution unit]]\". Most modern [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] have several execution units. Even simple computers usually have one unit to read and write memory, and another to execute user code. These elements could often be brought together as a single chip. This chip comes in a fixed width that would form a \"slice\" through the execution unit. These are known as \"[[bit slicing|bit slice]]\" chips. The [[AMD Am2900]] family is one of the best known examples of bit slice elements. The parts of the execution units and the execution units themselves are interconnected by a bundle of wires called a [[Computer bus|bus]].\n\nProgrammers develop microprograms, using basic software tools. A [[microassembler]] allows a programmer to define the table of bits symbolically. Because of its close relationship to the underlying architecture, \"microcode has several properties that make it difficult to generate using a compiler.\"<ref name=Kent2813 /> A [[simulator]] program is intended to execute the bits in the same way as the electronics, and allows much more freedom to debug the microprogram. After the microprogram is finalized, and extensively tested, it is sometimes used as the input to a computer program that constructs logic to produce the same data.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This program is similar to those used to optimize a [[programmable logic device|programmable logic array]]. Even without fully optimal logic, heuristically optimized logic can vastly reduce the number of transistors from the number required for a ROM control store. This reduces the cost of producing, and the electricity consumed by, a CPU.\n\nMicrocode can be characterized as ''horizontal'' or ''vertical'', referring primarily to whether each microinstruction controls CPU elements with little or no decoding (horizontal microcode){{efn|IBM horizontally microcoded processors had multiple micro-orders and register select fields that required decoding}} or requires extensive decoding by [[combinatorial logic]] before doing so (vertical microcode). Consequently, each horizontal microinstruction is wider (contains more bits) and occupies more storage space than a vertical microinstruction.\n\n===Horizontal microcode===\n\"Horizontal microcode has several discrete micro-operations that are combined in a single microinstruction for simultaneous operation.\"<ref name=Kent2813 /> Horizontal microcode is typically contained in a fairly wide control store; it is not uncommon for each word to be 108 bits or more. On each tick of a sequencer clock a microcode word is read, decoded, and used to control the functional elements that make up the CPU.\n\nIn a typical implementation a horizontal microprogram word comprises fairly tightly defined groups of bits. For example, one simple arrangement might be:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Register source A || Register source B || Destination register || [[Arithmetic and logic unit]] operation || Type of jump || Jump address\n|}\n\nFor this type of micromachine to implement a JUMP instruction with the address following the opcode, the microcode might require two clock ticks. The engineer designing it would write microassembler source code looking something like this:\n   # Any line starting with a number-sign is a comment\n   # This is just a label, the ordinary way assemblers symbolically represent a \n   # memory address.\n InstructionJUMP:\n       # To prepare for the next instruction, the instruction-decode microcode has already\n       # moved the program counter to the memory address register. This instruction fetches\n       # the target address of the jump instruction from the memory word following the\n       # jump opcode, by copying from the memory data register to the memory address register.\n       # This gives the memory system two clock ticks to fetch the next \n       # instruction to the memory data register for use by the instruction decode.\n       # The sequencer instruction \"next\" means just add 1 to the control word address.\n    MDR, NONE, MAR, COPY, NEXT, NONE\n       # This places the address of the next instruction into the PC.\n       # This gives the memory system a clock tick to finish the fetch started on the\n       # previous microinstruction.\n       # The sequencer instruction is to jump to the start of the instruction decode.\n    MAR, 1, PC, ADD, JMP, InstructionDecode\n       # The instruction decode is not shown, because it is usually a mess, very particular\n       # to the exact processor being emulated. Even this example is simplified.\n       # Many CPUs have several ways to calculate the address, rather than just fetching\n       # it from the word following the op-code. Therefore, rather than just one\n       # jump instruction, those CPUs have a family of related jump instructions.\n\nFor each tick it is common to find that only some portions of the CPU are used, with the remaining groups of bits in the microinstruction being no-ops. With careful design of hardware and microcode, this property can be exploited to parallelise operations that use different areas of the CPU; for example, in the case above, the ALU is not required during the first tick, so it could potentially be used to complete an earlier arithmetic instruction.\n\n===Vertical microcode===\nIn vertical microcode, each microinstruction is significantly encoded{{snd}} that is, the bit fields generally pass through intermediate combinatory logic that, in turn, generates the actual control and sequencing signals for internal CPU elements (ALU, registers, etc.). This is in contrast with horizontal microcode, in which the bit fields themselves either directly produce the control and sequencing signals or are only minimally encoded. Consequently, vertical microcode requires smaller instruction lengths and less storage, but requires more time to decode, resulting in a slower CPU clock.<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html\n | title      = CS-323: High Performance Microprocessors \u2013 Chapter 1.

At that point the [[RISC]] design philosophy started becoming more prominent.\n\nA CPU that uses microcode generally takes several clock cycles to execute a single instruction, one clock cycle for each step in the microprogram for that instruction. Some [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors include instructions that can take a very long time to execute. Such variations interfere with both [[interrupt latency]] and, what is far more important in modern systems, [[pipelining]].\n\nWhen designing a new processor, a [[hardwired control]] RISC has the following advantages over microcoded CISC:\n* Programming has largely moved away from assembly level, so it's no longer worthwhile to provide complex instructions for productivity reasons.\n* Simpler instruction sets allow direct execution by hardware, avoiding the performance penalty of microcoded execution.\n* Analysis shows complex instructions are rarely used, hence the machine resources devoted to them are largely wasted.\n* The machine resources devoted to rarely used complex instructions are better used for expediting performance of simpler, commonly used instructions.\n* Complex microcoded instructions may require many clock cycles that vary, and are difficult to [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] for increased performance.\n\nThere are counterpoints as well:\n* The complex instructions in heavily microcoded implementations may not take much extra machine resources, except for microcode space. For instance, the same ALU is often used to calculate an effective address as well as computing the result from the actual operands (e.g., the original [[Z80]], [[8086]], and others).\n* The simpler non-RISC instructions (i.e., involving direct memory [[operand]]s) are frequently used by modern compilers. Even immediate to stack (i.e., memory result) arithmetic operations are commonly employed. Although such memory operations, often with varying length encodings, are more difficult to pipeline, it is still fully feasible to do so - clearly exemplified by the [[i486]], [[AMD K5]], [[Cyrix 6x86]], [[Motorola 68040]], etc.\n* Non-RISC instructions inherently perform more work per instruction (on average), and are also normally highly encoded, so they enable smaller overall size of the same program, and thus better use of limited cache memories.\n\nMany RISC and [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] processors are designed to execute every instruction (as long as it is in the cache) in a single cycle. This is very similar to the way CPUs with microcode execute one microinstruction per cycle. VLIW processors have instructions that behave similarly to very wide horizontal microcode, although typically without such fine-grained control over the hardware as provided by microcode. RISC instructions are sometimes similar to the narrow vertical microcode.\n\nMicrocoding has been popular in application-specific processors such as [[network processors]], [[microcontroller]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[Channel I/O|channel controllers]], [[disk controller]]s, [[network interface controller]]s, [[graphics processing unit]]s, and in other hardware.\n\n==Micro Ops==\nModern CISC implementations, such as the [[x86]] family, decode instructions into dynamically buffered [[micro-operation]]s (\"\u03bcops\") with an instruction encoding similar to RISC or traditional microcode. A hardwired instruction decode unit directly emits \u03bcops for common x86 instructions, but falls back to a more traditional microcode ROM for more complex or rarely used instructions.<ref name=FogMicro/>\n\nFor example, an x86 might look up \u03bcops from microcode to handle complex multistep operations such as loop or string instructions, [[floating point unit]] [[transcendental function]]s or unusual values such as [[denormal number]]s, and special purpose instructions such as [[CPUID]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Address generation unit]] (AGU)\n* [[CPU design]]\n* [[Finite-state machine]] (FSM)\n* [[Firmware]]\n* [[Floating-point unit]] (FPU)\n* [[Instruction pipeline]]\n* [[Microsequencer]]\n* [[MikroSim]]\n* [[Millicode]]\n* [[Superscalar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = Smith, Richard E.\n | title      = A Historical Overview of Computer Architecture\n | journal    = [[Annals of the History of Computing]]\n | year       = 1988\n | volume     = 10\n | issue      = 4\n | pages      = 277&ndash;303\n | url        = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1988.10039\n | accessdate = June 21, 2006\n | doi        = 10.1109/MAHC.1988.10039}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = Smotherman, Mark\n | title      = A Brief History of Microprogramming\n | year       = 2005\n | url        = http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/uprog.html\n | accessdate = July 30, 2006}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = [[Maurice Wilkes|Wilkes, M.V.]]\n | title      = The Genesis of Microprogramming\n | journal    = Annals of the History of Computing\n | year       = 1986\n | volume     = 8\n | issue      = 2\n | pages      = 116&ndash;126\n | url        = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1986.10035\n | accessdate = August 7, 2006\n | doi        = 10.1109/MAHC.1986.10035}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = [[Maurice Wilkes|Wilkes, M.V.]], and [[John Bentley Stringer|Stringer, J.

It separates the machine instructions from the underlying [[electronics]] so that instructions can be designed and altered more freely. It also facilitates the building of complex multi-step instructions, while reducing the complexity of computer circuits. Writing microcode is often called '''microprogramming''' and the microcode in a particular processor implementation is sometimes called a '''microprogram'''.\n\nMore extensive microcoding allows small and simple [[microarchitecture]]s to [[Emulator|emulate]] more powerful architectures with wider [[word length]], more [[execution unit]]s and so on, which is a relatively simple way to achieve software compatibility between different products in a processor family.\n\nSome hardware vendors, especially [[IBM]], use the term ''microcode'' as a synonym for ''[[firmware]]''. In that way, all code within a device is termed ''microcode'' regardless of it being microcode or [[machine code]]; for example, [[hard disk drive]]s are said to have their microcode updated, though they typically contain both microcode and firmware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://download.boulder.ibm.com/ibmdl/pub/software/server/firmware/73lzx.html |title=IBM pSeries Servers - Microcode Update for Ultrastar 73LZX (US73) 18/36 GB| website=ibm.com |accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nThe lowest layer in a computer's software stack is traditionally raw binary [[machine code]] instructions for the processor. Microcode sits one level below this. To avoid confusion, each microprogram-related element is differentiated by the ''micro'' prefix: microinstruction, microassembler, microprogrammer, [[microarchitecture]], etc.\n\nEngineers normally write the microcode during the design phase of a processor, storing it in a [[read-only memory]] (ROM) or [[programmable logic array]] (PLA)<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Manning |first1=B.M. |last2=Mitby |first2=J.S |last3=Nicholson |first3=J.O. |title=Microprogrammed Processor Having PLA Control Store |journal=IBM Technical Disclosure Bulletin |volume=22 |issue=6 |date=November 1979 |url=http://www.computerhistory.org/collections/accession/102660026}}</ref> structure, or in a combination of both.<ref>Often denoted a ROM/PLA control store in the context of usage in a CPU; {{cite web|title=J-11: DEC's fourth and last PDP-11 microprocessor design ... features ... ROM/PLA control store|url=http://simh.trailing-edge.com/semi/j11.html}}</ref> However, machines also exist that have some or all microcode stored in [[Static random access memory|SRAM]] or [[flash memory]]. This is traditionally denoted as ''writeable [[control store]]'' in the context of computers, which can be either read-only or [[read-write memory]]. In the latter case, the CPU initialization process loads microcode into the control store from another storage medium, with the possibility of altering the microcode to correct bugs in the instruction set, or to implement new machine instructions.\n\nComplex digital processors may also employ more than one (possibly microcode-based) [[control unit]] in order to delegate sub-tasks that must be performed essentially asynchronously in parallel. A high-level programmer, or even an [[Assembly language|assembly]] programmer, does not normally see or change microcode. Unlike machine code, which often retains some [[backward compatibility]] among different processors in a family, microcode only runs on the exact [[electronic circuit]]ry for which it is designed, as it constitutes an inherent part of the particular processor design itself.\n\nMicroprograms consist of series of microinstructions, which control the CPU at a very fundamental level of hardware circuitry. For example, a single typical ''horizontal'' microinstruction might specify the following operations:\n* Connect register 1 to the ''A'' side of the [[Arithmetic logic unit|ALU]]\n* Connect register 7 to the ''B'' side of the ALU\n* Set the ALU to perform [[two's-complement]] addition\n* Set the ALU's carry input to zero\n* Store the result value in register 8\n* Update the condition codes from the ALU status flags (''negative'', ''zero'', ''overflow'', and ''carry'')\n* Microjump to micro[[program counter|PC]] nnn for the next microinstruction\n\nTo simultaneously control all processor's features in one cycle, the microinstruction is often wider than 50 bits; e.g., 128 bits on a 360/85 with an emulator feature. Microprograms are carefully designed and optimized for the fastest possible execution, as a slow microprogram would result in a slow machine instruction and degraded performance for related application programs that use such instructions.\n\n==Justification==\nMicrocode was originally developed as a simpler method of developing the control logic for a computer. Initially, CPU [[instruction set]]s were [[hardwired control unit|hardwired]]. Each step needed to fetch, decode, and execute the machine instructions (including any operand address calculations, reads, and writes) was controlled directly by [[combinational logic]] and rather minimal [[sequential circuit|sequential]] state machine circuitry. While such hard-wired processors were very efficient, the need for powerful instruction sets with multi-step addressing and complex operations (''see below'') made them difficult to design and debug; highly encoded and varied-length instructions can contribute to this as well, especially when very irregular encodings are used.\n\nMicrocode simplified the job by allowing much of the processor's behaviour and programming model to be defined via microprogram routines rather than by dedicated circuitry. Even late in the design process, microcode could easily be changed, whereas hard-wired CPU designs were very cumbersome to change. Thus, this greatly facilitated CPU design.\n\nFrom the 1940s to the late 1970s, a large portion of programming was done in [[assembly language]]; higher-level instructions mean greater programmer productivity, so an important advantage of microcode was the relative ease by which powerful machine instructions can be defined. The ultimate extension of this are \"Directly Executable High Level Language\" designs, in which each statement of a high-level language such as [[PL/I]] is entirely and directly executed by microcode, without compilation. The [[IBM Future Systems project]] and [[Data General]] Fountainhead Processor are examples of this. During the 1970s, CPU speeds grew more quickly than memory speeds and numerous techniques such as [[Direct memory access|memory block transfer]], [[Prefetching|memory pre-fetch]] and [[multi-level cache]]s were used to alleviate this. High-level machine instructions, made possible by microcode, helped further, as fewer more complex machine instructions require less memory bandwidth. For example, an operation on a character string can be done as a single machine instruction, thus avoiding multiple instruction fetches.\n\nArchitectures with instruction sets implemented by complex microprograms included the [[IBM]] [[System/360]] and [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] [[VAX]]. The approach of increasingly complex microcode-implemented instruction sets was later called [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]]. An alternate approach, used in many [[microprocessor]]s, is to use [[Programmable logic array|PLAs]] or [[Read-only memory|ROMs]] (instead of combinational logic) mainly for instruction decoding, and let a simple state machine (without much, or any, microcode) do most of the sequencing. The [[MOS Technology 6502]] is an example of a microprocessor using a PLA for instruction decode and sequencing. The PLA is visible in photomicrographs of the chip,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visual6502.org/images/6502/|title=6502 Images|publisher=|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> and its operation can be seen in the transistor-level simulation.\n\nMicroprogramming is still used in modern CPU designs. In some cases, after the microcode is debugged in simulation, logic functions are substituted for the control store.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Logic functions are often faster and less expensive than the equivalent microprogram memory.\n\n===Benefits===\nA processor's microprograms operate on a more primitive, totally different, and much more hardware-oriented architecture than the assembly instructions visible to normal programmers. In coordination with the hardware, the microcode implements the programmer-visible architecture. The underlying hardware need not have a fixed relationship to the visible architecture. This makes it easier to implement a given instruction set architecture on a wide variety of underlying hardware micro-architectures.\n\nThe IBM System/360 has a 32-bit architecture with 16 general-purpose registers, but most of the System/360 implementations actually use hardware that implemented a much simpler underlying microarchitecture; for example, the [[IBM System/360 Model 30|System/360 Model 30]] has 8-bit data paths to the arithmetic logic unit (ALU) and main memory and implemented the general-purpose registers in a special unit of higher-speed [[Magnetic-core memory|core memory]], and the [[IBM System/360 Model 40|System/360 Model 40]] has 8-bit data paths to the ALU and 16-bit data paths to main memory and also implemented the general-purpose registers in a special unit of higher-speed core memory. The [[IBM System/360 Model 50|Model 50]] has full 32-bit data paths and implements the general-purpose registers in a special unit of higher-speed core memory.<ref>{{cite book|title=IBM System/360 Model 50 Functional Characteristics|url=http://bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/funcChar/A22-6898-1_360-50_funcChar_1967.pdf|publisher=[[IBM]]|page=7|year=1967|accessdate=September 20, 2011}}</ref> The Model 65 through the Model 195 have larger data paths and implement the general-purpose registers in faster transistor circuits.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} In this way, microprogramming enabled IBM to design many System/360 models with substantially different hardware and spanning a wide range of cost and performance, while making them all architecturally compatible. This dramatically reduces the number of unique system software programs that must be written for each model.\n\nA similar approach was used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) in their VAX family of computers. As a result, different VAX processors use different microarchitectures, yet the programmer-visible architecture does not change.\n\nMicroprogramming also reduces the cost of field changes to correct defects ([[Computer bug|bugs]]) in the processor; a bug can often be fixed by replacing a portion of the microprogram rather than by changes being made to [[hardware logic]] and wiring.\n\n==History==\nIn 1947, the design of the [[Whirlwind (computer)|MIT Whirlwind]] introduced the concept of a control store as a way to simplify computer design and move beyond ''[[ad hoc]]'' methods. The control store is a [[diode matrix]]: a two-dimensional lattice, where one dimension accepts \"control time pulses\" from the CPU's internal clock, and the other connects to control signals on gates and other circuits. A \"pulse distributor\" takes the pulses generated by the CPU clock and breaks them up into eight separate time pulses, each of which activates a different row of the lattice. When the row is activated, it activates the control signals connected to it.<ref>{{Cite journal | author1=Everett, R.R. | author2=Swain, F.E. | lastauthoramp=yes | title=Whirlwind I Computer Block Diagrams | publisher=MIT Servomechanisms Laboratory | year=1947 | version=Report R-127 | url=http://www.cryptosmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/whirlwindr-127.pdf | format=PDF | accessdate=June 21, 2006 | url-status=dead | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120617112919/http://www.cryptosmith.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/05/whirlwindr-127.pdf | archivedate=June 17, 2012 }}</ref>\n\nDescribed another way, the signals transmitted by the control store are being played much like a [[player piano]] roll. That is, they are controlled by a sequence of very wide words constructed of [[bit]]s, and they are \"played\" sequentially. In a control store, however, the \"song\" is short and repeated continuously.\n\nIn 1951, [[Maurice Wilkes]] enhanced this concept by adding ''conditional execution'', a concept akin to a [[Conditional (programming)|conditional]] in computer software. His initial implementation consisted of a pair of matrices: the first one generated signals in the manner of the Whirlwind control store, while the second matrix selected which row of signals (the microprogram instruction word, so to speak) to invoke on the next cycle. Conditionals were implemented by providing a way that a single line in the control store could choose from alternatives in the second matrix. This made the control signals conditional on the detected internal signal. Wilkes coined the term '''microprogramming''' to describe this feature and distinguish it from a simple control store.\n\n==Examples==\n* The [[EMIDEC 1100]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emidec.org.uk/ |title=EMIDEC 1100 computer |publisher=Emidec.org.uk |accessdate=April 26, 2010}}</ref> reputedly uses a hard-wired control store consisting of wires threaded through ferrite cores, known as \"the laces\".\n* Most models of the IBM System/360 series are microprogrammed:\n** The [[IBM System/360 Model 25|Model 25]] is unique among System/360 models in using the top 16&nbsp;K bytes of core storage to hold the control storage for the microprogram.

The operating system preloads the interpreter for whatever language is required. These interpreters present different virtual machines for [[COBOL]], [[Fortran]], etc.\n* [[Microdata Corporation|Microdata]] produced computers in which the microcode is accessible to the user; this allows the creation of custom assembler level instructions.

The advantage over a hard-wired CPU is that internal CPU control becomes a specialized form of a computer program. Microcode thus transforms a complex electronic design challenge (the control of a CPU) into a less complex programming challenge. To take advantage of this, a CPU is divided into several parts:\n* A [[microsequencer]] picks the next word of the control store. A sequencer is mostly a counter, but usually also has some way to jump to a different part of the control store depending on some data, usually data from the [[instruction register]] and always some part of the control store. The simplest sequencer is just a register loaded from a few bits of the control store.\n* A [[processor register|register]] set is a fast memory containing the data of the central processing unit. It may include the program counter, stack pointer, and other numbers that are not easily accessible to the application programmer. Often the register set is a triple-ported [[register file]]; that is, two registers can be read, and a third written at the same time.\n* An [[arithmetic and logic unit]] performs calculations, usually addition, logical negation, a right shift, and logical AND. It often performs other functions, as well.\n\nThere may also be a [[memory address register]] and a [[memory data register]], used to access the main [[computer storage]]. Together, these elements form an \"[[execution unit]]\". Most modern [[Central processing unit|CPUs]] have several execution units. Even simple computers usually have one unit to read and write memory, and another to execute user code. These elements could often be brought together as a single chip. This chip comes in a fixed width that would form a \"slice\" through the execution unit. These are known as \"[[bit slicing|bit slice]]\" chips. The [[AMD Am2900]] family is one of the best known examples of bit slice elements. The parts of the execution units and the execution units themselves are interconnected by a bundle of wires called a [[Computer bus|bus]].\n\nProgrammers develop microprograms, using basic software tools. A [[microassembler]] allows a programmer to define the table of bits symbolically. Because of its close relationship to the underlying architecture, \"microcode has several properties that make it difficult to generate using a compiler.\"<ref name=Kent2813 /> A [[simulator]] program is intended to execute the bits in the same way as the electronics, and allows much more freedom to debug the microprogram. After the microprogram is finalized, and extensively tested, it is sometimes used as the input to a computer program that constructs logic to produce the same data.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This program is similar to those used to optimize a [[programmable logic device|programmable logic array]]. Even without fully optimal logic, heuristically optimized logic can vastly reduce the number of transistors from the number required for a ROM control store. This reduces the cost of producing, and the electricity consumed by, a CPU.\n\nMicrocode can be characterized as ''horizontal'' or ''vertical'', referring primarily to whether each microinstruction controls CPU elements with little or no decoding (horizontal microcode){{efn|IBM horizontally microcoded processors had multiple micro-orders and register select fields that required decoding}} or requires extensive decoding by [[combinatorial logic]] before doing so (vertical microcode). Consequently, each horizontal microinstruction is wider (contains more bits) and occupies more storage space than a vertical microinstruction.\n\n===Horizontal microcode===\n\"Horizontal microcode has several discrete micro-operations that are combined in a single microinstruction for simultaneous operation.\"<ref name=Kent2813 /> Horizontal microcode is typically contained in a fairly wide control store; it is not uncommon for each word to be 108 bits or more. On each tick of a sequencer clock a microcode word is read, decoded, and used to control the functional elements that make up the CPU.\n\nIn a typical implementation a horizontal microprogram word comprises fairly tightly defined groups of bits. For example, one simple arrangement might be:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Register source A || Register source B || Destination register || [[Arithmetic and logic unit]] operation || Type of jump || Jump address\n|}\n\nFor this type of micromachine to implement a JUMP instruction with the address following the opcode, the microcode might require two clock ticks. The engineer designing it would write microassembler source code looking something like this:\n   # Any line starting with a number-sign is a comment\n   # This is just a label, the ordinary way assemblers symbolically represent a \n   # memory address.\n InstructionJUMP:\n       # To prepare for the next instruction, the instruction-decode microcode has already\n       # moved the program counter to the memory address register. This instruction fetches\n       # the target address of the jump instruction from the memory word following the\n       # jump opcode, by copying from the memory data register to the memory address register.\n       # This gives the memory system two clock ticks to fetch the next \n       # instruction to the memory data register for use by the instruction decode.\n       # The sequencer instruction \"next\" means just add 1 to the control word address.\n    MDR, NONE, MAR, COPY, NEXT, NONE\n       # This places the address of the next instruction into the PC.\n       # This gives the memory system a clock tick to finish the fetch started on the\n       # previous microinstruction.\n       # The sequencer instruction is to jump to the start of the instruction decode.\n    MAR, 1, PC, ADD, JMP, InstructionDecode\n       # The instruction decode is not shown, because it is usually a mess, very particular\n       # to the exact processor being emulated. Even this example is simplified.\n       # Many CPUs have several ways to calculate the address, rather than just fetching\n       # it from the word following the op-code. Therefore, rather than just one\n       # jump instruction, those CPUs have a family of related jump instructions.\n\nFor each tick it is common to find that only some portions of the CPU are used, with the remaining groups of bits in the microinstruction being no-ops. With careful design of hardware and microcode, this property can be exploited to parallelise operations that use different areas of the CPU; for example, in the case above, the ALU is not required during the first tick, so it could potentially be used to complete an earlier arithmetic instruction.\n\n===Vertical microcode===\nIn vertical microcode, each microinstruction is significantly encoded{{snd}} that is, the bit fields generally pass through intermediate combinatory logic that, in turn, generates the actual control and sequencing signals for internal CPU elements (ALU, registers, etc.). This is in contrast with horizontal microcode, in which the bit fields themselves either directly produce the control and sequencing signals or are only minimally encoded. Consequently, vertical microcode requires smaller instruction lengths and less storage, but requires more time to decode, resulting in a slower CPU clock.<ref>{{cite web\n | url        = http://euler.mat.uson.mx/~havillam/ca/CS323/0708.cs-323003.html\n | title      = CS-323: High Performance Microprocessors \u2013 Chapter 1.

At that point the [[RISC]] design philosophy started becoming more prominent.\n\nA CPU that uses microcode generally takes several clock cycles to execute a single instruction, one clock cycle for each step in the microprogram for that instruction. Some [[Complex instruction set computer|CISC]] processors include instructions that can take a very long time to execute. Such variations interfere with both [[interrupt latency]] and, what is far more important in modern systems, [[pipelining]].\n\nWhen designing a new processor, a [[hardwired control]] RISC has the following advantages over microcoded CISC:\n* Programming has largely moved away from assembly level, so it's no longer worthwhile to provide complex instructions for productivity reasons.\n* Simpler instruction sets allow direct execution by hardware, avoiding the performance penalty of microcoded execution.\n* Analysis shows complex instructions are rarely used, hence the machine resources devoted to them are largely wasted.\n* The machine resources devoted to rarely used complex instructions are better used for expediting performance of simpler, commonly used instructions.\n* Complex microcoded instructions may require many clock cycles that vary, and are difficult to [[pipeline (computing)|pipeline]] for increased performance.\n\nThere are counterpoints as well:\n* The complex instructions in heavily microcoded implementations may not take much extra machine resources, except for microcode space. For instance, the same ALU is often used to calculate an effective address as well as computing the result from the actual operands (e.g., the original [[Z80]], [[8086]], and others).\n* The simpler non-RISC instructions (i.e., involving direct memory [[operand]]s) are frequently used by modern compilers. Even immediate to stack (i.e., memory result) arithmetic operations are commonly employed. Although such memory operations, often with varying length encodings, are more difficult to pipeline, it is still fully feasible to do so - clearly exemplified by the [[i486]], [[AMD K5]], [[Cyrix 6x86]], [[Motorola 68040]], etc.\n* Non-RISC instructions inherently perform more work per instruction (on average), and are also normally highly encoded, so they enable smaller overall size of the same program, and thus better use of limited cache memories.\n\nMany RISC and [[Very long instruction word|VLIW]] processors are designed to execute every instruction (as long as it is in the cache) in a single cycle. This is very similar to the way CPUs with microcode execute one microinstruction per cycle. VLIW processors have instructions that behave similarly to very wide horizontal microcode, although typically without such fine-grained control over the hardware as provided by microcode. RISC instructions are sometimes similar to the narrow vertical microcode.\n\nMicrocoding has been popular in application-specific processors such as [[network processors]], [[microcontroller]]s, [[digital signal processor]]s, [[Channel I/O|channel controllers]], [[disk controller]]s, [[network interface controller]]s, [[graphics processing unit]]s, and in other hardware.\n\n==Micro Ops==\nModern CISC implementations, such as the [[x86]] family, decode instructions into dynamically buffered [[micro-operation]]s (\"\u03bcops\") with an instruction encoding similar to RISC or traditional microcode. A hardwired instruction decode unit directly emits \u03bcops for common x86 instructions, but falls back to a more traditional microcode ROM for more complex or rarely used instructions.<ref name=FogMicro/>\n\nFor example, an x86 might look up \u03bcops from microcode to handle complex multistep operations such as loop or string instructions, [[floating point unit]] [[transcendental function]]s or unusual values such as [[denormal number]]s, and special purpose instructions such as [[CPUID]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Electronics}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Address generation unit]] (AGU)\n* [[CPU design]]\n* [[Finite-state machine]] (FSM)\n* [[Firmware]]\n* [[Floating-point unit]] (FPU)\n* [[Instruction pipeline]]\n* [[Microsequencer]]\n* [[MikroSim]]\n* [[Millicode]]\n* [[Superscalar]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = Smith, Richard E.\n | title      = A Historical Overview of Computer Architecture\n | journal    = [[Annals of the History of Computing]]\n | year       = 1988\n | volume     = 10\n | issue      = 4\n | pages      = 277&ndash;303\n | url        = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1988.10039\n | accessdate = June 21, 2006\n | doi        = 10.1109/MAHC.1988.10039}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = Smotherman, Mark\n | title      = A Brief History of Microprogramming\n | year       = 2005\n | url        = http://www.cs.clemson.edu/~mark/uprog.html\n | accessdate = July 30, 2006}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = [[Maurice Wilkes|Wilkes, M.V.]]\n | title      = The Genesis of Microprogramming\n | journal    = Annals of the History of Computing\n | year       = 1986\n | volume     = 8\n | issue      = 2\n | pages      = 116&ndash;126\n | url        = http://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/MAHC.1986.10035\n | accessdate = August 7, 2006\n | doi        = 10.1109/MAHC.1986.10035}}\n* {{cite journal\n | author     = [[Maurice Wilkes|Wilkes, M.V.]], and [[John Bentley Stringer|Stringer, J.
