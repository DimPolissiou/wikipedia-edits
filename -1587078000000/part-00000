The platforms occupy the sidewalks of Southwest Yamhill and Morrison streets between Broadway and 6th Avenue in [[downtown Portland]], and are the 21st and 7th stops eastbound on the [[MAX Blue Line|Blue Line]] and the [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]], respectively. They are situated directly west of the [[Portland Transit Mall]] at [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]]; these stations, along with the [[Pioneer Courthouse/Southwest 6th and Pioneer Place/Southwest 5th stations]] that are served by the [[MAX Green Line|Green]], [[MAX Orange Line|Orange]], and [[MAX Yellow Line|Yellow]] lines, mark the only point in the MAX system where passengers can transfer to any of the five existing lines.\n\nThe Pioneer Square stations are among the 27 original stations built as part of the Banfield light rail project\u2014Portland's first light rail line. They opened along with the inaugural service of MAX on September 5, 1986. The Red Line began serving the stations in September 2001, initially connecting downtown to [[Portland International Airport]]. In 2003, the Red Line extended westward to [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]]. The Yellow Line also served the stations from 2004 to 2009, connecting downtown to the [[Portland Metropolitan Exposition Center|Expo Center]]; TriMet rerouted this line to serve the transit mall in August 2009.\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Pioneer Courthouse Square}}\n\nThe Portland city block presently known as [[Pioneer Courthouse Square]] had previously been occupied by various structures, including a school, a hotel, and a parking garage.

An economist by education, he was head of the [[Sicherheitsdienst#Inland-SD|{{lang|de|Sicherheitsdienst|cat=no}} (SD) Inland]], responsible for intelligence and security within Germany. In 1941, Ohlendorf was appointed the commander of [[Einsatzgruppen|{{lang|de|Einsatzgruppe|cat=no}} D]], which perpetrated mass murder in Moldova, south Ukraine, the Crimea and, during 1942, the North Caucasus. He was tried at the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]], convicted and executed in 1951.\n\n==Life and education==\nBorn in [[S\u00f6hlde|Hoheneggelsen]] (today part of [[S\u00f6hlde]]; then in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]), Otto Ohlendorf came into the world as part of \"a farming family\".{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=228}}  He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1925 (member 6631) and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (member #880) in 1926.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} Ohlendorf studied [[economics]] and [[law]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] and the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], and by 1930 was already giving lectures at several economic institutions. He studied at the [[University of Pavia]], where he gained his doctor's degree in jurisprudence; and by 1933 he obtained the position of a research directorship in the [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy]].{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} Ohlendorf was active in the [[National Socialist Students' League]] in both Kiel and G\u00f6ttingen and taught at the Nazi Party's school in Berlin.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=184}} He participated in major debates between the SS, the [[German Labour Front]], and the Quadrenniel Organization on economic policy.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=36}} By 1938 he was also manager in the Trade section of the Reich Business Board ({{lang|de|{{ill|Reichswirtschaftskammer|de}}}}). Historian {{ill|Christian Ingrao|fr}} quips that for Ohlendorf, Nazism was a \"quest for race\" in the historical continuum, and even though he never stated it that way, his faith in Germandom was akin to that of his fellow SS intellectuals.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==SS career==\nOhlendorf joined the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] in 1936 and became an economic consultant of the organisation. Like other talented academics such as [[Helmut Knochen]] and [[Franz Six]], Ohlendorf had been recruited by SD talent scouts.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=186}} Attached to the SS with the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]'', by 1939, he had obtained the rank of SS-[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]] and was appointed as head of Amt III (SD-Inland) of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA),{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|Rozett|Spector|2009|p=345}} a position he kept until 1945.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=184}} His role in collecting intelligence from his secret police agents was disliked by some of the Nazi leadership. ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] once characterized Ohlendorf as \"an unbearable Prussian\" who was \"without humour\".{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=184}} Nonetheless, Ohlendorf was instrumental as a member of the SD in shaping Nazi economic doctrine, which became \"increasingly virulent as the war progressed\" as he attempted to mould the economy \"in an ethnic context\".{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=110}} It was Ohlendorf's responsibility as head of the SD-Inland to collect data and scientifically examine social, cultural, and economic issues, assembling reports to his superiors in the Nazi government.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=96\u201397}} Routine public opinion surveys\u2014which were under the purview of Ohlendorf and SS-Major Reinhard H\u00f6hn\u2014constituted some of these reports.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=135}} These public opinion polls on the social climate of Nazi Germany were both unpopular and controversial.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=143}}\n\nIn June 1941, [[Reinhard Heydrich]] appointed Ohlendorf to be commander of [[Einsatzgruppen|''Einsatzgruppe'' D]],{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=308}} which operated in southern [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]].{{sfn|Arad|2009|p=128}} Joining the ''Einsatzgruppen'' was an unappealing prospect and Ohlendorf refused twice before his eventual appointment.{{sfn|Koch|1985|p=383}} Transfers from the RHSA to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in part due to personnel shortages but also to keep the initial killing operations confined to those who already knew the details, such as Ohlendorf, [[Arthur Nebe]], and [[Paul Blobel]].{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=28}} ''Einsatzgruppe'' D was the smallest of the task forces, but was supplemented by Romanians along their way through the killing fields of [[Bessarabia]], southern Ukraine, and the Caucasus.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=620}} Additional manpower for ''Einsatzgruppe'' D came from Ukrainian auxiliary police formations.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=387}} Supporting military operations, Ohlendorf's group was attached to the Eleventh Army.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=12}}{{efn|One task which Ohlendorf disdained was providing guards for the harvest at the behest of Army commanders, who wanted to prevent the Romanians from consuming any of the goods.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=624}} }} Ohlendorf's ''Einsatzgruppe'' in particular was responsible for the 13 December 1941 massacre at [[Simferopol]], where at least 14,300 people, mostly Jews, were killed. Over 90,000 murders throughout the Ukraine and the Caucusus are attributed to Ohlendorf's unit.{{sfn|Chapoutot|2018|p=3}}{{efn|Ohlendorf stated that he tried to mitigate any \"unnecessary agitation\" for the victims during the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] at [[Nuremberg]].{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} }}\n\nOhlendorf disliked the use of the oft-employed ''Genickschu\u00df'' (shot to the back of the neck) and preferred to line up victims and fire at them from a greater distance so as to alleviate personal responsibility for individual murders.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=126}} All forms of contact between the firing squads and victims were limited\u2014per Ohlendorf's insistence\u2014until the last moments before the killing started, and up to three rifleman were allocated to each person about to be shot.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=319}} To ensure the group killing mentality, Ohlendorf forbade any commando from taking individual actions and explicitly instructed his men not to take any of the victim's valuables.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=166}} One of Ohlendorf's most trusted \"proper\" military-style murderers, ''SS-Haupsturmf\u00fchrer'' Lothar Heimbach, once exclaimed, \"A man is the lord over life and death when he gets an order to shoot three hundred children\u2014and he kills at least one hundred fifty himself.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=169}}{{efn|Justifying the murder of children, Ohlendorf stated, \"the children were people who would grow up and surely being the children of parents who had been killed, they would constitute a danger no smaller than their parents.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=113}} }}\n\nMany of the killing operations were personally overseen by Ohlendorf, who wanted to ensure they were \"military in character and humane under the circumstances\".{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=127}} Such considerations do not constitute mercy by any means and the number of persons killed under the leadership of ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders such as Ohlendorf are \"staggering\" despite the use of varying murder techniques.{{sfn|Botwinick|2001|pp=184\u2013188}} On 1 August 1941, ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders including Ohlendorf, received instructions from [[Gestapo]] chief [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] to keep headquarters (Hitler especially) informed of their progress in the East; M\u00fcller also encouraged the speedy delivery of photographs showing the results of these operations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=122}} During September 1941, Ohlendorf's group slaughtered 22,467 Jews and Communists at Nikolayev near Odessa.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=172}}\n\nDue to the Wehrmacht's insistence that the Ukraine's agricultural production was needed to sustain its military campaign, Ohlendorf was asked during October 1941 to refrain from killing some of the Jewish farmers\u2014a request he honored\u2014but one which earned him Himmler's contempt.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=182}} This act should not be seen as a change of heart or kindness, as just a month prior in September 1941, Ohlendorf reported to his men that \"from now on the Jewish question is going to be solved and that means liquidation\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=228}} From that month forward, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had begun the process of systematically shooting not just men but women and children, a transition that historian Peter Longerich terms \"a decisive step on the way towards a policy of racial annihilation\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=252}}\n\nBetween February and March 1942, Himmler ordered that gas vans should be used to murder women and children so as to reduce the strain on the men, but Ohlendorf reported that many of the ''Einsatzkommandos'' refused to utilize them since burying the victims proved an \"ordeal\" afterwards.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=243}}{{efn|Historian Martin Gilbert reported that in front of the Nuremberg Tribunal, Ohlendorf described the use of gas vans for killing operations as \"unpleasant\" and that the {{lang|de|Ensatzkommandos}} disliked dealing with the bodies.{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=365}} }} When gas van killing operations were conducted, it was usually at night to keep the population from witnessing the macabre affair.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=115}} After the victims' agonizing deaths, Jewish {{lang|de|Sonderkommando}} were forced to unload the bodies, clean the excrement and feces from inside the van's gas chamber, and once the clean up was complete, were themselves immediately shot.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=116}} As far as Ohlendorf was concerned, the gas vans were impracticable for the scale of killing demanded by Hitler and Himmler; namely, since they could only kill between fifteen and twenty-five persons at a time.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=960\u2013961}}\n\n[[File:Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Ohlendorf on 1 March 1948]]\nHistorian Donald Bloxham referred to Ohlendorf as a bureaucrat, who was trying to \"prove himself in the field\".{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=267}} Another historian, Mark Mazower, described Ohlendorf as a \"gloomy, driven, self-righteous Prussian\".{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=254}} His commitment to the Nazi cause kept him in the Ukraine longer than any of his comrades, and while he may have disliked the political direction Germany was headed, he never registered complaints about murdering Jews.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=254}} He did, however, express misgivings about the barbarity and sadism being meted out by the Romanian units that accompanied the ''Einsatzgruppen'' in their murderous tasks, since they were not only leaving a trail of corpses in their wake, they were also pillaging and raping in the process.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=336}} Not only that, Ohlendorf lodged a complaint about the Romanian forces, who drove thousands of frail elderly persons and children from Bessarabia and Bokovina\u2014all incapable of work\u2014into German-held regions, which his men forced back into Romanian territory but not without killing a significant percentage of them as a result.{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=234}}\n\nOhlendorf devoted only four years (1939\u20131943) of full-time activity to the RSHA, for in 1943, in addition to his other jobs, he became a deputy director general in the Reich Ministry of economic affairs.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=104}} Sometime in November 1944, he was promoted to ''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} Believing their expertise invaluable, Ohlendorf, [[Ludwig Erhard]], and other experts concerned themselves with how to stabilize German currency after the war.{{sfn|Janich|2013|pp=160\u2013161}} Hoping to salvage the reputation of the SD, Ohlendorf offered his services in the hopes that he could shape the postwar reconstruction of Germany, but along \"National Socialist lines\", remaining convinced as was Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] (who gave Ohlendorf the economics portfolio), that some form of Nazism would ultimately survive.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\nIn May 1945, Ohlendorf participated in Himmler's flight from Flensburg and was arrested with him near [[L\u00fcneburg]] along with several other subordinates.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=272}} Himmler committed suicide shortly after being captured.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|pp=244\u2013248}} For several weeks after arrest, Ohlendorf was carefully interrogated, during which he revealed the criminal nature of the German campaign in the East.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=227}}\n\n==Nuremberg trials==\n[[File:Otto Ohlendorf EGR.jpg|thumb|Ohlendorf testifies at the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]], 9 October 1947.]]\nDuring the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]], Ohlendorf was the chief defendant, and was also a key witness in the prosecution of other indicted war criminals. Ohlendorf's apparently reliable testimony was attributed to his distaste for the [[corruption in Nazi Germany]] and a stubborn commitment to duty. The court examined Ohlendorf concerning ''Einsatzgruppen'' operations in particular.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=784}} During the trial, Ohlendorf insisted that he, as a loyal Nazi, had acted properly and had done nothing wrong.{{sfn|Chapoutot|2018|pp=3\u20134}} He expressed no remorse for his actions, telling prosecutor [[Ben Ferencz]] that the [[Jew]]s of America would suffer for what the prosecutor had done, and seemed to have been more concerned about the moral strain on those carrying out the murders than those being murdered.{{sfn|Ferencz (1946\u20131949).

An economist by education, he was head of the [[Sicherheitsdienst#Inland-SD|{{lang|de|Sicherheitsdienst|cat=no}} (SD) Inland]], responsible for intelligence and security within Germany. In 1941, Ohlendorf was appointed the commander of [[Einsatzgruppen|{{lang|de|Einsatzgruppe|cat=no}} D]], which perpetrated mass murder in Moldova, south Ukraine, the Crimea and, during 1942, the North Caucasus. He was tried at the [[Einsatzgruppen Trial]], convicted and executed in 1951.\n\n==Life and education==\nBorn in [[S\u00f6hlde|Hoheneggelsen]] (today part of [[S\u00f6hlde]]; then in the [[Kingdom of Prussia]]), Otto Ohlendorf came into the world as part of \"a farming family\".{{sfn|Stackelberg|2007|p=228}}  He joined the [[Nazi Party]] in 1925 (member 6631) and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] (member #880) in 1926.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} Ohlendorf studied [[economics]] and [[law]] at the [[University of Leipzig]] and the [[University of G\u00f6ttingen]], and by 1930 was already giving lectures at several economic institutions. He studied at the [[University of Pavia]], where he gained his doctor's degree in jurisprudence; and by 1933 he obtained the position of a research directorship in the [[Kiel Institute for the World Economy]].{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} Ohlendorf was active in the [[National Socialist Students' League]] in both Kiel and G\u00f6ttingen and taught at the Nazi Party's school in Berlin.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=184}} He participated in major debates between the SS, the [[German Labour Front]], and the Quadrenniel Organization on economic policy.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=36}} By 1938 he was also manager in the Trade section of the Reich Business Board ({{lang|de|{{ill|Reichswirtschaftskammer|de}}}}). Historian {{ill|Christian Ingrao|fr}} quips that for Ohlendorf, Nazism was a \"quest for race\" in the historical continuum, and even though he never stated it that way, his faith in Germandom was akin to that of his fellow SS intellectuals.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=56\u201357}}\n\n==SS career==\nOhlendorf joined the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] in 1936 and became an economic consultant of the organisation. Like other talented academics such as [[Helmut Knochen]] and [[Franz Six]], Ohlendorf had been recruited by SD talent scouts.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=186}} Attached to the SS with the rank of SS-''[[Hauptsturmf\u00fchrer]]'', by 1939, he had obtained the rank of SS-[[Standartenf\u00fchrer]] and was appointed as head of Amt III (SD-Inland) of the [[Reich Main Security Office]] (RSHA),{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=16}}{{sfn|Rozett|Spector|2009|p=345}} a position he kept until 1945.{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=184}} His role in collecting intelligence from his secret police agents was disliked by some of the Nazi leadership. ''Reichsf\u00fchrer'' [[Heinrich Himmler]] once characterized Ohlendorf as \"an unbearable Prussian\" who was \"without humour\".{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=184}} Nonetheless, Ohlendorf was instrumental as a member of the SD in shaping Nazi economic doctrine, which became \"increasingly virulent as the war progressed\" as he attempted to mould the economy \"in an ethnic context\".{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=110}} It was Ohlendorf's responsibility as head of the SD-Inland to collect data and scientifically examine social, cultural, and economic issues, assembling reports to his superiors in the Nazi government.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|pp=96\u201397}} Routine public opinion surveys\u2014which were under the purview of Ohlendorf and SS-Major Reinhard H\u00f6hn\u2014constituted some of these reports.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=135}} These public opinion polls on the social climate of Nazi Germany were both unpopular and controversial.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=143}}\n\nIn June 1941, [[Reinhard Heydrich]] appointed Ohlendorf to be commander of [[Einsatzgruppen|''Einsatzgruppe'' D]],{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=308}} which operated in southern [[Ukraine]] and [[Crimea]].{{sfn|Arad|2009|p=128}} Joining the ''Einsatzgruppen'' was an unappealing prospect and Ohlendorf refused twice before his eventual appointment.{{sfn|Koch|1985|p=383}} Transfers from the RHSA to the ''Einsatzgruppen'' were in part due to personnel shortages but also to keep the initial killing operations confined to those who already knew the details, like Ohlendorf, [[Arthur Nebe]], and [[Paul Blobel]].{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=28}} ''Einsatzgruppe'' D was the smallest of the task forces, but was supplemented by Romanians along their way through the killing fields of [[Bessarabia]], southern Ukraine, and the Caucasus.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=620}} Additional manpower for ''Einsatzgruppe'' D came from Ukrainian auxiliary police formations.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=387}} Supporting military operations, Ohlendorf's group was attached to the Eleventh Army.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=12}}{{efn|One task which Ohlendorf disdained was providing guards for the harvest at the behest of Army commanders, who wanted to prevent the Romanians from consuming any of the goods.{{sfn|Burleigh|2000|p=624}} }} Ohlendorf's ''Einsatzgruppe'' in particular was responsible for the 13 December 1941 massacre at [[Simferopol]], where at least 14,300 people, mostly Jews, were killed. Over 90,000 murders throughout the Ukraine and the Caucusus are attributed to Ohlendorf's unit.{{sfn|Chapoutot|2018|p=3}}{{efn|Ohlendorf stated that he tried to mitigate any \"unnecessary agitation\" for the victims during the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]] at [[Nuremberg]].{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} }}\n\nOhlendorf disliked the use of the oft-employed ''Genickschu\u00df'' (shot to the back of the neck) and preferred to line up victims and fire at them from a greater distance so as to alleviate personal responsibility for individual murders.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=126}} All forms of contact between the firing squads and victims were limited\u2014per Ohlendorf's insistence\u2014until the last moments before the killing started, and up to three rifleman were allocated to each person about to be shot.{{sfn|Weale|2012|p=319}} To ensure the group killing mentality, Ohlendorf forbade any commando from taking individual actions and explicitly instructed his men not to take any of the victim's valuables.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=166}} One of Ohlendorf's most trusted \"proper\" military-style murderers, ''SS-Haupsturmf\u00fchrer'' Lothar Heimbach, once exclaimed, \"A man is the lord over life and death when he gets an order to shoot three hundred children\u2014and he kills at least one hundred fifty himself.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=169}}{{efn|Justifying the murder of children, Ohlendorf stated, \"the children were people who would grow up and surely being the children of parents who had been killed, they would constitute a danger no smaller than their parents.\"{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=113}} }}\n\nMany of the killing operations were personally overseen by Ohlendorf, who wanted to ensure they were \"military in character and humane under the circumstances\".{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=127}} Such considerations do not constitute mercy by any means and the number of persons killed under the leadership of ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders like Ohlendorf are \"staggering\" despite the use of varying murder techniques.{{sfn|Botwinick|2001|pp=184\u2013188}} On 1 August 1941, ''Einsatzgruppen'' commanders including Ohlendorf, received instructions from [[Gestapo]] chief [[Heinrich M\u00fcller (Gestapo)|Heinrich M\u00fcller]] to keep headquarters (Hitler especially) informed of their progress in the East; M\u00fcller also encouraged the speedy delivery of photographs showing the results of these operations.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=122}} During September 1941, Ohlendorf's group slaughtered 22,467 Jews and Communists at Nikolayev near Odessa.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=172}}\n\nDue to the Wehrmacht's insistence that the Ukraine's agricultural production was needed to sustain its military campaign, Ohlendorf was asked during October 1941 to refrain from killing some of the Jewish farmers\u2014a request he honored\u2014but one which earned him Himmler's contempt.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=182}} This act should not be seen as a change of heart or kindness, as just a month prior in September 1941, Ohlendorf reported to his men that \"from now on the Jewish question is going to be solved and that means liquidation\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=228}} From that month forward, the ''Einsatzgruppen'' had begun the process of systematically shooting not just men but women and children, a transition that historian Peter Longerich terms \"a decisive step on the way towards a policy of racial annihilation\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=252}}\n\nBetween February and March 1942, Himmler ordered that gas vans should be used to murder women and children so as to reduce the strain on the men, but Ohlendorf reported that many of the ''Einsatzkommandos'' refused to utilize them since burying the victims proved an \"ordeal\" afterwards.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=243}}{{efn|Historian Martin Gilbert reported that in front of the Nuremberg Tribunal, Ohlendorf described the use of gas vans for killing operations as \"unpleasant\" and that the {{lang|de|Ensatzkommandos}} disliked dealing with the bodies.{{sfn|Gilbert|1985|p=365}} }} When gas van killing operations were conducted, it was usually at night to keep the population from witnessing the macabre affair.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=115}} After the victims' agonizing deaths, Jewish {{lang|de|Sonderkommando}} were forced to unload the bodies, clean the excrement and feces from inside the van's gas chamber, and once the clean up was complete, were themselves immediately shot.{{sfn|Langerbein|2003|p=116}} As far as Ohlendorf was concerned, the gas vans were impracticable for the scale of killing demanded by Hitler and Himmler; namely, since they could only kill between fifteen and twenty-five persons at a time.{{sfn|Shirer|1990|pp=960\u2013961}}\n\n[[File:Otto Ohlendorf.jpg|thumb|upright|Ohlendorf on 1 March 1948]]\nHistorian Donald Bloxham referred to Ohlendorf as a bureaucrat, who was trying to \"prove himself in the field\".{{sfn|Bloxham|2009|p=267}} Another historian, Mark Mazower, described Ohlendorf as a \"gloomy, driven, self-righteous Prussian\".{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=254}} His commitment to the Nazi cause kept him in the Ukraine longer than any of his comrades, and while he may have disliked the political direction Germany was headed, he never registered complaints about murdering Jews.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=254}} He did, however, express misgivings about the barbarity and sadism being meted out by the Romanian units that accompanied the ''Einsatzgruppen'' in their murderous tasks, since they were not only leaving a trail of corpses in their wake, they were also pillaging and raping in the process.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|p=336}} Not only that, Ohlendorf lodged a complaint about the Romanian forces, who drove thousands of frail elderly persons and children from Bessarabia and Bokovina\u2014all incapable of work\u2014into German-held regions, which his men forced back into Romanian territory but not without killing a significant percentage of them as a result.{{sfn|Evans|2010|p=234}}\n\nOhlendorf devoted only four years (1939\u20131943) of full-time activity to the RSHA, for in 1943, in addition to his other jobs, he became a deputy director general in the Reich Ministry of economic affairs.{{sfn|Hilberg|1985|p=104}} Sometime in November 1944, he was promoted to ''[[Gruppenf\u00fchrer]]''.{{sfn|Zentner|Bed\u00fcrftig|1991|p=665}} Believing their expertise invaluable, Ohlendorf, [[Ludwig Erhard]], and other experts concerned themselves with how to stabilize German currency after the war.{{sfn|Janich|2013|pp=160\u2013161}} Hoping to salvage the reputation of the SD, Ohlendorf offered his services in the hopes that he could shape the postwar reconstruction of Germany, but along \"National Socialist lines\", remaining convinced like Admiral [[Karl D\u00f6nitz]] (who gave Ohlendorf the economics portfolio), that some form of Nazism would ultimately survive.{{sfn|Mazower|2008|pp=532\u2013533}}\n\nIn May 1945, Ohlendorf participated in Himmler's flight from Flensburg and was arrested with him near [[L\u00fcneburg]] along with several other subordinates.{{sfn|Rhodes|2003|p=272}} Himmler committed suicide shortly after being captured.{{sfn|Manvell|Fraenkel|1987|pp=244\u2013248}} For several weeks after arrest, Ohlendorf was carefully interrogated, during which he revealed the criminal nature of the German campaign in the East.{{sfn|Ingrao|2013|p=227}}\n\n==Nuremberg trials==\n[[File:Otto Ohlendorf EGR.jpg|thumb|Ohlendorf testifies at the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]], 9 October 1947.]]\nDuring the [[Einsatzgruppen trial]], Ohlendorf was the chief defendant, and was also a key witness in the prosecution of other indicted war criminals. Ohlendorf's apparently reliable testimony was attributed to his distaste for the [[corruption in Nazi Germany]] and a stubborn commitment to duty. The court examined Ohlendorf concerning ''Einsatzgruppen'' operations in particular.{{sfn|Cesarani|2016|p=784}} During the trial, Ohlendorf insisted that he, as a loyal Nazi, had acted properly and had done nothing wrong.{{sfn|Chapoutot|2018|pp=3\u20134}} He expressed no remorse for his actions, telling prosecutor [[Ben Ferencz]] that the [[Jew]]s of America would suffer for what the prosecutor had done, and seemed to have been more concerned about the moral strain on those carrying out the murders than those being murdered.{{sfn|Ferencz (1946\u20131949). ''Mass Murderers Seek to Justify Genocide''}}\n\nAt the trial, Ohlendorf attempted to present the operations in the Soviet area \"not as a racist programme for the annihilation of all the Jews&nbsp;... but as a general liquidation order primarily aimed at 'securing' the newly won territory\".{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=186}} Defending his actions, Ohlendorf compared the ''Einsatzgruppen'' actions to the Biblical Jewish extirpation of its enemies; he likewise claimed that his firing squads were \"no worse than the 'press-button killers' who dropped the atom bomb on Japan\".{{sfn|Wistrich|1995|p=185}}\n\nDespite his attempts to establish moral equivalency for atrocities upon the Allies, Otto Ohlendorf was convicted of [[crimes against humanity]] and [[war crimes]] committed during World War II.

The founding editor of ''Index on Censorship'' was the critic and translator [[Michael Scammell]] (1972\u201381), who still serves as a patron of the organisation.\n\nThe operation is based at 1 [[Rivington Place]] in central London.\n\n== The magazine ==\n[[File:Jodie Ginsberg - 2018 Human Rights and Democracy Report (48013652831) (cropped).jpg|thumb|Jodie Ginsberg, Chief Executive Index on Censorship]]\n''Index on Censorship'' magazine was founded by Michael Scammel in 1972.<ref name=euro>{{cite web|title=Members|url=http://www.eurozine.com/journals/samtiden/selfdescription.html|publisher=Eurozine|accessdate=20 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141120065558/http://www.eurozine.com/journals/samtiden/selfdescription.html|archivedate=20 November 2014}}</ref> It supports free expression, publishing distinguished writers from around the world, exposing suppressed stories, initiating debate, and providing an international record of censorship. The quarterly editions of the magazine usually focus on a country or region or a recurring theme in the global free expression debate. ''Index on Censorship'' also publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers. ''Index Index'', a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, was published in the magazine until December 2008.\n\nThe original inspiration to create ''Index'' came from prominent Soviet dissidents (see Founding History, below), but from its outset, the magazine covered censorship in right-wing dictatorships then ruling Greece and Portugal, the former military regimes of Latin America, and the former [[Soviet Union]] and its satellites.<ref name=\"theiner\" /> The magazine has covered other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and [[Internet censorship]].\n\nIn the first issue of May 1972 Stephen Spender wrote:\n<blockquote>\"Obviously there is the risk of a magazine of this kind becoming a bulletin of frustration. However, the material by writers which is censored in Eastern Europe, Greece, South Africa and other countries is among the most exciting that is being written today. Moreover, the question of censorship has become a matter of impassioned debate; and it is one which does not only concern totalitarian societies.\"</blockquote>\nAccordingly, the magazine has sought to shed light on other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and internet censorship. Issues are usually organised by theme, and contain a country-by-country list of recent cases involving censorship, restrictions on [[freedom of the press]] and other [[free speech]] violations. Occasionally, ''Index on Censorship'' publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers as well as censored ones.\n\nOver the years, ''Index on Censorship'' has presented works by some of the world's most distinguished writers and thinkers, including [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Umberto Eco]].<ref>Hampshire, Stuart (1997), \"Should Index be above the battle?\" in W.

There have been special issues on China, reporting from the Middle East, and on internet censorship. The Russia issue (January 2008) won an [[Amnesty International]] Media Award 2008 for features by Russian journalists [[Fatima Tlisova]] and [[Sergei Bachinin]], and Russian free speech campaigner Alexei Simonov.\n\nSince January 2010 it has been published by [[Sage Publications]], an independent for-profit academic publisher.<ref name=\"SAGE\">{{cite press release|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804033651/http://www.sagepub.com/press/2009/june/ic.sp |title=SAGE to publish Index on Censorship (via Wayback Machine)|publisher=SAGE Publications|date=June 2009}}</ref> Between 2005 and 2009, the magazine was published and distributed by [[Routledge]], part of the [[Taylor & Francis]] group.\n\nIn addition to print and annual subscriptions, ''Index on Censorship'' is available on [[Exact Editions]], an application for the iPhone/iPad and Android.<!-- no commercial advertising -->\n\nIt is also a partner with [[Eurozine]], a network of more than 60 European cultural journals.<ref name=euro />\n\n== Publishing landmarks ==\n[[File:Sv\u011bt knihy 2011 - Index on Censorship.jpg|thumb|Philip Spender, Jo Glanville, Michael Scammell]]\n[[File:IndexOnCensorshipLogo.png|thumb|Logo until 2012]]\nOther landmark publications include [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]'s writings from prison (Issue 3/1997) and a translation of the Czechoslovak [[Charter 77]] manifesto drafted by [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] and others in Issue 3/1977. Index published the first English translation of [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s Nobel Prize acceptance speech. ''Index on Censorship'' published the stories of the \"[[Forced disappearance#Argentina|disappeared]]\" in [[Argentina]] and the work of banned poets in [[Cuba]]; the work of Chinese poets who escaped the massacres that ended the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]]. ''Index on Censorship'' has a long history of publishing writers in translation, including [[Bernard-Henri L\u00e9vy]], [[Ivan Klima]], [[Ma Jian (writer)|Ma Jian]] and Nobel laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]], and news reports including [[Anna Politkovskaia]]'s coverage of the war in Chechnya (Issue 2/2002).\n\nSir [[Tom Stoppard]]'s play ''Every Good Boy Deserves Favour'' (1977), which is set in a Soviet mental institution, originally performed with the London Symphony Orchestra, was inspired by the personal account of former detainee [[Victor Fainberg]] and [[Clayton Yeo]]'s expose of the use of psychiatric abuse in the USSR, published in ''Index on Censorship'' (Issue 2, 1975).<ref name=\"Nadel\">Nadel, Ira (2004).

Six months later, ''Index'' published the ''Hunger Strike Declaration'' from four student leaders of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Zhou Duo]], [[Hou Dejian]] and [[Gao Xin]].\n\n''Index Index'', a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, continued to be published in each edition of the magazine until December 2008, when this function was transferred to the website. The offences against free expression documented in that first issue's ''Index Index'' listing included censorship in Greece and Spain, then dictatorships, and Brazil, which had just banned the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' on the grounds that it \"insulted a friendly power\" \u2013 the United States, where it had been made and freely shown.\n\n''Index on Censorship'' paid special attention to the situation in then Czechoslovakia between the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, devoting an entire issue to the country eight years after the [[Prague Spring]] (Issue 3/1976). It included several pieces by V\u00e1clav Havel, including a first translation of his one act play ''Conversation'', and a letter to Czech officials on police censorship of his December 1975 production of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' by [[John Gay]].<ref name=\"Nadel\" />\n\nThe magazine also carried articles on the state of the Czech theatre and a list of the so-called Padlock Publications, 50 banned books that circulated only in typescript. Index also published an English version of Havel's play ''Mistake'', dedicated to [[Samuel Beckett]] in gratitude for Beckett's own dedication of his play ''Catastrophe'' to Havel. Both short plays were performed<ref>Glanville, Jo (16 September 2009). [http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2009/09/godot-to-the-rescue/ \"Godot to the Rescue\"].

After much debate surrounding the report's ten key recommendations, the UK Justice Secretary Jack Straw pledged to make English defamation laws fairer.<ref>Glanville, Jo (22 November 2009).

Until then the organisation did not regard itself as \"a campaigning organisation in the mould of [[Article 19]] or [[Amnesty International]]\", as former news editor Sarah Smith noted in 2001,<ref name=\"Jones\">Smith, Sarah (2001), \"Index on Censorship\" in Jones, Derek (ed.), ''Censorship: A World Encyclopaedia''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-135-0}}</ref> preferring to use its \"understanding of what is newsworthy and politically significant\" to maintain pressure on oppressive regimes (such as China, from 1989) through extensive coverage.\n\n== External links ==\nThe Index on Censorship website [https://www.indexoncensorship.org/ http://www.indexoncensorship.org] was relaunched on 21 July 2013, replacing the former www.indexonline.org blog. The new website provides the hub for all the organisation's published writing, events and programmes. It carries some content from ''Index on Censorship'' magazine, but mostly originally commissioned articles and blogs on free expression issues.\n\nThe site also has an extensive archive of resources which offers a searchable global listing of organisations and media that champion freedom of expression; reports surveying freedom of expression around the world; links to censorship circumvention guides and software; and a selection of the best writing about landmark issues in the fight for free expression over the years, such as the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the controversy surrounding the publication of [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'']]'s Muhammad cartoons in Denmark, and internet censorship. It provides information about all current events, issues of magazines and projects that the organisation is undertaking.\n\n== Arts and international programmes ==\nIndex on Censorship also runs a programme of UK based and international projects that put the organisation's philosophy into practice. In 2009 and 2010 Index on Censorship worked in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Tunisia and many other countries, in support of journalists, broadcasters, artists and writers who work against a backdrop of intimidation, repression, and censorship.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe organisation's arts programmes investigate the impact of current and recent social and political change on arts practitioners, assessing the degree and depth of self-censorship. It uses the arts to engage young people directly into the freedom of expression debate. It works with marginalised communities in UK, creating new platforms, on line and actual for creative expression.\n\nIndex on Censorship works internationally to commission new work, not only articles for print and online, but also new photography, film & video, visual arts and performance. Recent examples include an exhibition of photostories produced by women in Iraq, ''Open Shutters''; and programme involving artists from refugee and migrant communities in UK, linking with artists from their country of origin, imagine art after, exhibited at [[Tate Britain]] in 2007.\n\nIndex is also working with Burmese exiled artists and publishers on creating a programme in support of the collective efforts of Burma's creative community. Index also commissioned a new play by Actors for Human Rights, ''Seven Years With Hard Labour'', weaving together four accounts from former Burmese political prisoners now living in the UK.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18401 \"Amnesty hosts hard-hitting performances of real life stories\"]. Amnesty.org (UK).</ref> Index also co-published a book of poetry by homeless people in London and St. Petersburg.\n\n== Partners ==\n''Index on Censorship'' works in partnership with major groups working for freedom of expression rights, including [[Amnesty International]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], [[English PEN]], [[PEN International]], [http://humanrightshouse.org/ Human Rights House Network] and [[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]] among many other groups to create landmark events of national and international significance. Index was one four international freedom of expression organisations on the programming committee of the First [[Global Forum on Freedom of Expression]] in Oslo June 1 \u2013 6 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}<!-- expressionforum.org down \u2013 other source, please?-->\n\nThe organisation regularly contributes to the national and international media, and plays a regular part in major literary events and public debate, including the [[Hay Festival|Hay]] and [[Edinburgh Festival]]s and political functions such as the Institute of Ideas, the Convention on Modern Liberty.\n\n''Index on Censorship'' is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organisations]] that monitors [[censorship]] worldwide and defends journalists, writers, Internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to [[freedom of expression]]. It is also a member of the [[Tunisia Monitoring Group]], a coalition of 16 free expression organisations that lobbies the [[Tunisia]]n government to improve its human rights record.\n\n== Founding history ==\nThe original inspiration for Index on Censorship came from two prominent Soviet dissidents, [[Pavel Litvinov]], grandson of the former Soviet Foreign Minister, [[Maxim Litvinov]], and [[Larisa Bogoraz]], the former wife of the writer, [[Yuli Daniel]], who had written to The Times in 1968 calling for international condemnation of the rigged trial of two young writers and their typists on charges of 'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'. (One of the writers, Yuri Galanskov, died in a camp in 1972).\n\nSpender organised a telegram of support and sympathy from 16 British and US public intellectuals, including [[W.H. Auden]], [[A.J.

In reply Litvinov suggested, in a letter later published in Index's first issue, for some form of publication \"to provide information to world public opinion about the real state of affairs in the USSR\".\n\nSpender and his colleagues, Stuart Hampshire, David Astor, Edward Crankshaw and founding editor Michael Scammell sought to go further than this, wishing to cover then current censorship in right-wing dictatorships such as Greece, Portugal, and the military regimes of Latin America, as well as in the former Soviet Union and its satellites.<ref name=\"theiner\" />\n\nDescribing the organisation's objectives Hampshire said \"the tyrant's concealments of oppression and of absolute cruelty should always be challenged. There should be noise of publicity outside every detention centre and concentration camp and a published record of every tyrannical denial of free expression.\"\n\nThe magazine was originally to be called Index, as suggested by Scammell, a reference to the lists or Indexes of banned works that are central to the history of censorship, including the Roman Catholic Church's ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (Index of Forbidden Books), the Soviet Union's ''Censor's Index'' and apartheid South Africa's ''Jacobsens Index of Objectionable Literature''.<ref name=\"theiner\" />\n\nScammell later admitted that the line ''on Censorship'' was added as an afterthought after it was perceived that the reference was not clear to readers. \"Panicking, we hastily added the words 'on censorship' as a subtitle,\" wrote Scammell in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, \"and this it has remained ever since, nagging me with its ungrammaticality (Index ''of'' Censorship, surely) and a standing apology for the opacity of its title.\"\n\n== Freedom of Expression Awards ==\n{{Split section|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox award\n| name           = Freedom of Expression Awards\n| subheader=\"Celebrating the courage and creativity of some of the world's greatest journalists, artists, campaigners and digital activists\"\n| image          = \n| imagesize      =\n| description    = courage, creativity and resilience in tackling censorship\n| presenter      = Index on Censorship\n| country        = {{GBR}}\n| location       = [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]\n| year           = 2001\n| year2          = 2020\n| website        = https://www.indexoncensorship.org/awards/\n| sponsor = [[Private Internet Access]], [[Google]], [[SAGE Publications]], [[Daily Mail and General Trust]], [[Daily Mirror]], [[Edwardian Hotels]], [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Psiphon]], [[News UK]], [[France M\u00e9dias Monde]], [[Vodafone]], Mainframe.\n}}\n\n''Index on Censorship'' annually presents awards to courageous journalists, artists, campaigners and digital activists from around the world who have made a significant contribution to free expression over the past year.

Speaking to students the previous May, Malkovich had been asked who \u2013 as the star of ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' \u2013 he would like to fight a duel with. He picked [[Robert Fisk]], ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper's Middle East correspondent, and [[George Galloway]], at the time a [[Glasgow]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour MP]], adding that rather than duel them, he would \"rather just shoot them\".\n\nFisk reacted with outrage<ref>Robert Fisk, [http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk0513.html \"Hate and Star Power: Why Does Malkovich Want to Kill Me?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004195018/http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk0513.html |date=2009-10-04 }}, Counterpunch, 13 May 2002.</ref> and the media rights group [[Reporters sans Frontieres]] condemned Malkovich, but in an online article Index's then Associate Editor (now deputy CEO) [[Rohan Jayasekera (writer)|Rohan Jayasekera]], dismissed the actor's comments as \"flippant\" in an article on the organisation's (www.indexonline.org) blog site:\n\n:Over the years since (the [[Rwanda]] genocide), and not without criticism, ''Index on Censorship'' has turned to reporting the areas where the right to free speech conflicts with these other rights. ''Index on Censorship'' is a journalistic enterprise, not a campaigning agency. This has freed it to make judgement calls \u2014 some say to equivocate \u2014 on when and where and how and why the freely expressed word can be a direct threat to other human rights.\n\nThe fundraising event went ahead in December 2002 despite a street protest outside the ICA. Since taking over as CEO in 2008 John Kampfner has strongly reinforced the campaigning profile of the organisation (see Arts and Advocacy programmes above).\n\n=== Theo Van Gogh ===\nIn November 2004, ''Index on Censorship'' attracted further controversy over another indexonline.org blog post by Jayasekera that, to many readers, seemed to condone or justify the murder of Dutch film-maker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]].<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Sullivan |title=BBC Weeps For Yasser Arafat |url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/bbc-weeps-for-yasser-arafat/4736/ |work=[[The New York Sun]] |publisher=Ronald Weintraub |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref> The blog described Van Gogh was a \"free-speech fundamentalist\" on a \"martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities\" in an \"abuse of his right to free speech\". Describing Van Gogh's film [[Submission (2004 film)|''Submission'']] as \"furiously provocative\", Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as:\n\n:A sensational climax to a lifetime's public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo Van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo! Bravo!<ref name=\"Sullivan\" />\n\nThere were many protests from both left- and right-wing commentators. [[Nick Cohen]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper wrote in December 2004, that:\n\n:When I asked Jayasekera if he had any regrets, he said he had none. He told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn't have made the mistake of believing that ''Index on Censorship'' was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle \u2013 in the same way as [[Amnesty International]] is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle. It may have been so its radical youth, but was now as concerned with fighting 'hate speech' as protecting free speech.<ref>{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Cohen |authorlink=Nick Cohen |title=Censor and sensibility |url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,6903,1371869,00.html |work=The Observer |date=12 December 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n[[Ursula Owen]], the chief executive of ''Index on Censorship'', while agreeing that the blog post's \"tone was not right\" contradicted Cohen's account of his conversation with Jayasekera in a letter to ''The Observer''.<ref>{{cite news |first=Ursula |last=Owen |authorlink=Ursula Owen |title=Free to speak |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2004/dec/19/letters.theobserver |work=The Observer |date=19 December 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref>\n\n=== Danish cartoons ===\nIn December 2009 the magazine published an interview with [[Jytte Klausen]] about a refusal of [[Yale University Press]] to include the [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|Mohammed Cartoons]] in Klausen's book ''[[The Cartoons that Shook the World]]''.

The quarterly editions of the magazine usually focus on a country or region or a recurring theme in the global free expression debate. ''Index on Censorship'' also publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers. ''Index Index'', a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, was published in the magazine until December 2008.\n\nThe original inspiration to create ''Index'' came from prominent Soviet dissidents (see Founding History, below), but from its outset, the magazine covered censorship in right-wing dictatorships then ruling Greece and Portugal, the former military regimes of Latin America, and the former [[Soviet Union]] and its satellites.<ref name=\"theiner\" /> The magazine has covered other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and [[Internet censorship]].\n\nIn the first issue of May 1972 Stephen Spender wrote:\n<blockquote>\"Obviously there is the risk of a magazine of this kind becoming a bulletin of frustration. However, the material by writers which is censored in Eastern Europe, Greece, South Africa and other countries is among the most exciting that is being written today. Moreover, the question of censorship has become a matter of impassioned debate; and it is one which does not only concern totalitarian societies.\"</blockquote>\nAccordingly, the magazine has sought to shed light on other challenges facing free expression, including religious extremism, the rise of nationalism, and internet censorship. Issues are usually organised by theme, and contain a country-by-country list of recent cases involving censorship, restrictions on [[freedom of the press]] and other [[free speech]] violations. Occasionally, ''Index on Censorship'' publishes short works of fiction and poetry by notable new writers as well as censored ones.\n\nOver the years, ''Index on Censorship'' has presented works by some of the world's most distinguished writers and thinkers, including [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], [[Milan Kundera]], [[V\u00e1clav Havel]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[Salman Rushdie]], [[Doris Lessing]], [[Arthur Miller]], [[Noam Chomsky]], and [[Umberto Eco]].<ref>Hampshire, Stuart (1997), \"Should Index be above the battle?\" in W.

There have been special issues on China, reporting from the Middle East, and on internet censorship. The Russia issue (January 2008) won an [[Amnesty International]] Media Award 2008 for features by Russian journalists [[Fatima Tlisova]] and [[Sergei Bachinin]], and Russian free speech campaigner Alexei Simonov.\n\nSince January 2010 it has been published by [[Sage Publications]], an independent for-profit academic publisher.<ref name=\"SAGE\">{{cite press release|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804033651/http://www.sagepub.com/press/2009/june/ic.sp |title=SAGE to publish Index on Censorship (via Wayback Machine)|publisher=SAGE Publications|date=June 2009}}</ref> Between 2005 and 2009, the magazine was published and distributed by [[Routledge]], part of the [[Taylor & Francis]] group.\n\nIn addition to print and annual subscriptions, ''Index on Censorship'' is available on [[Exact Editions]], an application for the iPhone/iPad and Android.<!-- no commercial advertising -->\n\nIt is also a partner with [[Eurozine]], a network of more than 60 European cultural journals.<ref name=euro />\n\n== Publishing landmarks ==\n[[File:Sv\u011bt knihy 2011 - Index on Censorship.jpg|thumb|Philip Spender, Jo Glanville, Michael Scammell]]\n[[File:IndexOnCensorshipLogo.png|thumb|Logo until 2012]]\nOther landmark publications include [[Ken Saro-Wiwa]]'s writings from prison (Issue 3/1997) and a translation of the Czechoslovak [[Charter 77]] manifesto drafted by [[V\u00e1clav Havel]] and others in Issue 3/1977. Index published the first English translation of [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s Nobel Prize acceptance speech. ''Index on Censorship'' published the stories of the \"[[Forced disappearance#Argentina|disappeared]]\" in [[Argentina]] and the work of banned poets in [[Cuba]]; the work of Chinese poets who escaped the massacres that ended the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]].

Six months later, ''Index'' published the ''Hunger Strike Declaration'' from four student leaders of the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]], [[Liu Xiaobo]], [[Zhou Duo]], [[Hou Dejian]] and [[Gao Xin]].\n\n''Index Index'', a round-up of abuses of freedom of expression worldwide, continued to be published in each edition of the magazine until December 2008, when this function was transferred to the website. The offences against free expression documented in that first issue's ''Index Index'' listing included censorship in Greece and Spain, then dictatorships, and Brazil, which had just banned the film ''[[Zabriskie Point (film)|Zabriskie Point]]'' on the grounds that it \"insulted a friendly power\" \u2013 the United States, where it had been made and freely shown.\n\n''Index on Censorship'' paid special attention to the situation in then Czechoslovakia between the Soviet invasion of 1968 and the [[Velvet Revolution]] of 1989, devoting an entire issue to the country eight years after the [[Prague Spring]] (Issue 3/1976). It included several pieces by V\u00e1clav Havel, including a first translation of his one act play ''Conversation'', and a letter to Czech officials on police censorship of his December 1975 production of ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'' by [[John Gay]].<ref name=\"Nadel\" />\n\nThe magazine also carried articles on the state of the Czech theatre and a list of the so-called Padlock Publications, 50 banned books that circulated only in typescript. Index also published an English version of Havel's play ''Mistake'', dedicated to [[Samuel Beckett]] in gratitude for Beckett's own dedication of his play ''Catastrophe'' to Havel. Both short plays were performed<ref>Glanville, Jo (16 September 2009). [http://www.indexoncensorship.org/2009/09/godot-to-the-rescue/ \"Godot to the Rescue\"].

Until then the organisation did not regard itself as \"a campaigning organisation in the mould of [[Article 19]] or [[Amnesty International]]\", as former news editor Sarah Smith noted in 2001,<ref name=\"Jones\">Smith, Sarah (2001), \"Index on Censorship\" in Jones, Derek (ed.), ''Censorship: A World Encyclopaedia''. London: Routledge. {{ISBN|978-1-57958-135-0}}</ref> preferring to use its \"understanding of what is newsworthy and politically significant\" to maintain pressure on oppressive regimes (such as China, from 1989) through extensive coverage.\n\n== External links ==\nThe Index on Censorship website [https://www.indexoncensorship.org/ http://www.indexoncensorship.org] was relaunched on 21 July 2013, replacing the former www.indexonline.org blog. The new website provides the hub for all the organisation's published writing, events and programmes. It carries some content from ''Index on Censorship'' magazine, but mostly originally commissioned articles and blogs on free expression issues.\n\nThe site also has an extensive archive of resources which offers a searchable global listing of organisations and media that champion freedom of expression; reports surveying freedom of expression around the world; links to censorship circumvention guides and software; and a selection of the best writing about landmark issues in the fight for free expression over the years, such as the fatwa against Salman Rushdie, the controversy surrounding the publication of [[Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy|''Jyllands-Posten'']]'s Muhammad cartoons in Denmark, and internet censorship. It provides information about all current events, issues of magazines and projects that the organisation is undertaking.\n\n== Arts and international programmes ==\nIndex on Censorship also runs a programme of UK based and international projects that put the organisation's philosophy into practice. In 2009 and 2010 Index on Censorship worked in Afghanistan, Burma, Iraq, Tunisia and many other countries, in support of journalists, broadcasters, artists and writers who work against a backdrop of intimidation, repression, and censorship.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}\n\nThe organisation's arts programmes investigate the impact of current and recent social and political change on arts practitioners, assessing the degree and depth of self-censorship. It uses the arts to engage young people directly into the freedom of expression debate. It works with marginalised communities in UK, creating new platforms, on line and actual for creative expression.\n\nIndex on Censorship works internationally to commission new work, not only articles for print and online, but also new photography, film & video, visual arts and performance. Recent examples include an exhibition of photostories produced by women in Iraq, ''Open Shutters''; and programme involving artists from refugee and migrant communities in UK, linking with artists from their country of origin, imagine art after, exhibited at [[Tate Britain]] in 2007.\n\nIndex is also working with Burmese exiled artists and publishers on creating a programme in support of the collective efforts of Burma's creative community. Index also commissioned a new play by Actors for Human Rights, ''Seven Years With Hard Labour'', weaving together four accounts from former Burmese political prisoners now living in the UK.<ref>[https://www.amnesty.org.uk/news_details.asp?NewsID=18401 \"Amnesty hosts hard-hitting performances of real life stories\"]. Amnesty.org (UK).</ref> Index also co-published a book of poetry by homeless people in London and St. Petersburg.\n\n== Partners ==\n''Index on Censorship'' works in partnership with major groups working for freedom of expression rights, including [[Amnesty International]], the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU), [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]], [[English PEN]], [[PEN International]], [http://humanrightshouse.org/ Human Rights House Network] and [[IFEX (organization)|IFEX]] among many other groups to create landmark events of national and international significance. Index was one four international freedom of expression organisations on the programming committee of the First [[Global Forum on Freedom of Expression]] in Oslo June 1 \u2013 6 2009.{{citation needed|date=August 2010}}<!-- expressionforum.org down \u2013 other source, please?-->\n\nThe organisation regularly contributes to the national and international media, and plays a regular part in major literary events and public debate, including the [[Hay Festival|Hay]] and [[Edinburgh Festival]]s and political functions such as the Institute of Ideas, the Convention on Modern Liberty.\n\n''Index on Censorship'' is a founding member of the [[International Freedom of Expression Exchange]], a global network of [[non-governmental organisations]] that monitors [[censorship]] worldwide and defends journalists, writers, Internet users and others who are persecuted for exercising their right to [[freedom of expression]]. It is also a member of the [[Tunisia Monitoring Group]], a coalition of 16 free expression organisations that lobbies the [[Tunisia]]n government to improve its human rights record.\n\n== Founding history ==\nThe original inspiration for Index on Censorship came from two prominent Soviet dissidents, [[Pavel Litvinov]], grandson of the former Soviet Foreign Minister, [[Maxim Litvinov]], and [[Larisa Bogoraz]], the former wife of the writer, [[Yuli Daniel]], who had written to The Times in 1968 calling for international condemnation of the rigged trial of two young writers and their typists on charges of 'anti-Soviet agitation and propaganda'. (One of the writers, Yuri Galanskov, died in a camp in 1972).\n\nSpender organised a telegram of support and sympathy from 16 British and US public intellectuals, including [[W.H. Auden]], [[A.J. Ayer]], [[Yehudi Menuhin]], [[J. B. Priestley]], [[Paul Scofield]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Igor Stravinsky]], among others. In reply Litvinov suggested, in a letter later published in Index's first issue, for some form of publication \"to provide information to world public opinion about the real state of affairs in the USSR\".\n\nSpender and his colleagues, Stuart Hampshire, David Astor, Edward Crankshaw and founding editor Michael Scammell sought to go further than this, wishing to cover then current censorship in right-wing dictatorships such as Greece, Portugal, and the military regimes of Latin America, as well as in the former Soviet Union and its satellites.<ref name=\"theiner\" />\n\nDescribing the organisation's objectives Hampshire said \"the tyrant's concealments of oppression and of absolute cruelty should always be challenged. There should be noise of publicity outside every detention centre and concentration camp and a published record of every tyrannical denial of free expression.\"\n\nThe magazine was originally to be called Index, as suggested by Scammell, a reference to the lists or Indexes of banned works that are central to the history of censorship, including the Roman Catholic Church's ''Index Librorum Prohibitorum'' (Index of Forbidden Books), the Soviet Union's ''Censor's Index'' and apartheid South Africa's ''Jacobsens Index of Objectionable Literature''.<ref name=\"theiner\" />\n\nScammell later admitted that the line ''on Censorship'' was added as an afterthought after it was perceived that the reference was not clear to readers. \"Panicking, we hastily added the words 'on censorship' as a subtitle,\" wrote Scammell in the December 1981 issue of the magazine, \"and this it has remained ever since, nagging me with its ungrammaticality (Index ''of'' Censorship, surely) and a standing apology for the opacity of its title.\"\n\n== Freedom of Expression Awards ==\n{{Split section|date=February 2017}}\n{{Infobox award\n| name           = Freedom of Expression Awards\n| subheader=\"Celebrating the courage and creativity of some of the world's greatest journalists, artists, campaigners and digital activists\"\n| image          = \n| imagesize      =\n| description    = courage, creativity and resilience in tackling censorship\n| presenter      = Index on Censorship\n| country        = {{GBR}}\n| location       = [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]\n| year           = 2001\n| year2          = 2020\n| website        = https://www.indexoncensorship.org/awards/\n| sponsor = [[Private Internet Access]], [[Google]], [[SAGE Publications]], [[Daily Mail and General Trust]], [[Daily Mirror]], [[Edwardian Hotels]], [[The Daily Telegraph]], [[Psiphon]], [[News UK]], [[France M\u00e9dias Monde]], [[Vodafone]], Mainframe.\n}}\n\n''Index on Censorship'' annually presents awards to courageous journalists, artists, campaigners and digital activists from around the world who have made a significant contribution to free expression over the past year.

Speaking to students the previous May, Malkovich had been asked who \u2013 as the star of ''[[Les Liaisons Dangereuses]]'' \u2013 he would like to fight a duel with. He picked [[Robert Fisk]], ''[[The Independent]]'' newspaper's Middle East correspondent, and [[George Galloway]], at the time a [[Glasgow]] [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour MP]], adding that rather than duel them, he would \"rather just shoot them\".\n\nFisk reacted with outrage<ref>Robert Fisk, [http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk0513.html \"Hate and Star Power: Why Does Malkovich Want to Kill Me?\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091004195018/http://www.counterpunch.org/fisk0513.html |date=2009-10-04 }}, Counterpunch, 13 May 2002.</ref> and the media rights group [[Reporters sans Frontieres]] condemned Malkovich, but in an online article Index's then Associate Editor (now deputy CEO) [[Rohan Jayasekera (writer)|Rohan Jayasekera]], dismissed the actor's comments as \"flippant\" in an article on the organisation's (www.indexonline.org) blog site:\n\n:Over the years since (the [[Rwanda]] genocide), and not without criticism, ''Index on Censorship'' has turned to reporting the areas where the right to free speech conflicts with these other rights. ''Index on Censorship'' is a journalistic enterprise, not a campaigning agency. This has freed it to make judgement calls \u2014 some say to equivocate \u2014 on when and where and how and why the freely expressed word can be a direct threat to other human rights.\n\nThe fundraising event went ahead in December 2002 despite a street protest outside the ICA. Since taking over as CEO in 2008 John Kampfner has strongly reinforced the campaigning profile of the organisation (see Arts and Advocacy programmes above).\n\n=== Theo Van Gogh ===\nIn November 2004, ''Index on Censorship'' attracted further controversy over another indexonline.org blog post by Jayasekera that, to many readers, seemed to condone or justify the murder of Dutch film-maker [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]].<ref name=\"Sullivan\">{{cite news |first=Andrew |last=Sullivan |title=BBC Weeps For Yasser Arafat |url=http://www.nysun.com/opinion/bbc-weeps-for-yasser-arafat/4736/ |work=[[The New York Sun]] |publisher=Ronald Weintraub |date=12 November 2004 |accessdate=24 June 2009}}</ref> The blog described Van Gogh was a \"free-speech fundamentalist\" on a \"martyrdom operation[,] roar[ing] his Muslim critics into silence with obscenities\" in an \"abuse of his right to free speech\". Describing Van Gogh's film [[Submission (2004 film)|''Submission'']] as \"furiously provocative\", Jayasekera concluded by describing his death as:\n\n:A sensational climax to a lifetime's public performance, stabbed and shot by a bearded fundamentalist, a message from the killer pinned by a dagger to his chest, Theo Van Gogh became a martyr to free expression. His passing was marked by a magnificent barrage of noise as Amsterdam hit the streets to celebrate him in the way the man himself would have truly appreciated. And what timing! Just as his long-awaited biographical film of [[Pim Fortuyn]]'s life is ready to screen. Bravo, Theo! Bravo!<ref name=\"Sullivan\" />\n\nThere were many protests from both left- and right-wing commentators. [[Nick Cohen]] of ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper wrote in December 2004, that:\n\n:When I asked Jayasekera if he had any regrets, he said he had none. He told me that, like many other readers, I shouldn't have made the mistake of believing that ''Index on Censorship'' was against censorship, even murderous censorship, on principle \u2013 in the same way as [[Amnesty International]] is opposed to torture, including murderous torture, on principle.

Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[\u0160tip]] (''\u0130\u015ftip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'').

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

However, the new administration system since 26 April 1922 split Kosovo among three districts ([[oblast]]) of the Kingdom: Kosovo, Ra\u0161ka and Zeta. In 1929, the country was transformed into the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] and the territories of Kosovo were reorganised among the [[Zeta Banovina|Banate of Zeta]], the [[Morava Banovina|Banate of Morava]] and the [[Vardar Banovina|Banate of Vardar]]. In order to change the [[Demographics of Kosovo|ethnic composition of Kosovo]], between 1912 and 1941 a [[Colonisation of Kosovo|large-scale Serbian re-colonisation of Kosovo]] was undertaken by the Belgrade government. Meanwhile, Kosovar Albanians' right to receive education in their own language was denied alongside other non-Slavic or unrecognised Slavic nations of Yugoslavia, as the kingdom only recognised the Slavic Croat, Serb, and Slovene nations as constituent nations of Yugoslavia, while other Slavs had to identify as one of the three official Slavic nations while non-Slav nations were only deemed as minorities.<ref name = \"Schabnel 2001 20\"/>\n\nAlbanians and other [[Muslims]] were forced to emigrate, mainly with the land reform which struck Albanian landowners in 1919, but also with direct violent measures.<ref name=\"daskalovski\">Daskalovski, \u017didas.

In the [[Ottoman Empire]] (which previously controlled the territory), it had been a vilayet with its borders having been revised on several occasions.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

The most noticeable [[Topography|topographical]] features are the [[Prokletije]] and the [[\u0160ar Mountains]]. The Albanian Alps, also commonly known as Bjeshk\u00ebt e Nemuna, are a geological continuation of the [[Dinaric Alps]]. The mountains run laterally through the west along the border with Albania and Montenegro. The southeast is predominantly the \u0160ar Mountains, which form the border with North Macedonia. Besides the mountain ranges, Kosovo's territory consists mostly of two major plains: the [[Kosovo Plain]] in the east and the [[Metohija|Metohija Plain]] in the west.\n\nKosovo's hydrological resources are relatively small. The longest rivers of Kosovo include the [[White Drin]], the [[South Morava]] and the [[Ibar River|Ibar]]. [[Sitnica]], a tributary of Ibar, is the largest river lying completely within Kosovo's territory. River [[Nerodimka (river)|Nerodimka]] represents Europe's only instance of a river bifurcation flowing into the [[Black Sea]] and [[Aegean Sea]].\n{{Clear}}\n\n=== Biodiversity ===\n{{main|Biodiversity of Kosovo|Protected areas of Kosovo|l1=Biodiversity}}\n\n[[File:Parku Komb\u00ebtar Bjeshk\u00ebt Nemuna , Liqeni i madh ne Liqenat , Rugove.jpg|thumb|[[Bjeshk\u00ebt e Nemuna National Park]] is home to a wide range of flora and fauna species.]]\n\nLocated strategically in [[Southeastern Europe]], Kosovo receives species from Europe and Eurasia.

It became the highest institution of visual arts in Kosovo. It was named after one of the most prominent artists of Kosovo [[Muslim Mulliqi]].

In 1969, the parliament of Kosovo established ''Kosovafilm'', a state institution for the production, distribution and showing of films. Its initial director was the actor Abdurrahman Shala, followed by writer and noted poet Azem Shkreli, under whose direction the most successful films were produced. Subsequent directors of Kosovafilm were Xhevar Qorraj, Ekrem Kryeziu and Gani Mehmetaj. After producing seventeen feature films, numerous short films and documentaries, the institution was taken over by the Serbian authorities in 1990 and dissolved. Kosovafilm was reestablished after [[FR Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] withdrawal from the region in June 1999 and has since been endeavoring to revive the film industry in Kosovo.\n\n[[File:Odissea Bekim Fehmiu.jpg|left|thumb|[[Bekim Fehmiu]] was the first Eastern European actor to star in [[Hollywood]] during the Cold War.]]\n\nThe International [[Dokufest|Documentary and Short Film Festival]] is the largest film event in Kosovo. The Festival is organised in August in [[Prizren]] , which attracts numerous international and regional artists. In this annually organised festival, films are screened twice a day in three open-air cinemas as well as in two regular cinemas. Except for its films, the festival is also well known for lively nights after the screening. Various events happen within the scope of the festival: workshops, DokuPhoto exhibitions, festival camping, concerts, which altogether turn the city into a charming place to be. In 2010, Dokufest was voted as one of the 25 best international documentary festivals.<ref>[http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 Dokufest] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160820055759/http://www.dokufest.com/2012/?cid=2,34 |date=20 August 2016 }}</ref>\n\nInternational actors of [[Albanians in kosovo|Albanian origin]] from Kosovo include [[Arta Dobroshi]], [[James Biberi]], [[Faruk Begolli]] and [[Bekim Fehmiu]].

During this time, [[Islam]] was introduced to the population. The [[Vilayet of Kosovo]] was an area much larger than today's Kosovo; it included all today's Kosovo territory, sections of the [[Sand\u017eak]] region cutting into present-day [[\u0160umadija and Western Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]] along with the [[Kuk\u00ebs]] municipality, the surrounding region in present-day northern [[Albania]] and also parts of north-western North Macedonia with the city of [[Skopje]] (then \u00dcsk\u00fcp), as its capital. Between 1881 and 1912 (its final phase), it was internally expanded to include other regions of present-day North Macedonia, including larger urban settlements such as [[\u0160tip]] (''\u0130\u015ftip''), [[Kumanovo]] (''Kumanova'') and [[Kratovo, Macedonia|Kratovo]] (''Kratova'').

The scholar Fredrick F. Anscombe shows that Prizren and [[Vu\u010ditrn]] (''Vul\u00e7itrin'') had no Serbian population in early 17th century. Prizren was inhabited by a mix of Catholic and Muslim Albanians, while Vu\u010ditrn had a mix of Albanian and Turkish speakers, followed by tiny a Serbian minority. [[Gjakova]] was founded by Albanians in the 16th century, and [[Pe\u0107]] (''\u0130pek'') had a continuous presence of the Albanian Kelmendi tribe. Central Kosovo was mixed, but large parts of the [[Drenica|Drenica Valley]] were ethnically Albanian.

[[Language policy]] was of utmost importance in communist Yugoslavia, which after World War II was reorganized as a [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|federation of ethnolinguistically defined nations]], in emulation of the [[Korenizatsiya|interwar Soviet nationalities policy]]. For instance, in 1944, the [[Macedonian language]] was proclaimed for the sake of distancing former [[Vardar Banovina]], which was [[World War II in Yugoslav Macedonia|incorporated into wartime Bulgaria]], from [[Bulgarian language]] and culture. Likewise, in postwar Yugoslavia's [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo]], the local [[Albanian language]] was distanced from Albania's standard steeped in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], by basing it on the Kosovar dialect of [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. As a result, a standard Kosovar language was formed. However, after the rapprochement between Albania and Yugoslavia at the turn of the 1970s, Belgrade adopted Albania's Tosk-based standard of the Albanian language, which ended the brief flourishing of the Gheg-based Kosovar language.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/29940833/The_Idea_of_a_Kosovan_Language_in_Yugoslavia_s_Language_Politics_pp_217-237_._International_Journal_of_the_Sociology_of_Language._Vol_242._DOI_10.1515_ijsl-2016-0040 Tomasz Kamusella. 2016.

As of the [[Constitution of Kosovo]], the judicial system is composed of the Supreme Court, which is the highest judicial authority, a [[Constitutional Court of Kosovo|Constitutional Court]], and an independent prosecutorial institution. All of them are administered by the [[Kosovo Judicial Council|Judicial Council]] located in [[Pristina]]. The [[Kosovo Police]] is the main state law enforcement agency in the nation. After the Independence of Kosovo in 2008, the force became the governmental agency. The agency carries nearly all general police duties such as criminal investigation, patrol activity, traffic policing, border control.\n\nThe [[Ahtisaari Plan]] envisaged two forms of international supervision of Kosovo after its independence such as the [[International Civilian Office]] (ICO), which would monitor the implementation of the Plan and would have a wide range of veto powers over legislative and executive actions, and the [[EULEX|European Union Rule of Law Mission to Kosovo]] (EULEX), which would have the narrower mission of deploying police and civilian resources with the aim of developing the Kosovo Police and judicial systems but also with its own powers of arrest and prosecution.\nThe declaration of independence and subsequent Constitution granted these bodies the powers assigned to them by the Ahtisaari Plan. Since the Plan was not voted on by the UN Security Council, the ICO's legal status within Kosovo was dependent on the de facto situation and Kosovo legislation; it was supervised by an [[International Steering Group]] (ISG) composed of the main states which recognised Kosovo. It was never recognised by Serbia or other non-recognising states. EULEX was also initially opposed by Serbia, but its mandate and powers were accepted in late 2008 by Serbia and the UN Security Council as operating under the umbrella of the continuing UNMIK mandate, in a status-neutral way, but with its own operational independence. The ICO's existence terminated on 10 September 2012, after the ISG had determined that Kosovo had substantially fulfilled its obligations under the Ahtisaari Plan. EULEX continues its existence under both Kosovo and international law; in 2012 the Kosovo president formally requested a continuation of its mandate until 2014.\n{{Clear}}\n=== Minorities ===\n\nThe relations between [[Kosovo Albanians|Kosovar Albanians]] and [[Kosovo Serbs|Kosovar Serbs]] have been hostile since the rise of nationalism in the Balkans during the 19th century.<ref name=\"Schabnel, Albrecht 2001.

Walther also took the opportunity to redesign the slide so the user could grip it more easily, and notably, change the proprietary accessory rail to a [[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] type.\nSome models built in 2005 and all later models received one more design change, an elongated magazine release.<ref name=\"Walther P99 at World Guns\"/>\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:WP99 3.jpg|thumb|left|Walther P99 with the slide locked back displaying its vertical barrel tilt.]]\n\nThe Walther P99 is a [[Recoil operation#Short recoil operation|short recoil]]-operated locked breech [[semi-automatic pistol]] that uses a modified [[John Browning|Browning]] cam-lock system adapted from the [[Browning Hi-Power|Hi-Power]] pistol. The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.\n\nIt uses an internal [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set .28striker or hammer.29|striker]] as opposed to an external [[hammer (firearms)|hammer]], with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the [[pistol slide|slide]] when the gun is cocked, as well as a [[loaded chamber indicator]] on the right side of the slide.\n\nThe original, first-generation P99 had a traditional [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action.2Fsingle-action|Double-Action/Single-Action trigger]] with a [[De-cocker#Decocker|decocker]]. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti-Stress mode is activated, where the striker is cocked but the trigger has the length of pull of the double-action mode. The trigger travel is 14&nbsp;mm (0.55&nbsp;in) long in the Anti-Stress mode, but the most of the length is slack and is similar in feel to a two-stage rifle trigger. At the end of the anti-stress travel, the pressure noticeably increases to 4.5 pounds and the user experiences a crisp trigger break and an extremely short trigger reset of about .1 inches.  All subsequent shots are fired in standard single action mode, where the slack on the trigger is much shorter, but the point of release feels the same.  In order to deactivate Single-Action or Anti-Stress mode, the user can manipulate the decocker button on the top of the slide, just in front of the rear sights.  When decocked from Single-Action mode, the trigger will reset to the full length of its pull.  The pistol is now in Double-Action mode with a pull 7.9 pounds for the full length of the .55 inch pull. After firing the first shot in Double-Action, the pistol will be fired in Single-Action for all subsequent shots.\n\nThe striker protrudes visibly and palpably from the back of the slide when the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.\nIt should however be noted that the striker of the second generation P99QA variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, unless fired, as the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.\n\nErgonomics were a key focus in the design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large)  to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. This adaptable grip was innovative at the time the P99 was introduced.\n\nThe slide and other metal parts of the pistol are [[Tenifer]] treated (a [[nitriding]] process also used on [[Glock]] pistols). The Tenifer finish is between {{convert|0.04|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} and {{convert|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\">Kasler, 137</ref> The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 99% resistance to [[seawater|salt water]] corrosion (which meets or exceeds [[stainless steel]] specifications),<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\">Kokalis, 321</ref> making the P99 particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed]] as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/>\n\nThe P99 features four internal safeties, [[iron sights]] adjustable for both [[windage]] and [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]], tool-less take down, and an [[ambidextrous]] [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] release incorporated into the [[trigger guard]]. The lower forward edge of the frame also known as the dust cover has a mounting-bracket or [[Rail Integration System|rail interface system]] for attaching accessories, such as a [[tactical light]] or [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sight]].\n\nThe P99 feeds from staggered-column or double-stack [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s of varying capacity. Walther also offers staggered-column magazines with a +2 baseplate that add 2 rounds to the magazine capacity at the expense of extending the grip and the pistol height by approximately {{convert|18|mm|abbr=on|1}}.\n\nThe .40 S&W caliber models incorporate a slightly larger slide in order to preserve the same recoil spring assembly used in its 9mm counterpart. The P99 is available in 4 colorations; a black frame with a black slide, a black frame with a titanium-coated slide, a military olive-drab frame with a black slide, and a desert tan frame with black slide. All three of these finishes incorporate the same black grip inserts that come with every P99. The compact versions of the P99 are only available in all black.<ref name=waltherfaq>[http://lundestudio.com/WaltherP99FAQ/ Walther P99 FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090212234948/http://lundestudio.com/WaltherP99FAQ/ |date=2009-02-12 }}</ref>\n\n===Accessories===\nFixed metal 3-dot iron sights, fixed [[Tritium illumination#Small arms sights|tritium]] night sights, adjustable sports iron sights, adjustable optic fibre iron sights, [[laser sight|laser pointer]]s, [[tactical light]]s, magazine flashlight adapters, holsters, magazines, magazine loaders, grip extenders and a [[suppressor]] kit with a 117&nbsp;mm (4.6&nbsp;in) barrel and protective cap for the muzzle threads and a silencer that reduces the sound signature by 33&nbsp;dB(A) are offered as factory accessories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.carl-walther.de/index.php?company=walther&lang=EN&content=products&hid=9|title=Walther Defense Accessories|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Second generation variants==\n===P99AS (Anti Stress)===\n[[File:Walther P99 Left.jpg|thumb|Walther P99AS second generation pistol chambered in .40 S&W.]]\nIntroduced in 2004, this variant comes closest to a traditional Double-Action/Single-Action trigger with a decocker. In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is 14&nbsp;mm (0.55&nbsp;in) long at approximately {{convert|38|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14&nbsp;mm (0.55&nbsp;in) long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to 8&nbsp;mm (0.3&nbsp;in) at the same {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decock key or knob on the slide. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10&nbsp;mm (0.4&nbsp;in) back.<ref name=\"Walther P99 flyer\">[http://www.carl-walther.de/files/pdf/P99E.pdf Walther P99 flyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523012156/http://www.carl-walther.de/files/pdf/P99E.pdf |date=2011-05-23 }}</ref> The P99AS is still in production today.\n\n===P99DAO (Double Action Only)===\nThe P99DAO is similar to the previously produced P990 Double Action Only variant.<ref>[http://www.politieparcours.eu/PDF%20files/Sam156.pdf Het nieuwe politie pistool deel 1, SAM Wapenmagazine 156]</ref> The internal striker is at rest with no pre-load.

The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last and the striker returns to its de-cocked position after each shot.<ref name=\"Walther P99 flyer\"/>\n\n===P99QA (Quick Action)===\nThis variant has a [[Glock pistol|Glock]] style trigger system with a pre-loaded internal striker. When the trigger is pulled, the striker is fully cocked and released, firing the pistol. The trigger travel is approximately 8&nbsp;mm (0.3&nbsp;in) with a trigger pull of approximately {{convert|38|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The trigger pull is consistent in length and force from the first shot to the last.<ref name=\"Walther P99 flyer\"/> The P99QA was announced in 2000 and discontinued in 2011.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===P99c (Compact) versions===\nCompact versions of the P99 available in the 3 preceding action types marketed as the:\n*'''P99c AS''' (Compact Anti Stress)\n*'''P99c DAO''' (Compact Double Action Only)\n*'''P99c QA''' (Compact Quick Action)\n\n===Training variant===\n====P99RAM (Real Action Marker)====\nThe P99RAM is a training and simulation pistol, equipped with a CO<sub>2</sub> blow-back system. It fires low-cost Paint- and Rubberball ammunition in caliber {{convert|.43|in|abbr=on}}. In its design, controls, and handling, the P99RAM is indistinguishable from the original P99 pistol. Protective clothing is needed to adequately protect the users from Paint- and Rubberball hits during training.\n\n===Limited editions===\nWalther has also created several limited production runs of the P99 including:\n*'''MI-6''' ([[James Bond]]) a marketing tie-in with the new James Bond movies\n*'''Year 2000''' - a limited edition P99 fabricated to commemorate the new millennium. 2000 of these were made to reciprocate the year for which it was issued.\n*'''P99 TA''' - a model prepared for the police tryouts in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 2002, featuring a single/double-action trigger with redesigned trigger guard, center location ambidextrous decocker and an early ambidextrous slide catch as well as the removal of the \"captured\" accessory rail in favor of a standard \"open\" rail system. Lastly, this model has new contours on the lower frame just ahead of the disassembly clasp, just before the accessory rails to facilitate holstering.<ref>Deutsches Waffen-Journal 12/2002</ref> Approximately fifty (50) P99 TAs were produced with less than 25 sold to the public (10 imported to the U.S.).{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Fabryka Broni Radom P99 RAD===\n[[File:Walther P99RAD PICT0081.jpg|thumb|right|P99 RAD made by Fabryka Broni Radom.]]\n\nThe '''P99 RAD''' variant is made under license by [[\u0141ucznik Arms Factory|Fabryka Broni Radom]] in Poland and marketed as a military sidearm proposition.<ref>[http://en.fabrykabroni.pl/img/karta_ANG_RAD.pdf RAD Personal Semiautomatic Pistol] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726003122/http://en.fabrykabroni.pl/img/karta_ANG_RAD.pdf |date=2011-07-26 }}</ref>\n\nThe P99 RAD grip shape and texture has been altered when compared to the P99 variants and an extended ambidextrous slide release and extended ambidextrous magazine release levers are fitted as a standard feature. Besides that the slide shape, dimensions and serrations have been altered. The standard sights are high-contrast 3 dot sights with contrast enhancements that have been painted with afterglow paint that can aid target acquisition under unfavourable lighting conditions. As an option the P99 RAD can also be fitted with self-luminous tritium [[Iron sight#Contrast enhancements|night sights]]. The P99 RAD pistol is available with the DAO trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately {{convert|39|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} and the QA trigger mechanism with a trigger pull of approximately {{convert|32|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}}. The grip frame has an integrated mounting [[MIL-STD-1913]] (Picatinny) rail for attaching tactical lights and laser sighting devices.\n\nMany of the alterations found in the P99 RAD variant were applied in the [[Walther PPQ]] pistol introduced in 2011.\n\n===P99Q police pistol===\n[[File:Walther P99Q.jpg|thumb|P99Q police duty pistol.]]\n\nMany of the alterations found in the Fabryka Broni Radom P99 RAD variant were also applied in the Walther P99Q pistol.

The SW99 is also available in [[.45 ACP]], while the P99 is not. The P99 was developed and introduced prior to the SW99.  Walther introduced a color-coding system to denote the difference between early generation SW99 and P99 magazines, with the latest generation being bright blue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAll 9mm P99s have always been completely German-made. Some P99 .40 components are manufactured under license by S&W. The barrel, slide and frame of all 100% German-manufactured P99s bear an \"Eagle over N\" proof mark of the German Proof House at Ulm. The mark indicates the pistol was test-fired with a Proof Load; the \"N\" stands for nitrocellulose.\n\n===Magnum Research MR Eagle===\nThe [[Magnum Research]] MR Eagle was another joint American/German venture, with Walther producing a black polymer frame with integral steel rails similar to the P99 series, only differing in grip texture and with the short magazine release paddles from the first gen P99. For its part, Magnum Research Inc. produced a 416 stainless steel slide and [[41xx steel|4140 CrMo steel]] barrel in their Pillager, MN factory in the United States. The MR Eagle series pistols were available in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum (MR9) and .40 S&W (MR40).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-MR9-Eagle-15-Round.asp|title=MR9 Eagle, 15 Round|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-MR40-Eagle-11-Round.asp|title=MR40 Eagle, 11 Round|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.

Walther also took the opportunity to redesign the slide so the user could grip it more easily, and notably, change the proprietary accessory rail to a [[Weaver rail mount|Weaver]] type.\nSome models built in 2005 and all later models received one more design change, an elongated magazine release.<ref name=\"Walther P99 at World Guns\"/>\n\n==Design details==\n[[File:WP99 3.jpg|thumb|left|Walther P99 with the slide locked back displaying its vertical barrel tilt.]]\n\nThe Walther P99 is a [[Recoil operation#Short recoil operation|short recoil]]-operated locked breech [[semi-automatic pistol]] that uses a modified [[John Browning|Browning]] cam-lock system adapted from the [[Browning Hi-Power|Hi-Power]] pistol. The P99 has a glassfiber-reinforced polymer frame and steel slide assembly. It can be broken down into its main parts or field stripped with a take down catch without the help of tools.\n\nIt uses an internal [[Trigger (firearms)#Pre-set .28striker or hammer.29|striker]] as opposed to an external [[hammer (firearms)|hammer]], with a red-painted striker tip that protrudes from rear of the [[pistol slide|slide]] when the gun is cocked, as well as a [[loaded chamber indicator]] on the right side of the slide.\n\nThe original, first-generation P99 had a traditional [[Trigger (firearms)#Double-action.2Fsingle-action|Double-Action/Single-Action trigger]] with a [[De-cocker#Decocker|decocker]]. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon loading, the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti-Stress mode is activated, where the striker is cocked but the trigger has the length of pull of the double-action mode. The trigger travel is 14&nbsp;mm (0.55&nbsp;in) long in the Anti-Stress mode, but the most of the length is slack and is similar in feel to a two-stage rifle trigger. At the end of the anti-stress travel, the pressure noticeably increases to 4.5 pounds and the user experiences a crisp trigger break and an extremely short trigger reset of about .1 inches.  All subsequent shots are fired in standard single action mode, where the slack on the trigger is much shorter, but the point of release feels the same.  In order to deactivate Single-Action or Anti-Stress mode, the user can manipulate the decocker button on the top of the slide, just in front of the rear sights.  When decocked from Single-Action mode, the trigger will reset to the full length of its pull.  The pistol is now in Double-Action mode with a pull 7.9 pounds for the full length of the .55 inch pull. After firing the first shot in Double-Action, the pistol will be fired in Single-Action for all subsequent shots.\n\nThe striker protrudes visibly and palpably from the back of the slide when the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.\nIt should however be noted that the striker of the second generation P99QA variant does not protrude from the back of the slide, unless fired, as the firearm is in a constant partially cocked state.\n\nErgonomics were a key focus in the design of the firearm, and as a result, three interchangeable grip backstraps are included (small, medium and large)  to accommodate various hand shapes and sizes; this feature permits most shooters a comfortable and efficient grip on the firearm. This adaptable grip was innovative at the time the P99 was introduced.\n\nThe slide and other metal parts of the pistol are [[Tenifer]] treated (a [[nitriding]] process also used on [[Glock]] pistols). The Tenifer finish is between {{convert|0.04|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} and {{convert|0.05|mm|in|abbr=on|3}} in thickness, and is characterized by extreme resistance to wear and corrosion; it penetrates the metal, and treated parts have similar properties even below the surface to a certain depth.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\">Kasler, 137</ref> The Tenifer process produces a matte gray-colored, non-glare surface with a 64 [[Rockwell scale|Rockwell C]] hardness rating and a 99% resistance to [[seawater|salt water]] corrosion (which meets or exceeds [[stainless steel]] specifications),<ref name=\"Kokalis_321\">Kokalis, 321</ref> making the P99 particularly suitable for individuals carrying the pistol [[Concealed carry in the United States|concealed]] as the highly chloride-resistant finish allows the pistol to better endure the effects of perspiration.<ref name=\"Kasler_137\"/>\n\nThe P99 features four internal safeties, [[iron sights]] adjustable for both [[windage]] and [[elevation (ballistics)|elevation]], tool-less take down, and an [[ambidextrous]] [[magazine (firearms)|magazine]] release incorporated into the [[trigger guard]]. The lower forward edge of the frame also known as the dust cover has a mounting-bracket or [[Rail Integration System|rail interface system]] for attaching accessories, such as a [[tactical light]] or [[Laser applications#Laser sight|laser sight]].\n\nThe P99 feeds from staggered-column or double-stack [[Magazine (firearms)|magazine]]s of varying capacity. Walther also offers staggered-column magazines with a +2 baseplate that add 2 rounds to the magazine capacity at the expense of extending the grip and the pistol height by approximately {{convert|18|mm|abbr=on|1}}.\n\nThe .40 S&W caliber models incorporate a slightly larger slide in order to preserve the same recoil spring assembly used in its 9mm counterpart. The P99 is available in 4 colorations; a black frame with a black slide, a black frame with a titanium-coated slide, a military olive-drab frame with a black slide, and a desert tan frame with black slide. All three of these finishes incorporate the same black grip inserts that come with every P99.

In Double-Action mode the internal striker is at rest with no pre-load and the trigger travel is 14&nbsp;mm (0.55&nbsp;in) long at approximately {{convert|38|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull. When the slide is racked completely to the rear upon (re)loading, the internal striker is manually pre-cocked to Single-Action mode and the trigger remains in the forward position for the first shot and the Anti Stress mode is activated. The trigger travel is 14&nbsp;mm (0.55&nbsp;in) long in the Anti Stress mode at approximately {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull. On all subsequent shots, the P99AS is automatically pre-cocked and the trigger travel is reduced to 8&nbsp;mm (0.3&nbsp;in) at the same {{convert|20|N|lb-f|1|lk=on|abbr=on}} trigger pull. For manually deactivating the Anti Stress mode and setting the pistol to Double-Action mode the P99AS features a decock key or knob on the slide. The Anti Stress mode can also be manually activated by moving the slide approximately 10&nbsp;mm (0.4&nbsp;in) back.<ref name=\"Walther P99 flyer\">[http://www.carl-walther.de/files/pdf/P99E.pdf Walther P99 flyer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110523012156/http://www.carl-walther.de/files/pdf/P99E.pdf |date=2011-05-23 }}</ref> The P99AS is still in production today.\n\n===P99DAO (Double Action Only)===\nThe P99DAO is similar to the previously produced P990 Double Action Only variant.<ref>[http://www.politieparcours.eu/PDF%20files/Sam156.pdf Het nieuwe politie pistool deel 1, SAM Wapenmagazine 156]</ref> The internal striker is at rest with no pre-load.

The SW99 is also available in [[.45 ACP]], while the P99 is not. The P99 was developed and introduced prior to the SW99.  Walther introduced a color-coding system to denote the difference between early generation SW99 and P99 magazines, with the latest generation being bright blue.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nAll 9mm P99s have always been completely German-made. Some P99 .40 components are manufactured under license by S&W. The barrel, slide and frame of all 100% German-manufactured P99s bear an \"Eagle over N\" proof mark of the German Proof House at Ulm. The mark indicates the pistol was test-fired with a Proof Load; the \"N\" stands for nitrocellulose.\n\n===Magnum Research MR Eagle===\nThe [[Magnum Research]] MR Eagle was another joint American/German venture, with Walther producing a black polymer frame with integral steel rails similar to the P99 series, only differing in grip texture and with the short magazine release paddles from the first gen P99. For its part, Magnum Research Inc. produced a 416 stainless steel slide and [[41xx steel|4140 CrMo steel]] barrel in their Pillager, MN factory in the United States. The MR Eagle series pistols were available in 9\u00d719mm Parabellum (MR9) and .40 S&W (MR40).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-MR9-Eagle-15-Round.asp|title=MR9 Eagle, 15 Round|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.magnumresearch.com/Firearms/Magnum-Research-MR40-Eagle-11-Round.asp|title=MR40 Eagle, 11 Round|publisher=|accessdate=24 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Users==\n<!--READ FIRST: This section is for cited entries only.
