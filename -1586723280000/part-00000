Site 1 is in the bottom left corner, site 2 in the top right, and site 3 in the bottom right.\n}}\n'''Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase''' (also '''pyruvate dehydrogenase complex kinase''', '''PDC kinase''', or '''PDK'''; {{EC number|2.7.11.2}}) is a [[kinase]] [[enzyme]] which acts to inactivate the enzyme [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]]  by [[phosphorylate|phosphorylating]] it using [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]].\n\nPDK thus participates in the regulation of the [[pyruvate dehydrogenase complex]] of which pyruvate dehydrogenase is the first component. Both PDK and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are located in the [[mitochondrial matrix]] of [[eukaryote]]s. The complex acts to convert [[pyruvate]] (a product of [[glycolysis]] in the [[cytosol]]) to [[acetyl-coA]], which is then oxidized in the mitochondria to produce energy, in the [[citric acid cycle]]. By [[Downregulation and upregulation|downregulating]] the activity of this complex, PDK will decrease the oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria and increase the conversion of pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate]] in the cytosol.\n\nThe opposite action of PDK, namely the dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is catalyzed by a [[phosphoprotein phosphatase]] called [[pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase]].\n\n(Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase should not be confused with [[Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1]], which is also sometimes known as \"PDK1\".)\n\n==Phosphorylation Sites==\n\nPDK can phosphorylate a [[serine]] residue on [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] at three possible sites. Some evidence has shown that phosphorylation at site 1 will nearly completely deactivate the enzyme while phosphorylation at sites 2 and 3 had only a small contribution to complex inactivation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeaman SJ, Hutcheson ET, Roche TE, Pettit FH, Brown JR, Reed LJ, Watson DC, Dixon GH | title = Sites of phosphorylation on pyruvate dehydrogenase from bovine kidney and heart | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 2364\u201370 | date = June 1978 | pmid = 678513 | doi = 10.1021/bi00605a017 }}</ref> Therefore, it is phosphorylation at site 1 that is responsible for pyruvate dehydrogenase deactivation.\n\n==Isozymes==\nThere are four known [[isozymes]] of PDK in humans:\n* [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1|PDK1]]\n* [[PDK2]]\n* [[PDK3]]\n* [[PDK4]]\n\nThe primary sequencing between the four isozymes are conserved with 70% identity.

The isozymes have different activity and phosphorylation rates at each site. At site 1 in order from fastest to slowest, PDK2 > PDK4 \u2248 PDK1 > PDK3. For site 2, PDK3 > PDK4 > PDK2 > PDK1. Only PDK1 can phosphorylate site 3.

Both PDK and the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex are located in the [[mitochondrial matrix]] of [[eukaryote]]s. The complex acts to convert [[pyruvate]] (a product of [[glycolysis]] in the [[cytosol]]) to [[acetyl-coA]], which is then oxidized in the mitochondria to produce energy, in the [[citric acid cycle]]. By downregulating the activity of this complex, PDK will decrease the oxidation of pyruvate in mitochondria and increase the conversion of pyruvate to [[lactic acid|lactate]] in the cytosol.\n\nThe opposite action of PDK, namely the dephosphorylation and activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase, is catalyzed by a [[phosphoprotein phosphatase]] called [[pyruvate dehydrogenase phosphatase]].\n\n(Pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase should not be confused with [[Phosphoinositide-dependent kinase-1]], which is also sometimes known as \"PDK1\".)\n\n==Phosphorylation Sites==\n\nPDK can phosphorylate a [[serine]] residue on [[pyruvate dehydrogenase]] at three possible sites. Some evidence has shown that phosphorylation at site 1 will nearly completely deactivate the enzyme while phosphorylation at sites 2 and 3 had only a small contribution to complex inactivation.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Yeaman SJ, Hutcheson ET, Roche TE, Pettit FH, Brown JR, Reed LJ, Watson DC, Dixon GH | title = Sites of phosphorylation on pyruvate dehydrogenase from bovine kidney and heart | journal = Biochemistry | volume = 17 | issue = 12 | pages = 2364\u201370 | date = June 1978 | pmid = 678513 | doi = 10.1021/bi00605a017 }}</ref> Therefore, it is phosphorylation at site 1 that is responsible for pyruvate dehydrogenase deactivation.\n\n==Isozymes==\nThere are four known [[isozymes]] of PDK in humans:\n* [[Pyruvate dehydrogenase lipoamide kinase isozyme 1|PDK1]]\n* [[PDK2]]\n* [[PDK3]]\n* [[PDK4]]\n\nThe primary sequencing between the four isozymes are conserved with 70% identity.

A minister of Information and documentation in the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London, he upheld its legal continuity in the struggle for the restoration of Poland as a [[sovereign state]], until his death.\n\n==Early Life==\nPragier was born into a well to do family of Jewish descent. His father, Stanis\u0142aw, was a medical practitioner and his mother, J\u00f3zefa was a member of the Szancer family. After home education in Warsaw he was sent as a boarder to the prestigious [[Bart\u0142omiej Nowodworski High School|St Anne's Academy]] in Krak\u00f3w where [[Jozef Retinger]] would have been a younger contemporary and where he joined the left leaning youth organisation, \"Promie\u0144\". He graduated from high school in 1904 and went on to the [[Jagiellonian University Medical College]] and joined the socialist \"Sp\u00f3jna\" group. He was allied to the Warsaw-based [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]]. After a year he transferred to the medical department of the [[University of Zurich]], where he was a member of the PPS abroad and soon became its leader. After the 1906 split in the PPS he was active in the [[Polish Socialist Party - Left]] faction.<ref>{{cite web|title = Adam Szymon Pragier|author=Kocha\u0144ski, Aleksander|url=https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/adam-szymon-pragier|publisher=www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1907\u20131908 he was editor of the review, \"My\u015bl Socjalistyczna\u201d - (Socialist Thought). Having obtained a basic medical degree to satisfy his parents, he switched to his abiding interest, political economy, and obtained his [[PhD]] at Zurich University in 1910 with a thesis in German, entitled ''Die Produktivgenossenschaften der schweizerischen Arbeiter'' (Manufacturing Cooperatives run by Swiss Workers). In 1914 he volunteered for the Polish Legions, but was discharged from service owing to a heart complaint. After convalescing he was called up by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to serve at a garrison in [[Ostrawa, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Ostrawa]]. In 1918 he became a member of the [[Polish Military Organisation]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\nIn April 1919 he rejoined the PPS. That same year he became a professor at the Free Polish University. Between 1922\u20131930 he was elected to the [[Sejm]] during the first phase (1922\u20131927), followed by re-election to the second phase (1928\u20131930). \n\nFrom 1921\u20131937 he was a member of the Executive Council of the PPS. In 1930 he was arrested along with a dozen other socialist leaders and held at the [[Brest Fortress]] as part of the [[Sanation]] government's manoeuvre to clamp down on the opposition, accusing them of an attempted coup. At the [[Brest trials]] he was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. However he was given the option of going into exile. Between 1933\u20131935 he was exiled in [[Paris]], then returned to Poland and gave himself up for incarceration which was commuted to several months during 1935.<ref name=\"PaczkowskiCave2003\">{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Paczkowski|author2=Jane Cave|title=The spring will be ours: Poland and the Poles from occupation to freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoKQWem2yl4C&pg=PA28|accessdate=13 November 2011|year=2003|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02308-3|page=28-}}</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Poland and exile==\nFollowing the [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939, he was once again in France from where he escaped to the [[United Kingdom]]. He participated in the formation on 30 September 1939 of the Second [[Wladyslaw Sikorski]] government to ensure the continuity of the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s authority after the internment in the [[Kingdom of Romania]] of President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] and his government on 18th September 1939. \n\nFrom 3rd November 1942 he was a member of the Polish [[Polish National Council]] which acted in place of an elected parliament. Between 1944\u20131949 he was Minister of Information in the administrations led by [[Tomasz Arciszewski]] and by [[Tadeusz Komorowski]]. On the termination of President [[August Zaleski]]'s term of office he sided with him in opposition to the [[Rada Trzech]] (Council of Three) and remained loyal to him to the end, in spite of their fundamental political differences. During 1949\u20131951 he was recalled to the Polish National Council.

A minister of Information and documentation in the [[Polish government-in-exile]] in London, he upheld its legal continuity in the struggle for the restoration of Poland as a [[sovereign state]], until his death.\n\n==Early Life==\nPragier was born into a well to do family of Jewish descent. His father, Stanis\u0142aw, was a medical practitioner and his mother, J\u00f3zefa was a member of the Szancer family. After home education in Warsaw he was sent as a boarder to the prestigious [[Bart\u0142omiej Nowodworski High School|St Anne's Academy]] in Krak\u00f3w where [[Jozef Retinger]] would have been a contemporary and where he joined the left leaning youth organisation, \"Promie\u0144\". He graduated from high school in 1904 and went on to the [[Jagiellonian University Medical College]] and joined the socialist \"Sp\u00f3jna\" group. He was allied to the Warsaw-based [[Polish Socialist Party|PPS]]. After a year he transferred to the medical department of [[University of Zurich]], where he was a member of the PPS abroad and soon became its leader. After the 1906 split in the PPS he was active in the [[Polish Socialist Party - Left]] faction.<ref>{{cite web|title = Adam Szymon Pragier|author=Kocha\u0144ski, Aleksander|url=https://www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl/a/biografia/adam-szymon-pragier|publisher=www.ipsb.nina.gov.pl|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1907\u20131908 he was editor of the review, \"My\u015bl Socjalistyczna\u201d - (Socialist Thought). Having obtained a basic medical degree to satisfy his parents, he switched to his abiding interest, political economy, and obtained his [[PhD]] at Zurich University in 1910 with a thesis in German, entitled ''Die Produktivgenossenschaften der schweizerischen Arbeiter'' (Manufacturing Cooperatives run by Swiss Workers). In 1914 he volunteered for the Polish Legions, but was discharged from service owing to a heart complaint. After convalescing he was called up by the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] to serve at a garrison in [[Ostrawa, Lower Silesian Voivodeship|Ostrawa]]. In 1918 he became a member of the [[Polish Military Organisation]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]].\n\nIn April 1919 he rejoined the PPS. That same year he became a professor at the Free Polish University. Between 1922\u20131930 he was elected to the [[Sejm]] during the first phase (1922\u20131927), followed by re-election to the second phase (1928\u20131930). \n\nFrom 1921\u20131937 he was a member of the Executive Council of the PPS. In 1930 he was arrested along with a dozen other socialist leaders and held at the [[Brest Fortress]] as part of the [[Sanation]] government's manoeuvre to clamp down on the opposition, accusing them of an attempted coup. At the [[Brest trials]] he was convicted and sentenced to three years in prison. However he was given the option of going into exile. Between 1933\u20131935 he was exiled in [[Paris]], then returned to Poland and gave himself up for incarceration which was commuted to several months during 1935.<ref name=\"PaczkowskiCave2003\">{{cite book|author1=Andrzej Paczkowski|author2=Jane Cave|title=The spring will be ours: Poland and the Poles from occupation to freedom|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoKQWem2yl4C&pg=PA28|accessdate=13 November 2011|year=2003|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02308-3|page=28-}}</ref>\n\n==Invasion of Poland and exile==\nFollowing the [[German invasion of Poland|German]] and [[Soviet invasion of Poland]] in 1939, he was once again in France from where he escaped to the [[United Kingdom]]. He participated in the formation on 30 September 1939 of the Second [[Wladyslaw Sikorski]] government to ensure the continuity of the [[Second Polish Republic]]'s authority after the internment in the [[Kingdom of Romania]] of President [[Ignacy Mo\u015bcicki]] and his government on 18th September 1939. \n\nFrom 3rd November 1942 he was a member of the Polish [[Polish National Council]] which acted in place of an elected parliament. Between 1944\u20131949 he was Minister of Information in the administrations led by [[Tomasz Arciszewski]] and by [[Tadeusz Komorowski]]. On the termination of President [[August Zaleski]]'s term of office he sided with him in opposition to the [[Rada Trzech]] (Council of Three) and remained loyal to him to the end, in spite of their fundamental political differences. During 1949\u20131951 he was recalled to the Polish National Council. Between 1954 and 1970 he was on the Council of the Government in exile, serving as its chairman between 1963 and 1968.\n\nBetween 1941\u20131947 he was a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee of the PPS.

Bell considered it his most important invention. The device allowed for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[sound]] on a beam of [[light]].

This contrasts with using solids such as [[optical fiber cable]].\n\nThe technology is useful where the physical connections are impractical due to high costs or other considerations.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Photophony1.jpg|thumb|A photophone receiver and headset, one half of Bell and Tainter's optical telecommunication system of 1880]]\n\n[[Optical communication]]s, in various forms, have been used for thousands of years.

Bell considered it his most important invention. The device allowed for the [[transmission (telecommunications)|transmission]] of [[sound]] on a beam of [[light]]. On June 3, 1880, Bell conducted the world's first wireless [[telephone]] transmission between two buildings, some 213&nbsp;meters (700&nbsp;feet) apart.<ref>{{cite book |author= Mary Kay Carson |title=Alexander Graham Bell: Giving Voice To The World |publisher=Sterling Publishing |location= New York |year=2007 |series=Sterling Biographies |pages=[https://archive.org/details/alexandergrahamb0000cars/page/76 76]\u201378 |isbn=978-1-4027-3230-0 |url=https://archive.org/details/alexandergrahamb0000cars |url-access= registration }}</ref><ref>\n{{cite journal |author= Alexander Graham Bell |title= On the Production and Reproduction of Sound by Light |journal= American Journal of Science |series=Third Series |volume= XX |number= 118 |date= October 1880 |pages= 305\u2013324|author-link= Alexander Graham Bell }} also published as \"Selenium and the Photophone\" in ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', September 1880.</ref>\nIts first practical use came in military communication systems many decades later, first for optical telegraphy.

Optical telephone communications were tested at the end of the war, but not introduced at troop level. In addition, special blinkger\u00e4ts were used for communication with airplanes, balloons, and tanks, with varying success.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\nA major technological step was to replace the Morse code by modulating optical waves in speech transmission. [[Carl Zeiss AG|Carl Zeiss, Jena]] developed the ''{{lang|de|Lichtsprechger\u00e4t}} 80/80'' (literal translation: optical speaking device) that the German army used in their World War&nbsp;II anti-aircraft defense units, or in bunkers at the [[Atlantic Wall]].<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.laud.no/ww2/lispr/lispr2.htm |title= German, WWII, WW2, Lichtsprechger\u00e4t 80/80 |publisher= LAUD Electronic Design AS |accessdate= June 28, 2011 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110724181528/http://www.laud.no/ww2/lispr/lispr2.htm |archivedate= July 24, 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe invention of [[laser]]s in the 1960s revolutionized free space optics. Military organizations were particularly interested and boosted their development. However, the technology lost market momentum when the installation of [[optical fiber]] networks for civilian uses was at its peak.\n\nMany simple and inexpensive consumer [[remote control]]s use low-speed communication using [[infrared]] (IR) light. This is known as [[consumer IR]] technologies.\n\n== Usage and technologies ==\nFree-space point-to-point optical links can be implemented using infrared laser light, although low-data-rate communication over short distances is possible using [[Light-emitting diode|LEDs]]. [[Infrared Data Association]] (IrDA) technology is a very simple form of free-space optical communications. On the communications side the FSO technology is considered as a part of the [[optical wireless communications]] applications.

Tintypes enjoyed their widest use during the 1860s and 1870s, but lesser use of the medium persisted into the early 20th century and it has been revived as a novelty and fine art form in the 21st.\n\nTintype portraits were at first usually made in a formal photographic studio, like [[daguerreotype]]s and other early types of photographs, but later they were most commonly made by photographers working in booths or the open air at [[fair]]s and [[carnival]]s, as well as by itinerant sidewalk photographers. Because the lacquered iron support (there is no actual [[tin]] used) was resilient and did not need drying, a tintype could be [[photographic processing|developed and fixed]] and handed to the customer only a few minutes after the picture had been taken.\n\nThe tintype photograph saw more uses and captured a wider variety of settings and subjects than any other photographic type. It was introduced while the daguerreotype was still popular, though its primary competition would have been the [[ambrotype]].\n\nThe tintype saw the Civil War come and go, documenting the individual soldier and horrific battle scenes. It captured scenes from the Wild West, as it was easy to produce by itinerant photographers working out of covered wagons.\n\nIt began losing artistic and commercial ground to higher quality [[albumen print]]s on paper in the mid-1860s, yet survived for well over another 40 years, living mostly as a carnival novelty.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phototree.com/id_tin.htm|title=Tintype \u2013 19th Century Photographs|website=www.phototree.com}}</ref>\n\nThe tintype's immediate predecessor, the [[ambrotype]], was done by the same process of using a sheet of [[glass]] as the support. The glass was either of a dark color or provided with a black backing so that, as with a tintype, the underexposed [[Negative (photography)|negative image]] in the emulsion appeared as a positive. Tintypes were sturdy and did not require mounting in a protective hard case like ambrotypes and daguerreotypes.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\nThere are two historic tintype processes: wet and dry. In the wet process, a [[collodion]] [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]] containing suspended [[silver halide]] crystals had to be formed on the plate just before it was exposed in the camera while still wet. Chemical treatment then reduced the crystals to microscopic particles of metallic silver in proportion to the intensity and duration of their exposure to light, resulting in a visible image. The later and more convenient dry process was similar but used a gelatin emulsion which could be applied to the plate long before use and exposed in the camera dry.\n\nIn both processes, a very [[Exposure (photography)|underexposed]] [[negative (photography)|negative]] image was produced in the emulsion. Its densest areas, corresponding to the lightest parts of the subject, appeared gray by reflected light. The areas with the least amount of silver, corresponding to the darkest areas of the subject, were essentially transparent and appeared black when seen against the dark background provided by the lacquer. The image as a whole therefore appeared to be a dull-toned positive.<ref name=\"Rinhart\">{{cite book |last1=Rinhart |first1=Floyd |last2=Rinhart |first2=Marion |year=1990 |title=The American Tintype |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=978-0-8142-0806-9}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}<ref name=\"AboutTintypes\">[http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/what-do-you-know-about-tintypes \"What Do You Know About Tintypes?\"], Ohio Historical Society Collections Blog, 2011-08-05.</ref> This ability to employ underexposed images allowed shorter exposure times to be used, a great advantage in [[portrait photography|portraiture]].\n\nTo obtain as light-toned an image as possible, [[potassium cyanide]] was normally employed as the [[photographic fixer]]. It was perhaps the most acutely hazardous of all the several highly toxic chemicals originally used in this and many other early photographic processes.\n\nOne unusual piece of tintype equipment was a twelve-lensed camera that could make a dozen {{convert|3/4|x|1|in|mm|adj=on}} \"gem\" portraits with one exposure, developed in 1858.<ref name=\"Rinhart\" /> Portrait sizes ranged from gem-size to {{convert|11|x|14|in|mm|abbr=on}}. From about 1865 to 1910, the most popular size, called \"Bon-ton\", ranged from {{convert|2+3/8|x|3+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|x|5+3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Rinhart\" />\n\nEach tintype is usually a camera original, so the image is usually a mirror image, reversed left to right from reality. Sometimes the camera was fitted with a mirror or right-angle prism so that the end result would be right-reading.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pease's Nantasket Tintype Gallery group portrait.png|thumb|right|300px|Tintype portrait in a paper mat, taken at Pease's Nantasket Tintype Gallery, circa 1900]]\nThe process was first described by Adolphe-Alexandre Martin in [[France]] in 1853. In 1856 it was patented by [[Hamilton Lanphere Smith|Hamilton Smith]] in the [[United States]] and by William Kloen in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was first called ''melainotype'', then ''ferrotype'' by a rival manufacturer of the iron plates used, then finally ''tintype''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peres |first=Michael R. |year=2017 |title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography |publisher=FOCAL |page=32 |isbn=978-1-138-29857-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Ambrotype as a precursor ===\nThe [[ambrotype]] was the first use of the wet-plate [[collodion process]] as a positive image. Such collodion glass positives had been invented by [[Frederick Scott Archer]] in 1851. Although it is a widely held belief [[James Ambrose Cutting]] might have named the process after himself, in actuality, \"ambrotype\" was first coined by [[Marcus Aurelius Root]], a well known daguerreotypist, in his gallery as documented in the 1864 book <I>The Camera and the Pencil</I> as follows <ref>Root, Marcus. <I>The Camera and the Pencil; or the Heliographic Art, its theory and practice in all its branches; e.g.-Daguerreotypy, photography, &c\".</I> Philadelphia, D. Appleton & Co., N.Y., 1864, pp. 372-373</ref>\n\nThe tintype was essentially a variant of the ambrotype, replacing the latter's glass plate with a thin sheet of [[japanned]] iron (hence ''ferro''). Ambrotypes often exhibit some flaking of their black back coating, cracking or detachment of the image-bearing emulsion layer, or other deterioration, but the image layer on a tintype has proven to be typically very durable.\n\n=== Success of the tintype ===\nCompared to their most important predecessor, the [[daguerreotype]], tintypes were not only very inexpensive, they were also relatively easy and quick to make.<ref name=\"AboutTintypes\" /> A photographer could prepare, expose, develop and varnish a tintype plate and have it ready for the customer in a few minutes. Although early tintypes were sometimes mounted in protective ornamental cases, like daguerreotypes and ambrotypes, uncased tintypes in simple paper mats were popular from the beginning. They were often later transferred into the precut openings provided in book-like photograph albums.\n\nOne or more hardy, lightweight, thin tintypes could be carried conveniently in a jacket pocket. They became very popular in the United States during the [[American Civil War]]. Although prints on paper (''see'' [[Carte de visite|cartes de visite]] and [[cabinet card]]s) soon displaced them as the most common type of photograph, the tintype process continued to enjoy considerable use throughout the 19th century and beyond, especially for casual portraiture by novelty and street photographers. Edward M. Estabrooke's book ''The Ferrotype and How to Make It'' (1872), and the introduction of low cost variants known as \"Gem ferrotypes\" helped to sustain the tintype's longevity.<ref>Marcel Safier (2015). \"[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~msafier/photos/tintypes.html The Gem and Carte de Visite Ferrotype].\" Accessed May 21, 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary usage ===\n[[File:Tintype 2018.jpg|thumb|a tintype attempt from 2018 ]]\nJohn Coffer, as profiled in a 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, travels by horse-drawn wagon creating tintypes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/garden/03tintype.html|title=Born 150 Years Too Late|last=Wadler|first=Joyce|date=3 August 2006|work=New York Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[California Air National Guard]] member and artist Ed Drew took the first tintypes in a [[Combat|war zone]] since the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]], when he photographed Air Force pilots serving in the [[Afghanistan War (2001-), major combat phase|Afghan War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petapixel.com/2013/07/10/these-are-the-first-combat-zone-tintype-photos-created-since-the-civil-war/|website=PetaPixel|title=These Are the First Combat Zone Tintype Photos Created Since the Civil War|date=July 10, 2013 |first= Michael|last=Zhang}}</ref>\n\nThe contemporary photographer Victoria Will created a series of tintypes of Hollywood stars at the 2014 and 2015 [[Sundance Film Festival]]s, including portraits of [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Nick Cave]], and [[Ewan McGregor]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Elizabeth|date=29 January 2015|title=49 Extraordinary Vintage Portraits of Hollywood's Most Famous Faces|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/g1969/exclusive-sundance-celebrity-tintype-portraits-2015/?slide=1|journal=Esquire|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The portraits were later published as a book.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Tyler|date=18 December 2017|title=This Photographer's New Book Celebrates the Lost Art of Tintype Portraits|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/g14436096/victoria-will-celebrity-tintype-portraits/|journal=Esquire|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nOrganisations such as the [https://penumbrafoundation.org penumbra foundation] still continue to use this technique, offering tintype photography sessions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2014/09/the-penumbra-foundation-proves-analog-isnt-dead-with-a-tintype-revival/|title=The Penumbra Foundation Proves Analog Isn\u2019t Dead With a Tintype Revival|date=2014-09-23|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Their work has been featured in the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Otis|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/reader-center/willets-point-workers-photography.html|title=Memorializing a New York Neighborhood With a 19th-Century Technique|date=2019-12-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/nyregion/willets-point-queens.html|title=Why the End Is Near for an Automotive Shantytown|date=2019-12-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Ferrotyping ==\n'''Ferrotyping''' is a finishing treatment applied to glossy [[photographic paper]] to bring out its reflective properties.

Because the lacquered iron support (there is no actual [[tin]] used) was resilient and did not need drying, a tintype could be [[photographic processing|developed and fixed]] and handed to the customer only a few minutes after the picture had been taken.\n\nThe tintype photograph saw more uses and captured a wider variety of settings and subjects than any other photographic type. It was introduced while the daguerreotype was still popular, though its primary competition would have been the [[ambrotype]].\n\nThe tintype saw the Civil War come and go, documenting the individual soldier and horrific battle scenes. It captured scenes from the Wild West, as it was easy to produce by itinerant photographers working out of covered wagons.\n\nIt began losing artistic and commercial ground to higher quality [[albumen print]]s on paper in the mid-1860s, yet survived for well over another 40 years, living mostly as a carnival novelty.\n<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phototree.com/id_tin.htm|title=Tintype \u2013 19th Century Photographs|website=www.phototree.com}}</ref>\n\nThe tintype's immediate predecessor, the [[ambrotype]], was done by the same process of using a sheet of [[glass]] as the support. The glass was either of a dark color or provided with a black backing so that, as with a tintype, the underexposed [[Negative (photography)|negative image]] in the emulsion appeared as a positive. Tintypes were sturdy and did not require mounting in a protective hard case like ambrotypes and daguerreotypes.\n\n== Technical details ==\n\nThere are two historic tintype processes: wet and dry. In the wet process, a [[collodion]] [[photographic emulsion|emulsion]] containing suspended [[silver halide]] crystals had to be formed on the plate just before it was exposed in the camera while still wet. Chemical treatment then reduced the crystals to microscopic particles of metallic silver in proportion to the intensity and duration of their exposure to light, resulting in a visible image. The later and more convenient dry process was similar but used a gelatin emulsion which could be applied to the plate long before use and exposed in the camera dry.\n\nIn both processes, a very [[Exposure (photography)|underexposed]] [[negative (photography)|negative]] image was produced in the emulsion. Its densest areas, corresponding to the lightest parts of the subject, appeared gray by reflected light. The areas with the least amount of silver, corresponding to the darkest areas of the subject, were essentially transparent and appeared black when seen against the dark background provided by the lacquer. The image as a whole therefore appeared to be a dull-toned positive.<ref name=\"Rinhart\">{{cite book |last1=Rinhart |first1=Floyd |last2=Rinhart |first2=Marion |year=1990 |title=The American Tintype |publisher=Ohio State University Press |isbn=978-0-8142-0806-9}}</ref>{{page needed|date=February 2018}}<ref name=\"AboutTintypes\">[http://ohiohistory.wordpress.com/2011/08/05/what-do-you-know-about-tintypes \"What Do You Know About Tintypes?\"], Ohio Historical Society Collections Blog, 2011-08-05.</ref> This ability to employ underexposed images allowed shorter exposure times to be used, a great advantage in [[portrait photography|portraiture]].\n\nTo obtain as light-toned an image as possible, [[potassium cyanide]] was normally employed as the [[photographic fixer]]. It was perhaps the most acutely hazardous of all the several highly toxic chemicals originally used in this and many other early photographic processes.\n\nOne unusual piece of tintype equipment was a twelve-lensed camera that could make a dozen {{convert|3/4|x|1|in|mm|adj=on}} \"gem\" portraits with one exposure, developed in 1858.<ref name=\"Rinhart\" /> Portrait sizes ranged from gem-size to {{convert|11|x|14|in|mm|abbr=on}}. From about 1865 to 1910, the most popular size, called \"Bon-ton\", ranged from {{convert|2+3/8|x|3+1/2|in|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|x|5+3/4|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Rinhart\" />\n\nEach tintype is usually a camera original, so the image is usually a mirror image, reversed left to right from reality. Sometimes the camera was fitted with a mirror or right-angle prism so that the end result would be right-reading.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Pease's Nantasket Tintype Gallery group portrait.png|thumb|right|300px|Tintype portrait in a paper mat, taken at Pease's Nantasket Tintype Gallery, circa 1900]]\nThe process was first described by Adolphe-Alexandre Martin in [[France]] in 1853. In 1856 it was patented by [[Hamilton Lanphere Smith|Hamilton Smith]] in the [[United States]] and by William Kloen in the [[United Kingdom]]. It was first called ''melainotype'', then ''ferrotype'' by a rival manufacturer of the iron plates used, then finally ''tintype''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Peres |first=Michael R. |year=2017 |title=The Focal Encyclopedia of Photography |publisher=FOCAL |page=32 |isbn=978-1-138-29857-6}}</ref>\n\n=== Ambrotype as a precursor ===\nThe [[ambrotype]] was the first use of the wet-plate [[collodion process]] as a positive image. Such collodion glass positives had been invented by [[Frederick Scott Archer]] in 1851 and the name Ambrotype was introduced in the [[United States]] by [[James Ambrose Cutting]] in 1854 when he patented a variation of Archer's original process.\n\nThe tintype was essentially a variant of the ambrotype, replacing the latter's glass plate with a thin sheet of [[japanned]] iron (hence ''ferro''). Ambrotypes often exhibit some flaking of their black back coating, cracking or detachment of the image-bearing emulsion layer, or other deterioration, but the image layer on a tintype has proven to be typically very durable.\n\n=== Success of the tintype ===\nCompared to their most important predecessor, the [[daguerreotype]], tintypes were not only very inexpensive, they were also relatively easy and quick to make.<ref name=\"AboutTintypes\" /> A photographer could prepare, expose, develop and varnish a tintype plate and have it ready for the customer in a few minutes. Although early tintypes were sometimes mounted in protective ornamental cases, like daguerreotypes and ambrotypes, uncased tintypes in simple paper mats were popular from the beginning. They were often later transferred into the precut openings provided in book-like photograph albums.\n\nOne or more hardy, lightweight, thin tintypes could be carried conveniently in a jacket pocket. They became very popular in the United States during the [[American Civil War]]. Although prints on paper (''see'' [[Carte de visite|cartes de visite]] and [[cabinet card]]s) soon displaced them as the most common type of photograph, the tintype process continued to enjoy considerable use throughout the 19th century and beyond, especially for casual portraiture by novelty and street photographers. Edward M. Estabrooke's book ''The Ferrotype and How to Make It'' (1872), and the introduction of low cost variants known as \"Gem ferrotypes\" helped to sustain the tintype's longevity.<ref>Marcel Safier (2015). \"[http://members.ozemail.com.au/~msafier/photos/tintypes.html The Gem and Carte de Visite Ferrotype].\" Accessed May 21, 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Contemporary usage ===\n[[File:Tintype 2018.jpg|thumb|a tintype attempt from 2018 ]]\nJohn Coffer, as profiled in a 2006 ''[[The New York Times|New York Times]]'' article, travels by horse-drawn wagon creating tintypes.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/03/garden/03tintype.html|title=Born 150 Years Too Late|last=Wadler|first=Joyce|date=3 August 2006|work=New York Times|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, [[California Air National Guard]] member and artist Ed Drew took the first tintypes in a [[Combat|war zone]] since the [[U.S. Civil War|Civil War]], when he photographed Air Force pilots serving in the [[Afghanistan War (2001-), major combat phase|Afghan War]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://petapixel.com/2013/07/10/these-are-the-first-combat-zone-tintype-photos-created-since-the-civil-war/|website=PetaPixel|title=These Are the First Combat Zone Tintype Photos Created Since the Civil War|date=July 10, 2013 |first= Michael|last=Zhang}}</ref>\n\nThe contemporary photographer Victoria Will created a series of tintypes of Hollywood stars at the 2014 and 2015 [[Sundance Film Festival]]s, including portraits of [[Anne Hathaway]], [[Nick Cave]], and [[Ewan McGregor]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Griffin|first=Elizabeth|date=29 January 2015|title=49 Extraordinary Vintage Portraits of Hollywood's Most Famous Faces|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/g1969/exclusive-sundance-celebrity-tintype-portraits-2015/?slide=1|journal=Esquire|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref> The portraits were later published as a book.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Coates|first=Tyler|date=18 December 2017|title=This Photographer's New Book Celebrates the Lost Art of Tintype Portraits|url=https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/books/g14436096/victoria-will-celebrity-tintype-portraits/|journal=Esquire|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nOrganisations such as the [https://penumbrafoundation.org penumbra foundation] still continue to use this technique, offering tintype photography sessions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://observer.com/2014/09/the-penumbra-foundation-proves-analog-isnt-dead-with-a-tintype-revival/|title=The Penumbra Foundation Proves Analog Isn\u2019t Dead With a Tintype Revival|date=2014-09-23|website=Observer|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-07}}</ref> Their work has been featured in the ''New York Times''.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Otis|first=John|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/18/reader-center/willets-point-workers-photography.html|title=Memorializing a New York Neighborhood With a 19th-Century Technique|date=2019-12-18|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|last=Kilgannon|first=Corey|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/20/nyregion/willets-point-queens.html|title=Why the End Is Near for an Automotive Shantytown|date=2019-12-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2020-04-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n== Ferrotyping ==\n'''Ferrotyping''' is a finishing treatment applied to glossy [[photographic paper]] to bring out its reflective properties.
