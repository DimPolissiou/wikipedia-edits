Over a number of years however, an increasing proportion of countries' telecommunications administrations{{Snd}} together with their government and military users{{Snd}} have permitted Amateur Radio operation in the 5&nbsp;MHz area on a short or longer term basis, ranging from discrete channels to a frequency band allocation.\n\nAt the closing meeting of the 2015 [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC-15) on 27 November 2015, amongst the Final Acts signed into the International Radio Regulations was one approving \"A Worldwide Frequency Allocation of 5351.5&ndash;5366.5&nbsp;kHz to the Amateur Service on a secondary basis\".<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/world-radiocommunication-conference-approves-global-60-meter-allocation |title=World Radiocommunication Conference Approves Global 60 Meter Allocation! |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaru-r1.org/index.php/3-news/newsflash/1492-new-band-at-5-mhz |title=New Band at 5&nbsp;MHz |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[International Amateur Radio Union]] Region 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> The ITU's enhanced band allocation limits most amateurs to 15&nbsp;watts [[effective isotropic radiated power]] (EIRP), with some countries allowed up to 25&nbsp;W EIRP.<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\"/><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/>  The ITU allocation came into effect January 1, 2017,<ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/> after which each country's national administration must formally revise their rules to permit amateur operation.\n\nPrior to WRC-15, all 5&nbsp;MHz Amateur allocations made by individual administrations were in accordance with [http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/frr.htm Article 4.4] of the ITU Radio Regulations, which requires non-interference with other radio services. Where two-way amateur radio communication is authorized on 60&nbsp;m, it has generally been within the frequency range 5250&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz, but the whole of this range is not necessarily available and allocations vary significantly from country-to-country. This has been particularly true in latter years since the award at WRC-12 of the range 5250&ndash;5275&nbsp;kHz to the Radiolocation Service, thus effectively reducing the former frequency range down to 5275&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz.\n\nIn some countries the allocation is still channelized at present, whereas others have block or band allocations or a mixture. Voice operation is generally in [[single sideband|upper sideband]] (USB) mode to facilitate inter-communication by non-amateur service users if necessary. In the [[United States]] and its Dependencies, channelized USB is mandatory. Where channelization is used, the USB suppressed carrier frequency (a.k.a. 'dial' frequency) is normally 1.5&nbsp;kHz below the quoted channel frequency. For example, 5403.5&nbsp;kHz is the 'dial' frequency for the channel centered on 5405&nbsp;kHz.  The \"center\" of the channel is based on the assumption that the bandwidth of SSB transmissions are 3&nbsp;kHz, at most.  Transmitters that are capable of wider SSB bandwidths should be adjusted for 3&nbsp;kHz bandwidth or less so their emissions stay within the allocated channel.\n\nAmateur equipment made in [[Japan]] and surrounding countries often did not originally support the 60-meter allocation. However it is usually possible to modify such equipment to work correctly on these frequencies within the terms of the individual's licensing conditions. More recently, commercial amateur radio equipment manufactured in Asia has begun to include provision for 60&nbsp;m / 5&nbsp;MHz operation, following the WRC-15 decision.\n\n== International Regulatory Status and World Radiocommunication Conferences ==\nThe amateur radio service is unusual in the fact that it is regulated by international treaty. Worldwide amateur allocations are determined by the International Telecommunication Union<ref>http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx</ref> (ITU), which allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits,<ref>http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&link=rhome&lang=en</ref> develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect and strive to improve access to ICTs to underserved communities worldwide. This is done through successive World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) which take place approximately every 3{{Snd}} 5 years, when telecommunications administrations and organisations from all around the globe meet to make decisions on these elements.\n[[File:ITU 2.jpg|thumb|ITU headquarters, Geneva]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the ITU 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) on Friday 17 February 2012, Resolution 649 [COM6/12] (WRC12) was ratified as being placed on the Agenda for the following WRC in 2015 (WRC-15).

Less affected by [[Ionosphere|D-Layer]] absorption than 80&nbsp;m, the 60-meter (5&nbsp;MHz) band is an ideal candidate for [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave| Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)]], the most commonly used technique capable of providing seamless local-to-medium distance HF communications. Information about the [[critical frequency|Critical Frequency (foF2)]] of the [[Ionosphere]] at any one time is highly important for setting up and maintaining reliable NVIS radio links.

A number of these transmit 24/7 (but not all) and some personal beacons are activated as required.\n\nIn the United Kingdom (ITU Region 1) Only GB3ORK (Orkneys{{Snd}} IO89ka) is now active on 5290&nbsp;kHz. The timing of the transmission is every 15 minutes starting at 2 minutes after the hour ( i.e. 02, 17, 32 and 47 minutes ). GB3ORK transmits a [[WSJT (amateur radio software)#JT9|JT9A]] sequence in addition to stepped power levels. Originally three beacons transmitted sequentially on the hour and each subsequent 15 minutes primarily using CW. They were in transmission order  {{Snd}} GB3RAL, GB3WES and GB3ORK, from approximately southern, central and northern locations in the UK respectively. GB3WES closed down on March 11, 2020, when its Notice of Variation (i.e. licence) expired and in July 2017, the licence for 5&nbsp;MHz operation of the southern beacon GB3RAL was not renewed owing to site difficulties.  Details of the original British beacon network, including design and building, can be found on the [http://rsgb.org/main/operating/band-plans/hf/5mhz/uk-5-mhz-beacon-chain/ 5&nbsp;MHz beacon page] of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] (RSGB) website. \n\nOn the 5290&nbsp;kHz channel (5289.5&nbsp;kHz USB) also is the Danish (ITU Region 1) personal beacon OV1BCN<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oz1fjb.dk/page8.html |title=oz1fjb_dk{{Snd}} 5&nbsp;MHz.

The beacon transmits from Sursee (Locator: JN47be) using a half-wave dipole, configured for high-angle radiation as an NVIS 'fountain' type antenna at a height above ground of 0.12 of a wavelength. A reflector is placed beneath the antenna. The aim of the system is to explore the propagation conditions on 5&nbsp;MHz in the hills and valleys of Switzerland in relation to its possible suitability as an Emergency Communications band.

It is co-sited with the DK\u00d8WCY 30 and 80&nbsp;m beacons. Owing to considerations of the rising cost of electrical power, the operational schedule of DRA5 has changed and it no longer transmits over the full 24-hour period. It is currently operational 0400\u20132200 UTC during the Summertime period and 0500\u20132300 UTC during the Wintertime period.

High Power night time broadcasts have been utilized in exercises to provide information and instructions from the Government to Amateur radio operators across North America.  Government stations using these frequencies are authorized significantly more power than Amateurs.\n\nAs a part of preparation of justification for a 60-meter band, the ARRL organized a group of twelve amateur radio operators, most of whom had experience in trying to communicate with stations in the Caribbean to obtain eyewitness reports of hurricanes in that region.  The group was assigned by FCC WA2Xxx call signs and allowed to transmit on the 60-meter band as experimental stations. That group's report of conditions on that band became central to ARRL's request for the band for amateur use.  That initial effort stressed continuous communication with the Caribbean hurricane region and timely reports to the Miami National Hurricane Center to supplement other observations and to take emergency messages.  ARRL requested an article for its QST magazine from Charles Harpole, K4VUD and WA2Xxx, about the band's use, but that article was only placed briefly on the ARRL Internet site.  ARRL confirmed that their plan was to move away from hurricane and emergency uses of the band toward general amateur uses.  Harpole, as K4VUD near Orlando, Florida, made the first transatlantic two-way ham radio communication with a ham station near London; notice of that achievement was also suppressed by ARRL fearing FCC concern that the band become too rapidly a normal use amateur band {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n.\n\n==Countries with band allocations==\n\n'''Andorra''' (ITU Region 1): In June 2016 Andorran amateurs were permitted access to the new WRC-15 60&nbsp;m allocation from 5351.5 to 5366.5&nbsp;kHz on a Secondary basis with a maximum power of 15&nbsp;W EIRP; modes are permitted CW and SSB.

4.4,Trial Basis, or any combination of these.]]\n\nThe '''60-meter band''' or '''5&nbsp;MHz band''' is a relatively new [[amateur radio]] allocation, first introduced in 2002, that was originally only available in a few countries, such as the [[United States]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Norway]], [[Finland]], [[Denmark]], [[Ireland]] and [[Iceland]]. Over a number of years however, an increasing proportion of countries' telecommunications administrations{{Snd}} together with their government and military users{{Snd}} have permitted Amateur Radio operation in the 5&nbsp;MHz area on a short or longer term basis, ranging from discrete channels to a frequency band allocation.\n\nAt the closing meeting of the 2015 [[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] [[World Radiocommunication Conference]] (WRC-15) on 27 November 2015, amongst the Final Acts signed into the International Radio Regulations was one approving \"A Worldwide Frequency Allocation of 5351.5&ndash;5366.5&nbsp;kHz to the Amateur Service on a secondary basis\".<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\">{{cite web |url=http://www.arrl.org/news/world-radiocommunication-conference-approves-global-60-meter-allocation |title=World Radiocommunication Conference Approves Global 60 Meter Allocation! |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]] |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\">{{cite web |url=http://www.iaru-r1.org/index.php/3-news/newsflash/1492-new-band-at-5-mhz |title=New Band at 5&nbsp;MHz |date=November 18, 2015 |publisher=[[International Amateur Radio Union]] Region 1 |access-date=November 19, 2015}}</ref> The ITU's enhanced band allocation limits most amateurs to 15&nbsp;watts [[effective isotropic radiated power]] (EIRP), with some countries allowed up to 25&nbsp;W EIRP.<ref name=\"ARRL-WRC15_Approves_Band\"/><ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/>  The ITU allocation came into effect January 1, 2017,<ref name=\"IARU-R1_NewBand\"/> after which each country's national administration must formally revise their rules to permit amateur operation.\n\nPrior to WRC-15, all 5&nbsp;MHz Amateur allocations made by individual administrations were in accordance with [http://life.itu.int/radioclub/rr/frr.htm Article 4.4] of the ITU Radio Regulations, which requires non-interference with other radio services. Where two-way amateur radio communication is authorized on 60&nbsp;m, it has generally been within the frequency range 5250&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz, but the whole of this range is not necessarily available and allocations vary significantly from country-to-country. This has been particularly true in latter years since the award at WRC-12 of the range 5250&ndash;5275&nbsp;kHz to the Radiolocation Service, thus effectively reducing the former frequency range down to 5275&ndash;5450&nbsp;kHz.\n\nIn some countries the allocation is still channelized at present, whereas others have block or band allocations or a mixture. Voice operation is generally in [[single sideband|upper sideband]] (USB) mode to facilitate inter-communication by non-amateur service users if necessary. In the [[United States]] and its Dependencies, channelized USB is mandatory. Where channelization is used, the USB suppressed carrier frequency (a.k.a. 'dial' frequency) is normally 1.5&nbsp;kHz below the quoted channel frequency. For example, 5403.5&nbsp;kHz is the 'dial' frequency for the channel centered on 5405&nbsp;kHz.  The \"center\" of the channel is based on the assumption that the bandwidth of SSB transmissions are 3&nbsp;kHz, at most.  Transmitters that are capable of wider SSB bandwidths should be adjusted for 3&nbsp;kHz bandwidth or less so their emissions stay within the allocated channel.\n\nAmateur equipment made in [[Japan]] and surrounding countries often did not originally support the 60-meter allocation. However it is usually possible to modify such equipment to work correctly on these frequencies within the terms of the individual's licensing conditions. More recently, commercial amateur radio equipment manufactured in Asia has begun to include provision for 60&nbsp;m / 5&nbsp;MHz operation, following the WRC-15 decision.\n\n== International Regulatory Status and World Radiocommunication Conferences ==\nThe amateur radio service is unusual in the fact that it is regulated by international treaty. Worldwide amateur allocations are determined by the International Telecommunication Union<ref>http://www.itu.int/en/Pages/default.aspx</ref> (ITU), which allocates global radio spectrum and satellite orbits,<ref>http://www.itu.int/ITU-R/index.asp?category=information&link=rhome&lang=en</ref> develops the technical standards that ensure networks and technologies seamlessly interconnect and strive to improve access to ICTs to underserved communities worldwide. This is done through successive World Radiocommunication Conferences (WRCs) which take place approximately every 3{{Snd}} 5 years, when telecommunications administrations and organisations from all around the globe meet to make decisions on these elements.\n[[File:ITU 2.jpg|thumb|ITU headquarters, Geneva]]\n\nAt the conclusion of the ITU 2012 World Radiocommunication Conference (WRC-12) on Friday 17 February 2012, Resolution 649 [COM6/12] (WRC12) was ratified as being placed on the Agenda for the following WRC in 2015 (WRC-15). This resolution invited WRC-15 to consider \"The possibility of making an allocation of an appropriate amount of spectrum, not necessarily contiguous, to the amateur service on a secondary basis within the band 5250\u20135450&nbsp;kHz\".<ref name=\"ITU-649-20120601\">{{cite web |title=Resolution 649 (WRC-12){{Snd}} Possible allocation to the amateur service on a secondary basis at around 5,300&nbsp;kHz |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pub/itu-r/oth/0c/0a/R0C0A00000A0018PDFE.pdf |website=[[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]] |date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\nFollowing the decision at WRC-12 to implement a Radiolocation allocation from 5250 to 5275&nbsp;kHz, the candidate band for an amateur allocation at WRC-15 subsequently became truncated to the 5275 to 5450&nbsp;kHz sector.\n \nOn September 11, 2014, the National Telecommunications Agency of Brazil (ANATEL) announced its intention to propose an amateur service allocation from 5275 to 5450&nbsp;kHz in the 60&nbsp;m band at the next meeting of CITEL (Inter-American Telecommunication Commission).<ref>http://www.southgatearc.org/news/2014/september/brazil_proposes_5275_to_5450_khz.htm</ref> At the [https://www.citel.oas.org/en/Pages/default.aspx CITEL] Regional Conference held in M\u00e9rida City, Mexico in October 2014, the conference recognised\nan IAP (Inter-American Proposal) for a Secondary Amateur Allocation from 5275 to 5450&nbsp;kHz.

Less affected by [[Ionosphere|D-Layer]] absorption than 80&nbsp;m, the 60-meter (5&nbsp;MHz) band is an ideal candidate for [[Near Vertical Incidence Skywave| Near Vertical Incidence Skywave (NVIS)]], the most commonly used technique capable of providing seamless local-to-medium distance HF communications. Information about the [[critical frequency|Critical Frequency (foF2)]] of the [[Ionosphere]] at any one time is highly important for setting up and maintaining reliable NVIS radio links. This information can be found online from [[Ionogram]]s produced by local [[ionosonde]]s at this site<ref>{{cite web|url=http://car.uml.edu/common/DIDBFastStationList |title=DIDBase Station list |publisher=Car.uml.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-08-07}}</ref>\n\n==Propagation beacons==\nA number of amateur [[radio propagation beacon]]s are active on 5&nbsp;MHz, some of which produce a sequence of varying power levels in various transmission formats. A number of these transmit 24/7 (but not all) and some personal beacons are activated as required.\n\nIn the United Kingdom (ITU Region 1) Only GB3ORK (Orkneys{{Snd}} IO89ka) is now active on 5290&nbsp;kHz. The timing of the transmission is every 15 minutes starting at 2 minutes after the hour ( i.e. 02, 17, 32 and 47 minutes ). GB3ORK transmits a [[WSJT (amateur radio software)#JT9|JT9A]] sequence in addition to stepped power levels. Originally three beacons transmitted sequentially on the hour and each subsequent 15 minutes primarily using CW. They were in transmission order  {{Snd}} GB3RAL, GB3WES and GB3ORK, from approximately southern, central and northern locations in the UK respectively. GB3WES closed down on March 11, 2020, when its Notice of Variation (i.e. licence) expired and in July 2017, the licence for 5&nbsp;MHz operation of the southern beacon GB3RAL was not renewed owing to site difficulties.  Details of the original British beacon network, including design and building, can be found on the [http://rsgb.org/main/operating/band-plans/hf/5mhz/uk-5-mhz-beacon-chain/ 5&nbsp;MHz beacon page] of the [[Radio Society of Great Britain]] (RSGB) website. \n\nOn the 5290&nbsp;kHz channel (5289.5&nbsp;kHz USB) also is the Danish (ITU Region 1) personal beacon OV1BCN<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oz1fjb.dk/page8.html |title=oz1fjb_dk{{Snd}} 5&nbsp;MHz.

From Spring 2011, it has been in operation h24 and is sequenced to transmit 2 minutes after the UK beacons, (hr+ 04/19/34/49 min.), transmitting a USB-announcement, followed by CW + MT63 identifications. ''(Info: Lars, OZ1FJB)''\n\nThe South African Amateur Radio League{{Snd}} SARL{{Snd}} (ITU Region 1) As of May 2017, the South African 5&nbsp;MHz WSPR Cluster has two permanent beacons{{Snd}} currently ZS6SRL in Johannesburg (KG33wv) and ZS1OA (JF95fx) in Cape Town.<ref>http://www.amateurradio.org.za/propresearch.htm</ref> Although no longer operational, when SARL first announced its intention to have a 5&nbsp;MHz Beacon operational, the South African club KARTS{{Snd}} Kempton Park Amateur Radio and Technical Society commissioned a [[WSPR (Amateur radio software)|WSPR]] beacon callsign ZS6KTS (KG43cw), initially on 5250&nbsp;kHz. At a meeting during Summer 2014 with their regulator, ICASA (The Independent Communications Authority of South Africa), SARL reached an agreement to exchange their channel at 5250&nbsp;kHz for the more common beacon channel of 5290&nbsp;kHz.\n\nThe 60&nbsp;m band was released for amateur radio in Switzerland (ITU Region 1) in January 2017, however the Sursee Amateur Radio Club obtained earlier the necessary official authorizations from their [https://web.archive.org/web/20140523203444/http://www.bakom.admin.ch/index.html?lang=en Federal Office of Communications] for a Swiss 5&nbsp;MHz Experimental Beacon project. Using the callsign HB9AW, the beacon became operational on 5291.0&nbsp;kHz at 0000{{Clarify |date=February 2020 |reason=Time zone?}} on 1 June 2014. The transmission commences with the call sign HB9AW in CW (100HA1B), followed by five 2 seconds-long dashes. The dashes are each accurately attenuated by 10&nbsp;dB in the EIRP power sequence 10&nbsp;W, 5&nbsp;W, 1&nbsp;W, 100&nbsp;mW, concluding with 10&nbsp;mW, and repeats every 5 minutes, commencing on the hour. The beacon transmits from Sursee (Locator: JN47be) using a half-wave dipole, configured for high-angle radiation as an NVIS 'fountain' type antenna at a height above ground of 0.12 of a wavelength. A reflector is placed beneath the antenna. The aim of the system is to explore the propagation conditions on 5&nbsp;MHz in the hills and valleys of Switzerland in relation to its possible suitability as an Emergency Communications band.

It is co-sited with the DK\u00d8WCY 30 and 80&nbsp;m beacons. Owing to considerations of the rising cost of electrical power, the operational schedule of DRA5 has changed and it no longer transmits over the full 24-hour period. It is currently operational 0400\u20132200 UTC during the Summertime period and 0500\u20132300 UTC during the Wintertime period. These times of year correspond to those of the seasonal clock changes in Germany.''(Source: Beacon keeper DK4VW e-mail 18th July 2013)''\n\nThe Hungarian 60&nbsp;m CW Beacon HG7BHB (ITU Region 1), which could be found on 5352.5&nbsp;kHz has now ceased operation.

Government stations using these frequencies are authorized significantly more power than Amateurs.\n\nAs a part of preparation of justification for a 60-meter band, the ARRL organized a group of twelve amateur radio operators, most of whom had experience in trying to communicate with stations in the Caribbean to obtain eyewitness reports of hurricanes in that region.  The group was assigned by FCC WA2Xxx call signs and allowed to transmit on the 60-meter band as experimental stations. That group's report of conditions on that band became central to ARRL's request for the band for amateur use.  That initial effort stressed continuous communication with the Caribbean hurricane region and timely reports to the Miami National Hurricane Center to supplement other observations and to take emergency messages.  ARRL requested an article for its QST magazine from Charles Harpole, K4VUD and WA2Xxx, about the band's use, but that article was only placed briefly on the ARRL Internet site.  ARRL confirmed that their plan was to move away from hurricane and emergency uses of the band toward general amateur uses.  Harpole, as K4VUD near Orlando, Florida, made the first transatlantic two-way ham radio communication with a ham station near London; notice of that achievement was also suppressed by ARRL fearing FCC concern that the band become too rapidly a normal use amateur band {{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n.\n\n==Countries with band allocations==\n\n'''Andorra''' (ITU Region 1): In June 2016 Andorran amateurs were permitted access to the new WRC-15 60&nbsp;m allocation from 5351.5 to 5366.5&nbsp;kHz on a Secondary basis with a maximum power of 15&nbsp;W EIRP; modes are permitted CW and SSB.

It stated that the playing ranks had been severely depleted over the past season as over 600 players had joined the ranks of the military to fight in the first world war. There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade). Fourteen clubs were affiliated to the Auckland Rugby League with over 800 players in total. The Mangere, Remuera, and [[Northcote Tigers|Northcote]] clubs withdrew from the competition due to so many of their players going to war.\n\nSignificantly they secured the option of the Chinamen's gardens just off Stanley Street and this was to later be turned into [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news \n| title =Auckland Rugby League/Past Season Reviewed\n| page =8\n| work = New Zealand Herald |volume=LIV |issue=16526\n| date = 1917-04-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19170430.2.71.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-14}}</ref>\n\nIt was suggested that the newly-formed Garrison Artillery Club enter a first grade team however as there were already 6 teams competing there was a fear that it would weaken the existing teams.

There were 42 teams in total to compete across six grades (7 in the senior grade, 5 in second grade, 9 in third grade, 7 in the fourth grade, 8 in the fifth grade, and 6 in the sixth grade).

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up in open rebellion]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a disconnect between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander&nbsp;II's successor, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory&nbsp;VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as [[Canossa]] to meet with the Pope. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's conflicts with the Popes and with his sons and wife, and his penitentiary \"Walk to Canossa\" established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, others describing him as an exemplary monarch. \n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as the heads of all Christians and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia.

Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]].

He was the son of [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor]], and [[Agnes of Poitou]]. After his father's death on 5&nbsp;October 1056, Henry was placed under his mother's guardianship. She made grants to German aristocrats to secure their support. Unlike her late husband, she could not control the election of the popes, thus the idea of the [[Libertas ecclesiae|''libertas ecclesiae'']] (freedom of the Church) strengthened during her rule. Taking advantage of her weakness, Archbishop [[Anno II of Cologne]] kidnapped Henry in April 1062. He administered Germany until Henry came of age in 1065.\n\nHenry decided to recover the royal estates that had been lost during his minority. He employed low-ranking officials to carry out his new policies, causing discontent in [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]] and [[Duchy of Thuringia|Thuringia]]. Henry crushed a riot in Saxony in 1069 and overcame the rebellion of the Saxon aristocrat, [[Otto of Nordheim]] in 1071. The appointment of commoners to high offices offended German aristocrats, and many of them withdrew from Henry's court. He insisted on his royal prerogatives relating to the appointment of bishops and abbots, although the reformist clerics condemned this practice as [[simony]] (a forbidden sale of church offices). [[Pope Alexander II]] blamed Henry's advisors for his acts and excommunicated them in early 1073. Henry's conflicts with the [[Holy See]] and the German dukes weakened his position and the [[Saxon Rebellion|Saxons rose up in open rebellion]] in the summer of 1074. He took advantage of a disconnect between the Saxon aristocrats and peasantry and forced the rebels into submission in October 1075.\n\nHenry adopted an active policy in Italy, alarming Pope Alexander&nbsp;II's successor, [[Pope Gregory VII|Gregory&nbsp;VII]] who threatened him with excommunication for simony. Henry persuaded most of the German bishops to declare the Pope's election invalid on 24&nbsp;January 1076. In response, the Pope excommunicated Henry and released his subjects from their allegiance. German aristocrats who were hostile to Henry called for the Pope to hold an assembly in Germany to hear Henry's case. To prevent the Pope from sitting in judgement on him, Henry went to Italy as far as [[Canossa]] to meet with the Pope. His penitential \"[[Walk to Canossa]]\" was a success and Gregory&nbsp;VII had no choice but to absolve him in January 1077. Henry's German opponents ignored his absolution and elected an [[antiking]], [[Rudolf of Rheinfelden]], on 14&nbsp;March 1077. The Pope was initially neutral in the two kings' conflict, enabling Henry to consolidate his position. Henry continued to appoint high-ranking clerics, for which the Pope again excommunicated him on 7&nbsp;March 1080. Most German and Lombardian bishops remained loyal to Henry and they elected the antipope [[Antipope Clement III|Clement&nbsp;III]]. Rudolf of Rheinfelden was killed in battle and his successor, [[Hermann of Salm]], could only exert royal authority in Saxony. From 1081, Henry launched a series of military campaigns to Italy, and Clement&nbsp;III crowned him emperor in Rome on 1&nbsp;April 1084.\n\nHermann of Salm died and Henry pacified Saxony with the local aristocrats' assistance in 1088. He launched an invasion against the pope's principal Italian ally, [[Matilda of Tuscany]], in 1089. She convinced Henry's elder son, [[Conrad II of Italy|Conrad]] II, to take up arms against his father in 1093. Her alliance with [[Welf I, Duke of Bavaria]] prevented Henry's return to Germany until 1096 when he was reconciled with Welf. After Clement&nbsp;III's death, Henry did not support new antipopes, but he did not make peace with [[Pope Paschal II]]. Henry proclaimed the first ''[[Landfrieden]]'' (or, imperial peace) which covered the whole territory of Germany in 1103. His younger son, [[Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;V]], forced him to abdicate on 31&nbsp;December 1105. He tried to regain his throne with the assistance of Lotharingian aristocrats, but became ill and died without receiving absolution from his excommunication. Henry's conflicts with the Popes and with his sons and wife, and his penitentiary \"Walk to Canossa\" established his controversial reputation, with some regarding him as the stereotype of a tyrant, others describing him as an exemplary monarch. \n\n==Background==\n\nHenry was the third monarch of the [[Salian dynasty]]\u2014the royal house ruling [[Kingdom of Germany|Germany]] from 1024 to 1124.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The 11th-century kings of Germany also ruled [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|Italy]] and [[Kingdom of Arles|Burgundy]] and had a strong claim to the title of emperor. They were convinced that their claim to the emperorship entitled them to act as the heads of all Christians and to control [[Papal selection before 1059|papal elections]] in Rome.{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=197\u2013198}} Rome was actually dominated by local aristocrats, the [[Counts of Tusculum|Tusculani]] and the [[Crescentii]], who placed their own candidates to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=43\u201344}} Their rivalries caused scandals, culminating when rival popes\u2014[[Pope Benedict&nbsp;IX|Benedict&nbsp;IX]], [[Pope Sylvester III|Sylvester&nbsp;III]] and [[Pope Gregory VI|Gregory&nbsp;VI]]\u2014competed for Rome in 1045.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=44}}{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=56}} To put an end to the schism, Henry's father, [[Henry III, Holy Roman Emperor|Henry&nbsp;III]], crossed the [[Alps]] to Italy and held a [[Council of Sutri|Church synod at Sutri]] on 20 December 1046.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=113}} The synod deposed the three popes and replaced them with a German prelate, Bishop Suidger of Bamberg, who assumed the name [[Pope Clement II|Clement II]].{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=57}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III emphasized the priestly nature of kingship, attributing it to the kings' annointment by holy oil.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=39}} For all his personal piety, he regarded himself as \"[[Vicar of Christ]]\", authorized to administer state and church alike.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}} The Romans awarded him with the hereditary title of patrician, acknowledging his and his successors' right to cast the first vote at papal elections.{{sfn|Schutz|2010|p=128}} His new title enabled him to exlude the Roman aristocrats from influencing papal elections and to secure the appointment of German clerics to the papal throne.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=45}} The third German pope, [[Pope Leo IX|Leo&nbsp;IX]], came from [[Lotharingia]]\u2014a province that had been an important center of reformist clerics. They wanted to purify the Church through the re-implementation of ancient (or supposedly ancient) collections of [[Canon law of the Catholic Church|canon law]] and Leo&nbsp;IX enthusiastically introduced their ideas in Rome. He prohibited simony\u2014the sale of Church offices\u2014and promoted [[Clerical celibacy in the Catholic Church|clerical celibacy]] soon after his entry to Rome.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|pp=64\u201365, 70\u201374}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III's claim to intervene in Church affairs was rarely challenged: reformist bishops convinced him not to extract an oath of fealty from the monk [[Halinard]] who had been elected [[archbishop of Lyon]] in 1045; Bishop [[Wazo of Li\u00e8ge]] openly denied his right to depose bishops in 1047 or 1048.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=49}}{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|pp=52\u201353}} Imperial control of Church affairs, however, was on the long run incompatible with the reformist idea of \"liberty of the Church\" which claimed that ecclesiastic institutions could only be subject to the authority of the Holy See. The conflict between the two ideas reached its pinnacle during Henry IV's reign, developing into the confrontation known as the [[Investiture Controversy]].{{sfn|Barber|2004|pp=87\u201391}}\n\nGermany, Italy and Burgundy were no more than collections of semi-independent territories, each administered by a prelate or a lay aristocrat, under the Salian monarchs.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|p=2}} The prelates\u2014the bishops and abbots\u2014were not only wealthy landowners, but they also played an important role in state administration. They were required to make annual gifts to the kings and also to provide the monarchs with well-defined regular services, including the collection of taxes and hospitality.{{sfn|Blumenthal|2010|p=36}} The dukes were the most powerful lay aristocrats in Germany. They were primarily military commanders, but they were also responsible for the administration of justice. The dukes were the principal representatives of the people of their duchies in the royal court, but the monarchs expected the dukes to be primarily their agents.{{sfn|Robinson|2003|pp=2\u20133}} The monarchs occasionally kept the office of duke for themselves or for their closest relatives, but sooner or later they had no choice, but to give away the vacant duchies, because they depended on the most powerful aristocrats' support.{{sfn|Fuhrmann|2001|p=41}}\n\nHenry&nbsp;III came into conflict with influential dukes towards the end of his life. [[Godfrey the Bearded]], [[Duke of Upper Lotharingia]], married a wealthy widow, [[Beatrice of Lorraine|Beatrice of Tuscany]], without the Emperor's consent after the Emperor denied to invest him with whole Lotharingia.

Consequently, polemical literature tended to provide a list of the characteristics of either good or wicked rulers when portraying Henry. For instance, in the 1080s, the ''[[Song of the Saxon War]]'' praised him as a \"king second to none in his piety\" who defended the widows and the poor and gave laws to the lawless Saxons. An anonymous biography, completed in the early 1110s, described him as a vigorous and warlike monarch who employed learned officials and enjoyed conversations about spiritual themes and the [[liberal arts]].

He was father-in-law to [[Muqtada al-Sadr]], a cousin of [[Muhammad Sadeq al-Sadr]] and Imam [[Musa as-Sadr]]. His father [[Haydar al-Sadr]] was a well-respected high-ranking Shi'a cleric. His lineage can be traced back to [[Muhammad]] through the seventh Shia Imam [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa al-Kazim]]. Muhammad Baqir Al-Sadr was executed in 1980 by the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] along with his sister, Bintelhuda.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\nMuhammad Baqir al-Sadr was born in [[Kadhimiya|al-Kazimiya]], [[Iraq]] to the prominent [[Sadr (name)|Sadr]] family, which originated from [[Jabal Amel]] in Lebanon. His father died in 1937, leaving the family destitute. In 1945, the family moved to the holy city of [[Najaf]], where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. He was a [[child prodigy]] who, at 10, was delivering lectures on [[Islamic history]]. At eleven, he was a student of [[logic]]. He wrote a book refuting materialistic [[philosophy]] when he was 24.<ref>Baqir Al-Sadr, ''Our Philosophy'', [[Taylor and Francis]], 1987, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vikOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR13&dq=Musa+al+Sadr%2Bphilosophy&lr=&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&ei=TJviScT6DoKszgTToYSsDQ&hl=fr#PPR13,M1 p. xiii]</ref> Al-Sadr completed his religious studies at religious seminaries under [[al-Khoei]] and [[Muhsin al-Hakim]], and began teaching at the age of 25.\n\n===Later life ===\nAl-Sadr's works attracted the ire of the [[Baath Party]] leading to repeated imprisonment where he was often tortured.

Al-Sadr explained that throughout history there have been \"...two lines. Man's line and the Prophet's line. The former is the ''khalifa'' (trustee) who inherits the earth from God; the latter is the ''shahid'' (witness)\".<ref name=\"Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr 1979, p.132\">Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr, ''Al-Islam yaqud al-hayat'', Qum, 1979, p.132</ref>\n\nAl-Sadr demonstrated that ''[[khilafa]]'' (governance) is \"a right given to the whole of humanity\" and defined it as an obligation given from God to the human race to \"tend the globe and administer human affairs\". This was a major advancement of Islamic political theory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walberg |first1=Eric |title=From Postmodernism to Postsecularism: Re-emerging Islamic Civilization |date=2013 |publisher=SCB Distributors |isbn=978-0-9860362-4-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYpXDwAAQBAJ |accessdate=22 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhile Al-Sadr identified ''khilafa'' as the obligation and right of the people, he used a broad-based explanation of a Quranic verse<ref>Quran 5:44</ref> to identify who held the responsibility of ''shahada'' in an Islamic state. First were the Prophets (anbiya'). Second were the Imams who are considered a divine (''rabbani'') continuation of the Prophets in this line. The last were the ''marja'iyya'' (''see [[Marja'|Marja]]'').<ref>Baqir Al-Sadr, ''Al-Islam yaqud al-hayat'', Qum, 1979, p.24</ref>\n\nWhile the two functions of ''khilafa'' and ''shahada'' (witness; supervision) were united during the times of the Prophets, they diverged during [[The Occultation|the occultation]] so that ''khilafa'' returned to the people (''umma'') and ''shahada'' to the scholars.<ref>Faleh A Jabar, The Shi'ite Movement in Iraq, London: Saqi Books, 2003, p.286</ref>\n\nAl-Sadr also presented a practical application of ''khilafa'', in the absence of the twelfth Imam. He argued that ''khilafa'' required the establishment of a democratic system whereby the people regularly elect their representatives in government:\n\n<blockquote>Islamic theory rejects monarchy as well as the various forms of dictatorial government; it also rejects the aristocratic regimes and proposes a form of government, which contains all the positive aspects of the democratic system.<ref>Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr, Lamha fiqhiya, p.20</ref></blockquote>\nHe continued to champion this point until his final days:\n<blockquote>Lastly, I demand, in the name of all of you and in the name of the values you uphold, to allow the people the opportunity truly to exercise their right in running the affairs of the country by holding elections in which a council representing the ummah (people) could truly emerge.' ''<ref>Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr, Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence, London: ICAS, 2003, p.15</ref></blockquote>\n\nAl-Sadr was executed by [[Saddam Hussein]] in 1980 before he was able to provide any details of the mechanism for the practical application of the ''shahada'' concept in an Islamic state. A few elaborations of ''shahada'' can be found in Al-Sadr's works. In his text ''Role of the Shiah Imams in the Reconstruction of Islamic Society'', Al-Sadr illustrates the scope and limitations of ''shahada'' by using the example of the third Shi'i Imam, [[Hussein ibn Ali]] (the grandson of the Prophet), who defied [[Yazid I|Yazid]], the ruler at the time. Al-Sadr explained that Yazid was not simply acting counter to Islamic teachings, as many rulers before and after him had done, but he was distorting the teachings and traditions of Islam and presenting his deviant ideas as representative of Islam itself. This, therefore, is what led Imam Hussein to intervene challenging Yazid in order to restore the true teachings of Islam, and consequently laying down his own life. In Al-Sadr's own words, the ''shahid's'' (witness \u2013 person performing ''shahada'' or supervision) duties are \"to protect the correct doctrines and to see that deviations do not grow to the extent of threatening the ideology itself\".<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hadad |first1=Sama |title=The Development of Shi\u2019ite Islamic Political Theory |date=2008 |pages=32\u201340 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/resrep03025.7 |accessdate=22 March 2020 |publisher=American Enterprise Institute}}</ref>\n\n==List of works==\nAl-Sadr engaged Western philosophical ideas, challenging them as necessary and incorporating them where appropriate, with the ultimate goal of demonstrating that religious knowledge was not antithetical to scientific knowledge.<ref name=\"TheMostLearned\">{{cite book|author=Walbridge, Linda S.|year=2001|title=The Most Learned of the Shi'a: The Institution of the Marja Taqlid|page=10|location=USA|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-513799-6}}</ref> The following is a list of his work:<ref>[http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?id=7241 The Super Genius Personality of Islam]</ref>\n\n===Jurisprudence===\n*''Buhuth fi Sharh al- 'Urwah al' Wuthqa'' (Discourses on the Commentary of ''al- 'Urwah al-Wuthqa''), four volumes\n*''Al-Ta'liqah 'ala Minhaj al-Salihin'' (Annotation of Ayatullah Hakim's ''Minhaj al-Salihin''), two volumes\n*''Al-Fatawa al-Wadhihah'' (Clear Decrees).\n*''Mujaz Ahkam al-Hajj'' (Summarized Rules of Hajj)\n*''Al-Ta'liqah 'ala Manasik al-Hajj'' (Annotation of Ayatullah Khui's Hajj Rites)\n*''Al-Ta'liqah 'ala Salah al-Jumu'ah'' (Annotation on Friday Prayer)\n\n===Fundamentals of the law===\n*''Durus fi Ilm al-Usul'' (Lessons in the Science of Jurisprudence), 3 Parts.<ref>This has been translated into English twice: by [[Roy Mottahedeh]] as ''Lessons in Islamic Jurisprudence'' (2005) {{ISBN|978-1-85168-393-2}} (Part 1 only) and anonymously as ''The Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence according to Shi'i Law'' (2003) {{ISBN|978-1-904063-12-4}}.</ref>\n*''Al-Ma'alim al-Jadidah lil-Usul'' (The New Signposts of Jurisprudence)\n*''Ghayat al-Fikr'' (The Highest Degree of Thought)\n\n===Philosophy===\n*''[[Falsafatuna]]'' ([https://www.al-islam.org/our-philosophy-falsafatuna-ayatullah-sayyid-muhammad-baqir-sadr]) (Our Philosophy) published in 1959\n\n===Logic===\n*''Al-Usus al-Mantiqiyyah lil-Istiqra{{'}}'' (Logical Foundations of Induction)\n\n===Theology===\n*''Al-Mujaz fi Usul al-Din: al-Mursil, al-Rasul, al-Risalah'' (The Summarized Principles of Religion: The Sender, The Messenger, The Message)\n*''Al-Tashayyu' wa al-Islam - Bahth Hawl al-Wilayah'' (Discourse on Divine Authority)\n*''Bahth Hawl al-Mahdi'' (Discourse on Imam Mahdi)\n\n===Economics===\n*[[Iqtisaduna]] (Our Economy)\n*''Al-Bank al-la Ribawi fi al-Islam'' (Usury-free Banking in Islam)\n*''Maqalat Iqtisadiyyah'' (Essays in Economy)\n\n===Qur'anic commentaries===\n*''Al-Tafair al-Mawzu'i lil-Qur'an al-Karim - al-Madrasah al-Qur'aniyyah'' (The Thematic Exegesis of the Holy Qur'an)\n*''1Buhuth fi 'Ulum al-Qur'an'' (Discourses on Qur'anic Sciences)\n*''Maqalat Qur'aniyyah'' (Essays on Qur'an)\n\n===History===\n*''Ahl al-Bayt Tanawwu' Ahdaf wa Wahdah Hadaf'' (Ahl al- Bayt, Variety of Objectives Towards a Single Goal)\n*''Fadak fi al-Tarikh'' (Fadak in History)\n\n===Islamic culture===\n*''Al-Islam Yaqud al-Hayah'' (Islam Directive to Life)\n*''Al-Madrasah al-Islamiyyah'' (Islamic School)\n*''Risalatuna'' (Our Mission)\n*''Nazrah Ammah fi al-Ibadat'' (General View on Rites of Worship)\n*''Maqalat wa Muhazrat'' (Essays and Lectures)\n\n===Articles===\n*\"Al-'Amal wa al-Ahdaf\" (The Deeds and the Goals): Min Fikr al- Da'wah.

He was father-in-law to [[Muqtada al-Sadr]], a cousin of [[Muhammad Sadeq al-Sadr]] and Imam [[Musa as-Sadr]]. His father [[Haydar al-Sadr]] was a well-respected high-ranking Shi'a cleric. His lineage can be traced back to [[Muhammad]] through the seventh Shia Imam [[Musa al-Kadhim|Musa al-Kazim]]. Muhammad Baqir Al-Sadr was executed in 1980 by the regime of [[Saddam Hussein]] along with his sister, Bintelhuda.\n\n==Biography==\n===Early life and education===\nMuhammad Baqir al-Sadr was born in [[Kadhimiya|al-Kazimiya]], [[Iraq]] to the prominent [[Sadr (name)|Sadr]] family, which originated from [[Jabal Amel]] in Lebanon. His father died in 1937, leaving the family destitute. In 1945, the family moved to the holy city of [[Najaf]], where al-Sadr would spend the rest of his life. He was a [[child prodigy]] who, at 10, was delivering lectures on [[Islamic history]]. At eleven, he was a student of [[logic]]. He wrote a book refuting materialistic [[philosophy]] when he was 24.<ref>Baqir Al-Sadr, ''Our Philosophy'', [[Taylor and Francis]], 1987, [https://books.google.com/books?id=vikOAAAAQAAJ&pg=PR13&dq=Musa+al+Sadr%2Bphilosophy&lr=&as_brr=3&as_pt=ALLTYPES&ei=TJviScT6DoKszgTToYSsDQ&hl=fr#PPR13,M1 p. xiii]</ref> Al-Sadr completed his religious studies at religious seminaries under [[al-Khoei]] and [[Muhsin al-Hakim]], and began teaching at the age of 25.\n\n===Later life ===\nAl-Sadr's works attracted the ire of the [[Baath Party]] leading to repeated imprisonment where he was often tortured.

Al-Sadr explained that throughout history there have been \"...two lines.  Man's line and the Prophet's line.  The former is the ''khalifa'' (trustee) who inherits the earth from God; the latter is the ''shahid'' (witness)\".<ref name=\"Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr 1979, p.132\">Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr, ''Al-Islam yaqud al-hayat'', Qum, 1979, p.132</ref>\n\nAl-Sadr demonstrated that ''[[khilafa]]'' (governance) is \"a right given to the whole of humanity\" and defined it as an obligation given from God to the human race to \"tend the globe and administer human affairs\".  This was a major advancement of Islamic political theory.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Walberg |first1=Eric |title=From Postmodernism to Postsecularism: Re-emerging Islamic Civilization |date=2013 |publisher=SCB Distributors |isbn=978-0-9860362-4-8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYpXDwAAQBAJ |accessdate=22 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nWhile Al-Sadr identified ''khilafa'' as the obligation and right of the people, he used a broad-based explanation of a Quranic verse<ref>Quran 5:44</ref> to identify who held the responsibility of ''shahada'' in an Islamic state. First were the Prophets (anbiya'). Second were the Imams who are considered a divine (''rabbani'') continuation of the Prophets in this line. The last were the ''marja'iyya'' (''see [[Marja'|Marja]]'').<ref>Baqir Al-Sadr, ''Al-Islam yaqud al-hayat'', Qum, 1979, p.24</ref>\n\nWhile the two functions of ''khilafa'' and ''shahada'' (witness; supervision) were united during the times of the Prophets, they diverged during [[The Occultation|the occultation]] so that ''khilafa'' returned to the people (''umma'') and ''shahada'' to the scholars.<ref>Faleh A Jabar, The Shi'ite Movement in Iraq, London: Saqi Books, 2003, p.286</ref>\n\nAl-Sadr also presented a practical application of ''khilafa'', in the absence of the twelfth Imam.  He argued that ''khilafa'' required the establishment of a democratic system whereby the people regularly elect their representatives in government:\n\n<blockquote>Islamic theory rejects monarchy as well as the various forms of dictatorial government; it also rejects the aristocratic regimes and proposes a form of government, which contains all the positive aspects of the democratic system.<ref>Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr, Lamha fiqhiya, p.20</ref></blockquote>\nHe continued to champion this point until his final days:\n<blockquote>Lastly, I demand, in the name of all of you and in the name of the values you uphold, to allow the people the opportunity truly to exercise their right in running the affairs of the country by holding elections in which a council representing the ummah (people) could truly emerge.' ''<ref>Muhammed Baqir Al-Sadr, Principles of Islamic Jurisprudence, London: ICAS, 2003, p.15</ref></blockquote>\n\nAl-Sadr was executed by [[Saddam Hussein]] in 1980 before he was able to provide any details of the mechanism for the practical application of the ''shahada''  concept in an Islamic state. A few elaborations of ''shahada'' can be found in Al-Sadr's works. In his text ''Role of the Shiah Imams in the Reconstruction of Islamic Society'', Al-Sadr illustrates the scope and limitations of ''shahada'' by using the example of the third Shi'i Imam, [[Hussein ibn Ali]] (the grandson of the Prophet), who defied [[Yazid I|Yazid]], the ruler at the time. Al-Sadr explained that Yazid was not simply acting counter to Islamic teachings, as many rulers before and after him had done, but he was distorting the teachings and traditions of Islam and presenting his deviant ideas as representative of Islam itself. This, therefore, is what led Imam Hussein to intervene challenging Yazid in order to restore the true teachings of Islam, and consequently laying down his own life.

This took him to [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in Germany. In 1974 he answered an advert in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' placed by [[Johnnie Wilder Jr.]] and as a result became a member of the [[funk]] and [[disco]] band [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]], which Wilder was putting together at the time. \"He was the first British guy that I had ever met personally.

Alan Kirk, a Yorkshire musician with [[Jimmy James (singer)|Jimmy James and the Vagabonds]] who toured with Heatwave in the mid 1970s remembered: \"The ''Always and Forever'' track was written on a [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer piano]] at the side of a pile of pungent washing&nbsp;\u2013 sorry to disappoint all the romantics.\" And producer [[Barry Blue]] recalled: \"He had a very small flat, so everything had to be done within one room and he had piles of washing, and had the T.V. on top of the organ. It was a nightmare <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> he had trams running outside <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> but he made it, he just absorbed himself in the music and Rod seemed to come up with these amazing songs\".<ref name=gambo/> In 1977 Heatwave followed up the success of its first album with its second, ''[[Central Heating (Heatwave album)|Central Heating]]'', with Barry Blue again producing and Temperton behind the majority of the songs.

This took him to [[Worms, Germany|Worms]] in Germany. In 1974 he answered an advert in ''[[Melody Maker]]'' placed by [[Johnnie Wilder Jr.]] and as a result became a member of the [[funk]] and [[disco]] band [[Heatwave (band)|Heatwave]], which Wilder was putting together at the time. \"He was the first British guy that I had ever met personally. He spoke kind of funny but he had a good sense of humour and he was a very friendly guy.

Alan Kirk, a Yorkshire musician with [[Jimmy James (singer)|Jimmy James and the Vagabonds]] who toured with Heatwave in the mid 1970s remembered: \"The ''Always and Forever'' track was written on a [[Wurlitzer electric piano|Wurlitzer piano]] at the side of a pile of pungent washing&nbsp;\u2013 sorry to disappoint all the romantics.\" And producer [[Barry Blue]] recalled: \"He had a very small flat, so everything had to be done within one room and he had piles of washing, and had the T.V. on top of the organ. It was a nightmare <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> he had trams running outside <nowiki>[...]</nowiki> but he made it, he just absorbed himself in the music and Rod seemed to come up with these amazing songs\".<ref name=gambo/> In 1977 Heatwave followed up the success of its first album with its second, ''[[Central Heating (Heatwave album)|Central Heating]]'', with Barry Blue again producing and Temperton behind the majority of the songs.

It is located around {{convert|8|mi|km|1}} north of [[Charing Cross]]. The name is derived from being the south gate to [[Enfield Chase]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:South Point House, Southgate.JPG|thumbnail|South Point House, where the South Gate once stood.]]\nSouthgate was originally the ''South Gate'' of [[Enfield Chase]], the King's hunting grounds.  This is reflected in the street names Chase Road (which leads due north from the station to [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]], and was formerly the avenue into the Chase) and Chase Side.  There is a blue plaque on a building on the site of the south gate. A little further to the south was another small medieval settlement called South Street which had grown up around a village green; by 1829 the two settlements had merged and the village green became today's Southgate Green.<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=Bertram|title=Old Southgate and Palmers Green|year=2008|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|isbn=9781840334241|page=3|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBecoming separate from [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]] in 1881, Southgate had a population in 1891 of just 10,970. By 1901 the figure had moved up to 14,993, and by 1911 the figure had ballooned to 33,612, aided by the nearby railway station in [[Palmers Green, London, England|Palmers Green]].\n[[File:Southgate Club.jpg|thumbnail|Rare survivors of 1930s development: The Southgate Club (built 1889) and adjacent [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terrace in Chase Side.<ref>https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/planning/enfield-local-heritage-list-may-18-planning.pdf</ref>]]\nSouthgate was predominantly developed in the 1930s: largish semi-detached houses were built on the hilly former estates (Walker, Osidge, Monkfrith, etc.) following increased transport development. In 1933, the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] was completed through Edmonton and Southgate, and also in 1933, the [[London Underground]] Piccadilly line was extended from Arnos Grove (where it had reached the previous year), through [[Southgate tube station]], on to Enfield West (now known as [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]]). This unleashed a building boom, and by 1939 the area had become almost fully developed.\n\nBy 1951, the population had grown to 73,377 \u2013 falling by about 1,000 ten years later as many moved to new towns nearby.\n\n===Status===\nIn 1894 an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Middlesex]], called Southgate, was created by the [[Local Government Act 1894]]. In 1933 a [[municipal borough]] called Southgate was created. The [[Municipal Borough of Southgate]] was abolished in 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]], which also created the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. This borough also included the area that had been within the [[Municipal Borough of Enfield]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = [[East Barnet]]\n|North     = [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]]\n|Northeast = [[Grange Park, Enfield|Grange Park]]\n|West      = [[Osidge]]\n|Centre    = Southgate\n|East      = [[Winchmore Hill]]\n|Southwest = [[Brunswick Park]]\n|South     = [[Arnos Grove]]\n|Southeast = [[Palmers Green]]\n}}\n\n== Local features ==\n[[File:Southgate Station, London N14 - geograph.org.uk - 1605783.jpg|thumbnail|Southgate underground station]]\nWithin the area is the art deco Grade II* [[Southgate tube station]] designed by [[Charles Holden]]. The area has several large green parks such as [[Grovelands Park]] which covers ninety-two acres and contains a former boating lake of seven acres adjoining dense woods and bracken. In Waterfall Road is [[Christ Church, Southgate|Christ Church]], built in 1862 by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir Gilbert Scott]]; adjacent to its grounds stands the Minchenden Oak. Across the road from the church lies the [[John Walker's Ground|Walker Cricket Ground]]; a regular Middlesex venue which was first used in 1859 and is named after the cricketer [[John Walker (cricketer, born 1826)|John Walker]]. \n\nThe Southgate Green conservation area contains several notable Grade II listed buildings such as [[Arnoside House and Essex House]], [[Sandford House & Norbury House]], [[Old House & Essex Coach House]], [[40 The Green, Southgate|40 The Green]] and the [[Valentine Poole houses, Southgate|Valentine Poole houses]]. The adjoining Cannon Hill features [[Arnos Grove house]] and the High Street features [[Southgate House]].\n\nSouthgate station on the [[Piccadilly line]] is the nearest tube stop to most of Southgate's residential area. Other stations are at [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]] (to the north) and [[Arnos Grove tube station|Arnos Grove]] (to the south west).\n\n\n==Demography==\nSouthgate is a [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] district.

The name is derived from being the south gate to [[Enfield Chase]].\n\n==History==\n[[File:South Point House, Southgate.JPG|thumbnail|South Point House, where the South Gate once stood.]]\nSouthgate was originally the ''South Gate'' of [[Enfield Chase]], the King's hunting grounds.  This is reflected in the street names Chase Road (which leads due north from the station to [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]], and was formerly the avenue into the Chase) and Chase Side.  There is a blue plaque on a building on the site of the south gate. A little further to the south was another small medieval settlement called South Street which had grown up around a village green; by 1829 the two settlements had merged and the village green became today's Southgate Green.<ref>{{cite book|last=Byrom|first=Bertram|title=Old Southgate and Palmers Green|year=2008|publisher=Stenlake Publishing|isbn=9781840334241|page=3|url=http://www.stenlake.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nBecoming separate from [[Edmonton, London|Edmonton]] in 1881, Southgate had a population in 1891 of just 10,970. By 1901 the figure had moved up to 14,993, and by 1911 the figure had ballooned to 33,612, aided by the nearby railway station in [[Palmers Green, London, England|Palmers Green]].\n[[File:Southgate Club.jpg|thumbnail|Rare survivors of 1930s development: The Southgate Club (built 1889) and adjacent [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] terrace in Chase Side.<ref>https://new.enfield.gov.uk/services/planning/enfield-local-heritage-list-may-18-planning.pdf</ref>]]\nSouthgate was predominantly developed in the 1930s: largish semi-detached houses were built on the hilly former estates (Walker, Osidge, Monkfrith, etc.) following increased transport development. In 1933, the [[A406 road|North Circular Road]] was completed through Edmonton and Southgate, and also in 1933, the [[London Underground]] Piccadilly line was extended from Arnos Grove (where it had reached the previous year), through [[Southgate tube station]], on to Enfield West (now known as [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]]). This unleashed a building boom, and by 1939 the area had become almost fully developed.\n\nBy 1951, the population had grown to 73,377 \u2013 falling by about 1,000 ten years later as many moved to new towns nearby.\n\n===Status===\nIn 1894 an [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]] of [[Middlesex]], called Southgate, was created by the [[Local Government Act 1894]]. In 1933 a [[municipal borough]] called Southgate was created. The [[Municipal Borough of Southgate]] was abolished in 1965 by the [[London Government Act 1963]], which also created the [[London Borough of Enfield]]. This borough also included the area that had been within the [[Municipal Borough of Enfield]] and the [[Municipal Borough of Edmonton]].{{cn|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Geography==\n{{Geographic Location\n|title     = '''Neighbouring areas'''\n|Northwest = [[East Barnet]]\n|North     = [[Oakwood, London|Oakwood]]\n|Northeast = [[Grange Park, Enfield|Grange Park]]\n|West      = [[Osidge]]\n|Centre    = Southgate\n|East      = [[Winchmore Hill]]\n|Southwest = [[Brunswick Park]]\n|South     = [[Arnos Grove]]\n|Southeast = [[Palmers Green]]\n}}\n\n== Local features ==\n[[File:Southgate Station, London N14 - geograph.org.uk - 1605783.jpg|thumbnail|Southgate underground station]]\nWithin the area is the art deco Grade II* [[Southgate tube station]] designed by [[Charles Holden]]. The area has several large green parks such as [[Grovelands Park]] which covers ninety-two acres and contains a former boating lake of seven acres adjoining dense woods and bracken. In Waterfall Road is [[Christ Church, Southgate|Christ Church]], built in 1862 by [[George Gilbert Scott|Sir Gilbert Scott]]; adjacent to its grounds stands the Minchenden Oak. Across the road from the church lies the [[John Walker's Ground|Walker Cricket Ground]]; a regular Middlesex venue which was first used in 1859 and is named after the cricketer [[John Walker (cricketer, born 1826)|John Walker]]. \n\nThe Southgate Green conservation area contains several notable Grade II listed buildings such as [[Arnoside House and Essex House]], [[Sandford House & Norbury House]], [[Old House & Essex Coach House]], [[40 The Green, Southgate|40 The Green]] and the [[Valentine Poole houses, Southgate|Valentine Poole houses]]. The adjoining Cannon Hill features [[Arnos Grove house]] and the High Street features [[Southgate House]].\n\nSouthgate station on the [[Piccadilly line]] is the nearest tube stop to most of Southgate's residential area. Other stations are at [[Oakwood tube station|Oakwood]] (to the north) and [[Arnos Grove tube station|Arnos Grove]] (to the south west).\n\n\n==Demography==\nSouthgate is a [[Multiculturalism|cosmopolitan]] district.
