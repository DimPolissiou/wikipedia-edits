In 1951, she was converted to diesel-electric power, completely rebuilt and renamed ''North Head''. She was removed from service in 1985 following the introduction of the [[Freshwater-class ferry|Freshwater class ferries]]. She spent time in Hobart as a floating restaurant, and in 2000, she was taken to [[Cairns]] where she remains grounded and in deteriorating condition.\n\nThe name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. \"North Head\" is [[North Head, New South Wales|the northern headland]] at the entrance to [[Sydney Harbour]].\n\n{{TOC limit|2}}\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Kuringgai Flickr.jpg|thumb|left|''Kuring-gai'' (1901) was the forerunner to the \"Bingarra-type\" vessels including ''Barrenjoey''. Note the wheel houses located midships compared to ''Barrenjoey's'' at the ends of the sun deck.]]\n\nThe Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company's fleet transitioned comparatively late to screw propelled vessels and the fleet comprised mostly paddle steamers until the early years of the twentieth century. The difficulty of turning in the narrow bays of Sydney Harbour - particularly in the busy Circular Quay terminus in [[Sydney Cove]] - required the use of double-ended vessels. However, a double-ended screw configuration was particularly difficult for the fine bows that Manly ferries required for both speed and heavy seas. Further, a propeller at the leading forward end of a vessel reduced speed considerably. In the properous early twentieth century, this speed drawback was overcome by increasing enginee size and power. \n\nThe first screw ferries on the Manly run were two innovative [[Walter Reeks]]-designed vessels; the ''[[SS Manly]]'' (1896), and ''[[SS Kuring-gai]]'' (1901), which were to become the fore-runners of the \"Binggarra-class\" ferries. They both had high [[forecastle]]s at either to help her run through the deep-sea conditions across the [[Sydney Heads]]. The steel-hulled ''Kuring-gai'' was larger and she further refined the basic design to be similar to the subsequent and larger \"Binngarra-class\" vessels. ''Manly'' and ''Kuring-gai'' had both, however, followed paddle steamer design with their bridges around the midships funnels. Whereas the \"Binggarra-class\" vessels would have their wheelhouses at either end of their promenade decks. \n\nThe \"Binngarra-class\" ferries, ''[[Binngarra]]'' (1905), ''[[Burra-Bra]]'' (1908), ''[[Bellubera]]'' (1910), ''[[SS Balgowlah|Balgowlah]]'' (1912), ''Barrenjoey'' (1913), and ''[[Baragoola]]'' (1922), were designed by [[Mort's Dock and Engineering]], initially under the guidance of former chief draughtsman Andrew Christie. The first five were built at Mort's [[Woolwich]] yard and ''Baragoola'' was built at the [[Balmain, New South Wales|Balmain]] yard. They were among the largest ships built in Australian yards at the time and, on the admission of Mort's executives, were built by the dock more for prestige than profit. Build costs were higher in Australia than in the United Kingdom, but this was offset by the cost of sailing them out to Australia. \n\n==Steam ship ''Barrenjoey''==\n[[File:Manly ferry Barrenjoey.jpg|thumb|left|''Barrenjoey'' on Sydney Harbour, 1920s, before expansion of her wheelhouses]]\n\nFollowing ''Bellubera's'' success (she was bigger and faster than the preceding ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra-Bra''), in 1911 the Company placed an order for two new vessels, ''Balgowlah'' and ''Barrenjoey'', which were largely the same design. The three would represent the largest, fastest, and most refined of the six \"Binngarra-class\" vessels. Like the previous four of the class, ''Barrenjoey'' was built by [[Mort's Dock]] at their [[Woolwich, New South Wales|Woolwich]] yard. \n\nThe three vessels all had riveted steel hulls with single screws at either end, and steam steering equipment. ''Barrenjoey'' was 500 tons, 64.0 m in length and had a passenger capacity of 1,512. Her 112 horsepower triple expansion steam engines were also built by Mort's Dock could push her at up to 15 knots. The vessels had \"navy-type\" boilers with corrugated furnaces in both.\n\nThe ships' promenade (upper) decks were entirely open except for two small shelters and the canopy formed by the sun deck. All of the \"Binngarra-class\" would later have their upper decks enclosed except the first two, ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra Bra''. The main (lower) decks were enclosed and had outside perimeter seating. The two decks were connected by two double internal staircases. The ladies' cabin was located at the aft end of the main deck, while the crew spaces were placed on a flat forward of the boiler room. Electric lighting was fitted throughout. \n\n''Barrenjoey'' was launched on 8 May 1913 by the daughter of Mr. B. McBride (a director of the Port Jackson Company). The name \"Barrenjoey\" was taken from [[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|the headland]] at the northern tip of [[Pittwater]]. Her see trials were run on 17 September 1913 from near [[Long Nose Point]] to the Sow and Pigs and back. A newspaper report said that she exceeded the speed stipulated in the contract by one knot. Following the trials, guests of the company were entertained at a luncheon held on board with her moored off [[Cremorne Point]]. The chairman noted that since the paddle steamer ''Narrabeen'' (1886), the combined value of new steamers delivered by Mort's Dock for the company was \u00a3170,000. In 1901, the fleet comprised five steamers with a combined capacity of 4,300 passengers. Twelve years later with ''Barrenjoey''{{'}}s introduction, there were eight vessels with a combined capacity of 10,500. The new steamer was placed in service on 20 September 1913, at which time the company's capacity was sufficient and ''Baragoola'' wasn't delivered until 1922.<ref name=Prescott/> \n\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY approaches Circular Quay circa 1930.jpg|In her recently enclosed uppper decks, 1931.\n\nThe cost and difficulty of replacing the large steel-hulled Manly ferries saw them upgraded and modified rather than replaced. In line with regulations requiring improved crew accommodation, facilities were progressivelyremoved from the poorly-ventilated spaces below the main deck. In the 1920s, ''Barrenjoey'' along with ''Bellubera'', ''Balgowlah'' and ''Baragoola'' had officers' cabins attached to their wheelhouses. In the 1940s additional cabins were added to the wheelhouses for the entire crews, which affected the vessels' stability and resulted in reduced passenger capacities from the 1950s.<ref name=Prescott/> Also in the 1920s, ''Barrenjoey'' and the rest of the \"Binngarra-class\" ferries were fitted with small cafeterias below the main deck aft, but the cafeteria's were removed from the vessels in the 1930s.<ref name=Prescott/> \n\nIn August 1930, ''Barrenjoey'' had much of her open upper deck enclosed with reversible and upholstered seating provided making the vessels more suitable for the heavy business traffic, and was of benefit to the travelling public during the colder months and at night.<ref name=FerriesofSydney>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160227124230/http://ferriesofsydney.com/barrenjoey.html SS Barrenjoey/MV North Head] Ferries of Sydney</ref><ref name=HistoryWorks>[http://www.historyworks.com.au/B%20Boats.pdf Manly Ferries Balgowlah, Barrenjoey & Baragoola] History Works December 2007</ref><ref name=TMead>{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=Tom|title=Manly Ferries of Sydney Harbour|date=1988|publisher=Child & Associates|location=Brookvale|isbn=0 86777 091 0|pages=164\u2013165}}</ref> ''Balgowlah'', ''Bellubera'', and ''Baragoola'' also received enclosed upper decks between 1931 and 1932, however, the older ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra-Bra'' did not receive the upgrade.<ref name=Prescott/> Curl Curl and Dee Why (both 1928) had been built with the enclosed upper saloon.\n\n==Motor vessel ''North Head''==\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD leaving Manly Wharf 1954.jpg|Newly rebuilt as ''North Head'', leaving Manly, prior to Queen Elizabeth II first visit to Australia, 1954|thumb]] \n\nIn 1946, the company decided to convert ''Balgowlah'' and ''Barrenjoey'' from steam to diesel-electric propulsion, as the cost of replacing the two vessels with new boats was by then prohibitive to the company. ''Barrenjoey's'' last trip as a steamer was on 12 April 1948, when she was withdrawn from service for a survey, which subsequently failed her boilers. By 30 June 1949, the ferry's original builder, Mort's Dock and Engineering, had fitted new hull plates, altered the hull framing, and provided foundation beds for the new equipment. Post-war shortages of labour and materials prolonged the work and increased costs to \u00a3261,772 which almost bankrupted the company. \n\nFour seven-cylinder [[British Thomson-Houston]] diesel engines were provided which drove two [[English Electric]] electric engines. Her new engines generated 2000 bhp and could push her to 16 knots. Her tall single steam funnel was replaced with two short funnels. Her formerly timber superstructure was completely rebuilt with a fully enclosed steel upper deck, wheelhouses further extended, and bows rebuilt to resemble the [[South Steyne]]'s (1938). With the exception of the outside seating on the main deck, all seating was enclosed and upholstered. The camber on the upper deck was removed, and with the transverse seating being removable, it was possible to hold dances on board while limited catering facilities were provided.<ref name=Prescott>{{cite book |last1=Prescott |first1=AM |title=Sydney Ferry Fleet |date=1984 |publisher=Ronald H Parsons |location=Magill South Australia |isbn=0909418306 |pages=48,59}}</ref> \n\nThe vessel's new gross and net tonnages was 465.66 and 183.78 respectively.  She was permitted to carry 904 on the main deck and 358 persons on the promenade deck with a total seated capacity of 1,005. The rebuild also provided a  raked bow and stern in place of the former straight stems. Following sea trials on the 5 May 1951, she was commissioned on 7 May 1951 having been renamed ''North Head''. The vessel's stability had been affected by the new heavier steel superstructure and larger wheelhouses. Life rafts were moved from the sun deck to the fore and aft ends of the promenade deck and sections of the bulwarks were hinged to allow the wooden rafts to be pushed overboard.\n\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|''North Head'' at [[Circular Quay]] in her [[Urban Transit Authority]] colours, 1981|left|thumb]]\n\nThe last four \"Binngarra-class\" ferries (''Balgowlah'', ''Bellubera'', ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'') were all to be modernised and converted to diesel-electric propulsion. However, the company's post-war economic difficulties and the cost of the ''Barrenjoey'''s rebuild and diesel conversion almost bankrupted the company. As such, ''Balgowlah'' was decommissioned and sold to ship breakers in 1953 and the engines acquired for her went to ''Baragoola''. Upgrades to ''Bellubera'' and ''Baragoola'' in future years were much more modest in scope retaining their original hull shape and timber superstructures. ''Bellubera'' was withdrawn from service in 1973.\n\nIn 1964, it was sent to [[Melbourne]] under her own power for the [[Moomba]] Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/><ref name=TMead/> ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola'' were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to [[Brambles Limited|Brambles]] in April 1972 (''South Steyne'' was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the [[Public Transport Commission]] took over the service in Decemeber 1974 acquiring  ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola''.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/> With the arrive of the first two [[MV Freshwater|''Freshwater'']] class ferries in 1982 and 1983, ''Baragoola'' was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, ''Narrabeen'' arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, ''North Head'' was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. \n\nOn 26 March 1987, ''North Head'' departed under its own steam for [[Hobart]] for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to [[Cairns]] to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on [[eBay]] to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard.\n\n==Incidents==\nOver her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, ''Barrenjoey'' / ''North Head'' had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents:<ref name=FerriesofSydney/>  \u00a0 \n* Within a year of her commissioning, ''Barrenjoey'' was lost in thick fog and drifted around [[Manly Cove]] for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 am. \n* ''Barrenjoey'' collided with ''Kareela'' in 1914, ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]]'' in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. \n* In January 1940, she collided with ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kubu]]'' as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber ''Kubu's'' upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled ''Barrenjoey'' was only scratched. \n* In January 1942, ''Barrenjoey'' went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. \n* During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'' were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, ''Barrenjoey'' was torn free of her mooring at the [[Kurraba Point, New South Wales|Kurraba Point]] base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the [[Neutral Bay ferry wharf]]. A tug was used to pull her free.\n* On the night 28 May 1955, ''North Head'' ran aground off [[Bradleys Head]] in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted.\n* In 1976, a fire broke out in ''North Head's'' wiring. It was put out and she returned to the [[Balmain, NEw South Wales|Balmain]] base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day.\n* In 1979, ''North Head'' failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only ''Baragoola'' and the small ''Lady Wakehurst'' available, peak hour was chaos. \n* In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. ''Baragoola'' and the smaller ''Lady Wakehurst'' had to carry the majority of the service as the small ''Lady Nortcott'' was not available due to a refit.\n* On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, ''North Head'' and ''[[MV Kanangra|Kanangra]]'' collided off the [[Sydney Opera House]]. ''North Head'' had turned too early and the collision with ''Kanangra'' prevented her running into the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The smaller ''Kanangra'' had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to ''North Head''. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with ''Kanangra''.\n\n==Chronological gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY passes Bradley's Head circa 1913-1930.jpg|Rounding [[Bradley's Head]] in her as built form with original wheelhouses and open upper decks. \nFile:Sydney Ferries KIANDRA and BARRENJOEY at Circular Quay.jpg|In Circular Quay behind ferry [[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]], 1920s\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY crossing the Sydney Heads 1930 or early 1940s.jpg|Crossing [[Sydney Heads]] with extended wheelhouses and enclosed upper decks, 1930s or early 1940s.\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD removal of steam engine during conversion to diesel electrica 1948-51.jpg|Removal of steam engines during conversion to diesel-eletric propulsion\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD en route to Manly at the Heads on Sydney Harbour 20 January 1973.jpg|Port Jackson Company colours\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passing Hydrofoil ferry DEE WHY at North Head on Sydney Harbour 13 Jan 1974.jpg|Passing hydrofoil ''Dee Why'' with her namesake [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] in the background\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD in Cockatoo Island Dock for maintenance 1975.jpg|In Cockatoo dock for maintenance, 1975\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passes Dobroyd Head on way from Manly to Circular Quay April 1980.jpg|In Public Transport Commission colours passing [[Dobroyd Head]] en route to Circular Quay, 1980\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_NORTH_HEAD_interior_upper_deck_1980.jpg|Interior upper deck, 1980\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|Urban Transport Authority colours, 1981\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1984.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]] in rough seas, [[Middle Head]] in the background, 1984\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1985.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]], 1985\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD arrives at Circular Quay 1985.jpg|After final refit showing the masts added \nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD grounded in Cairns 2009.jpg|Aground and land-locked at [[Trinity Inlet]] near [[Cairns]], 2009\n</gallery>\n\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sydney Harbour ferries]]\n\n==External links==\n[http://simonfieldhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Manly-Ferry-SS-Barrenjoey-North-Head-1024x789.jpg Images on SimonFieldhouse.com showing her 1913, 1936 and 1951 configurations]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Australianferries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North Head}}\n[[Category:Ferries of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Ferry transport in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1913 ships]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Australian ferry}}\n{{Use Australian English|date=March 2018}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2018}}\n{|{{Infobox ship begin}}\n{{Infobox ship image\n|Ship image=Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD off Bradley's Head 17 January 1972.jpg\n|Ship image size=300px\n|Ship caption={{nowrap|as ''North Head'' on [[Sydney Harbour]], 1972}}}}\n{{Infobox ship career\n|Hide header=\n|Ship flag={{shipboxflag|Australia|civil}}\n|Ship name=*MV ''North Head''\n*formerly SS ''Barrenjoey''\n|Ship owner=\n|Ship operator=*[[Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company]]\n*[[Public Transport Commission]]\n*[[Urban Transit Authority]]\n|Ship registry=[[Port Jackson|Sydney]]\n|Ship namesake=*[[Sydney Heads|North Head]]\n*[[Barrenjoey, New South Wales|Barrenjoey]]\n|Ship route=[[Manly ferry services|Manly]]\n|Ship ordered=\n|Ship builder=[[Mort's Dock]]\n|Ship original cost=\u00a332,000\n|Ship yard number=39\n|Ship way number=\n|Ship laid down=\n|Ship launched=8 May 1913\n|Ship completed=\n|Ship christened=\n|Ship acquired=\n|Ship maiden voyage=\n|Ship in service=20 September 1913\n|Ship out of service=12 December 1985\n|Ship identification={{IMO Number|5256939}}\n|Ship fate=\n|Ship status=\n|Ship notes=}}\n{{Infobox ship characteristics\n|Hide header=\n|Header caption=\n|Ship class=\n|Ship tonnage=499 tonnes\n|Ship displacement=\n|Ship length=\n|Ship beam=\n|Ship height=\n|Ship draught=\n|Ship draft=\n|Ship depth=\n|Ship decks=2\n|Ship deck clearance=\n|Ship ramps=\n|Ship ice class=\n|Ship sail plan=\n|Ship power=\n|Ship propulsion=\n|Ship speed=\n|Ship capacity=1,262\n|Ship crew=\n|Ship notes=}}\n|}\nThe '''MV ''North Head''''' (formerly SS '''''Barrenjoey''''') was a ferry operated by the [[Port Jackson & Manly Steamship Company]] and its successors on the [[Manly ferry services|Manly service]] from 1913 until 1985. \n\nThe vessel was launched as ''Barrenjoey'', a steamer and one of the six \"Binngarra\" type Manly ferries which were built between 1905 and 1922.

In the 1940s additional cabins were added to the wheelhouses for the entire crews, which affected the vessels' stability and resulted in reduced passenger capacities from the 1950s.<ref name=Prescott/> Also in the 1920s, ''Barrenjoey'' and the rest of the \"Binngarra-class\" ferries were fitted with small cafeterias below the main deck aft, but the cafeteria's were removed from the vessels in the 1930s.<ref name=Prescott/> \n\nIn August 1930, ''Barrenjoey'' had much of her open upper deck enclosed with reversible and upholstered seating provided making the vessels more suitable for the heavy business traffic, and was of benefit to the travelling public during the colder months and at night.<ref name=FerriesofSydney>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160227124230/http://ferriesofsydney.com/barrenjoey.html SS Barrenjoey/MV North Head] Ferries of Sydney</ref><ref name=HistoryWorks>[http://www.historyworks.com.au/B%20Boats.pdf Manly Ferries Balgowlah, Barrenjoey & Baragoola] History Works December 2007</ref><ref name=TMead>{{cite book|last1=Mead|first1=Tom|title=Manly Ferries of Sydney Harbour|date=1988|publisher=Child & Associates|location=Brookvale|isbn=0 86777 091 0|pages=164\u2013165}}</ref> ''Balgowlah'', ''Bellubera'', and ''Baragoola'' also received enclosed upper decks between 1931 and 1932, however, the older ''Binngarra'' and ''Burra-Bra'' did not receive the upgrade.<ref name=Prescott/> Curl Curl and Dee Why (both 1928) had been built with the enclosed upper saloon.\n\n==Motor vessel ''North Head''==\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD leaving Manly Wharf 1954.jpg|Newly rebuilt as ''North Head'', leaving Manly, prior to Queen Elizabeth II first visit to Australia, 1954|thumb]] \n\nIn 1946, the company decided to convert ''Balgowlah'' and ''Barrenjoey'' from steam to diesel-electric propulsion, as the cost of replacing the two vessels with new boats was by then prohibitive to the company. ''Barrenjoey's'' last trip as a steamer was on 12 April 1948, when she was withdrawn from service for a survey, which subsequently failed her boilers. By 30 June 1949, the ferry's original builder, Mort's Dock and Engineering, had fitted new hull plates, altered the hull framing, and provided foundation beds for the new equipment. Post-war shortages of labour and materials prolonged the work and increased costs to \u00a3261,772 which almost bankrupted the company. \n\nFour seven-cylinder [[British Thomson-Houston]] diesel engines were provided which drove two [[English Electric]] electric engines. Her new engines generated 2000 bhp and could push her to 16 knots. Her tall single steam funnel was replaced with two short funnels. Her formerly timber superstructure was completely rebuilt with a fully enclosed steel upper deck, wheelhouses further extended, and bows rebuilt to resemble the [[South Steyne]]'s (1938). With the exception of the outside seating on the main deck, all seating was enclosed and upholstered. The camber on the upper deck was removed, and with the transverse seating being removable, it was possible to hold dances on board while limited catering facilities were provided.<ref name=Prescott>{{cite book |last1=Prescott |first1=AM |title=Sydney Ferry Fleet |date=1984 |publisher=Ronald H Parsons |location=Magill South Australia |isbn=0909418306 |pages=48,59}}</ref> \n\nThe vessel's new gross and net tonnages was 465.66 and 183.78 respectively.  She was permitted to carry 904 on the main deck and 358 persons on the promenade deck with a total seated capacity of 1,005. The rebuild also provided a  raked bow and stern in place of the former straight stems. Following sea trials on the 5 May 1951, she was commissioned on 7 May 1951 having been renamed ''North Head''. The vessel's stability had been affected by the new heavier steel superstructure and larger wheelhouses. Life rafts were moved from the sun deck to the fore and aft ends of the promenade deck and sections of the bulwarks were hinged to allow the wooden rafts to be pushed overboard.\n\n[[File:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|''North Head'' at [[Circular Quay]] in her [[Urban Transit Authority]] colours, 1981|left|thumb]]\n\nThe last four \"Binngarra-class\" ferries (''Balgowlah'', ''Bellubera'', ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'') were all to be modernised and converted to diesel-electric propulsion. However, the company's post-war economic difficulties and the cost of the ''Barrenjoey'''s rebuild and diesel conversion almost bankrupted the company. As such, ''Balgowlah'' was decommissioned and sold to ship breakers in 1953 and the engines acquired for her went to ''Baragoola''. Upgrades to ''Bellubera'' and ''Baragoola'' in future years were much more modest in scope retaining their original hull shape and timber superstructures. ''Bellubera'' was withdrawn from service in 1973.\n\nIn 1964, it was sent to [[Melbourne]] under her own power for the [[Moomba]] Festival for six weeks. It returned to Melbourne in 1965 and 1967.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/><ref name=TMead/> ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola'' were included in the sale of the Manly ferry business to [[Brambles Limited|Brambles]] in April 1972 (''South Steyne'' was not). With Brambles having allowed the ferries condition and service to deteriorate while suggesting that the service would be closed completely, the [[Public Transport Commission]] took over the service in Decemeber 1974 acquiring  ''North Head'' and ''Baragoola''.<ref name=FerriesofSydney/><ref name=HistoryWorks/> With the arrive of the first two [[MV Freshwater|''Freshwater'']] class ferries in 1982 and 1983, ''Baragoola'' was retired. In 1984, a third new ferry, ''Narrabeen'' arrived and with the new ferries having settled down, ''North Head'' was withdrawn on 12 December 1985, 72 years after entering service. \n\nOn 26 March 1987, ''North Head'' departed under its own steam for [[Hobart]] for use as a floating restaurant and convention centre. She underwent significant restoration, however, the venture failed. In 2000, it was sold and moved to [[Cairns]] to be used in the same manner. However, after the venture failed, the ship rotted in a Cairns dock until 2005, when it was sold on [[eBay]] to a landscape contractor, who dug a pit and put it in his front yard.\n\n==Incidents==\nOver her 73 years as a Sydney Harbour ferry, ''Barrenjoey'' / ''North Head'' had her fair share of largely minor collisions and other incidents:<ref name=FerriesofSydney/>  \u00a0 \n* Within a year of her commissioning, ''Barrenjoey'' was lost in thick fog and drifted around [[Manly Cove]] for two and half hours before finding the wharf around 1:30 am. \n* ''Barrenjoey'' collided with ''Kareela'' in 1914, ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]]'' in 1927. Collisions with the timber inner harbour ferries usually resulted in significant damage to the timber boats, but insignificant damage to the steel Manly ferries. \n* In January 1940, she collided with ''[[Kirrule-type ferry|Kubu]]'' as both ferries tried to avoid yachts. Timber ''Kubu's'' upper deck and railings were badly damaged, whereas steel-hulled ''Barrenjoey'' was only scratched. \n* In January 1942, ''Barrenjoey'' went aground on rocks at Smedleys Point near Manly wharf. She was stuck for an hour before freeing herself and continuing on with her normal trip with no damage. \n* During a cyclone that hit Sydney on 16 April 1946, passengers on ''Barrenjoey'' and ''Baragoola'' were injured and both ferries damaged. Later that day in the same storm, ''Barrenjoey'' was torn free of her mooring at the [[Kurraba Point, New South Wales|Kurraba Point]] base and drifted across the harbour towards a group of navy ships, but then jammed crosswise into the [[Neutral Bay ferry wharf]]. A tug was used to pull her free.\n* On the night 28 May 1955, ''North Head'' ran aground off [[Bradleys Head]] in thick fog. It was two and a half hours before she was pulled off, by which time the fog was so thick, all harbour traffic had been halted.\n* In 1976, a fire broke out in ''North Head's'' wiring. It was put out and she returned to the [[Balmain, NEw South Wales|Balmain]] base where it was replaced and she went back into service the next day.\n* In 1979, ''North Head'' failed to stop at Circular Quay and rammed the seawall and footpath. Damage was found to be slight, however, with only ''Baragoola'' and the small ''Lady Wakehurst'' available, peak hour was chaos. \n* In July 1979, she lost a rudder near Bradleys Head which caused chaos on the morning run for the 31st. With only one rudder until a new one could be made, she was used sparingly in peak hour. ''Baragoola'' and the smaller ''Lady Wakehurst'' had to carry the majority of the service as the small ''Lady Nortcott'' was not available due to a refit.\n* On 5 November 1984, during a Sydney record rain event, ''North Head'' and ''[[MV Kanangra|Kanangra]]'' collided off the [[Sydney Opera House]]. ''North Head'' had turned too early and the collision with ''Kanangra'' prevented her running into the [[Sydney Opera House]]. The smaller ''Kanangra'' had significant damage but there was no apparent significant damage to ''North Head''. Two weeks later, however, she broke down and was found to have a broken propellor shaft, likely damaged in the accident with ''Kanangra''.\n\n==Chronological gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY passes Bradley's Head circa 1913-1930.jpg|Rounding [[Bradley's Head]] in her as built form with original wheelhouses and open upper decks. \nFile:Sydney Ferries KIANDRA and BARRENJOEY at Circular Quay.jpg|In Circular Quay behind ferry [[Kirrule-type ferry|Kiandra]], 1920s\nFile:Sydney Ferry BARRENJOEY crossing the Sydney Heads 1930 or early 1940s.jpg|Crossing [[Sydney Heads]] with extended wheelhouses and enclosed upper decks, 1930s or early 1940s.\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD removal of steam engine during conversion to diesel electrica 1948-51.jpg|Removal of steam engines during conversion to diesel-eletric propulsion\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD en route to Manly at the Heads on Sydney Harbour 20 January 1973.jpg|Port Jackson Company colours\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passing Hydrofoil ferry DEE WHY at North Head on Sydney Harbour 13 Jan 1974.jpg|Passing hydrofoil ''Dee Why'' with her namesake [[North Head, New South Wales|North Head]] in the background\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD in Cockatoo Island Dock for maintenance 1975.jpg|In Cockatoo dock for maintenance, 1975\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD passes Dobroyd Head on way from Manly to Circular Quay April 1980.jpg|In Public Transport Commission colours passing [[Dobroyd Head]] en route to Circular Quay, 1980\nFile:Sydney_Ferry_NORTH_HEAD_interior_upper_deck_1980.jpg|Interior upper deck, 1980\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD at Circular Quay 9 January 1981.jpg|Urban Transport Authority colours, 1981\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1984.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]] in rough seas, [[Middle Head]] in the background, 1984\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD crossing the Sydney Heads en route to Circular Quay 1985.jpg|Crossing the [[Sydney Heads]], 1985\nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD arrives at Circular Quay 1985.jpg|After final refit showing the masts added \nFile:Sydney Ferry NORTH HEAD grounded in Cairns 2009.jpg|Aground and land-locked at [[Trinity Inlet]] near [[Cairns]], 2009\n</gallery>\n\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of Sydney Harbour ferries]]\n\n==External links==\n[http://simonfieldhouse.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Manly-Ferry-SS-Barrenjoey-North-Head-1024x789.jpg Images on SimonFieldhouse.com showing her 1913, 1936 and 1951 configurations]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Australianferries|state=collapsed}}\n{{Oldest surviving ships (pre-1919)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:North Head}}\n[[Category:Ferries of New South Wales]]\n[[Category:Ferry transport in Sydney]]\n[[Category:Ships built in New South Wales]]\n[[Category:1913 ships]]\n", "name_user": "DocWatson42", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSteam ship Barrenjoey:Made two minor corrections.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MV_North_Head"}

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of [[Jalore]] was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of [[Mewar]] against [[Muslim conquests in the Indian subcontinent|Muslim]] invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son Prince Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.\u00a0 Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora [[Chauhan]], was the first man in his genealogy to convert to [[Jainism]].{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement \n| name           = Delwara\n| other_name     = \n| settlement_type = Sub-Tehsil\n| image_skyline   = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname = \"Devkul Patan Nagri\"\n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = Delwara\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|24.7752|N|73.7463|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{IND}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Rajsamand district|Rajsamand]]\n| established_date        = 224-215 BC\n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = \n| leader_name             = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| elevation_m             = 586\n| population_total        = 4429\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes=<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/</ref>\n| population_density_km2  = \n| literacy_rate = 76.7\n| demographics_type1     = Languages\n| demographics1_title1   = Official\n| demographics1_info1    = [[Hindi]]\n| demographics1_title2   = {{no wrap|Additional Official}}\n| demographics1_info2    = [[English language|English]]\n| demographics1_title3   = Regional\n| demographics1_info3   = [[Mewari language|Mewari]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 313202\n| area_code               = +91- 2952\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| registration_plate      = RJ-30\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest Places \n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Udaipur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajsamand]], [[Haldighati]], [[Kumbhalgarh]], [[Chittorgarh]]\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|BSh]]\n|}}\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== The seat of learning ===\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n=== The grandeur of Jain temples ===\n<br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen goddesses of knowledge, (\u0935\u093f\u0927\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0926\u0947\u0935\u0940)  are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, the minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]]. These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]).\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\n<br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar?

He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].\n\n=== The seat of learning ===\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aahar (Ayad) were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]].

Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] (\u090b\u0937\u092d\u0926\u0947\u0935 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928) and one of [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]] (\u092a\u093e\u0930\u094d\u0936\u094d\u0935\u0928\u093e\u0925 \u092d\u0917\u0935\u093e\u0928). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]], respectively. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] (\u0924\u0940\u0930\u094d\u0925\u0902\u0915\u0930) with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations.

Abu]] are called [[Dilwara Temples]] (\u0926\u0947\u0932\u0935\u093e\u0921\u093e \u091c\u0948\u0928 \u092e\u0902\u0926\u093f\u0930)? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] rulers of [[Gujarat]] visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah, the minister, governor of [[Chandravati]] and commander-in-chief of [[Bhima I|Bhimadev I]] (1022\u201364), the [[Solanki dynasty|Solanki]] ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near [[Mount Abu]] which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. \n\nThe temple is known as [[Vimal Vasahi]] (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230 AD, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 [[Vastupala|Vastupal]] and Tejpal, both ministers of the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after [[Vimal Vasahi]] temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as [[Dilwara Temples]]. These temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara ([[Mewar]]).\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized [[Nadol]] (near [[Jodhpur]]) from the [[Paramara dynasty|Paramaras]] and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan [[Qutb al-Din Aibak|Qutbud-din Aibak]] of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to [[Bhinmal]] and [[Sanchore|Sanchor]], before seizing [[Jalore]] from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipal was progenitor of [[Songara]] clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref name=\":0\">Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of [[Jalore]], [[Chandravati]] and [[Sirohi State|Sirohi]] belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.\n\n\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar (now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to [[Dungarpur State|Dungarpur]]. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. [[Jagir|Jagirdars]] of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebari means window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. \n\n<br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur [[Gaurishankar Hirachand Ojha|Gaurishankar Ojha]] writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015).

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Muhammad Bin Tughluk brought in large army to recapture Chittor Fort, but he was defeated by the army of Maharana Hamir Singh I and taken prisoner at Singoli, near Mandalgarh. Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts. But he died in 1351 at Delhi.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century? There is an inscription plate of 1975, that Ashapura Temple at Berwas (near Debari) was built by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528. Who were the ancestors of Munjerao? Were they descendants of Raja Sagar?

Murphy, paleoconservatives developed a focus on [[states' rights]] and [[Localism (politics)|political localism]]. From the mid-1980s onward, ''Chronicles''  promoted a Southern traditionalist worldview focused on national identity, regional particularity, and skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power.{{sfn|Murphy|2001|p=218}} According to Hague, Beirich, and Sebesta (2009), the [[antimodernism]] of the paleoconservative movement defined the [[neo-confederate]] movement of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, notable paleoconservative argued that [[desegregation]], welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislatures and think tanks. Paleoconservatives also claimed the [[Southern Agrarians]] as forebearers in this regard.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hague |first1=Euan |last2=Beirich |first2=Heidi |last3=Sebesta |first3=Edward H. |title=Neo-Confederacy: A Critical Introduction |date=2009 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292779211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfWdaR9wHEEC |accessdate=3 December 2018 |language=en |pages=25\u201327}}</ref>\n\n=== Alt-right ===\nThe [[alt-right]] movement emerged out of the younger generation of paleoconservatives.

Those in favor of the Vietnam War became known as the ''neoconservatives'' (interventionists) as they marked a decisive split from the nationalist-isolationism that the [[Traditionalist conservatism in the United States|traditionalist conservatives]] (isolationists) had subscribed to up until this point.{{sfn|Gottfried|1993}}{{sfn|Gottfried|2006}}{{sfn|Scotchie|2017}}\n\nAccording to the [[international relations]] scholar [[Michael Foley (academic)|Michael Foley]], \"paleoconservatives press for restrictions on [[Immigration to the United States|immigration]], a rollback of [[multicultural]] programs and [[Whiteshift|large-scale demographic change]], the [[States' rights|decentralization of federal policy]], the restoration of [[Protectionism in the United States|controls upon free trade]], a greater emphasis upon [[economic nationalism]] and [[United States non-interventionism|non-interventionism in the conduct of American foreign policy]]\".{{sfn|Foley|2007|p=318}}\n\n== Terminology ==\nThe prefix ''paleo'' derives from the [[Greek language|Greek]] root [[wikt:paleo-|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03b1\u03b9\u03cc\u03c2]], meaning \"ancient\" or \"old\". It is somewhat [[:wikt:tongue-in-cheek|tongue-in-cheek]] and refers to the paleoconservatives' claim to represent a more historic, authentic conservative tradition than that found in [[neoconservatism]]. Adherents of paleoconservatism often describe themselves simply as \"paleo\".

Murphy, paleoconservatives developed a focus on [[states' rights]] and [[Localism (politics)|political localism]]. From the mid-1980s onward, ''Chronicles''  promoted a Southern traditionalist worldview focused on national identity, regional particularity, and skepticism of abstract theory and centralized power.{{sfn|Murphy|2001|p=218}} According to Hague, Beirich, and Sebesta (2009), the [[antimodernism]] of the paleoconservative movement defined the [[neo-confederate]] movement of the 1980s and 1990s. During this time, notable paleoconservative argued that [[desegregation]], welfare, tolerance of gay rights, and church-state separation had been damaging to local communities, and that these issues had been imposed by federal legislatures and think tanks. Paleoconservatives also claimed the [[Southern Agrarians]] as forebearers in this regard.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Hague |first1=Euan |last2=Beirich |first2=Heidi |last3=Sebesta |first3=Edward H. |title=Neo-Confederacy: A Critical Introduction |date=2009 |publisher=University of Texas Press |isbn=9780292779211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LfWdaR9wHEEC |accessdate=3 December 2018 |language=en |pages=25\u201327}}</ref>\n\n=== Alt-right ===\nThe [[alt-right]] movement emerged out of the younger generation of paleoconservatives.

One Nation was founded in 1997, by [[Australian Parliament|member of parliament]] [[Pauline Hanson]] and her advisors [[David Ettridge]] and [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] after Hanson was disendorsed as a federal candidate for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. The disendorsement came before the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]] because of comments she made about [[Indigenous Australians]]. Hanson sat as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] for one year before forming Pauline Hanson's One Nation.\n\nFederally, no One Nation candidate has ever been elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (Hanson was already a member of the House when One Nation was formed). However, one candidate from the party was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], and four One Nation senators were elected in the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]]. In state politics, however, One Nation has performed better. At the [[1998 Queensland state election]] the party gained more than 22% of the vote in Queensland's [[unicameral]] [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|legislative assembly]], winning 11 of the 89 seats. David Oldfield was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] as a One Nation candidate, but he was expelled from the party and later formed the unsuccessful splinter group, [[One Nation NSW]]. Three members were elected to the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].\n\nOne Nation changed its name back to \"Pauline Hanson's One Nation\" in June 2015.\n\nAt the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]] the party polled 4.3% (+3.8) of the nationwide primary vote in the Senate. Only Queensland polled higher for the party than their nationwide percentage \u2212 the party polled 9.2% (+8.6) of the primary vote in that state. [[Pauline Hanson]] (QLD) and three other One Nation candidates \u2212 [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] (QLD), [[Brian Burston]] (NSW) and [[Rod Culleton]] (WA) were elected to the Senate. Elected to the [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016|3rd Queensland Senate spot]], as per convention Hanson is serving a six-year term while the three other One Nation Senators who were elected in the last half of spots were appointed to three-year terms. Culleton was stripped of his seat in January 2017 after he was declared bankrupt. In March 2017, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruled that Culleton's election to the Senate was invalid in any event because of a criminal conviction in New South Wales. After a court-ordered recount, Culleton was replaced by the second candidate on the WA list, [[Peter Georgiou]].\n\nFormer [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] leader [[Mark Latham]] joined the party in November 2018 as leader for New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-07/mark-latham-joins-pauline-hanson-and-one-nation/10471078 |title=Mark Latham confirms political comeback with One Nation |last=McKinnell |first=Jamie |last2=Sas |first2=Nick |date=2018-11-07 |website=ABC News |language=en-AU |access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> He successfully contested a seat in the Legislative Council, winning it in March 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-23/mark-latham-wins-nsw-upper-house-seat/10923460 |title='Extraordinary personal triumph': Latham to return after One Nation wins Upper House seat |last=Trigger |first=Rebecca |date=2019-03-23 |website=ABC News |language=en-AU |access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe party has a strongly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] platform.

The term \"One Nation\" was last used in Australian political life to describe a tax reform package in the early 1990s by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] (1991\u201396), whose culturally-cosmopolitan, Asia-centric (internationalist), free-trade, and pro-[[affirmative action]] policies were completely antithetical to what supporters of the later One Nation party formed in the late 1990s stood for.\n\nArguing that other political parties were out of touch with mainstream Australia, One Nation ran on a broadly populist and protectionist platform. It promised to drastically reduce immigration and to abolish \"divisive and discriminatory policies&nbsp;... attached to Aboriginal and multicultural affairs.\" Condemning multiculturalism as a \"threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values\", One Nation rallied against liberal government immigration and multicultural policies which, it argued, were leading to \"the Asianisation of Australia.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Malcolm Farnsworth |url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |title=One Nation's Immigration, Population and Social Cohesion Policy 1998 |accessdate=19 September 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702185221/http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |archivedate=2 July 2003  }}</ref> The party also denounced [[economic rationalism]] and [[globalisation]], reflecting working-class dissatisfaction with the neo-liberal economic policies embraced by the major parties.

This was still enough to deny Labor a majority, as 7 One Nation seats would have gone to Labor if not for leakage of Coalition preferences. Subsequently, the One Nation contingent in the Queensland Parliament split, with dissident members forming the rival [[City Country Alliance|City-Country Alliance]] in late 1999.<ref name=\"apg\">{{cite book |title=Australian Politics and Government: The Commonwealth, the States and Territories |last=Wanna |first=John |editor-first=Campbell |editor-last=Moon |editor2-first=Jeremy |editor2-last=Sharman |chapter=Queensland |year=2003 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |location=Cambridge, United Kingdom |isbn=0521825075 |page=92 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37Sel9HEYgUC |accessdate=26 July 2012}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], Hanson contested the new seat of [[Division of Blair|Blair]] after a redistribution effectively split Oxley in half. Hanson lost to [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate [[Cameron Thompson]], and One Nation candidate in Oxley lost the seat to ALP candidate [[Bernie Ripoll]], but One Nation candidate [[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]] was elected as a senator for Queensland. Hill's eligibility to sit as a senator was successfully challenged (see ''[[Sue v Hill]]'' for information on the case) under the [[Australian Constitution]] on the basis that she had failed to renounce her childhood British citizenship, despite being a naturalised Australian citizen. The seat went to the party's [[Len Harris (politician)|Len Harris]] following a recount.\n\nPolitical scientists [[Ian McAllister (political scientist)|Ian McAllister]] and Clive Bean, in an analysis of the 1998 federal election, found that although it was assumed that One Nation supporters came from a traditionally conservative demographic, instead:\n\n{{quote|\"... in a number of significant respects it in fact tends more towards [[Australian Labor Party|Labor\u2019s]] profile instead.

Lawsuits involving ex-members forced Hanson to repay approximately [[A$]]500,000 of public funding won at the 1998 Queensland election amid claims that the party was fraudulently registered. The suits alleged that the party was undemocratically constituted in order to concentrate all power in the hands of three people\u2014Hanson, Ettridge and Oldfield (in particular Oldfield)\u2014and that it technically had only two members: Ettridge and Hanson. Even though Hanson's fraud charges were dropped, the Electoral Commission of Queensland never reimbursed Hanson for the monies that they collected from the claim.\n\nThe first Annual General Meeting of the One Nation party was held in April 1999, which critic Paul Reynolds said demonstrated that One Nation lacked organisation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rutherford|first1=Jennifer|title=One Love Too Many: The Undoing of Pauline Hanson|journal=[[Australian Journal of Politics and History]]|date=June 2001|volume=47|issue=2|pages=192\u2013208|doi=10.1111/1467-8497.00227}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1999 New South Wales state election]], [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. In October 2000, Hanson expelled Oldfield from the party. Oldfield had been accused of abusing his authority, usurping power, and setting up alternative political parties under his control.{{clarify|date=September 2015}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} His expulsion created even more instability in a party which was constantly embroiled in scandal and internal strife. Oldfield engineered a split within the party, creating [[One Nation NSW]], in 2001. The new party took advantage of electoral party registration laws to register itself as a political party under the 'One Nation' name with the NSW electoral commission, and achieved registration in April 2002. This meant that the original One Nation party was unable to gain registration for NSW elections, and that any candidates which that party chose to represent them at state elections could not use the party name. Consequently, the original One Nation could only contest Federal elections in NSW under the 'One Nation' banner, whilst the Oldfield group could present itself as 'One Nation' only at state elections.\n\nDisendorsed One Nation candidate [[Terry Sharples]] accused the party of not having the 500 members needed for registration, and called for the party to be deregistered, which was carried by the Supreme Court. Hanson appealed the verdict but was unsuccessful. Hanson and Ettridge were later charged with electoral fraud.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/research-and-publications/publications/misconduct/the-prosecution-of-pauline-hanson-and-david-ettridge-a-report-on-an-inquiry-into-issues-raised-in-a-resolution-of-parliament.pdf |title=The prosecution of Pauline Hanson and David Ettridge: a report on an inquiry into issues raised in a resolution of Parliament |date=January 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2017 |isbn=1-876986-21-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2001 Queensland state election]], One Nation won three seats and 8.69% of the primary vote. The City-Country Alliance lost all of its seats, and faded into irrelevance soon afterward.\n\nAt the [[2001 Western Australian state election|2001 state election in Western Australia]], One Nation won three seats in the state's Legislative Council. One Nation did not win any seats in state elections in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] or [[Tasmania]] in the following year.\n\nAt the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 federal election]], the party's vote fell from 9% to 5.5%. Hanson failed in her bid to win a Senate seat from Queensland, despite polling a strong 10% of the primary vote. Hanson failed to win a seat in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] at the 2003 state election, where she ran as an independent, with the support of the One Nation party. She polled less than 2% of the vote and withdrew from the party's leadership.\n\nAt the [[2004 Queensland state election]], One Nation polled less than 5% of the vote and its sole elected representative, [[Rosa Lee Long]], acted as an independent. One Nation attempted to defend its Queensland Senate seat at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]], but lost it (effectively to the National Party). Len Harris's Senate term expired on 30 June 2005.\n\nOn 8 February 2005, One Nation lost federal party status but was re-registered in time for the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. It still had state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. Subsequently, it created another state party in Western Australia. In the February 2005 [[2005 Western Australian state election|Western Australian state election]], the One Nation vote collapsed.\n\nIn the [[2006 South Australian state election]], six One Nation candidates stood for the lower house. Their highest levels of the primary vote was 4.1% in the district of [[electoral district of Hammond|Hammond]] and 2.7% in [[electoral district of Goyder|Goyder]], with the other four hovering around 1%. They attracted 0.8% (7559 votes) of the upper house vote. One Nation consequently won no seats in that election.\n\nIn the [[2006 Queensland state election]], the party contested four of 89 seats, and its vote collapsed. It suffered a swing of 4.3% to be left with just 0.6% of the vote. Its only remaining seat in the state (and country), [[Electoral district of Tablelands|Tablelands]], was retained with an increased majority by [[Rosa Lee Long]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/qld/2006/results/tabl.htm 2006 Queensland Election.

One Nation was founded in 1997, by [[Australian Parliament|member of parliament]] [[Pauline Hanson]] and her advisors [[David Ettridge]] and [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] after Hanson was disendorsed as a federal candidate for the [[Liberal Party of Australia]]. The disendorsement came before the [[1996 Australian federal election|1996 federal election]] because of comments she made about [[Indigenous Australians]]. Hanson sat as an [[Independent (politician)|independent]] for one year before forming Pauline Hanson's One Nation.\n\nFederally, no One Nation candidate has ever been elected to the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (Hanson was already a member of the House when One Nation was formed). However, one candidate from the party was elected to the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in the [[1998 Australian federal election|1998 federal election]], and four One Nation senators were elected in the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]]. In state politics, however, One Nation has performed better. At the [[1998 Queensland state election]] the party gained more than 22% of the vote in Queensland's [[unicameral]] [[Legislative Assembly of Queensland|legislative assembly]], winning 11 of the 89 seats. David Oldfield was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] as a One Nation candidate, but he was expelled from the party and later formed the unsuccessful splinter group, [[One Nation NSW]]. Three members were elected to the [[Western Australian Legislative Council]].\n\nOne Nation changed its name back to \"Pauline Hanson's One Nation\" in June 2015.\n\nAt the [[2016 Australian federal election|2016 federal election]] the party polled 4.3% (+3.8) of the nationwide primary vote in the Senate. Only Queensland polled higher for the party than their nationwide percentage \u2212 the party polled 9.2% (+8.6) of the primary vote in that state. [[Pauline Hanson]] (QLD) and three other One Nation candidates \u2212 [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] (QLD), [[Brian Burston]] (NSW) and [[Rod Culleton]] (WA) were elected to the Senate. Elected to the [[Senate results for the Australian federal election, 2016|3rd Queensland Senate spot]], as per convention Hanson is serving a six-year term while the three other One Nation Senators who were elected in the last half of spots were appointed to three-year terms. Culleton was stripped of his seat in January 2017 after he was declared bankrupt. In March 2017, the [[High Court of Australia|High Court]] ruled that Culleton's election to the Senate was invalid in any event because of a criminal conviction in New South Wales. After a court-ordered recount, Culleton was replaced by the second candidate on the WA list, [[Peter Georgiou]].\n\nFormer [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] leader [[Mark Latham]] joined the party in November 2018 as leader for New South Wales.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-11-07/mark-latham-joins-pauline-hanson-and-one-nation/10471078 |title=Mark Latham confirms political comeback with One Nation |last=McKinnell |first=Jamie |last2=Sas |first2=Nick |date=2018-11-07 |website=ABC News |language=en-AU |access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref> He successfully contested a seat in the Legislative Council, winning it in March 2019.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-03-23/mark-latham-wins-nsw-upper-house-seat/10923460 |title='Extraordinary personal triumph': Latham to return after One Nation wins Upper House seat |last=Trigger |first=Rebecca |date=2019-03-23 |website=ABC News |language=en-AU |access-date=2019-03-31}}</ref>\n\nThe party has a strongly [[Nationalism|nationalist]] platform.

The term \"One Nation\" was last used in Australian political life to describe a tax reform package in the early 1990s by the [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] government of Prime Minister [[Paul Keating]] (1991\u201396), whose culturally-cosmopolitan, Asia-centric (internationalist), free-trade, and pro-[[affirmative action]] policies were completely antithetical to what supporters of the later One Nation party formed in the late 1990s stood for.\n\nArguing that other political parties were out of touch with mainstream Australia, One Nation ran on a broadly populist and protectionist platform. It promised to drastically reduce immigration and to abolish \"divisive and discriminatory policies&nbsp;... attached to Aboriginal and multicultural affairs.\" Condemning multiculturalism as a \"threat to the very basis of the Australian culture, identity and shared values\", One Nation rallied against liberal government immigration and multicultural policies which, it argued, were leading to \"the Asianisation of Australia.\"<ref>{{cite web |author=Malcolm Farnsworth |url=http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |title=One Nation's Immigration, Population and Social Cohesion Policy 1998 |accessdate=19 September 2017 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030702185221/http://www.australianpolitics.com/parties/onenation/immigration-policy-98.shtml |archivedate=2 July 2003  }}</ref> The party also denounced [[economic rationalism]] and [[globalisation]], reflecting working-class dissatisfaction with the neo-liberal economic policies embraced by the major parties.

This was still enough to deny Labor a majority, as 7 One Nation seats would have gone to Labor if not for leakage of Coalition preferences.

Hanson lost to [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] candidate [[Cameron Thompson]], and One Nation candidate in Oxley lost the seat to ALP candidate [[Bernie Ripoll]], but One Nation candidate [[Heather Hill (politician)|Heather Hill]] was elected as a senator for Queensland. Hill's eligibility to sit as a senator was successfully challenged (see ''[[Sue v Hill]]'' for information on the case) under the [[Australian Constitution]] on the basis that she had failed to renounce her childhood British citizenship, despite being a naturalised Australian citizen. The seat went to the party's [[Len Harris (politician)|Len Harris]] following a recount.\n\nPolitical scientists [[Ian McAllister (political scientist)|Ian McAllister]] and Clive Bean, in an analysis of the 1998 federal election, found that although it was assumed that One Nation supporters came from a traditionally conservative demographic, instead:\n\n{{quote|\"... in a number of significant respects it in fact tends more towards [[Australian Labor Party|Labor\u2019s]] profile instead.

Lawsuits involving ex-members forced Hanson to repay approximately [[A$]]500,000 of public funding won at the 1998 Queensland election amid claims that the party was fraudulently registered. The suits alleged that the party was undemocratically constituted in order to concentrate all power in the hands of three people\u2014Hanson, Ettridge and Oldfield (in particular Oldfield)\u2014and that it technically had only two members: Ettridge and Hanson. Even though Hanson's fraud charges were dropped, the Electoral Commission of Queensland never reimbursed Hanson for the monies that they collected from the claim.\n\nThe first Annual General Meeting of the One Nation party was held in April 1999, which critic Paul Reynolds said demonstrated that One Nation lacked organisation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rutherford|first1=Jennifer|title=One Love Too Many: The Undoing of Pauline Hanson|journal=[[Australian Journal of Politics and History]]|date=June 2001|volume=47|issue=2|pages=192\u2013208|doi=10.1111/1467-8497.00227}}</ref>\n\nAt the [[1999 New South Wales state election]], [[David Oldfield (politician)|David Oldfield]] was elected to the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]]. In October 2000, Hanson expelled Oldfield from the party. Oldfield had been accused of abusing his authority, usurping power, and setting up alternative political parties under his control.{{clarify|date=September 2015}}{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} His expulsion created even more instability in a party which was constantly embroiled in scandal and internal strife. Oldfield engineered a split within the party, creating [[One Nation NSW]], in 2001. The new party took advantage of electoral party registration laws to register itself as a political party under the 'One Nation' name with the NSW electoral commission, and achieved registration in April 2002. This meant that the original One Nation party was unable to gain registration for NSW elections, and that any candidates which that party chose to represent them at state elections could not use the party name. Consequently, the original One Nation could only contest Federal elections in NSW under the 'One Nation' banner, whilst the Oldfield group could present itself as 'One Nation' only at state elections.\n\nDisendorsed One Nation candidate [[Terry Sharples]] accused the party of not having the 500 members needed for registration, and called for the party to be deregistered, which was carried by the Supreme Court. Hanson appealed the verdict but was unsuccessful. Hanson and Ettridge were later charged with electoral fraud.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.ccc.qld.gov.au/research-and-publications/publications/misconduct/the-prosecution-of-pauline-hanson-and-david-ettridge-a-report-on-an-inquiry-into-issues-raised-in-a-resolution-of-parliament.pdf |title=The prosecution of Pauline Hanson and David Ettridge: a report on an inquiry into issues raised in a resolution of Parliament |date=January 2004 |accessdate=8 January 2017 |isbn=1-876986-21-2}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[2001 Queensland state election]], One Nation won three seats and 8.69% of the primary vote. The City-Country Alliance lost all of its seats, and faded into irrelevance soon afterward.\n\nAt the [[2001 Western Australian state election|2001 state election in Western Australia]], One Nation won three seats in the state's Legislative Council. One Nation did not win any seats in state elections in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[South Australia]] or [[Tasmania]] in the following year.\n\nAt the [[2001 Australian federal election|2001 federal election]], the party's vote fell from 9% to 5.5%. Hanson failed in her bid to win a Senate seat from Queensland, despite polling a strong 10% of the primary vote. Hanson failed to win a seat in the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]] at the 2003 state election, where she ran as an independent, with the support of the One Nation party. She polled less than 2% of the vote and withdrew from the party's leadership.\n\nAt the [[2004 Queensland state election]], One Nation polled less than 5% of the vote and its sole elected representative, [[Rosa Lee Long]], acted as an independent. One Nation attempted to defend its Queensland Senate seat at the [[2004 Australian federal election|2004 federal election]], but lost it (effectively to the National Party). Len Harris's Senate term expired on 30 June 2005.\n\nOn 8 February 2005, One Nation lost federal party status but was re-registered in time for the [[2007 Australian federal election|2007 federal election]]. It still had state parties in Queensland and New South Wales. Subsequently, it created another state party in Western Australia. In the February 2005 [[2005 Western Australian state election|Western Australian state election]], the One Nation vote collapsed.\n\nIn the [[2006 South Australian state election]], six One Nation candidates stood for the lower house. Their highest levels of the primary vote was 4.1% in the district of [[electoral district of Hammond|Hammond]] and 2.7% in [[electoral district of Goyder|Goyder]], with the other four hovering around 1%. They attracted 0.8% (7559 votes) of the upper house vote. One Nation consequently won no seats in that election.\n\nIn the [[2006 Queensland state election]], the party contested four of 89 seats, and its vote collapsed. It suffered a swing of 4.3% to be left with just 0.6% of the vote. Its only remaining seat in the state (and country), [[Electoral district of Tablelands|Tablelands]], was retained with an increased majority by [[Rosa Lee Long]].<ref>[http://www.abc.net.au/elections/qld/2006/results/tabl.htm 2006 Queensland Election.

The rapid rise of the party revealed a substantial number of discontented voters dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\nIn the prologue to her autobiography ''Untamed and Unashamed'', Hanson cites the Howard government's adoption of her policies as an attempt to win back One Nation voters to the Liberal and National parties, stating \"the very same policies I advocated back then&nbsp;... are being advocated today by the federal government\".<ref>Hanson, Pauline.

The first Italian establishment in the area was the purchase of  [[Assab]] by the [[Societ\u00e0 di Navigazione Rubattino|Rubattino Shipping Company]] in 1869, which came under government control in 1882. Occupation of [[Massawa]] in 1885 and the subsequent [[Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889|expansion of territory]] would gradually engulf the region and in 1889 borders with the [[Ethiopian Empire]] were defined in the [[Treaty of Wuchale]]. In 1890 the Colony of Eritrea ({{lang-it|Colonia Eritrea}}) was officially founded.\n\nIn 1936 the region was integrated into [[Italian East Africa]] as the [[Eritrea Governorate]]. This would last until Italy's loss of the region in 1941, during the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Italian Eritrea then came under [[#British Military Administration and the end of the colony|British military administration]], which in 1951 fell under [[United Nations]] supervision. In September 1952 it became an [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|an autonomous part of Ethiopia.]]\n\n==History==\n===Acquisition of Assab and creation of the colony===\n{{see also|Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889}}\n{{History of Eritrea}}\nThe leading figure of the early history of Italian enterprises in the [[Red Sea]] was Giuseppe Sapeto. When a young monk, preparing himself in Cairo for missionary work, he had been dispatched in 1837 into [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Afterward, he became an active advocate of European penetration, initially encouraging the French to establish themselves in the area. After 1866, following the political unification of Italy, he sought to develop Italian influence instead. As the [[Suez Canal]] neared completion, he began to visualize the establishment of a coaling station and port of call for Italian steamships in the Red Sea. Sapeto won over the Italian minister for foreign affairs, and [[King Victor Emmanuel II]], to whom he explained his ideas.\n[[File:Assab 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Italian settlement at Assab, 1880]]\nIn the autumn of 1869 he,  together with [[Alfredo Acton|Admiral Acton]], was sent by the government to the Red Sea to choose a suitable port and arrange for its sale. This he did by paying a small deposit to the [[Afar people|Danakil]] chiefs at Assab Bay in return for their promise to sell their territory to him on his return. Meanwhile, the government had been in touch with [[Raffaele Rubattino]], whose company was planning to establish a steamship line through the newly opened Suez Canal and the Red Sea to India. It was agreed that the company would buy the territory in its own name and with its own funds, but should undertake to use it in the national interest. Sapeto returned to the Red Sea on behalf of the company, completed the purchase and bought more land to the south.\n\nBy March 1870, an Italian shipping company had thus become claimant to territory at the northern end of Assab Bay, a deserted but spacious bay about half-way between Annesley Bay to the north and Obock to the South.<ref>Agatha Ramm, \"Great Britain and the Planting of Italian Power in the Red Sea, 1868-1885\", ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 59, No. 234 (May, 1944), p. 214\u2013215.</ref> However, the area, \u2014 which had been long dominated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Egypt/3 History |display=Egypt: Section III: History |volume=9 |page=90\u2013119}}</ref>\u2014 was not settled by the Italians until 1880.<ref name=EBAb>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea |volume=9 |page=747}}</ref> Two years later, Italy formally took possession of the nascent colony from its commercial owners.\n\nMost of the western coast of the Red Sea was then formally claimed by the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] (under the notional rule of the [[Ottoman Turkish Empire]], who held the eastern coast) but the region was thrown into chaos by major Egyptian defeats in the [[Ethio-Egyptian War]] and by the success of [[Muhammad Ahmad|the Mahdi]]'s uprising in the [[Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]]. In 1884, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Hewett Treaty|Hewett&nbsp;Treaty]] promised the [[Bogos]]\u2014the [[Eritrean Highlands|highlands]] of modern [[Eritrea]]\u2014and free access to the [[Massawa]]n coast to [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV]] in exchange for his help evacuating garrisons from the Sudan;<ref>Wylde, Augustus B.

His subsequent victory over his rival kings and enthronement as [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Menelik II of Ethiopia|Menelek&nbsp;II]] (r.&nbsp;1889&ndash;1913) made the treaty formally binding upon the entire country.\n\nOnce established, however, Menelik took a dim view towards Italian involvement with local leaders in his northern province of [[Tigray Province|Tigray]];<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |volume=1 |page=94}}</ref> while the Italians, for their part, felt bound to involvement given the regular Tigrayan raiding of tribes within their colony's protectorate<ref name=EBE/> and the Tigrayan leaders themselves continued to claim the provinces now held by Italy. Negotiations with the French over a [[Imperial Ethiopian Railway|railway]] brought things to a head: the [[Italian language|Italian]]{{mdash}}but ''not'' [[Amharic language|Amharic]]{{mdash}}version of the Treaty of Wuchale had prohibited Ethiopia with foreign negotiations except through Italy, effectively making the realm an Italian [[protectorate]]. Secure both domestically and militarily (thanks to arms shipments via [[French Third Republic|French]] [[Djibouti (city)|Djibouti]] and [[Harar]]), Menelik denounced the treaty in whole and the [[First Italo-Ethiopian War|ensuing war]], culminating in Italy's disastrous defeat at [[Battle of Adwa|Adwa]], ended their hopes of annexing Ethiopia for a time.\n\nDuring the late twentieth century Assab would become [[Ethiopia]]'s main port, but it was long overshadowed by nearby [[Djibouti]], whose [[Imperial Ethiopian Railway|railway]] (completed to [[Dire Dawa|Dire&nbsp;Dawa]] in 1902) permitted it to quickly supplant traditional [[Caravan route|caravan]]-based routes to [[Assab]]<ref name=EBE/> and [[Zeila]].<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Abyssinia |display=Abyssinia: Trade and Currency |volume=1 |page=87}}</ref><ref name=EBZ>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Zaila |volume=28 |page=950}}</ref><ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Somaliland#French Somaliland |display=Somaliland: French Somaliland |volume=25 |pages=382\u2013383}}</ref> [[Massawa]] remained the primary port for most of northern Ethiopia, but its relatively high customs dues, dependence on caravans, and political antagonism limited the volume on its trade with Ethiopia.<ref name=EBE>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Eritrea#Trade |display=Eritrea: Agriculture and Trade|volume=9 |page=746}}</ref>\n\nSeeking to develop their own lands, the Italian government launched the first development projects in the new colony in the late 1880s.

In the year 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens, some even moved from the villages to work in the factories.The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities.

Indeed, the best Italian colonial troops were the [[Eritrean Ascari]], as stated by Italian Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] and legendary officer [[Amedeo Guillet]].<ref>[http://www.comandosupremo.com/Guillett.html Amedeo Guillet in Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509182833/http://www.comandosupremo.com/Guillett.html |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref> Furthermore, after [[World War I]], service with the Ascari become the main source of paid employment for the indigenous male population of Italian Eritrea.

This fact made Asmara the main \"Italian town\" of the [[Italian empire]] in Africa. Furthermore, because of the Italian architecture of the city, Asmara was called ''Piccola Roma'' (Little Rome).<ref>[http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/01/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf Italian architectural planification of Asmara (in Italian) p. 64-66]</ref> The total number of Italians in all of Eritrea was 75,000 in that year.<ref>[http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm Italians in 1939 Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220153314/http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}</ref>\n\nAsmara was known to be an exceptionally modern city, not only because of its architecture, but Asmara also had more traffic lights than Rome did when the city was being built. The city incorporates many features of a planned city. Indeed, Asmara was an early example of an ideal modern city created by architects, an idea which was introduced into many cities across the world, such as [[Brasilia]], but which was not altogether popular. Features include designated city zoning and planning, wide treed boulevards, political areas and districts and space and scope for development. Asmara was not built for the Eritreans however; the Italians built it primarily for themselves and made the city a typical Italian city with even its own car race (called the [[Asmara circuit]]).\n\nThe city has been regarded as \"New Rome\" due to its quintessential Italian touch, not only for the architecture but also for the wide streets, piazzas and coffee bars. While the boulevards are lined with palms and indigenous ''shiba'kha'' trees, there are numerable [[pizza|pizzerias]] and coffee bars, serving cappuccinos and lattes, as well as [[ice cream]] parlours.\n\nMany industrial investments were endorsed by the Italians in the area of Asmara and [[Italian Massaua|Massawa]], but the beginning of [[World War II]] stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea.<ref>[http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm Italian industries and companies in Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm |date=2009-04-29 }}</ref>\n\n===British Military Administration and the end of the colony===\n{{Infobox country\n| conventional_long_name                = British Military Administration in Eritrea\n| image_flag                = Flag of the United Kingdom.svg\n| flag_caption                = Flag\n| government_type                = {{nowrap|[[United Kingdom|British]] [[military administration]]}}\n| currency                = [[Pound sterling|pound]]\n| life_span              = 1941-1952\n|event_start         = [[East African campaign (World War II)|Established]]\n|date_start          = 19 May 1941\n|event1              = [[United Nations|UN]] supervision\n|date_event1         = 19 February 1951\n|event_end           = {{nowrap|[[Eritrean Autonomous State]]}}\n|year_end            = 15 September 1952\n|title_leader         = Military Administrator\n|leader1              = [[William Platt]]\n|year_leader1         = 1941&ndash;1942\n|leader2              = [[Stephen Hemsley Longrigg|Stephen Longrigg]]\n|year_leader2         = 1942&ndash;1944\n|leader3              = [[Charles D'Arcy McCarthy|Charles McCarthy]]\n|year_leader3         = 1944&ndash;1945\n|leader4              = [[John Meredith Benoy|John Benoy]]\n|year_leader4         = 1945&ndash;1946\n|leader5              = [[Francis Greville Drew|Francis Drew ]]\n|year_leader5         = 1946&ndash;1951\n|title_representative = UN High Commissioner\n|representative1      = [[Eduardo Anze Matienzo]]\n|year_representative1 = 1951&ndash;1952\n|title_deputy         = Chief Administrator\n|deputy1              = [[Duncan Cameron Cumming|Duncan Cumming]]\n|year_deputy1         = 1951&ndash;1952\n| p1                = Italian East Africa\n| s1                = Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea\n| flag_p1                = Flag of Italy (1861-1946) crowned.svg\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Eritrea (1952-1961).svg\n}}\nWhen the British army [[East African Campaign (World War II)|conquered Eritrea]] in January 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged and the remaining ones (like the Asmara-Massawa Cableway) were successively removed and sent toward India and British possessions in Africa as a war booty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&pg=PA490&lpg=PA490&dq=eritrea+italian+colony+1882+1941&source=web&ots=IuwHpljurX&sig=cW8fP4OVx1_ppGWnfY2ilmYoknw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result|title=Encyclopedia of African History: A - G.. 1|author=|date=8 April 2018|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla war]] was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops (like the \"hero\" of Eritrean independence, [[Hamid Idris Awate]]) <ref>Rosselli, Alberto.

Eritrea was placed under [[British Empire|British]] military administration after the Italian surrender in [[World War II]].\n\nThe Italians in Eritrea started to move away from the country after the defeat of the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861\u20131946)|Kingdom of Italy]] by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]], and by the time of the British census of 1949 Asmara had only 17,183 Italian Eritreans of a total population of 127,579. Most Italian settlers left for Italy, with others to United States, Middle East, and Australia.\n\nThe British maintained initially the Italian administration of Eritrea, but the country soon started to be involved in a violent process of independence (from the British in the late forties and after 1952 from the Ethiopians, who annexed Eritrea in that year).\n\nDuring the last years of [[World War II]] some Italian Eritreans like Dr. [[Vincenzo DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]] defended politically the presence of Italians in Eritrea and successively promoted the independence of Eritrea.<ref>Franco Bandini. ''Gli italiani in Africa, storia delle guerre coloniali 1882-1943'' p. 67</ref> He went to [[Rome]] to participate in a Conference for the independence of Eritrea, promoted by the Vatican.\n\nAfter the war Di Meglio was named Director of the \"Comitato Rappresentativo Italiani dell' Eritrea\" (CRIE). In 1947  he supported the creation of the ''\"Associazione Italo-Eritrei\"'' and the ''\"Associazione Veterani Ascari\"'', in order to get alliance with the Eritreans favorable to [[Italy]] in Eritrea.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ilcornodafrica.it/st-sci03.htm|title=Nuova pagina 1|author=|date=|website=www.ilcornodafrica.it|accessdate=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\nAs a result of these creations, he cofounded the ''\"Partito Eritrea Pro Italia\"'' (Party of Shara Italy) in September 1947, an Eritrean political Party favorable to the Italian presence in Eritrea that obtained more than 200,000 inscriptions of membership in one single month.\n\nIndeed, the Italian Eritreans strongly rejected the [[Ethiopia]]n annexation of Eritrea after the war: the \"Party of Shara Italy\" was established in Asmara in 1947 and the majority of the members were former Italian soldiers with many [[Eritrean Ascari]] (the organization was even backed up by the government of Italy).\n\nThe main objective of this party was Eritrean freedom, but they had a pre-condition that stated that before independence the country should be governed by Italy for at least 15 years.\n\nWith the Peace Treaty of 1947  [[Italy]] officially accepted the end of the colony. As a consequence the Italian community started to disappear, mainly after the [[Ethiopian Empire|Ethiopian]]n government took control of Eritrea.\n\nHowever some Italo-Eritrean were welcomed by the Ethiopian government, like the brothers [[Italo Vassalo]] and [[Luciano Vassalo]], champions of football who won the [[1962 African Cup of Nations]].\n\n[[File:IndipendenzaEritrea.png|thumb|200px|right|Vincenzo di Meglio (second from right) at the 1949 Conference for Eritrean independence in the Vatican]]\n[[File:Asmara-Panorama 3.jpeg|thumb|right|Modern downtown Asmara, called ''Piccola Roma'', featuring Italian-style buildings]]\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Eritrea}}\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Italian Eritreans]]\n* [[Italian Colonial Empire]]\n* [[Eritrea Governorate]]\n* [[Asmara, Eritrea|Italian Asmara]]\n* [[Cinema Impero]]\n* [[Asmara President's Office]]\n* [[Fiat Tagliero Building]]\n* [[David DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]]\n* [[Eritrean Ascari]]\n* [[Roman Catholicism in Eritrea]]\n* [[Linea dell'Impero]]\n* [[Asmara circuit]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n{{div col}}\n* {{citation |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |author=[[Archivio Storico Diplomatico]] |location=Rome |url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/servizi/uapsds/storico_diplom/inventarionline.html |language=it |title= Inventario dell'Archivio Storico del Ministero Africa Italiana |volume=1: Eritrea, Etiopia, Somalia (1857-1939) |year= 1975 }} \n* {{citation |publisher= Ministry of Foreign Affairs |author=Archivio Storico Diplomatico |location=Rome |url=http://www.esteri.it/mae/it/ministero/servizi/uapsds/storico_diplom/inventarionline.html |language=it |title= Inventario dell'Archivio Eritrea (1880-1945) |year= 1977 }}\n* Bandini, Franco.

The first Italian establishment in the area was the purchase of  [[Assab]] by the [[Societ\u00e0 di Navigazione Rubattino|Rubattino Shipping Company]] in 1869, which came under government control in 1882. Occupation of [[Massawa]] in 1885 and the subsequent [[Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889|expansion of territory]] would gradually engulf the region and in 1889 borders with the [[Ethiopian Empire]] were defined in the [[Treaty of Wuchale]]. In 1890 the Colony of Eritrea ({{lang-it|Colonia Eritrea}}) was officially founded.\n\nIn 1936, the region was integrated into [[Italian East Africa]] as the [[Eritrea Governorate]]. This would last until Italy's loss of the region in 1941, during the [[East African campaign (World War II)|East African campaign]] of [[World War II]]. Italian Eritrea then came under [[#British Military Administration and the end of the colony|British military administration]], which in 1951 fell under [[United Nations]] supervision. In September 1952 it became an [[Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea|an autonomous part of Ethiopia.]]\n\n==History==\n===Acquisition of Assab and creation of the colony===\n{{see also|Italo-Ethiopian War of 1887\u20131889}}\n{{History of Eritrea}}\nThe leading figure of the early history of Italian enterprises in the [[Red Sea]] was Giuseppe Sapeto. When a young monk, preparing himself in Cairo for missionary work, he had been dispatched in 1837 into [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]]. Afterward, he became an active advocate of European penetration, initially encouraging the French to establish themselves in the area. After 1866, following the political unification of Italy, he sought to develop Italian influence instead. As the [[Suez Canal]] neared completion, he began to visualize the establishment of a coaling station and port of call for Italian steamships in the Red Sea. Sapeto won over the Italian minister for foreign affairs, and [[King Victor Emmanuel II]], to whom he explained his ideas.\n[[File:Assab 1880.jpg|thumb|left|Italian settlement at Assab, 1880]]\nIn the autumn of 1869 he,  together with [[Alfredo Acton|Admiral Acton]], was sent by the government to the Red Sea to choose a suitable port and arrange for its sale. This he did by paying a small deposit to the [[Afar people|Danakil]] chiefs at Assab Bay in return for their promise to sell their territory to him on his return. Meanwhile, the government had been in touch with [[Raffaele Rubattino]], whose company was planning to establish a steamship line through the newly opened Suez Canal and the Red Sea to India. It was agreed that the company would buy the territory in its own name and with its own funds, but should undertake to use it in the national interest. Sapeto returned to the Red Sea on behalf of the company, completed the purchase and bought more land to the south.\n\nBy March 1870, an Italian shipping company had thus become claimant to territory at the northern end of Assab Bay, a deserted but spacious bay about half-way between Annesley Bay to the north and Obock to the South.<ref>Agatha Ramm, \"Great Britain and the Planting of Italian Power in the Red Sea, 1868-1885\", ''The English Historical Review'', Vol. 59, No. 234 (May, 1944), p. 214\u2013215.</ref> However, the area, \u2014 which had been long dominated by the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Khedivate of Egypt|Egypt]]<ref>{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Egypt/3 History |display=Egypt: Section III: History |volume=9 |page=90\u2013119}}</ref>\u2014 was not settled by the Italians until 1880.<ref name=EBAb>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Eritrea |volume=9 |page=747}}</ref> Two years later, Italy formally took possession of the nascent colony from its commercial owners.\n\nMost of the western coast of the Red Sea was then formally claimed by the [[Khedivate of Egypt]] (under the notional rule of the [[Ottoman Turkish Empire]], who held the eastern coast) but the region was thrown into chaos by major Egyptian defeats in the [[Ethio-Egyptian War]] and by the success of [[Muhammad Ahmad|the Mahdi]]'s uprising in the [[Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]]. In 1884, the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] [[Hewett Treaty|Hewett&nbsp;Treaty]] promised the [[Bogos]]\u2014the [[Eritrean Highlands|highlands]] of modern [[Eritrea]]\u2014and free access to the [[Massawa]]n coast to [[emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] [[Yohannes IV]] in exchange for his help evacuating garrisons from the Sudan;<ref>Wylde, Augustus B.

In the year 1939, there were around 2,198 factories and most of the employees were Eritrean citizens, some even moved from the villages to work in the factories.The establishment of industries also made an increase in the number of both Italians and Eritreans residing in the cities.

Even in [[World War II]] the Italians used Eritrea to attack [[Sudan]] and occupy the [[Kassala]] area. Indeed, the best Italian colonial troops were the [[Eritrean Ascari]], as stated by Italian Marshall [[Rodolfo Graziani]] and legendary officer [[Amedeo Guillet]].<ref>[http://www.comandosupremo.com/Guillett.html Amedeo Guillet in Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080509182833/http://www.comandosupremo.com/Guillett.html |date=2008-05-09 }}</ref> Furthermore, after [[World War I]], service with the Ascari become the main source of paid employment for the indigenous male population of Italian Eritrea.

This fact made Asmara the main \"Italian town\" of the [[Italian empire]] in Africa. Furthermore, because of the Italian architecture of the city, Asmara was called ''Piccola Roma'' (Little Rome).<ref>[http://www.fedoa.unina.it/1881/01/Santoianni_Progettazione_Architettonica.pdf Italian architectural planification of Asmara (in Italian) p. 64-66]</ref> The total number of Italians in all of Eritrea was 75,000 in that year.<ref>[http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm Italians in 1939 Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220153314/http://www.maitacli.it/arg_menu/italiani/elenco.htm |date=2009-02-20 }}</ref>\n\nAsmara was known to be an exceptionally modern city, not only because of its architecture, but Asmara also had more traffic lights than Rome did when the city was being built. The city incorporates many features of a planned city. Indeed, Asmara was an early example of an ideal modern city created by architects, an idea which was introduced into many cities across the world, such as [[Brasilia]], but which was not altogether popular. Features include designated city zoning and planning, wide treed boulevards, political areas and districts and space and scope for development. Asmara was not built for the Eritreans however; the Italians built it primarily for themselves and made the city a typical Italian city with even its own car race (called the [[Asmara circuit]]).\n\nThe city has been regarded as \"New Rome\" due to its quintessential Italian touch, not only for the architecture but also for the wide streets, piazzas and coffee bars. While the boulevards are lined with palms and indigenous ''shiba'kha'' trees, there are numerable [[pizza|pizzerias]] and coffee bars, serving cappuccinos and lattes, as well as [[ice cream]] parlours.\n\nMany industrial investments were endorsed by the Italians in the area of Asmara and [[Italian Massaua|Massawa]], but the beginning of [[World War II]] stopped the blossoming industrialization of Eritrea.<ref>[http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm Italian industries and companies in Eritrea] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429102012/http://www.dankalia.com/history/04503.htm |date=2009-04-29 }}</ref>\n\n===British Military Administration and the end of the colony===\n{{Infobox country\n| conventional_long_name                = British Military Administration in Eritrea\n| image_flag                = Flag of the United Kingdom.svg\n| flag_caption                = Flag\n| government_type                = {{nowrap|[[United Kingdom|British]] [[military administration]]}}\n| currency                = [[Pound sterling|pound]]\n| life_span              = 1941-1952\n|event_start         = [[East African campaign (World War II)|Established]]\n|date_start          = 19 May 1941\n|event1              = [[United Nations|UN]] supervision\n|date_event1         = 19 February 1951\n|event_end           = {{nowrap|[[Eritrean Autonomous State]]}}\n|year_end            = 15 September 1952\n|title_leader         = Military Administrator\n|leader1              = [[William Platt]]\n|year_leader1         = 1941&ndash;1942\n|leader2              = [[Stephen Hemsley Longrigg|Stephen Longrigg]]\n|year_leader2         = 1942&ndash;1944\n|leader3              = [[Charles D'Arcy McCarthy|Charles McCarthy]]\n|year_leader3         = 1944&ndash;1945\n|leader4              = [[John Meredith Benoy|John Benoy]]\n|year_leader4         = 1945&ndash;1946\n|leader5              = [[Francis Greville Drew|Francis Drew ]]\n|year_leader5         = 1946&ndash;1951\n|title_representative = UN High Commissioner\n|representative1      = [[Eduardo Anze Matienzo]]\n|year_representative1 = 1951&ndash;1952\n|title_deputy         = Chief Administrator\n|deputy1              = [[Duncan Cameron Cumming|Duncan Cumming]]\n|year_deputy1         = 1951&ndash;1952\n| p1                = Italian East Africa\n| s1                = Federation of Ethiopia and Eritrea\n| flag_p1                = Flag of Italy (1861-1946) crowned.svg\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Eritrea (1952-1961).svg\n}}\nWhen the British army [[East African Campaign (World War II)|conquered Eritrea]] in January 1941, most of the infrastructure and the industrial areas were extremely damaged and the remaining ones (like the Asmara-Massawa Cableway) were successively removed and sent toward India and British possessions in Africa as a war booty.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ftz_gtO-pngC&pg=PA490&lpg=PA490&dq=eritrea+italian+colony+1882+1941&source=web&ots=IuwHpljurX&sig=cW8fP4OVx1_ppGWnfY2ilmYoknw&hl=en&sa=X&oi=book_result&resnum=3&ct=result|title=Encyclopedia of African History: A - G.. 1|author=|date=8 April 2018|publisher=Taylor & Francis|accessdate=8 April 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nThe following [[Italian guerrilla war in Ethiopia|Italian guerrilla war]] was supported by many Eritrean colonial troops (like the \"hero\" of Eritrean independence, [[Hamid Idris Awate]]) <ref>Rosselli, Alberto.

Most Italian settlers left for Italy, with others to United States, Middle East, and Australia.\n\nThe British maintained initially the Italian administration of Eritrea, but the country soon started to be involved in a violent process of independence (from the British in the late forties and after 1952 from the Ethiopians, who annexed Eritrea in that year).\n\nDuring the last years of [[World War II]] some Italian Eritreans like Dr. [[Vincenzo DiMeglio|Vincenzo Di Meglio]] defended politically the presence of Italians in Eritrea and successively promoted the independence of Eritrea.<ref>Franco Bandini.

He set up a studio in Amsterdam; the influence of life there, and traveling to the Eastern Mediterranean, gave him the idea of an ethnic ambient project.  Soon after, a debut album was announced, though Fulber's work as a [[record producer|producer]] and [[remix]]er eventually pushed its release to September 2002.\n\nThe [[eponym|self-titled]] album was a fusion of the electronic characteristics of Fulber's previous work\u2014[[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]-based, with rhythmic [[dance music|dance]] [[beat (music)|beats]]\u2014and the influences of [[Middle Eastern music]], which inspired [[ambient music|ambient]] melodies more reminiscent of Delerium.\n\nA number of songs were more [[pop music|pop]]-oriented and featured guest vocalists, primarily [[Ann Danielewski|Poe]] and [[Chemda]], the latter singing entirely in [[Arabic]]. [[Sin\u00e9ad O'Connor]] and [[Jeff Martin (Canadian musician)|Jeff Martin]] of [[The Tea Party]] were also featured.\n\nAfter returning to Front Line Assembly and Delerium, in 2005 Fulber released a second album entitled ''Extraordinary Ways''. This album utilized much more [[Contemporary music|contemporary]] sounds, including much greater prominence given to [[guitar]]s and [[trip hop]]-like beats. Vocalists included [[Tiff Lacey]], [[Ann Danielewski|Poe]] (credited as \"Jane\"), Chemda, Joanna Stevens,, and Fulber himself ([[cover version|covering]] a song by the punk band [[Buzzcocks]]).\n\nIn 2007, [[Germany]]'s biggest selling female pop star of the 80s [[Sandra (singer)|Sandra Cretu]] covered \"Sleep\" as a bonus track on her single \"[[The Way I Am (Sandra song)|The Way I Am]]\".\n\nThree bootleg albums of Conjure One have been widely circulated, mainly in Russia.  The first bootleg, titled 'Enigma \"Sleep\"', is the music of the first Conjure One album mixed with the first album by [[Enigma (German band)|Enigma]],  the song \"Sleep\" is labeled \"Enigma feat. Dido\", etc.  ''Reasons to Disturb'' is the second.  Although it contains a few newer Conjure One songs and remixes, the songs are actually renamed versions of songs by [[Poe (singer)|Poe]], [[Balligomingo]], and [[Fauxliage]], among others.
