This mostly due to the shell needing to meet the needs of its environment.  They vary depending on the exact location of them being in sea grass or in the rocks. Those located in seagrass are oftentimes smaller and have a steeper arch then their counterparts located in rocky areas. The snail varies in shades of cocoa, often having spots or streaks on the shell. Rarely do some have purple tints near the apex.

During its life it will pass through 5 sexual phases. The immature phase where it is in the larval stage and has no need to start sexual reproduction but shows a slight rise on the right side of the neck where the phallus will later grow. Next when hatched the snail will be in what is called the \u201cPhallus Bud\u201d stage which is the forming of the male sexual organ and may have a \u201cpeg-like\u201d phallus. Soon after it will have developed a full phallus and be deemed a \u201cMale\u201d, where it can start the sexual reproduction process and fertilize its female counterparts. Later on it will start to change and grow into a \u201cTransitional\u201d where the male starts to grow and loses the ability to fertilize and start to become female. Finally it will be a \u201cFemale\u201d which will be its final sexual phase. At that point it will be able to be inseminated and lay eggs and may have a remnant of a degenerate phallus.<ref name=Hendler>{{cite journal |last1=Hendler |first1=Gordon |last2=Franz |first2=David R. |title=Population Dynamics and Life History of ''Crepidula convexa'' Say (Gastropoda: Prosobranchia) in Delaware Bay|journal=The Biological Bulletin |date=December 1971 |volume=141 |issue=3 |page=514\u2013526 |jstor=1540265|doi= 10.2307/1540265}}</ref>\n\n==Breeding Pattern==  \nDuring a single breeding season the larger female will only have one male partner.
