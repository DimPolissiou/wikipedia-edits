Paleogene to Neogene rocks in Kansas consist of river silt, sand, freshwater limestones and some [[volcanic ash]] derived from [[volcanic eruption|eruptions]] in the western United States.

The Pennsylvanian and Permian bedrock is buried under thick deposits of glacial debris, largely loess. A variety of [[glacial erratic]]s were left by the melting glaciers. Many of these are of [[Sioux Quartzite]] carried south from the [[Sioux Falls, South Dakota]] area.<ref>http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/glacier/glacier.html Glaciated Region KGS</ref>\n\n===Wellington-McPherson Lowlands===\nThe Wellington-McPherson Lowlands of south central Kansas in [[Sumner County, Kansas|Sumner]], [[Sedgwick County, Kansas|Sedgwick]], [[Harvey County, Kansas|Harvey]] and [[McPherson County, Kansas|McPherson counties]] is underlain by fluvial sediments deposited in the ancestral [[Arkansas River]] valley during the Pleistocene Epoch one to two million years ago. The sediments consist largely of sands, silts and gravels. These include the \"Equus beds\" aquifer sediments, named for Pleistocene fossils it contains. Also under this area is the Permian Hutchinson salt bed which reaches a thickness of 400 feet. The area also contains inactive sand dunes.<ref name=Arkansas>http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/lowlands/lowlands.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607113611/http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Extension/lowlands/lowlands.html |date=2011-06-07 }} Arkansas River Lowlands and Wellington-McPherson Lowlands</ref>\n\n===Arkansas River Lowlands===\nThe Arkansas River Lowlands follows the course of the [[Arkansas River]] through southwest and south-central Kansas. The broad floodplain contains large quantities of sand and silt carried from the Rocky Mountains by the river. A significant area of sand dunes occur on the south side of the plain formed by the prevailing winds from the glaciers to the north during the Pleistocene.<ref name=Arkansas/>\n\n==Subsurface geology==\n[[File:Kansas Structure Map.png|thumb|350px|Subsurface structures of Kansas]]\nThe subsurface geology of Kansas consists of several sequences of sedimentary [[stratum|strata]] deposited on the [[Pre-Cambrian]] [[Basement (geology)|basement]] of the [[North American Craton]].\n\nSeveral regional subsurface structures including five [[sedimentary basin]]s exist under Kansas. These structures are important in controlling the vast deposits of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] in the state. The [[Central Kansas Uplift]] is a broad arch in the rocks of west central Kansas. The rock units within this arch have been major oil producers. The [[Anadarko Basin]] of southwest Kansas contains significant natural gas. The Sedgwick Basin, the Cherokee Basin and the Forest City Basin of south and east Kansas also produce petroleum and natural gas.<ref>http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/Oil/primer09.html Petroleum geology of Kansas KGS</ref>\n\n{{clear}}\n===Proterozoic basement===\n[[File:Humboldt Fault.svg|thumb|350px|Humboldt Fault (red) and Midcontinent Rift (green) in Kansas and Nebraska]]\nThe [[Nemaha Ridge|Nemaha uplift]] is a deep [[Fault (geology)|fault zone]] which runs diagonally across east Kansas and extends from just south of [[Omaha, Nebraska]] to [[Oklahoma City]]. This fault zone directly overlies a [[granite]] \"high\" in the Precambrian basement and is structurally active as the [[Humboldt Fault]]. Some fifty miles to the west the southernmost extension of the [[Proterozoic]] [[Midcontinent Rift System]] extends into northeastern Kansas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/pic3/pic3_4.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-02-17 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100128213910/http://www.kgs.ku.edu/Publications/pic3/pic3_4.html |archivedate=2010-01-28 }} Earthquakes in Kansas KGS</ref>\n\nThe northern two-thirds of Kansas is underlain by a Proterozoic sequence known as the Central Plains Orogen.
