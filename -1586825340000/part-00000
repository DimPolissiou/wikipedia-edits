While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and does not include much of the last half of the manga. The soundtrack, which draws heavily from traditional [[Music of Indonesia|Indonesian]] [[gamelan]] as well as Japanese [[noh]] music, was composed by [[Tsutomu \u014chashi|Sh\u014dji Yamashiro]] and performed by [[Geinoh Yamashirogumi]].\n\n''Akira'' premiered in Japan on July 16, 1988 by [[Toho]], but was initially unable to recoup its budget.

By 2019, Tokyo is rebuilt. Known as Neo-Tokyo, it is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence and is on the verge of collapse. During a massive protest, the hot-headed Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda leads his vigilante [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] motorcycle gang against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an esper (person with [[extrasensory perception]]) who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. The accident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] Colonel Shikishima. Assisted by esper Masaru, Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes Tetsuo with him, and arrests Kaneda and his gang. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist belonging to the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her and his gang.\n\nShikishima and his head of research, Doctor \u014cnishi, discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's destruction. Takashi's fellow esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction. However, Neo-Tokyo's parliament dismisses Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm.\n\nMeanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to flee Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend, Kaori. The Clowns ambush them, but after a severe beating are rescued by Kaneda's gang. During the intervention, however, Tetsuo begins suffering intense headaches and hallucinations, and he is returned to the hospital. Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell after overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers.\n\nAt the hospital, the espers confront Tetsuo, and he aggressively fights back with his psychokinetic powers and escapes. These powers are beginning to make him egomaniacal and unstable. Kaneda, Kei, and the resistance group infiltrate the hospital and are drawn into Shikishima and the espers' attempt to stop Tetsuo. He overpowers them all and flees the hospital after learning from Kiyoko that he can gain help from Akira, who is in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium construction site.\n\nKei and Kaneda escape military custody because of Kiyoko, who is hoping to stop Tetsuo using Kei as a medium. Shikishima stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the Neo-Tokyo government and directs all of its military forces to destroy Tetsuo. Tetsuo returns to his gang's former hangout, Harukiya Bar, to obtain drugs to control his powers. He murders the bartender and destroys the bar in the process. When his former friends Yamagata and Kai arrive and confront him, he cold-bloodedly slaughters Yamagata in front of Kai; Kaneda is informed by Kai of what happened and vows to avenge his friend. Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at Akira's [[cryogenic storage dewar]] under the stadium. Kiyoko has Kei fight Tetsuo, but he easily defeats her and exhumes Akira's remains. Using a laser rifle, Kaneda fights Tetsuo in a duel, and Shikishima fires an [[Space weapon|orbital weapon]] at him, but both fail to stop him.\n\nShikishima and Kaori approach the stadium to find Tetsuo in great pain; Shikishima offers to return Tetsuo to the hospital, heal his injuries, and help control his abilities, while Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo. However, Kaneda arrives and duels with Tetsuo again. Unable to control his powers, Tetsuo mutates into a gigantic mass, consuming all matter, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass grows, the espers awaken Akira to stop it. After reuniting with his friends, Akira creates another singularity that draws Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension as a result.\n\nIn the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and the espers' childhood, including Tetsuo's dependence on Kaneda during their childhood, and how the children were trained and altered before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to his world, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers.\n\nThe singularity disappears, and water floods the city. \u014cnishi is crushed to death when the laboratory collapses on him. Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they drive off into the ruins, while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Finally, Tetsuo introduces himself at another unspecified level of existence.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Characters\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Japanese voice actor<ref name=\"CBM\" />\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />(Electric Media/[[Kodansha]]/[[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]], 1989)<ref name=\"Streamline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025742/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />([[Animaze]]/[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer-Geneon]], 2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225155717/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around \u00a51,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of [[Kodansha]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], [[Bandai]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Toho]], [[Laserdisc]] Corporation and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film.

The film's main production was completed in 1987, with sound recording and mixing performed in early 1988. It was released in 1988, two years before the manga officially ended in 1990. Otomo is claimed to have filled 2,000 pages of notebooks, containing various ideas and character designs for the film, but the final storyboard consisted of a trimmed-down 738 pages.<ref name=\"CBM\" /> He had great difficulty completing the manga; Otomo has stated that the inspiration for its conclusion arose from a conversation that he had with [[Alejandro Jodorowsky]] in 1990.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=2961 |title=Akira Program Notes |publisher=Austin Film Society |accessdate=December 22, 2015 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092919/http://www.austinfilm.org/page.aspx?pid=2961 |archive-date=December 22, 2015 |url-status=dead}}</ref> He later recalled that the film project had to begin with the writing of an ending that would bring suitable closure to major characters, storylines, and themes without being extraordinarily lengthy, so that he could know in reverse order which manga elements would make the cut into the anime and thus suitably resolve the manga's various elements into a lean, two-hour story.<ref name=\"DVD int\">{{cite AV media |title= Director Interview |medium= DVD |publisher= [[FUNimation Entertainment]] |date=November 12, 2013}}</ref>\n\nOtomo is a big fan of ''[[Tetsujin 28-go]]''.

In addition, Takashi has a \"26\" [[tattoo]]ed on his hand which closely resembles the font used in ''Tetsujin 28-go''.

[[Katsuhiro Otomo]], produced by Ry\u014dhei Suzuki and Shunz\u014d Kat\u014d, and written by Otomo and [[Izo Hashimoto]], based on Otomo's 1982 [[Akira (manga)|manga of the same name]]. The film had a production budget of {{JPY|1.1 billion|link=yes}}<ref name=\"empire\" /> ({{US$|{{#expr:1100/128 round 0}} million|long=no}}),<ref name=\"currency\" /> making it the most expensive [[anime]] film of its time.<ref name=\"Beck\" />\n\nSet in a [[dystopia]]n 2019, ''Akira'' tells the story of Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda, a leader of a  [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku|biker gang]] whose childhood friend, Tetsuo Shima, acquires incredible [[telekinesis|telekinetic]] abilities after a motorcycle accident, eventually threatening an entire military complex amidst chaos and rebellion in the sprawling futuristic metropolis of Neo-Tokyo. While most of the character designs and settings were adapted from the manga, the plot differs considerably and does not include much of the last half of the manga.

By 2019, Tokyo is rebuilt. Known as Neo-Tokyo, it is plagued by corruption, anti-government protests, terrorism, and gang violence and is on the verge of collapse. During a massive protest, the hot-headed Sh\u014dtar\u014d Kaneda leads his vigilante [[b\u014ds\u014dzoku]] motorcycle gang against the rival Clown gang. Kaneda's best friend Tetsuo Shima inadvertently crashes his motorcycle into Takashi, an esper (person with [[extrasensory perception]]) who escaped from a government laboratory with the aid of a resistance organization. The accident awakens psychic powers in Tetsuo, attracting the attention of a secret government project directed by [[Japan Self-Defense Forces]] Colonel Shikishima. Assisted by esper Masaru, Shikishima recaptures Takashi, takes Tetsuo with him, and arrests Kaneda and his gang. While being interrogated by the police, Kaneda meets Kei, an activist belonging to the resistance movement, and tricks the authorities into releasing her and his gang.\n\nShikishima and his head of research, Doctor \u014cnishi, discover that Tetsuo possesses powerful psychic abilities similar to Akira, the esper responsible for Tokyo's destruction. Takashi's fellow esper Kiyoko forewarns Shikishima of Neo-Tokyo's impending destruction. However, Neo-Tokyo's parliament dismisses Shikishima's concerns, leading him to consider killing Tetsuo to prevent another cataclysm.\n\nMeanwhile, Tetsuo escapes from the hospital, steals Kaneda's motorcycle, and prepares to flee Neo-Tokyo with his girlfriend, Kaori. The Clowns ambush them, but after a severe beating are rescued by Kaneda's gang. During the intervention, however, Tetsuo begins suffering intense headaches and hallucinations, and he is returned to the hospital. Kaneda joins Kei's resistance cell after overhearing their plan to rescue Tetsuo and the other espers.\n\nAt the hospital, the espers confront Tetsuo, and he aggressively fights back with his psychokinetic powers and escapes. These powers are beginning to make him egomaniacal and unstable. Kaneda, Kei, and the resistance group infiltrate the hospital and are drawn into Shikishima and the espers' attempt to stop Tetsuo. He overpowers them all and flees the hospital after learning from Kiyoko that he can gain help from Akira, who is in cryonic storage beneath the Olympic Stadium construction site.\n\nKei and Kaneda escape military custody because of Kiyoko, who is hoping to stop Tetsuo using Kei as a medium. Shikishima stages a [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] against the Neo-Tokyo government and directs all of its military forces to destroy Tetsuo. Tetsuo returns to his gang's former hangout, Harukiya Bar, to obtain drugs to control his powers. He murders the bartender and destroys the bar in the process. When his former friends Yamagata and Kai arrive and confront him, he cold-bloodedly slaughters Yamagata in front of Kai; Kaneda is informed by Kai of what happened and vows to avenge his friend. Tetsuo rampages through Neo-Tokyo, arriving at Akira's [[cryogenic storage dewar]] under the stadium. Kiyoko has Kei fight Tetsuo, but he easily defeats her and exhumes Akira's remains. Using a laser rifle, Kaneda fights Tetsuo in a duel, and Shikishima fires an [[Space weapon|orbital weapon]] at him, but both fail to stop him.\n\nShikishima and Kaori approach the stadium to find Tetsuo in great pain; Shikishima offers to return Tetsuo to the hospital, heal his injuries, and help control his abilities, while Kaori attempts to restrain Tetsuo. However, Kaneda arrives and duels with Tetsuo again. Unable to control his powers, Tetsuo mutates into a gigantic mass, consuming all matter, engulfing Kaneda and killing Kaori. As the mass grows, the espers awaken Akira to stop it. After reuniting with his friends, Akira creates another singularity that draws Tetsuo and Kaneda into another dimension. The espers teleport Shikishima to a safe distance as the singularity destroys Neo-Tokyo in a mirror of Tokyo's previous destruction, and they agree to rescue Kaneda, knowing that they will not be able to return to this dimension.\n\nIn the singularity, Kaneda experiences Tetsuo's and the espers' childhood, including Tetsuo's dependence on Kaneda during their childhood, and how the children were trained and altered before Tokyo's destruction. The espers return Kaneda to his world, informing him that Akira will take Tetsuo to safety and that Kei is developing psychic powers.\n\nThe singularity disappears, and water floods the city. \u014cnishi is crushed to death when the laboratory collapses on him. Kaneda discovers that Kei and Kai have survived, and they drive off into the ruins, while Shikishima watches the sunrise. Finally, Tetsuo introduces himself at another unspecified level of existence.\n\n== Voice cast ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Characters\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| Japanese voice actor<ref name=\"CBM\" />\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />(Electric Media/[[Kodansha]]/[[Streamline Pictures|Streamline]], 1989)<ref name=\"Streamline\">{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=August 24, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129025742/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/20/akira/ |archive-date=November 29, 2014 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n! style=\"text-align:center;\"| English dubbing actor<br />([[Animaze]]/[[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer-Geneon]], 2001)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |title=Akira (movie) |publisher=CrystalAcids.com |accessdate=December 17, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160225155717/http://www.crystalacids.com/database/title/19/akira/ |archive-date=February 25, 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n|-\n!

The group's assembly was necessitated by the unconventionally high budget of around \u00a51,100,000,000, intended to achieve the desired epic standard equal to Otomo's over 2,000-page manga tale. The committee consisted of [[Kodansha]], [[Mainichi Broadcasting System]], [[Bandai]], [[Hakuhodo]], [[Toho]], [[Laserdisc]] Corporation and [[Sumitomo Corporation]] who all forwarded money and promotion towards the film.

In addition, Takashi has a \"26\" [[tattoo]]ed on his hand which closely resembles the font used in ''Tetsujin 28-go''.

The sketch has since become known for its satirical depiction of [[Class in Britain|Britain's class system]] and [[North-south divide (England)|North-South divide]].\n\nBrooke-Taylor also took part in [[David Frost]]'s pilot programme ''[[How to Irritate People]]'' in 1968, designed to sell what would later be recognised as the [[Monty Python]] style of comedy to the American market.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://dangerousminds.net/tag/John-Cleese|title=Tags: John Cleese &#124; Dangerous Minds|website=dangerousminds.net}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0063100/fullcredits|title=\"David Frost Presents\" How to Irritate People (TV Episode 1969) - IMDb|via=www.imdb.com}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sotcaa.org/history/ukonline/python_frame.html?/history/ukonline/python/python_irritate.html|title=Some Of The Corpses Are Amusing|website=sotcaa.org}}</ref> Many of the sketches were later revived in the Monty Python TV series, such as the job interview sketch in which Brooke-Taylor played a nervous interviewee tormented by interviewer John Cleese. The programme was also the first collaboration between Cleese and [[Michael Palin]]. One of the sketches referred to Cleese's character dating a promiscuous woman named \"Christine Weadon\", which was the name of Brooke-Taylor's wife.\n\nAlso in 1968 Brooke-Taylor made an unexpected and uninvited guest appearance in an episode of ''[[Do Not Adjust Your Set]]'', filling in for Michael Palin who was ill that week.

First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand-up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]]. The series transferred to television briefly, produced for ITV by the commercial franchise [[ITV Yorkshire|Yorkshire Television]].<ref name=\"fringe\" />\n\nHe appeared on television in [[British sitcom]]s, including ''[[You Must Be the Husband]]'' with [[Diane Keen]], ''His and Hers'' with [[Madeline Smith]], and ''[[Me and My Girl (TV series)|Me and My Girl]]'' with [[Richard O'Sullivan]].

In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]]. His interest in golf came to the fore when he took part in the ''Pro-Celebrity Golf'' television series (opposite [[Bruce Forsyth]]), and appeared in the premiere episode of the BBC's golf-based game show ''[[Full Swing (game show)|Full Swing]]''.\n\nIn 2008, Brooke-Taylor was heard in the [[Doctor Who|''Doctor Who'']] audio story ''The Zygon Who Fell To Earth'', made by [[Big Finish Productions]].

He was best known as a member of [[The Goodies]], starring in the [[The Goodies (TV series)|television series]] throughout the 1970s and picking up international recognition in Australia and New Zealand.

First transmitted on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] in November 1970, ''The Goodies'' was a television success, broadcast for over a decade by both the BBC and (in its final year) by [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] contractor [[London Weekend Television]], spawning many spin-off books and successful records.\n\nDuring the run of ''The Goodies'', Brooke-Taylor took part in the BBC radio series ''[[Hello Cheeky]]'', a bawdy [[stand-up comedy]] show also starring [[Barry Cryer]] and [[John Junkin]].

After ''The Goodies'' on UK television, Brooke-Taylor also worked again with Garden and Oddie on the television [[animated]] comedy series ''[[Bananaman]]'', in which Brooke-Taylor was the narrator, as well as voicing the characters of King Zorg of the Nurks, Eddie the Gent, Auntie and Appleman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/bananaman/cast_crew/|title=Bananaman cast and crew credits|first=British Comedy|last=Guide|website=British Comedy Guide}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ukgameshows.com/ukgs/Tim_Brooke-Taylor|title=Tim Brooke-Taylor \u2013 UKGameshows|website=www.ukgameshows.com|accessdate=29 July 2018}}</ref> He also lent his voice to the children's TV series ''[[Gideon (TV series)|Gideon]]''.\n\nBrooke-Taylor appeared in [[Amnesty International]] shows: in ''[[A Poke in the Eye (With a Sharp Stick)]]'' he, Oddie and Garden, sang their hit song \"[[Funky Gibbon]]\",<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goodiesruleok.com/articles.php?cod=665&print|title=The Official Goodies Rule - OK!

In the early 1980s, he branched out into [[pantomime]] as [[Pantomime dame|the Dame]] in ''[[Dick Whittington]]''. He was also the author (and co-author) of several humorous books, based mainly on his radio and television work, and the sports of golf and [[cricket]].

Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a [[truck]] and [[SUV]], and bigger than a common [[car]]. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, [[microvan]]s, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities. [[Mini MPV]]s, [[Compact MPV]]s, and [[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPVs]] are all small vans usually used for transporting people in small quantities. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.\n\n==Word origin and usage==\n[[File:Roger Fenton's waggon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roger Fenton]]'s photographic van, [[Crimea]], 1855]]\nVan means a type of vehicle arose as a contraction of the word [[Caravan (disambiguation)|caravan]]. The earliest records of a van as a vehicle in English are in the mid 19th century meaning a covered wagon for transporting goods (earliest reported record 1829). Caravan with the same meaning has records since the 1670s. A caravan, meaning one wagon, had arisen as an extension or corruption of caravan meaning a convoy of multiple wagons.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/oedxbarch#page/n51/mode/1up \"Van #3\" @ ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921131333/http://archive.org/stream/oedxbarch |date=21 September 2016 }}, year 1928.

Note: The word van as a vehicle, being a contraction of caravan, has no historical relation with the word van as a contraction of [[vanguard]].</ref>\n\nThe word ''van'' has slightly different, but overlapping, meanings in [[list of dialects of the English language|different forms of English]]. While the word always now applies to boxy cargo vans, other applications are found to a greater or lesser extent in the different English-speaking countries.\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australian English]], the term ''van'' is commonly used to describe a [[minivan]], a passenger [[minibus]], or an Australian [[panel van]] as manufactured by companies such as [[Holden]] and [[Ford Australia|Ford]] at various times.\n\nA [[full-size van]] used for commercial purposes is also known as a ''van''; however, a passenger vehicle with more than 7 or 8 seats is more likely to be called a ''minibus''.\n\nFinally, the term ''van'' can sometimes be used interchangeably with ''caravan'', which in the U.S. is referred to as a [[travel trailer]].\n\nThe British term ''people mover'' is also used in Australian English to describe a passenger van. The American usage of ''van'' to mean a cargo box trailer or semi-trailer is used rarely, if ever, in Australia.\n\n===India===\nIn India, the van is one of the most common modes of transport and is often used for transporting school children to and from schools, usually when parents, especially working parents, are often too busy to pick their children up from school or when school buses are full and unable to accommodate other children.<ref>{{cite news|title=School van operators take kids for a ride|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chunk-ht-ui-gurgaonsurvey-gurgaonfirst/school-van-operators-take-kids-for-a-ride/article1-1057290.aspx|accessdate=27 July 2015|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=24 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916191906/http://www.hindustantimes.com/chunk-ht-ui-gurgaonsurvey-gurgaonfirst/school-van-operators-take-kids-for-a-ride/article1-1057290.aspx|archivedate=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Suzuki Alto Juna rear.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Alto]] Van - note baggage rails in rear side windows]]\nEarly Japanese vans include the [[Kurogane Baby]], [[Mazda Bongo]] and the [[Toyota LiteAce]] van. The Japanese also produced many vans based on the American flat nose model, but also mini-vans which for the American market have generally evolved to the long-wheelbase front wheel drive form factor pioneered by the [[Nissan Prairie]] and [[Mitsubishi Chariot]]. [[Microvan]]s, vans that fulfill [[kei car]] regulations, are very popular for small business. The term is also used to describe full-fledged station wagons (passenger car front sheetmetal, flat folding back seats, windows all around) and even hatchbacks with a basic trim package intended for commercial use. These are referred to as \"Light Vans\" ({{lang-ja|\u30e9\u30a4\u30c8\u30d0\u30f3}}), with \"light\" referring to the glazing rather than the weight of the vehicle.\n\n===United Kingdom===\nIn [[British English]], the word van refers to vehicles that carry goods only, on both roads and rails. What would be called a [[minivan]] in American English is called a ''people-carrier'' or ''MPV'', or multi-purpose vehicle, and larger passenger vehicles are called a [[minibus]]. The [[Telegraph (newspaper)|''Telegraph'']] newspaper introduced the idea of \"[[White Van Man]]\", a typical [[working class]] man or small business owner who would have a white [[Ford Transit]], [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]], or similar panel van. Today the phrase \"man and van\" refers to light removal firms normally operated by a sole business owner transporting anything from the contents of a whole house to just a few boxes. The word \"van\" also refers to railway [[covered goods wagons]], called \"boxcars\" in the [[United States]].\n\n===United States===\n[[File:94-97RamVan.JPG|right|thumb|Full-size [[Dodge Ram Van]] in the United States]]\n[[File:2011 Toyota Sienna XLE -- 05-18-2011.jpg|right|thumb|Minivan in the United States]]\nIn the United States, a ''van'' can also refer to a box-shaped trailer or [[semi-trailer]] used to carry goods. In this case there is a differentiation between a \"dry van\", used to carry most goods, and a [[refrigeration|refrigerated]] van, or ''reefer'', used for cold goods. A railway [[car]] used to carry baggage is also called a ''van''.\n\nA vehicle referred to as a '''[[full-size van]]''' is usually a large, boxy vehicle that has a platform and powertrain similar to their [[light truck]] counterparts.  These vans may be sold with the space behind the front seats empty for transporting of goods ('''cargo van'''), or furnished for passenger use by either the manufacturer ('''wagon''') or another company for more personal comforts. ('''[[conversion van]]'''). Full-size vans often have a very short hood, with the engine placed under the passenger cabin.\n\nA [[cutaway van chassis]] is a variation of the full size van which was developed for use by [[second stage manufacturer]]s. Such a unit has a van front end, and driver controls in a cab body which extends to a point aft of the front seats, where the rest of the van body is cutoff (leading to the terminology \"cutaway\"). From that point aft, only the chassis frame rails and running gear extend to the rear when the unit is shipped as an \"incomplete vehicle\". A second stage manufacturer, commonly known as a bodybuilder, will complete the vehicle for uses such as [[recreational vehicle]]s, small [[school bus]]es, minibuses, type III [[ambulance]]s, and delivery trucks. A large portion of cutaway van chassis are equipped with dual rear wheels. Second stage manufacturers also add a third weight-bearing single wheel \"tag axle\" for larger minibus models.\n\nThe term ''van'' may also refer to a '''[[minivan]]'''. Minivans are usually distinguished by their smaller size and [[front wheel drive]] powertrain, although some are equipped with [[four wheel drive]].  Minivans typically offer seven or eight passenger [[seating capacity]], and better fuel economy than full-sized vans, at the expense of power, cargo space, and towing capacity. Minivans are often equipped with dual side sliding doors.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Lublinn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Poland|Polish]] [[Lublin van|Lublin III]] van]]\nThe precursor to American Vans would be the [[Sedan delivery|Sedan deliveries]] of the 1930s to late-1950s. The first generation of American vans were the 1960s [[compact van]]s, which were patterned in size after the [[Volkswagen Type 2|Volkswagen Bus]]. The [[Chevrolet Greenbrier|Corvair]]-based entry even imitated the rear-mounted, air-cooled engine design. The [[Ford Falcon (North America)|Ford Falcon]]-based [[Ford E-Series#First generation (1961\u20131967)|first-generation Econoline]] had a flat nose, with the engine mounted between and behind the front seats. The [[Dodge A100]] had a similar layout and could accommodate a [[V8 engine]]. Chevrolet also switched to this layout. The Ford, Dodge and Corvair vans were also produced as pickup trucks.\n\nThe ''standard'' or ''full size'' vans appeared with Ford's innovation of moving the engine forward under a short hood and using pickup truck components. The engine cockpit housing is often called a ''dog house''. Over time, they evolved longer noses and sleeker shapes. The [[Dodge Sportsman]] was available with an extension to the rear of its long wheelbase model to create a 15-passenger van. Vehicles have been sold as both cargo and passenger models, as well as in [[cutaway van chassis]] versions for [[second stage manufacturer]]s to make box vans, ambulances, campers, and other vehicles. Second stage manufacturers also modify the original manufacturer's body to create custom vans.\n\nIn the 1970s, songs like \"[[Chevy Van (song)|Chevy Van]]\", written and performed by [[Sammy Johns]], and nicknames like \"sin bin\" or \"screw canoe\" became part of the culture as owners transformed them into rolling bedrooms and lounges. Conversion vans became a large part of the market with plusher accommodations.\n\nDodge ended production of their full-size vans during the 2003 model year and replaced it with the [[Dodge Sprinter]], which is based on a narrower, more fuel-efficient European design pattern. Typical versions of the Sprinter are taller than other vans, with a more aerodynamic profile in front. They have been adopted primarily for delivery and lightweight Class-C van cab motor home applications.\n\n==Use==\n[[File:2009-03-10 Van equipped for professional carpet cleaning.jpg|thumb|right|A [[ Chevrolet]] van equipped with professional carpet cleaning tools in [[Durham, North Carolina]]]]\nIn urban areas of the United States, full-size vans have been used as ''commuter vans'' since 1971, when Dodge introduced a van that could transport up to 15 passengers. Commuter vans are used as an alternative to [[carpool]]ing and other ride sharing arrangements.\n\nMany mobile businesses use a van to carry almost their entire business to various places where they work. For example, those who come to homes or places of business to perform various services, installations, or repairs. Vans are also used to shuttle people and their luggage between [[hotel]]s and [[airport]]s, to transport [[commuter]]s between [[parking]] lots and their places of work, and along established routes as minibuses. Vans are also used to transport elderly and mobility-impaired worshipers to and from church services or to transport youth groups for outings to amusement parks, picnics, and visiting other churches. Vans are also used by schools to drive sports teams to [[intramural]] games. Vans have been used by touring music groups to haul equipment and people to music venues around the country.\n\n=== Full-size van ===\nA '''full-size van''' is a [[marketing]] term used in [[North America]] for a van larger than a [[minivan]], that is characterized by a large, boxy appearance, a short hood, and heavy cargo/passenger-hauling capacity. \n\nThe first full-size van was the 1969 [[Ford E-Series|Ford Econoline]], which used components from the [[Ford F-Series]] [[pickup truck|pickup]]s. [[General Motors]] and the [[Dodge Ram Van]] would follow suit with designs with the engines placed farther forward, and succeeding generations of the Econoline introduced longer hoods.\n\nFor the 2020 model year, full-size vans in the American market include: [[Mercedes-Benz Sprinter]], [[Nissan NV (North America)|Nissan NV]], [[Ford Transit]], [[Ram ProMaster]] and [[Chevrolet Express|Chevrolet Express/GMC Savana]].\n\n===Step van===\n{{Main|Multi-stop truck}}\n[[File:Fedex-truck-Chicago.jpg|right|thumb|A [[Federal Express]] step van]]\nAnother type of van specific to North America is the ''[[step van]],'' so-named because of the ease with which one can step in and out. Widely used by delivery services, courier companies, and the parcel division of the US Postal Service and Canada Post, they are often seen driven with the door open. Step vans have more boxy shapes, wider bodies, and higher rooftops than other vans, and are rarely employed for carrying passengers.\n\n===Rollover safety===\nA van is taller than a typical passenger car, resulting in a higher [[center of gravity]]. The suspension is also higher to accommodate the weight of 15 passengers, who can weigh over one ton alone. In the United States it is common for only the front seat passengers to use their [[safety belt]]s. The U.S. [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] (NHTSA) has determined that belted passengers are about four times more likely to survive in rollover crashes.\n\nSafety can be improved by understanding the unique characteristics of 12- and 15-passenger vans and by following guidelines developed for their drivers, according to the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). A summary of this information is available at \"Reducing The Risk of Rollover Crashes in 15-Passenger Vans\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/studies/15PassVans/index.htm|title=Passenger Van Safety|publisher=nhtsa.dot.gov|accessdate=8 May 2012|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090724152125/http://www.nhtsa.dot.gov/cars/problems/studies/15PassVans/Index.htm|archivedate=24 July 2009}}</ref> \n\nCar rental companies have also started adding stickers to warn renters about the difference in handling while compared to standard cars.\n\n===Safety equipment===\nMany commercial vans are fitted with [[cargo barrier]]s behind the front seats (or rear seats, if fitted) to prevent injuries caused by unsecured cargo in the event of sudden deceleration, collision or a rollover.

Depending on the type of van, it can be bigger or smaller than a [[truck]] and [[SUV]], and bigger than a common [[car]]. There is some varying in the scope of the word across the different English-speaking countries. The smallest vans, [[microvan]]s, are used for transporting either goods or people in tiny quantities. [[Mini MPV]]s, [[Compact MPV]]s, and [[Multi-purpose vehicle|MPVs]] are all small vans usually used for transporting people in small quantities. Larger vans with passenger seats are used for institutional purposes, such as transporting students. Larger vans with only front seats are often used for business purposes, to carry goods and equipment. Specially-equipped vans are used by television stations as mobile studios. Postal services and courier companies use large step vans to deliver packages.\n\n==Word origin and usage==\n[[File:Roger Fenton's waggon.jpg|thumb|right|[[Roger Fenton]]'s photographic van, [[Crimea]], 1855]]\nVan means a type of vehicle arose as a contraction of the word [[Caravan (disambiguation)|caravan]]. The earliest records of a van as a vehicle in English are in the mid 19th century meaning a covered wagon for transporting goods (earliest reported record 1829). Caravan with the same meaning has records since the 1670s. A caravan, meaning one wagon, had arisen as an extension or corruption of caravan meaning a convoy of multiple wagons.<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/oedxbarch#page/n51/mode/1up \"Van #3\" @ ''New English Dictionary on Historical Principles''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921131333/http://archive.org/stream/oedxbarch |date=21 September 2016 }}, year 1928.

Note: The word van as a vehicle, being a contraction of caravan, has no historical relation with the word van as a contraction of [[vanguard]].</ref>\n\nThe word ''van'' has slightly different, but overlapping, meanings in [[list of dialects of the English language|different forms of English]]. While the word always now applies to boxy cargo vans, other applications are found to a greater or lesser extent in the different English-speaking countries.\n\n===Australia===\nIn [[Australian English]], the term ''van'' is commonly used to describe a [[minivan]], a passenger [[minibus]], or an Australian [[panel van]] as manufactured by companies such as [[Holden]] and [[Ford Australia|Ford]] at various times.\n\nA [[full-size van]] used for commercial purposes is also known as a ''van''; however, a passenger vehicle with more than 7 or 8 seats is more likely to be called a ''minibus''.\n\nFinally, the term ''van'' can sometimes be used interchangeably with ''caravan'', which in the U.S. is referred to as a [[travel trailer]].\n\nThe British term ''people mover'' is also used in Australian English to describe a passenger van. The American usage of ''van'' to mean a cargo box trailer or semi-trailer is used rarely, if ever, in Australia.\n\n===India===\nIn India, the van is one of the most common modes of transport and is often used for transporting school children to and from schools, usually when parents, especially working parents, are often too busy to pick their children up from school or when school buses are full and unable to accommodate other children.<ref>{{cite news|title=School van operators take kids for a ride|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/chunk-ht-ui-gurgaonsurvey-gurgaonfirst/school-van-operators-take-kids-for-a-ride/article1-1057290.aspx|accessdate=27 July 2015|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=24 July 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150916191906/http://www.hindustantimes.com/chunk-ht-ui-gurgaonsurvey-gurgaonfirst/school-van-operators-take-kids-for-a-ride/article1-1057290.aspx|archivedate=16 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Japan===\n[[File:Suzuki Alto Juna rear.jpg|thumb|[[Suzuki Alto]] Van - note baggage rails in rear side windows]]\nEarly Japanese vans include the [[Kurogane Baby]], [[Mazda Bongo]] and the [[Toyota LiteAce]] van. The Japanese also produced many vans based on the American flat nose model, but also mini-vans which for the American market have generally evolved to the long-wheelbase front wheel drive form factor pioneered by the [[Nissan Prairie]] and [[Mitsubishi Chariot]].
