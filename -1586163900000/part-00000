For example, Article 115(11) of the Penal Code ({{lang-pl|Kodeks karny}}) uses the term \"the closest person\", which covers romantic relations that are not legally formalised. The status of \"the closest person\" gives the right of refusal to testify against the partner. The term \"partner\" includes same-sex couples.\n\nA resolution of the Supreme Court from 28 November 2012 (''III CZP 65/12'') on the interpretation of the term \"a person who has lived actually in cohabitation with the tenant\" was issued with regard to the case of a gay man who was the partner of a deceased person, the main tenant of the apartment. The Court interpreted the law in a way that recognised the surviving partner as authorised to take over the right to tenancy. The Court stated that the person actually remaining in cohabitation with the tenant - in the meaning of Article 691 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code - is a person connected with the tenant by a bond of emotional, physical and economic nature. This also includes a person of the same sex.<ref>[https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf/ Formalisation of legal family formats in Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619113200/https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf |date=19 June 2018 }}.

For example, Article 115(11) of the Penal Code ({{lang-pl|Kodeks karny}}) uses the term \"the closest person\", which covers romantic relations that are not legally formalised. The status of \"the closest person\" gives the right of refusal to testify against the partner. The term \"partner\" includes same-sex couples.\n\nA resolution of the Supreme Court from 28 November 2012 (''III CZP 65/12'') on the interpretation of the term \"a person who has lived actually in cohabitation with the tenant\" was issued with regard to the case of a gay man who was the partner of a deceased person, the main tenant of the apartment. The Court interpreted the law in a way that recognised the surviving partner as authorised to take over the right to tenancy. The Court stated that the person actually remaining in cohabitation with the tenant - in the meaning of Article 691 \u00a7 1 of the Civil Code - is a person connected with the tenant by a bond of emotional, physical and economic nature. This also includes a person of the same sex.<ref>[https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf/ Formalisation of legal family formats in Poland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180619113200/https://www.ined.fr/Xtradocs/lawsandfamilies/LawsAndFamilies-PL-Section1.pdf |date=19 June 2018 }}.

The Democratic Left Alliance, Modern, [[Labor United]], [[Your Movement]], and [[Spring (political party)|Spring]] are supporters of LGBT rights. More right-wing parties, such as [[Civic Platform|PO]], [[Law and Justice|PiS]] and [[Polish People's Party|PSL]], are generally against any changes in legislation. Out of these, PiS takes the strongest oppositional stance on homosexual issues.\n\n===Law and Justice===\nAfter the [[2005 Polish parliamentary election|2005 elections]], the [[Law and Justice]] party (PiS) came to power. They formed a coalition government with the [[League of Polish Families]] (LPR) and the [[Self-Defence of the Republic of Poland|Self-Defence Party]] (Samoobrona).

The [[North Germanic languages|northernmost]] extension of [[Germanic mythology]], Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.\n\nThe source texts mention numerous gods, such as the [[Mj\u00f6lnir|hammer-wielding]], humanity-protecting thunder-god [[Thor]], who relentlessly fights his foes; the one-eyed, [[Huginn and Muninn|raven-flanked]] god [[O\u00f0in]], who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the [[runic alphabet]]; the beautiful, [[sei\u00f0r]]-working, feathered cloak-clad goddess [[Freyja]] who rides to battle to choose among the slain; the vengeful, skiing goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]], who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore; the powerful god [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]], who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land; the god [[Freyr]], whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity; the goddess [[I\u00f0unn]], who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness; the mysterious god [[Heimdallr]], who is born of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth, and possesses a resounding horn; the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Loki]], who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess [[Frigg]]'s beautiful son [[Baldr]]; and [[List of Germanic deities|numerous other deities]].\n\nMost of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the [[j\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], beings who may be friends, lovers, foes or family members of the gods. The [[Norse cosmology|cosmos in Norse mythology]] consists of [[Nine Worlds]] that flank a central tree, [[Yggdrasil]]. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being [[Ymir]], and the first two humans are [[Ask and Embla]]. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There the surviving gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and green, and [[L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir|two humans]] will repopulate the world.\n\nNorse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century, when key texts were brought to the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe. By way of [[comparative mythology]] and [[historical linguistics]], scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology reaching as far back as [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European mythology]]. During the modern period, the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Viking revival]] re-awoke an interest in the subject matter, and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture. The myths have further been revived in a religious context among adherents of [[Germanic Neopaganism]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe historical religion of the [[Norsemen|Norse people]] is commonly referred to as ''Norse mythology''.

The majority of these Old Norse texts were created in [[Iceland]], where the oral tradition stemming from the pre-Christian inhabitants of the island was collected and recorded in manuscripts. This occurred primarily in the 13th century. These texts include the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', a collection of poems from earlier traditional material anonymously compiled in the 13th century.<ref name=\"EDDAS-IN-TIME\">{{harvp|Faulkes|1995|pp=vi\u2013xxi}}, and {{harvp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=1\u201334}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Prose Edda'' was composed as a prose manual for producing [[skald]]ic poetry\u2014traditional [[Old Norse]] poetry composed by [[skald]]s. Originally composed and transmitted orally, skaldic poetry utilizes [[alliterative verse]], [[kenning]]s, and various metrical forms. The ''Prose Edda'' presents numerous examples of works by various skalds from before and after the Christianization process and also frequently refers back to the poems found in the ''Poetic Edda''. The ''Poetic Edda'' consists almost entirely of poems, with some prose narrative added, and this poetry\u2014''Eddic'' poetry\u2014utilizes fewer [[kenning]]s. In comparison to skaldic poetry, Eddic poetry is relatively unadorned.<ref name=\"EDDAS-IN-TIME\"/>\n\nThe ''Prose Edda'' features layers of [[Euhemerism|euhemerization]], a process in which deities and supernatural beings are presented as having been either actual, magic-wielding human beings who have been [[Apotheosis|deified]] in time or beings [[Demonization|demonized]] by way of [[Christian mythology]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=xvi\u2013xviii}} Texts such as ''[[Heimskringla]]'', composed in the 13th century by Snorri and ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', composed in [[Latin]] by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in Denmark in the 12th century, are the results of heavy amounts of euhemerization.{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=27\u201334}}\n\nNumerous further texts, such as the [[sagas]], provide further information. The saga corpus consists of thousands of tales recorded in Old Norse ranging from Icelandic family histories ([[Sagas of Icelanders]]) to [[Migration period]] tales mentioning historic figures such as [[Attila the Hun]] ([[legendary saga]]s). Objects and monuments such as the [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] and the [[Kvinneby amulet]] feature [[runic inscriptions]]\u2014texts written in the [[runic alphabet]], the indigenous alphabet of the Germanic peoples\u2014that mention figures and events from Norse mythology.<ref name=\"SAGAS-AND-RUNES\">{{harvp|Lindow|2001|pp=11\u201312}}, {{harvp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=17\u201321}}, and {{harvp|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=27\u201328, 216}}.</ref>\n\nObjects from the archaeological record may also be interpreted as depictions of subjects from Norse mythology, such as amulets of the god Thor's hammer [[Mj\u00f6lnir]] found among pagan burials and small silver female figures interpreted as [[valkyrie]]s or [[d\u00edsir]], beings associated with war, fate or ancestor cults.<ref name=\"HAMMER-AND-DISIR\">Regarding the d\u00edsir, valkyries, and figurines (with images), see {{harvp|Lindow|2001|pp=95\u201397}}.

Numerous gods are mentioned in the source texts. As evidenced by records of personal names and place names, the most popular god among the Scandinavians during the Viking Age was [[Thor]], who is portrayed as unrelentingly pursuing his foes, his mountain-crushing, thunderous hammer [[Mj\u00f6lnir]] in hand. In the mythology, Thor lays waste to numerous j\u00f6tnar who are foes to the gods or humanity, and is wed to the beautiful, golden-haired goddess [[Sif]].{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=287\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Odin]] is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts. One-eyed, [[Geri and Freki|wolf]]- and [[Huginn and Muninn|raven]]-flanked, with spear in hand, Odin pursues knowledge throughout the worlds. In an act of self-sacrifice, Odin is described as having hanged himself upside-down for nine days and nights on the cosmological tree [[Yggdrasil]] to gain knowledge of the runic alphabet, which he passed on to humanity, and is associated closely with death, wisdom, and poetry. Odin is portrayed as the ruler of [[Asgard]], and leader of the [[\u00c6sir|Aesir]]. Odin's wife is the powerful goddess [[Frigg]] who can see the future but tells no one, and together they have a beloved son, [[Baldr]]. After a series of dreams had by [[Baldr]]of his impending death, his death is engineered by [[Loki]], and Baldr thereafter resides in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], a realm ruled over by an [[Hel (being)|entity of the same name]].{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=128\u201329, 247\u201352}}\n\nOdin must share half of his share of the dead with a powerful goddess, [[Freyja]]. She is beautiful, sensual, wears a feathered cloak, and practices [[sei\u00f0r]]. She rides to battle to choose among the slain and brings her chosen to her afterlife field [[F\u00f3lkvangr]]. Freyja weeps for her missing husband [[\u00d3\u00f0r]], and seeks after him in faraway lands.{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=118, 126\u201328}} Freyja's brother, the god [[Freyr]], is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts, and in his association with the weather, royalty, human sexuality, and agriculture brings peace and pleasure to humanity. Deeply lovesick after catching sight of the beautiful j\u00f6tunn [[Ger\u00f0r]], Freyr seeks and wins her love, yet at the price of his future doom.{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=121\u201322}} Their father is the powerful god [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]]. Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r is strongly associated with ships and seafaring, and so also wealth and prosperity. Freyja and Freyr's mother is [[Sister-wife of Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r|Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r's sister]] (her name is unprovided in the source material). However, there is more information about his pairing with the skiing and hunting goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]]. Their relationship is ill-fated, as Ska\u00f0i cannot stand to be away from her beloved mountains, nor Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r from the seashore.{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=241\u201343}} Together, Freyja, Freyr, and Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r form a portion of gods known as the [[Vanir]]. While the Aesir and the Vanir retain distinct identification, they came together as the result of the [[Aesir\u2013Vanir War]].{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=311\u201312}}\n\nWhile they receive less mention, numerous other gods and goddesses appear in the source material. (For a list of these deities, see [[List of Germanic deities]].) Some of the gods heard less of include the apple-bearing goddess [[I\u00f0unn]] and her husband, the skaldic god [[Bragi]]; the gold-toothed god [[Heimdallr]], born of [[Nine Mothers of Heimdallr|nine mothers]]; the ancient god [[T\u00fdr]], who lost a hand while binding the great wolf [[Fenrir]]; and the goddess [[Gefjon]], who formed modern-day [[Zealand]], [[Denmark]].{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=86\u201388, 135\u201337, 168\u201372, 198\u201399, 297\u201399}}\n\nVarious beings outside of the gods are mentioned. [[elf|Elves]] and [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]] are commonly mentioned and appear to be connected, but their attributes are vague and the relation between the two is ambiguous.

Outside of the gods, humanity, and the j\u00f6tnar, these Nine Worlds are inhabited by beings, such as [[elves]] and [[dwarf (Germanic mythology)|dwarfs]]. Travel between the worlds is frequently recounted in the myths, where the gods and other beings may interact directly with humanity.

Bands such as [[Amon Amarth]], [[Bathory (band)|Bathory]], and [[M\u00e5negarm]] have written songs about Norse mythology.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Mythology}}\n{{Commons category|Norse mythology}}\n\n*[[Alliterative verse]] \n*[[Project Runeberg]] \n*[[List of Germanic deities]]\n*[[List of valkyrie names in Norse mythology]]\n* [[Greek mythology]]\n* [[Roman mythology]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* {{cite book |translator-last=Faulkes |translator-first=Anthony |year=1995 |title=Edda |publisher=[[Everyman's Library|Everyman]] |isbn=0-460-87616-3 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Flowers |first=Stephen |authorlink=Stephen Flowers |year=1989 |title=The Galdrab\u00f3k: An Icelandic Grimoire |isbn=0-87728-685-X |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Lindow |first=John |authorlink=John Lindow |year=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=KlT7tv3eMSwC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q=&f=false |title=Norse Mythology: A Guide to the Gods, Heroes, Rituals, and Beliefs |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=0-19-515382-0 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last1=MacLeod |first1=Mindy |last2=Mees |first2=Bernard |year=2006 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hx7UigqsTKoC |title=Runic Amulets and Magic Objects |publisher=[[Boydell Press]] |isbn=1-84383-205-4 |ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Mallory |first=J.

The [[North Germanic languages|northernmost]] extension of [[Germanic mythology]], Norse mythology consists of tales of various deities, beings, and heroes derived from numerous sources from both before and after the pagan period, including medieval manuscripts, archaeological representations, and folk tradition.\n\nThe source texts mention numerous gods, such as the [[Mj\u00f6lnir|hammer-wielding]], humanity-protecting thunder-god [[Thor]], who relentlessly fights his foes; the one-eyed, [[Huginn and Muninn|raven-flanked]] god [[Odin]], who craftily pursues knowledge throughout the worlds and bestowed among humanity the [[runic alphabet]]; the beautiful, [[sei\u00f0r]]-working, feathered cloak-clad goddess [[Freyja]] who rides to battle to choose among the slain; the vengeful, skiing goddess [[Ska\u00f0i]], who prefers the wolf howls of the winter mountains to the seashore; the powerful god [[Nj\u00f6r\u00f0r]], who may calm both sea and fire and grant wealth and land; the god [[Freyr]], whose weather and farming associations bring peace and pleasure to humanity; the goddess [[I\u00f0unn]], who keeps apples that grant eternal youthfulness; the mysterious god [[Heimdallr]], who is born of nine mothers, can hear grass grow, has gold teeth, and possesses a resounding horn; the [[j\u00f6tunn]] [[Loki]], who brings tragedy to the gods by engineering the death of the goddess [[Frigg]]'s beautiful son [[Baldr]]; and [[List of Germanic deities|numerous other deities]].\n\nMost of the surviving mythology centres on the plights of the gods and their interaction with various other beings, such as humanity and the [[j\u00f6tunn|j\u00f6tnar]], beings who may be friends, lovers, foes or family members of the gods. The [[Norse cosmology|cosmos in Norse mythology]] consists of [[Nine Worlds]] that flank a central tree, [[Yggdrasil]]. Units of time and elements of the cosmology are personified as deities or beings. Various forms of a creation myth are recounted, where the world is created from the flesh of the primordial being [[Ymir]], and the first two humans are [[Ask and Embla]]. These worlds are foretold to be reborn after the events of [[Ragnar\u00f6k]] when an immense battle occurs between the gods and their enemies, and the world is enveloped in flames, only to be reborn anew. There the surviving gods will meet, and the land will be fertile and green, and [[L\u00edf and L\u00edf\u00ferasir|two humans]] will repopulate the world.\n\nNorse mythology has been the subject of scholarly discourse since the 17th century, when key texts were brought to the attention of the intellectual circles of Europe. By way of [[comparative mythology]] and [[historical linguistics]], scholars have identified elements of Germanic mythology reaching as far back as [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Proto-Indo-European mythology]]. During the modern period, the [[Romanticism|Romanticist]] [[Viking revival]] re-awoke an interest in the subject matter, and references to Norse mythology may now be found throughout modern popular culture. The myths have further been revived in a religious context among adherents of [[Germanic Neopaganism]].\n\n==Terminology==\nThe historical religion of the [[Norsemen|Norse people]] is commonly referred to as ''Norse mythology''.

The majority of these Old Norse texts were created in [[Iceland]], where the oral tradition stemming from the pre-Christian inhabitants of the island was collected and recorded in manuscripts. This occurred primarily in the 13th century. These texts include the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', composed in the 13th century by [[Snorri Sturluson]], and the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'', a collection of poems from earlier traditional material anonymously compiled in the 13th century.<ref name=\"EDDAS-IN-TIME\">{{harvp|Faulkes|1995|pp=vi\u2013xxi}}, and {{harvp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=1\u201334}}.</ref>\n\nThe ''Prose Edda'' was composed as a prose manual for producing [[skald]]ic poetry\u2014traditional [[Old Norse]] poetry composed by [[skald]]s. Originally composed and transmitted orally, skaldic poetry utilizes [[alliterative verse]], [[kenning]]s, and various metrical forms. The ''Prose Edda'' presents numerous examples of works by various skalds from before and after the Christianization process and also frequently refers back to the poems found in the ''Poetic Edda''. The ''Poetic Edda'' consists almost entirely of poems, with some prose narrative added, and this poetry\u2014''Eddic'' poetry\u2014utilizes fewer [[kenning]]s. In comparison to skaldic poetry, Eddic poetry is relatively unadorned.<ref name=\"EDDAS-IN-TIME\"/>\n\nThe ''Prose Edda'' features layers of [[Euhemerism|euhemerization]], a process in which deities and supernatural beings are presented as having been either actual, magic-wielding human beings who have been [[Apotheosis|deified]] in time or beings [[Demonization|demonized]] by way of [[Christian mythology]].{{sfnp|Faulkes|1995|pp=xvi\u2013xviii}} Texts such as ''[[Heimskringla]]'', composed in the 13th century by Snorri and ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'', composed in [[Latin]] by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] in Denmark in the 12th century, are the results of heavy amounts of euhemerization.{{sfnp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=27\u201334}}\n\nNumerous further texts, such as the [[sagas]], provide further information. The saga corpus consists of thousands of tales recorded in Old Norse ranging from Icelandic family histories ([[Sagas of Icelanders]]) to [[Migration period]] tales mentioning historic figures such as [[Attila the Hun]] ([[legendary saga]]s). Objects and monuments such as the [[R\u00f6k Runestone]] and the [[Kvinneby amulet]] feature [[runic inscriptions]]\u2014texts written in the [[runic alphabet]], the indigenous alphabet of the Germanic peoples\u2014that mention figures and events from Norse mythology.<ref name=\"SAGAS-AND-RUNES\">{{harvp|Lindow|2001|pp=11\u201312}}, {{harvp|Turville-Petre|1964|pp=17\u201321}}, and {{harvp|MacLeod|Mees|2006|pp=27\u201328, 216}}.</ref>\n\nObjects from the archaeological record may also be interpreted as depictions of subjects from Norse mythology, such as amulets of the god Thor's hammer [[Mj\u00f6lnir]] found among pagan burials and small silver female figures interpreted as [[valkyrie]]s or [[d\u00edsir]], beings associated with war, fate or ancestor cults.<ref name=\"HAMMER-AND-DISIR\">Regarding the d\u00edsir, valkyries, and figurines (with images), see {{harvp|Lindow|2001|pp=95\u201397}}.

Numerous gods are mentioned in the source texts. As evidenced by records of personal names and place names, the most popular god among the Scandinavians during the Viking Age was [[Thor]], who is portrayed as unrelentingly pursuing his foes, his mountain-crushing, thunderous hammer [[Mj\u00f6lnir]] in hand. In the mythology, Thor lays waste to numerous j\u00f6tnar who are foes to the gods or humanity, and is wed to the beautiful, golden-haired goddess [[Sif]].{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=287\u201391}}\n\nThe god [[Odin]] is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts. One-eyed, [[Geri and Freki|wolf]]- and [[Huginn and Muninn|raven]]-flanked, with spear in hand, Odin pursues knowledge throughout the worlds. In an act of self-sacrifice, Odin is described as having hanged himself upside-down for nine days and nights on the cosmological tree [[Yggdrasil]] to gain knowledge of the runic alphabet, which he passed on to humanity, and is associated closely with death, wisdom, and poetry. Odin is portrayed as the ruler of [[Asgard]], and leader of the [[\u00c6sir|Aesir]]. Odin's wife is the powerful goddess [[Frigg]] who can see the future but tells no one, and together they have a beloved son, [[Baldr]]. After a series of dreams had by [[Baldr]]of his impending death, his death is engineered by [[Loki]], and Baldr thereafter resides in [[Hel (location)|Hel]], a realm ruled over by an [[Hel (being)|entity of the same name]].{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=128\u201329, 247\u201352}}\n\nOdin must share half of his share of the dead with a powerful goddess, [[Freyja]]. She is beautiful, sensual, wears a feathered cloak, and practices [[sei\u00f0r]]. She rides to battle to choose among the slain and brings her chosen to her afterlife field [[F\u00f3lkvangr]]. Freyja weeps for her missing husband [[\u00d3\u00f0r]], and seeks after him in faraway lands.{{sfnp|Lindow|2001|pp=118, 126\u201328}} Freyja's brother, the god [[Freyr]], is also frequently mentioned in surviving texts, and in his association with the weather, royalty, human sexuality, and agriculture brings peace and pleasure to humanity.

The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], France's king from 1364 to 1380, had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden.

By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: ''F. vesca'', ''F. moschata'', and ''F. viridis''. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated [[Asexual propagation|asexually]] by cutting off the runners.\n\nTwo subspecies of ''F. vesca'' were identified: ''F. sylvestris alba'' and ''F. sylvestris semperflorens''. The introduction of ''F. virginiana'' from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of history because it is one of the two species that give rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712 introduced a strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we have today.\n\nThe Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of ''F. chiloensis'', the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit.  French gardeners in Brest and [[Cherbourg]] around the mid 18th century first noticed that when ''F. moschata'' and ''F. virginiana'' were planted in between rows of ''F. chiloensis'', the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits. Soon after, [[Antoine Nicolas Duchesne]] began to study the [[breeding of strawberries]] and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding, such as the sexual reproduction of strawberry which he published in 1766. Duchesne discovered that the female ''F. chiloensis'' plants could only be pollinated by male ''F. moschata'' or ''F. virginiana'' plants.<ref name=\"duchesne\">{{cite book |url=http://specialcollections.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide/darrow/Darrow_TheStrawberry.pdf |title=The strawberry; history, breeding, and physiology |year=1966 |publisher=New York Holt Rinehart and Winstonrived}}</ref> This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers. \n\nDuchesne determined ''F. ananassa'' to be a hybrid of ''F. chiloensis'' and ''F. virginiana''. ''F. ananassa'', which produces large fruits, is so-named because it resembles the pineapple in smell, taste and berry shape. In England, many varieties of ''F. ananassa'' were produced to form the basis of modern varieties of strawberries currently cultivated and consumed. Further breeding were also conducted in Europe and America to improve the hardiness, disease resistance, size, and taste of strawberries.<ref name=\"duchesne\"/>\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Strawberry flower.jpg|thumb|Strawberry flower]]\n[[File:Strawberry growth (Video).webm|thumb|Strawberry growth (video)]]\n[[File:D\u00fclmen, Kirchspiel, Erdbeerfeld -- 2015 -- 6492-6.jpg|left|thumb|Strawberry field in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]]\n[[File:Strawberry Plant in early June.JPG|thumb|''Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa'' in the [[UBC Botanical Garden]]]]\n[[File:Plasticulture.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large strawberry field with plastic covering the earth around the strawberry plants.|A field using the plasticulture method]]\n\nStrawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.<ref name=\"missouri1\">{{cite web |url=http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6135 |title=G6135 Home Fruit Production: Strawberry Cultivars and Their Culture|publisher=University of Missouri}}</ref> On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://strawberryplants.org/2010/05/strawberry-seeds/|title=Strawberry Seeds|last=|first=|date=|website=Strawberry Plants|publisher=|access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref> Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs.

In this method, raised beds are formed each year, [[fumigation|fumigated]], and covered with plastic to prevent weed growth and erosion. Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath. Runners are removed from the plants as they appear, in order to encourage the plants to put most of their energy into fruit development. At the end of the harvest season, the plastic is removed and the plants are plowed into the ground.<ref name=\"osu-2126\" /><ref name=\"noble\">{{cite web |url=http://www.noble.org/Ag/Horticulture/StrawberryFields/index.html |title=Strawberry Fields Forever |publisher=Noble.org }}</ref> Because strawberry plants more than a year or two old begin to decline in productivity and fruit quality, this system of replacing the plants each year allows for improved yields and denser plantings.<ref name=\"osu-2126\" /><ref name=\"noble\" /> However, because it requires a longer growing season to allow for establishment of the plants each year, and because of the increased costs in terms of forming and covering the mounds and purchasing plants each year, it is not always practical in all areas.<ref name=\"noble\" />\n\nThe other major method, which uses the same plants from year to year growing in rows or on mounds, is most common in colder climates.<ref name=\"osu-2126\" /><ref name=\"nevfc_production\" /> It has lower investment costs, and lower overall maintenance requirements.<ref name=\"nevfc_production\" /> Yields are typically lower than in plasticulture.<ref name=\"nevfc_production\" />\n\nAnother method uses a compost sock.

The French began taking the strawberry from the forest to their gardens for harvest in the 14th century. [[Charles V of France|Charles V]], France's king from 1364 to 1380, had 1,200 strawberry plants in his royal garden. In the early 15th century western European monks were using the wild strawberry in their illuminated manuscripts. The strawberry is found in Italian, Flemish, and German art, and in English miniatures.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} The entire strawberry plant was used to treat depressive illnesses.\n\nBy the 16th century, references of cultivation of the strawberry became more common. People began using it for its supposed medicinal properties and botanists began naming the different species. In England the demand for regular strawberry farming had increased by the mid-16th century.\n\nThe combination of strawberries and cream was created by [[Thomas Wolsey]] in the court of King [[Henry VIII]].<ref name=\"Wimbledon\">{{cite news|title=Wimbledon's strawberries and cream has Tudor roots|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/surrey/hi/people_and_places/newsid_8756000/8756132.stm|agency=BBC|date=9 June 2015}}</ref> Instructions for growing and harvesting strawberries showed up in writing in 1578. By the end of the 16th century three European species had been cited: ''F. vesca'', ''F. moschata'', and ''F. viridis''. The garden strawberry was transplanted from the forests and then the plants would be propagated [[Asexual propagation|asexually]] by cutting off the runners.\n\nTwo subspecies of ''F. vesca'' were identified: ''F. sylvestris alba'' and ''F. sylvestris semperflorens''. The introduction of ''F. virginiana'' from Eastern North America to Europe in the 17th century is an important part of history because it is one of the two species that give rise to the modern strawberry. The new species gradually spread through the continent and did not become completely appreciated until the end of the 18th century. When a French excursion journeyed to Chile in 1712 introduced a strawberry plant with female flowers that resulted in the common strawberry that we have today.\n\nThe Mapuche and Huilliche Indians of Chile cultivated the female strawberry species until 1551, when the Spanish came to conquer the land. In 1765, a European explorer recorded the cultivation of ''F. chiloensis'', the Chilean strawberry. At first introduction to Europe, the plants grew vigorously but produced no fruit.  French gardeners in Brest and [[Cherbourg]] around the mid 18th century first noticed that when ''F. moschata'' and ''F. virginiana'' were planted in between rows of ''F. chiloensis'', the Chilean strawberry would bear abundant and unusually large fruits. Soon after, [[Antoine Nicolas Duchesne]] began to study the [[breeding of strawberries]] and made several discoveries crucial to the science of plant breeding, such as the sexual reproduction of strawberry which he published in 1766. Duchesne discovered that the female ''F. chiloensis'' plants could only be pollinated by male ''F. moschata'' or ''F. virginiana'' plants.<ref name=\"duchesne\">{{cite book |url=http://specialcollections.nal.usda.gov/speccoll/collectionsguide/darrow/Darrow_TheStrawberry.pdf |title=The strawberry; history, breeding, and physiology |year=1966 |publisher=New York Holt Rinehart and Winstonrived}}</ref> This is when the Europeans became aware that plants had the ability to produce male-only or female-only flowers. \n\nDuchesne determined ''F. ananassa'' to be a hybrid of ''F. chiloensis'' and ''F. virginiana''. ''F. ananassa'', which produces large fruits, is so-named because it resembles the pineapple in smell, taste and berry shape. In England, many varieties of ''F. ananassa'' were produced to form the basis of modern varieties of strawberries currently cultivated and consumed. Further breeding were also conducted in Europe and America to improve the hardiness, disease resistance, size, and taste of strawberries.<ref name=\"duchesne\"/>\n\n== Cultivation ==\n[[File:Strawberry flower.jpg|thumb|Strawberry flower]]\n[[File:Strawberry growth (Video).webm|thumb|Strawberry growth (video)]]\n[[File:D\u00fclmen, Kirchspiel, Erdbeerfeld -- 2015 -- 6492-6.jpg|left|thumb|Strawberry field in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany]]\n[[File:Strawberry Plant in early June.JPG|thumb|''Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa'' in the [[UBC Botanical Garden]]]]\n[[File:Plasticulture.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A large strawberry field with plastic covering the earth around the strawberry plants.|A field using the plasticulture method]]\n\nStrawberry cultivars vary widely in size, color, flavor, shape, degree of fertility, season of ripening, liability to disease and constitution of plant.<ref name=\"missouri1\">{{cite web |url=http://extension.missouri.edu/publications/DisplayPub.aspx?P=G6135 |title=G6135 Home Fruit Production: Strawberry Cultivars and Their Culture|publisher=University of Missouri}}</ref> On average, a strawberry has about 200 seeds on its external membrane.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://strawberryplants.org/2010/05/strawberry-seeds/|title=Strawberry Seeds|last=|first=|date=|website=Strawberry Plants|publisher=|access-date=2 August 2016}}</ref> Some vary in foliage, and some vary materially in the relative development of their sexual organs.

Plants, usually obtained from northern nurseries, are planted through holes punched in this covering, and irrigation tubing is run underneath.

According to Russian sources, after 1 p.m., Turkish troops conducted more than 15 [[Man-portable air-defense system|MANPADS]] attacks against the Russian and Syrian jets, with some Russian aircraft allegedly suffering damage while evading the fire.<ref name = \"deciphering\"/>\n\nAt around 5 p.m., a 400-man Turkish mechanized infantry battalion traveling in a convoy was targeted by an airstrike on the road between al-Bara and Balyun, around five kilometers north of [[Kafr Nabl]]. A light airstrike by a Su-22s halted the convoy, after which more intense bombing forced the Turkish soldiers to take shelter in the nearby buildings. According to ''[[Al-Monitor]]'', \"What followed next was likely the dropping of [[KAB-1500L]] bombs...by the Russian jets\", collapsing two buildings and leaving a number of soldiers under the rubble.

An example of such territories was the 1961 [[Indian annexation of Goa]]. An example of annexation of a territory from the British Raj was the [[Indian integration of Junagadh]].\n\n[[Akhand Bharat]], literally Undivided India or Whole India, is an irredentist call to reunite [[Pakistan]] and [[Bangladesh]] (and for some Sri Lanka, Maldives, Nepal and Bhutan) with [[India]] to form an ''Undivided India'' as it existed before [[Partition of India|partition]] in 1947 during the [[British Raj]] (and before that, during other periods of political unity in [[South Asia]] when most of the [[Indian Subcontinent]] was under the rule of one power, such as during the [[Maurya Empire]], the [[Gupta Empire]], the [[Mughal Empire]] or the [[Maratha Empire]]). The call for ''Akhanda Bharata'' has often been raised by mainstream [[India]]n nationalistic cultural and political organizations such as the [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS) and the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=Ferguson>Yale H.

Multiple wars have been fought over the issue, the first one immediately upon independence and partition in 1947 itself. To stave off a Pakistani and tribal invasion, [[Maharaja]] [[Hari Singh]] of the [[princely state]] of [[Kashmir and Jammu (princely state)|Jammu and Kashmir]] signed the [[Instrument of Accession]] with India. Kashmir has remained divided in three parts, administered by India, Pakistan and [[China]], since then. However, on the basis of the instrument of accession, India continues to claim the entire Kashmir region as its integral part. All modern Indian political parties support the return of the entirety of Kashmir to India, and all official maps of India show the entire Kashmir (including parts under Pakistani or Chinese administration after 1947) as an integral part of India.\n\n===Indonesia===\n{{Main|Greater Indonesia}}\n[[File:Westpapua.png|thumb|[[Western New Guinea]] was incorporated into Indonesia in 1969]]\nIndonesia claimed all territories of the former [[Dutch East Indies]], and previously viewed British plans to group the [[British Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] into a new independent federation of [[Malaysia]] as a threat to its objective to create a united state called [[Greater Indonesia]].

The [[United Nations General Assembly]] passed U.N. Resolution 181, otherwise known as the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]], with 72% of the valid votes. Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. From 1995 to 2017, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and in May 2018 the embassy officially did so.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref>\n\nA number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and allege that the area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Japanese nationalism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\nJapan claims the two southernmost islands of the [[Russia]]n-administered [[Kuril Islands]], the island chain north of [[Hokkaido]], annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] following World War II.

The [[Kingdom of Spain]] formally ceded the territory in perpetuity to the British Crown in 1713, under [[:s:Peace and Friendship Treaty of Utrecht between Spain and Great Britain#ARTICLE X|Article X]] of the [[Treaty of Utrecht]]. Spain's territorial claim was formally reasserted by the Spanish dictator [[Francisco Franco]] in the 1960s and has been continued by successive [[Government of Spain|Spanish governments]]. In 2002 an agreement in principle on joint sovereignty over [[Gibraltar]] between the governments of the United Kingdom and Spain was decisively rejected in a [[2002 Gibraltar sovereignty referendum|referendum]].

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to claim [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n=== Asia ===\n====East Asia====\n=====China=====\n{{Main|Chinese nationalism|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty over Macau}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nWhen [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories, respectively, China considered these two territories to be Chinese territories under British and Portuguese administration. Therefore, [[Hong Kong people]] and [[Macau people]] descended from Chinese immigrants were entitled to [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport]] or [[Macao Special Administrative Region passport]] after the two territories became the [[special administrative region]]s.\n\n=====Korea=====\nThe 1909 [[Gando Convention]] addressed a territory dispute between China and [[Joseon Korea]] in China's favour. Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz. [[Dandong]] and [[Liaoning]]. The most ambitious claims include all parts of [[Manchuria]] that the [[Goguryeo]] kingdom controlled.\n\n=====Mongolia=====\n{{Main|Pan-Mongolism}}\n\nThe irredentist idea that advocates cultural and political solidarity of [[Mongols]]. The proposed territory usually includes the independent state of [[Mongolia]], the Chinese regions of [[Inner Mongolia]] (Southern Mongolia) and [[Dzungaria]] (in [[Xinjiang]]), and the Russian subjects of [[Buryatia]]. Sometimes [[Tuva]] and the [[Altai Republic]] are included as well.\n\n====South Asia====\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\n[[South Asia]] too is another region in which armed irredentist movements have been active for almost a century. Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population. In 1998, Lieutenant General S.K. Sinha, then the Governor of Assam, claimed that massive illegal immigration from Bangladesh was directly linked with \"the long-cherished design of Greater Bangladesh\".{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\n=====India=====\n{{Main|Indian nationalism|Greater India|Akhand Bharat}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe call for creation of ''Akhanda Bharata'' or ''Akhand Hindustan'' has on occasion been raised by some [[India]]n right wing [[Hindutva]]di cultural and political organisations, such as the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Hindu Mahasabha]], [[Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh]] (RSS), [[Vishwa Hindu Parishad]], [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP).<ref name=\"Ferguson\"/><ref name=\"Majumder\"/><ref name=\"Martensson\"/><ref name=\"Suda1953\">{{cite book|last=Suda|first=Jyoti Prasad|title=India, Her Civic Life and Administration|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVsNAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=23 July 2014|year=1953|publisher=Jai Prakash Nath & Co.|quote=Its members still swear by the ideal of Akhand Hindustan.}}</ref> The name of one organisation sharing this goal, the [[Akhand Hindustan Morcha]], bears the term in its name.<ref>{{cite book|title=Hindu Political Parties|date=30 May 2010|publisher=General Books|isbn=9781157374923}}</ref> Other major Indian non-sectarian political parties, such as the [[Indian National Congress]], maintain a position against the [[partition of India]] .\n\n=====Iran=====\n{{Main|Pan-Iranism|Greater Iran}}\n\n[[Pan-Iranism]] is an [[ideology]] that advocates solidarity and reunification of [[Iranian people]]s living in the [[Iranian plateau]] and other regions that have significant Iranian cultural influence, including the [[Persian people|Persians]], [[Azerbaijanis]], [[Ossetians]], [[Kurds]], [[Zazas]], [[Tajiks]] of [[Tajikistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], the [[Pashtuns]] and the [[Baloch people|Baloch]] of [[Pakistan]].

Parliament met on 28 January 1920 and published their decisions on 12 February 1920. These decisions worried the occupying [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], resulting in the [[Occupation of Constantinople]] by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]], [[French Third Republic|French]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] troops on 16 March 1920 and the establishment of a new [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish nationalist]] parliament, the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]], in [[Ankara Government|Ankara]].\n\nThe Ottoman Minister of Internal Affairs, [[Damat Ferid Pasha]], made the opening speech of parliament due to [[Mehmed VI]]'s illness. A group of parliamentarians called ''Fel\u00e2h-\u0131 Vatan'' was established by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk|Mustafa Kemal]]'s friends to acknowledge the decisions taken at the [[Erzurum Congress]] and the [[Sivas Congress]]. Mustafa Kemal said \"It is the nation's iron fist that writes the Nation's Oath which is the main principle of our independence to the annals of history.\" Decisions taken by this parliament were used as the basis for the new [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]'s claims in the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)|Treaty of Lausanne]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}}\n\n=====United Arab Emirates=====\nThe [[Greater and Lesser Tunbs]] are disputed by the [[United Arab Emirates]] against [[Iran]].\n\n=====Yemen=====\n{{Main|Greater Yemen}}\n\n[[File:Rasulid_1264.jpg|thumb|240px|right|Rasulid Kingdom encompassing [[Greater Yemen]] around 1264 AD]]\n\nGreater Yemen is a theory giving Yemen claim to former territories that were held by various predecessor states that existed between the [[Himyarite]] period and 18th century.

Greater Serbia consists of [[Serbia]], [[North Macedonia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Montenegro]] and [[Virovitica-Karlovac-Karlobag line|large parts of Croatia]].\n\n====France====\n{{Main|Natural borders of France}}\n\n====Germany====\n{{Main|German Question|Pan-Germanism|Anschluss|Munich Agreement}}\n\nDuring the debate of what was then called the [[German Question]] (''die deutsche Frage'') in the 19th century prior to the [[unification of Germany]] (1871), the term ''Gro\u00dfdeutschland'', \"Greater Germany\", referred to a possible German nation consisting of the states that later comprised the [[German Empire]] and [[Austria]]. The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy.

Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary.

Eventually, Israeli independence was achieved following the liquidation of the former British-administered Mandate of Palestine, the departure of the British and the \"Independence War\" between the Jews in ex-[[Mandatory Palestine]] and five Arab states' armies. The Jewish claim to Palestine as a [[Jewish homeland]] can be seen as an example of irredentist reclamation of what is considered lost Jewish land by Zionists. These claims are based on ancestral inhabitance (and in some periods sovereignty) in the land and the cultural/religious significance of it in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. The latter is particularly relevant to the Israeli claim to Jerusalem. [[Mandatory Palestine]] had sizable [[History of the Jews in Palestine|Jewish]] and [[Palestinians|Arab]] populations before the Second World War.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n[[Judea]] and [[Samaria]], as they are called in the Bible, were part of the ancient [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]] (designated the [[West Bank]] by Jordan in 1947) and the [[Gaza Strip]], previously annexed by Jordan and occupied by Egypt respectively, were conquered and occupied by Israel in the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967. Israel withdrew from Gaza in August 2005; Judea and Samaria (West Bank) remain under Israeli control. Israel has never explicitly claimed sovereignty over any part of the West Bank apart from [[East Jerusalem]], which it unilaterally annexed in 1980. However, the Israeli military supports and defends hundreds of thousands of Israeli citizens who have [[Israeli settlements|migrated]] to the West Bank, incurring criticism by some who otherwise support Israel. The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, and some countries and international organizations continue to regard Israel as occupying Gaza. ''(See [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli-Occupied Territories]])''\n\n[[File:Israel and occupied territories map.png|thumb|Israel and [[Israeli-occupied territories]]]]\nThe Israeli annexing instrument, the [[Jerusalem Law]]\u2014one of the [[Basic Laws of Israel]] (Israel does not have a constitution)\u2014declares Jerusalem, \"complete and united\", to be the capital of Israel. Article 3 of the Basic Law of the [[Palestinian Authority]], which was ratified in 2002 by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] and serves as an interim constitution, claims that \"[[Jerusalem]] is the capital of Palestine\". ''De facto'', the Palestinian government administers the parts of the [[West Bank]] that Israel has granted it authority over from [[Ramallah]], while the [[Gaza Strip]] is administered by [[Hamas|the Hamas movement]] from [[Gaza City|Gaza]].\n\nThe United States did not recognize Israeli sovereignty over East Jerusalem until 2017. In Jerusalem, the United States maintained two Consulates General as a diplomatic representation to the city of Jerusalem alone, separate from representation to the state of Israel. One of the Consulates General was established before the 1967 war, and the other in a recently constructed building on the Israeli side of Jerusalem. Moreover, Congress passed the [[Jerusalem Embassy Act]] in 1995 that says the US shall move its embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, but allows the [[President of the United States|president]] to delay the move every year if it is deemed contrary to national security interests. From 1995 to 2017, every president delayed the move. However, President [[Donald Trump]] in December 2017 declared his intention to move the embassy to Jerusalem and in May 2018 the embassy officially did so.<ref>{{cite news |author=Mark Landler |date=6 December 2017 |title=Trump Recognizes Jerusalem as Israel's Capital and Orders U.S. Embassy to Move |newspaper=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/12/06/world/middleeast/trump-jerusalem-israel-capital.html}}</ref>\n\nA number of Israelis and Jews regard the [[Transjordan (region)|East Bank of the Jordan river]] (which is today the [[Jordan|Kingdom of Jordan]]) as the eastern parts of the [[Land of Israel]] (following the [[Revisionist Zionism|revisionist]] idea) because, according to the Bible, the [[Tribes of Israel|Israelite tribes]] of [[Tribe of Manasseh|Menasseh]], [[Tribe of Gad|Gad]], and [[Tribe of Reuben|Reuben]] settled on the east bank of the Jordan, and allege that the area was designated a [[Homeland for the Jewish people|Jewish national home]] by the [[League of Nations]] in the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate for Palestine]] based upon the recognized historical connection of the Jewish people to the land.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}} Cited as an explicit basis not to create, but to reconstitute the historical homeland of the Jewish people as a nation-state roughly analogous to the former Kingdom of Israel subject to change by treaty, capitulation, grant, usage, sufferance or other lawful means, it forms a basis for claims of sovereign jurisdiction.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===Japan===\n{{main|Japanese nationalism}}\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\nJapan claims the two southernmost islands of the [[Russia]]n-administered [[Kuril Islands]], the island chain north of [[Hokkaido]], annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] following World War II.

This state did not include [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised six counties in the north-east of the island of [[Ireland]] which remained in the United Kingdom. When the [[Constitution of Ireland]] was adopted in 1937 it provided that the name of the state is ''Ireland'' and this is considered the time that the Republic of Ireland became a fully fledged independent nation. In the constitution [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]] provided that \"[t]he national territory consists of the whole island of Ireland\", while stipulating that \"[p]ending the re-integration of the national territory\", the powers of the state were restricted to legislate only for the area which had formed part of the [[Irish Free State]]. Arising from the [[Northern Ireland peace process]], the matter was mutually resolved as part of the [[Good Friday Agreement]] in 1998. [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]]'s constitution was altered by [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|referendum]] and its territorial claim to [[Northern Ireland]] was removed.\n\nThe amended constitution asserts that while it is the entitlement of \"every person born in the island of Ireland \u2026 to be part of the Irish Nation\" and to hold Irish citizenship, \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\". A [[North/South Ministerial Council]] was created between the two jurisdictions and given executive authority. The advisory and consultative role of the government of Ireland in the government of Northern Ireland granted by the United Kingdom, that had begun with the 1985 [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]], was maintained, although that Agreement itself was ended. The two states also settled the long-running [[Names of the Irish state|dispute concerning their respective names]]: ''Ireland'' and the ''United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland'', with both governments agreeing to use those names.\n\nUnder the [[Irish republicanism|Irish republican]] theory of [[Irish republican legitimism|legitimism]], the [[Irish Republic]] declared in 1916 was in existence from then on, denying the legitimacy of either the state of Ireland or the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. Through much of its [[history of Sinn F\u00e9in|history]], this was the position of [[Sinn F\u00e9in]]; however, it effectively abandoned this stance after accepting the Good Friday Agreement. Small groups which split from Sinn F\u00e9in continue to adopt this stance, including [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], linked with the [[Continuity Irish Republican Army|Continuity IRA]], and the [[32 County Sovereignty Movement]], linked with the [[Real Irish Republican Army|Real IRA]].\n\n==Historic, theoretical and fringe irredentistic claims==\n{{Multiple issues|section=yes|\n {{recentism|section|date=February 2018}}\n {{split section|date=February 2018}}\n}}\n\n=== Africa ===\nIrredentism is commonplace in [[Africa]] due to the political boundaries of former European colonial nation-states passing through ethnic boundaries, and recent declarations of independence after civil war. For example, some Ethiopian nationalist circles still claim the former Ethiopian province of [[Eritrea]] (internationally recognized as the independent State of Eritrea in 1993 after a 30-year civil war).\n\n====East Africa====\n=====Somalia=====\n{{Main|Greater Somalia}}\n\n[[File:Somali map.jpg|thumb|Estimated ethnic Somali territory in relation to neighbouring countries.The area is roughly coextensive with [[Greater Somalia]].]]\n\nGreater Somalia refers to the region in the Horn of Africa in which [[Somalis|ethnic Somalis]] are and have historically represented the predominant population. The territory encompasses The Republic of Somalia, the Ogaden region in Ethiopia, the North Eastern Province in Kenya and southern and eastern Djibouti. [[Ogaden]] in eastern Ethiopia has seen military and civic movements seeking to make it part of [[Somalia]]. This culminated in the 1977\u201378 [[Ogaden War]] between the two neighbours where the Somali military offensive between July 1977 and March 1978 over the disputed Ethiopian region Ogaden ended when the Somali Armed Forces retreated back across the border and a truce was declared. The Kenyan [[Northern Frontier District]] also saw conflict during the [[Shifta War]] (1963\u20131967) when a secessionist conflict in which ethnic Somalis in the [[Lamu County|Lamu]], [[Garissa County|Garissa]], [[Wajir County|Wajir]] and [[Mandera County|Mandera]] [[Counties of Kenya|counties]] (all except [[Lamu County|Lamu]] formed part of the former [[North Eastern Province (Kenya)|North Eastern Province]], abolished in 2013), attempted to join with their fellow Somalis in a \"[[Greater Somalia]]\". There has been no similar conflicts in Djibouti, which was previously known as the \"[[French Somaliland]]\" during colonisation. Here the apparent struggles for unification manifested itself in political strife that ended when in a referendum to join France as opposed to the Somali Republic succeeded among rumours of widespread [[vote rigging]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Africa Research Bulletin, Volume 3|author=Africa Research, Ltd|date=1966|publisher=Blackwell|page=597|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=42oEAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=18 December 2014}}</ref> and the subsequent death of Somali nationalist [[Mahmoud Harbi]], Vice President of the Government Council, who was killed in a plane crash two years later under suspicious circumstances.<ref name=Barrington2006>Barrington, Lowell, ''After Independence: Making and Protecting the Nation in Postcolonial and Postcommunist States'', (University of Michigan Press: 2006), p.115</ref>\nSome sources say that Somalia has also laid a claim to the [[Socotra]] archipelago, which is currently governed by [[Yemen]].\n\n====North Africa====\nIn North Africa, the prime examples of irredentism are the concepts of [[Greater Morocco]] and [[Greater Mauritania]].<ref>http://www.bundesheer.at/pdf_pool/publikationen/hasa03.pdf</ref> While Mauritania has since relinquished any claims to territories [[Tiris al-Gharbiyya|outside its internationally recognized borders]], Morocco continues to claim [[Western Sahara]], which it refers to as its \"[[Southern Provinces]]\".\n\n=== Asia ===\n====East Asia====\n=====China=====\n{{Main|Chinese nationalism|Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Transfer of sovereignty over Macau}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nWhen [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]] were [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[Portugal|Portuguese]] territories, respectively, China considered these two territories to be Chinese territories under British and Portuguese administration.

Both Korean states now accept the convention border as an administrative boundary. However, because the convention was made by the occupying [[Empire of Japan]], [[South Korea]] has disputed its legality and some Koreans claim that Korea extends into ''de facto'' PRC territory, viz.

Most prominent amongst them are the [[Naga (clan)|Naga]] fight for Greater [[Nagaland]], the [[Chin people|Chin]] struggle for a unified [[Chinland]], the [[Sri Lankan Tamil]] struggle for a return of their state under [[Tamil Eelam]] and other self-determinist movements by the [[ethnic]] [[indigenous peoples]] of the erstwhile [[Assam]] both under the British and post-British Assam under India.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Other such movements include [[Belgaum border dispute|Be\u1e3bag\u0101va border dispute]] on [[Maharashtra]] and [[Karnataka]] border with intentions to unite all [[Marathi people|Marathi]] speaking people under one state since the formation of the Karnataka state and dissolution of the bilingual [[Bombay state]].\n\n=====Bangladesh=====\n{{Main|Greater Bangladesh}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nGreater Bangladesh is an assumption of several Indian intellectuals that the neighbouring country of Bangladesh has an aspiration to unite all Bengali dominated regions under their flag. These include the states of [[West Bengal]], [[Tripura]] and [[Assam]] as well as the [[Andaman Islands]] which are currently part of India and the Burmese [[Rakhine State|State of Rakhine]]. The theory is principally based on a widespread belief amongst Indian masses that a large number of illegal Bangladeshi immigrants reside in Indian territory. It is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh as well as the state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nScholars have reflected that under the guise of anti-Bangladeshi immigrant movement it is actually an anti-Muslim agenda pointed towards Bangladeshi Muslims by false propaganda and widely exaggerated claims on immigrant population.

The term ''Kleindeutschland'' \"Lesser Germany\" referred to a possible German state without Austria. The term was later used by Germans referring to Greater Germany, a state consisting of pre\u2013World War I Germany, Austria and the [[Sudetenland]].\n\nA main point of [[Nazism|Nazi ideology]] was to reunify all Germans either born or living outside of Germany to create an \"all-German [[Reich]]\". These beliefs ultimately resulted in the Munich Agreement, which ceded to Germany [[The Sudetenland|areas of Czechoslovakia]] that were mainly inhabited by those of German descent, and the ''[[Anschluss]]'', which ceded the entire country of Austria to Germany; both events occurred in 1938.\n\n====Greece====\n{{Main|Megali Idea}}\n\n[[File:ParisPeace-Venizelos-Map.png|thumb|Claims presented by Greece at the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919]].]]\n\nFollowing the [[Greek War of Independence]] in 1821\u20131832, [[Greece]] began to contest areas inhabited by Greeks, primarily against the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The [[Megali Idea]] (Great Idea) envisioned Greek incorporation of Greek-inhabited lands, but also historical lands in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] corresponding with the predominantly Greek and Orthodox [[Byzantine Empire]] and the dominions of the ancient Greeks.\n\nThe Greek quest began with the acquisition of [[Thessaly]] through the [[Convention of Constantinople (1881)|Convention of Constantinople in 1881]], [[Greco-Turkish War (1897)|a failed war against Turkey in 1897]] and the [[Balkan Wars]] ([[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]], [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], some [[Aegean Islands]]). After World War I, Greece acquired [[Western Thrace]] from [[Bulgaria]] as per the [[Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine]], but also [[Ionia]]/[[\u0130zmir|Smyrna]] and [[East Thrace|Eastern Thrace]] (excluding [[Istanbul|Constantinople]]) from the Ottoman Empire as ordained in the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]]. Subsequently, Greece launched an [[Greco-Turkish War (1919\u201322)|unsuccessful campaign]] to further their gains in Asia Minor, but were halted by the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish revolution]]. The events culminated into the [[Great Fire of Smyrna]], [[Population exchange between Greece and Turkey]], and [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which returned Eastern Thrace and Ionia to the newfound Turkish Republic. The events are known as the \"Asia Minor Catastrophe\" to Greeks. The [[Ionian Islands]] were ceded by Britain in 1864, and the [[Dodecanese]] by Italy in 1947.\n\nAnother concern of the Greeks is the [[Enosis|incorporation of Cyprus]] which was ceded by the Ottomans to [[British Cyprus (1878\u20131960)|the British]]. As a result of the [[Cyprus Emergency]] the island gained independence as the [[Cyprus|Republic of Cyprus]] in 1960. The failed incorporation by Greece through [[1974 Cypriot coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'\u00e9tat]] and the [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus]] in 1974 led to the formation of the mostly unrecognized [[Northern Cyprus]] and has culminated into the present-day [[Cyprus dispute|Cyprus issue]].\n\nThe Aegean islands of [[Imbros and Tenedos]] which were not ceded to Greece over the course of the 20th century and where the dominant Greek community has faced persecution are also of concern.\n\n====Hungary====\n[[File:Territorial_gains_of_Hungary_1938-41_en.svg|thumb|Map of territories reassigned to Hungary in 1938\u20131941 including [[Northern Transylvania]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia|Transcarpathia]]]]\n\n{{Main|Hungarian irredentism}}\n\n{{Expand section|date=December 2015}}\n\nThe restoration of the borders of [[Hungary]] to their state prior to World War I, in order to unite all ethnic Hungarians within the same country once again.\n\n====Italy====\n[[File:RegioniIrredenteItalia.jpg|thumb|Italian territory claims by Italian irredentism activists in the 1930s.]]\n\n{{Main|Italian irredentism|Italian Empire}}\n\nItaly's territorial claims were on the basis of re-establishing a Romanesque Empire, a fourth shore according to the concept of Mare Nostrum (Latin for 'Our Sea') and traditional ethnic borders. Evident in Italy's rapid takeover of surrounding territories under Fascist leader Benito Mussolini and claims following the collapsed 1915 [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]] and 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]] which established feelings of betrayal. Mussolini and Hitler's similarities including a joint hatred towards the French and wanting to expand their territories brought the two leaders together, solidified in the [[Pact of Steel]] and later WW2. By 1942 Italy had conquered Abyssinia (modern day Ethiopia and Eritrea), Libya, much of the north coast of Egypt, and what is now Somalia. And \u2013 on the European continent, and with significant German assistance, \u2013 Istria, Dalmatia, Albania, Slovenia, Croatia, Macedonia, and France's Corsica; Malta was also bombed. Underlying tensions remained with France, over its territories of Corsica, Nice and Savoy.\n\n====North Macedonia====\n{{Main|United Macedonia}}{{see also|Macedonian nationalism}}\n\nSome Macedonian nationalists promoted the irredentist concept of a [[United Macedonia]] ({{lang-mk|\u041e\u0431\u0435\u0434\u0438\u043d\u0435\u0442\u0430 \u041c\u0430\u043a\u0435\u0434\u043e\u043d\u0438\u0458\u0430|translit=Obedineta Makedonija}}) among [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|ethnic Macedonian]] [[nationalism|nationalists]], which involves territorial claims on the northern province of [[Macedonia (Greece)|Macedonia]] in [[Greece]], but also in [[Blagoevgrad Province]] (\"Pirin Macedonia\") in Bulgaria, Albania, and Serbia.

Under Danish sovereignty since they established a hegemonic position in the [[Kalmar Union]], the territories were considered as Norwegian colonies. When in the [[Treaty of Kiel]] in 1814, Norway's territories were transferred from [[Denmark]] to [[Sweden]], the territories of Iceland, Greenland, and the Faroe Islands were maintained by Denmark.\n\nIn 1919, Norway declared sovereignty over an area in Eastern Greenland in the [[Ihlen Declaration]], which led to a dispute with Denmark that was not settled until 1933, by the [[Permanent Court of International Justice]]. Norway formerly included the provinces [[J\u00e4mtland]], [[H\u00e4rjedalen]], [[Idre]]-[[S\u00e4rna]] (lost since the [[Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro (1645)|Second Treaty of Br\u00f6msebro]]), and [[Bohusl\u00e4n]] (lost since the [[Treaty of Roskilde]]), which were ceded to Sweden after Danish defeats in wars such as the [[Thirty Years' War]] and [[Second Northern War]].\n\n====Poland====\n{{See also|Polish nationalism|Kresy}}\n\n[[Kresy]] (\"Borderlands\") are the eastern lands that formerly belonged to [[Poland]].

Even though ''Kresy'', or the ''Eastern Borderlands'', are no longer Polish territories, the area is still inhabited by a significant Polish minority, and the memory of the Polish ''Kresy'' is still cultivated. The attachment to the \"myth of Kresy\", the vision of the region as a peaceful, idyllic, rural land, has been criticized in Polish discourse.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wyborcza.pl/51,97863,7751751.html?i=0Czas|title=odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Czas odczarowa\u0107 mit Kres\u00f3w Marcin Wojciechowski, Gazeta Wyborcza 2010-04-12, |publisher=}}</ref>\n\nIn January, February and March 2012, the [[Centre for Public Opinion Research]] conducted a survey, asking Poles about their ties to the Kresy.

There are Polish sports clubs ([[Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w (2009)|Pogo\u0144 Lw\u00f3w]], and formerly [[FK Polonia Vilnius]]), newspapers ([[Gazeta Lwowska]], [[Kurier Wile\u0144ski]]), radio stations (in Lviv and Vilnius), numerous theatres, schools, choirs and folk ensembles. Poles living in ''Kresy'' are helped by [[Fundacja Pomoc Polakom na Wschodzie]], a Polish government-sponsored organization, as well as other organizations, such as The ''Association of Help of Poles in the East Kresy'' (see also [[Karta Polaka]]). Money is frequently collected to help those Poles who live in the ''Kresy'', and there are several annual events, such as a ''Christmas Package for a Polish Veteran in Kresy'', and ''Summer with Poland'', sponsored by the [[Association \"Polish Community\"]], in which Polish children from ''Kresy'' are invited to visit Poland.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dzienniklodzki.pl/wakacje/432777,dzieci-z-kresow-zwiedzaja-lodz-zdjecia,id,t.html|title=Dzieci z Kres\u00f3w zwiedzaj\u0105 \u0141\u00f3d\u017a [ZDJ\u0118CIA]|first=Micha\u0142|last=Meksa|publisher=}}</ref> Polish language handbooks and films, as well as medicines and clothes are collected and sent to ''Kresy''.

Crimea was part of the [[Russian Empire]] from 1783 to 1917, after which it enjoyed a few years of autonomy until it was made part of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic]] (which was a part of the Soviet Union) from 1921 to 1954 and then [[1954 transfer of Crimea|transferred]] to [[Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Ukraine]] (which also was a part of the Soviet Union) in 1954. After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Crimea still remained part of Ukraine until February 2014. Russia declared Crimea to be part of the Russian Federation in March 2014, and effective administration commenced. The Russian regional status is not currently recognised by the UN General Assembly and by many countries.\n\nRussian irredentism also includes southeastern and coastal Ukraine, known as ''[[Novorossiya]]'', a term from the Russian Empire.\n\n====Serbia====\n{{Main|Greater Serbia}}\n\n[[File:Serbs in Croatia, Bosnia, Montenegro and Serbia, 1981.png|thumb|The distribution of Serbs and Montenegrins in Yugoslavia (except Macedonia and Slovenia) in 1981.]]\n\nSerbian irredentism is manifested in \"[[Greater Serbia]]\".

Some intellectuals sought to unite all South Slavs (regardless of religion) into a Serbian state. [[Principality of Serbia|Serbia]] had gained independence from the Ottoman Empire in 1878. Bosnia and Herzegovina, annexed by the Austrians in 1908, was viewed of as a part of the Serbian homeland. Serbia directed its territorial aspirations to the south, as the north and west was held by Austria. Macedonia was divided between Serbia and Greece after the [[Balkan Wars]].\n\nIn 1914, aspirations were directed towards Austria-Hungary. A government policy sought to incorporate all Serb-inhabited areas, and other South Slavic areas, thereby laying the foundation of [[Yugoslavia]].<ref name=\"Danver2010\">{{cite book|author=Steven L.

The Croatian [[Operation Storm]] ended large-scale combat and captured most of the [[Republic of Serbian Krajina]], while the [[Dayton Agreement]] ended the Bosnian War. Bosnia and Herzegovina was established as a federal republic, made up by two separate entities, one being Serb-inhabited [[Republika Srpska]].

[[North Korea]]'s constitution stresses the importance of reunification, but, while it makes no similar formal provision for administering the South, it effectively claims its territory as it does not [[Diplomatic recognition|diplomatically recognise]] the Republic of Korea, deeming it an \"entity occupying the Korean territory\".\n\n[[South Korea]]'s constitution also claims jurisdiction over the entire Korean peninsula. It acknowledges the [[division of Korea]] only indirectly by requiring the president to work for reunification. The [[Committee for the Five Northern Korean Provinces]], established in 1949, is the South Korean authority charged with the administration of Korean territory north of the [[Military Demarcation Line]] (i.e., North Korea), and consists of the governors of the five provinces, who are appointed by the [[President of the Republic of Korea|President]].

Subsequently, Pavel Voloshin has been interviewed by [[David Satter]].<ref>{{harvnb|Dunlop|2012|pp=175}}</ref> According to Satter, Tkachenko insisted that the bomb was real. Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment. The police officers who answered the original call and discovered the bomb also insisted that it was obvious from its appearance that the substance in the bomb was not sugar.<ref>{{harvnb|Satter|2003|pp=29\u201330}}</ref><ref name=\"shadow\"/>\n\nAt a press conference on the occasion of the [[Security Agency Worker\u2019s Day]] in December 2001, Tkachenko said that a gas analyser has not been used and the detonator was a [[shotgun shell]] that couldn't detonate any known explosives.<ref name=\"fsb-satisfied\">{{cite news |last1=Trukhina |first1=Lyudmila |title=Satisfied with the results of the year |url=http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n=1244&m=8.htm |work=[[Ryazanskie Vedomosti]] |date=December 20, 2001 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110131045636/http://rv.ryazan.ru/old/cgi-bin/main-n%3D1244%26m%3D8.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2011 |language=Russian}}</ref>\n\nIn March 2000, ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist Pavel Voloshin reported the account of Private Alexei Pinyayev of the 137th Regiment, who guarded a military facility near the city of Ryazan, together with a friend.

In my view, this provocation was the bombing in September 1999 of the apartment building bombings in Moscow, Buinaksk, and Volgodonsk. In the aftermath of these attacks, which claimed 300 lives, a new war was launched against Chechnya. Putin, the newly appointed prime minister who was put in charge of that war, achieved overnight popularity. Yeltsin resigned early.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct. The major problem with it is the Ryazan incident. However, realizing the peculiarities of that episode does not necessarily lead to a conspiracy. It's plausible that FSB \"simulated\" an attack in Ryazan in order to claim credit for \"uncovering\" it; however the plot was foiled by vigilant local denizens and law enforcement personnel. The \"training exercise\" justification was improvised after the plot failed.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\n=== Other ===\nRussian military analyst [[Pavel Felgenhauer]] noted that \"The FSB accused [[Ibn al-Khattab|Khattab]] and [[Achemez Gochiyaev|Gochiyaev]], but oddly they did not point the finger at Chechen president [[Aslan Maskhadov]]'s regime, which is what [[Second Chechen War|the war]] was launched against.\"<ref name=\"Nedbaeva\" />\n\n== Sealing information by the US government ==\nOn 8 February 2000, the secretary of state [[Madeleine Albright]] was asked by senator [[Jesse Helms]] about any evidence linking the bombings to Chechen rebels during her testimony before the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations.

Tkachenko said that the explosives, including a timer, a power source, and a detonator were genuine military equipment and obviously prepared by a professional. He also said that the gas analyser that tested the vapours coming from the sacks unmistakably indicated the presence of RDX. Tkachenko said that it was out of the question that the analyser could have malfunctioned, as the gas analyser was of world-class quality, cost $20,000, and was maintained by a specialist who worked according to a strict schedule, checking the analyser after each use and making frequent prophylactic checks. Tkachenko pointed out that meticulous care in the handling of the gas analyser was a necessity because the lives of the bomb squad experts depended on the reliability of their equipment.

It would also explain why no Chechen claimed responsibility. Also it would explain Basayev's reference to responsibility of Dagestanis and it would be consistent with the initial vow of Khattab to set off the bombs blasting through Russian cities.<ref name=\"Ware2005\">{{cite journal|last1=Ware|first1=Robert Bruce|title=Revisiting Russia's Apartment Block Blasts|journal=[[The Journal of Slavic Military Studies]]|date=2005|volume=18|issue=4|pages=599\u2013606|doi=10.1080/13518040590914118}}</ref>\n\nWare also criticizes an argument that [[David Satter]] and [[Rajan Menon]] use to support the view of Russian security services responsibility for the bombings \u2014 that the apartment block explosions involved hexogen, which is a highly controlled substance in Russia and is extraordinarily difficult to obtain. According to Ware, that's not the case, as sizable amounts of hexogen (as well as other weaponry) were readily available in Dagestan. As a proof, Ware cites the police reports of the program for voluntary surrender of arms in Dagestan which ran for a couple of months in 2003 and revealed large quantities of hexogen and ammonite.<ref name=\"Ware2005\" />\n\nMax Abrahms, an academic who is critical of the efficacy of terrorism in general, compared the allegations of Russian government involvement in the bombings to [[false flag]] conspiracy theories such as [[9/11 conspiracy theories]] and claims that the Algerian government co-opted the notoriously violent [[Armed Islamic Group of Algeria|Armed Islamic Group]], emphasizing that such alternative explanations for terrorist atrocities are commonplace but typically not predicated on specific evidence. Instead, conspiracy theorists recognize the counterproductive effects of terrorism and conclude that the actual perpetrators must be the prime beneficiaries of terrorist attacks.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=80\u201381}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Abrahms, the case of Russian apartment bombings supports his theory that such attacks were always counterproductive for the perpetrators. He argued that the bombings were detrimental for the self-determination of Chechnya. He noted that the [[Chechen Republic of Ichkeria]] has achieved a ''de facto'' independence from Russia after the [[Khasavyurt Accord]], with two thirds of Russian citizens favoring the separation of the breakaway republic. However, the public opinion in Russia has changed dramatically after the bombings. Most Russians started \"baying for blood\" and strongly supporting the war with Chechnya that became inevitable and led to the loss of the independence as a result of the bombings.<ref>{{cite book|last=Abrahms|first=Max|title=Rules for Rebels: The Science of Victory in Militant History|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|isbn=9780192539441|pp=61\u201364, 70}}</ref>\n\nPolitical scientist Brian Taylor believes that there's too little evidence to decide which version of the events is correct, as the available evidence is fragmentary and controversial.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\"/>\n\nTaylor identifies several reasons to doubt the conspiracy version. First, while the bombings did propel Putin to power, by itself it's not the evidence that this was the goal of the attacks. Second, there was a casus belli even without the bombings\u2014namely, the invasion of Dagestan and multiple kidnappings in the region in the preceding years. Third, if the goal of the bombings was to justify a new war, one or two bombings in Moscow would be more than adequate. Any subsequent bombings would be potentially dangerous, because they would increase the risk to expose the conspiracy. Fourth, the conspiracy version implies that a plot involving multiple players in and out of government (and presumably a large number of FSB operatives) could be kept secret, which seems dubious.<ref name=\"BrianTaylor\">{{cite book |last1=Taylor |first1=Brian |title=State Building in Putin's Russia: Policing and Coercion After Communism |date=2011 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |isbn=978-0521760881 |pages=82\u201388}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Taylor, the most obvious version\u2014that the attacks were perpetrated by Islamic terrorists\u2014could well be correct.

Its members consist of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Minority group|minorities]], and [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] or [[Military occupation|occupied]] territories. UNPO works to develop the understanding of and respect for the [[right to self-determination]], provides advice and support related to questions of [[international recognition]] and [[political autonomy]], trains groups on how to advocate for their causes effectively, and directly advocates for an international response to [[human rights]] violations perpetrated against UNPO member groups. Some former members, such as [[Armenia]], [[East Timor]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Palau]], have gained full independence and joined the [[United Nations]] (UN).<ref>Barbara Crossette, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DB1238F93BA25751C1A962958260 Those Knocking, Unheeded, at UN's Doors Find Champion], [[New York Times]], 18 December 1994.</ref><ref name=\"An Anthropology of NGOs\">Tishkov, Valerie, [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2005-06-01-tishkov-en.html An Anthropology of NGOs], ''Eurozine'', July 2008</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUNPO was conceived of in the 1980s by leaders of self-determination movements, [[Linnart M\u00e4ll]] of the [[Congress of Estonia]], Erkin Alptekin, of [[East Turkestan]], and Lodi Gyari of [[Tibet]], together with Michael van Walt van Praag, long the international law adviser of the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

A Foundation was established in the Netherlands to provide secretarial support to the UNPO General Assembly and to carryout research and educational activities related to unrepresented peoples worldwide. The Foundation maintains a permanent presence before the European Union, United States and United Nations. It is funded by a combination of member contributions, donations from individuals and project-based grants from foundations.  \n<br />\n\n== Aims ==\nUNPO's vision is to affirm democracy as a fundamental human right, implement human, civil and political rights worldwide, uphold the universal right to autonomy and self-determination and further federalism. It encourages nonviolent methodologies to reach peaceful solutions to conflicts and oppression. UNPO supports members in getting their human and cultural [[right]]s respected and in preserving their environments. The organization provides a forum for members to network and assists them in participating at an international level.<ref name=\"UNPO\"/>\n\nAlthough UNPO members often have different goals, they have one thing in common: they are generally not represented diplomatically (or only with a minor status, such as observer) in major international institutions, such as the [[United Nations]] (UN). As a result, their ability to have their concerns addressed by the global bodies mandated to protect human rights and address conflict is limited.<ref name=\"UNPO\"/>\n\nUNPO is dedicated to the five principles enshrined in its [[Covenant (historical)|Covenant]]:\n\n* The equal right to [[self-determination]];\n* Adherence to the internationally accepted [[human rights]] standards as laid down in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and other international instruments;\n* Adherence to the principles of [[democracy|democratic]] pluralism and rejection of totalitarianism and religious intolerance;\n* Promotion of [[non-violence]] and the rejection of terrorism as an instrument of policy; and\n* Protection of the [[Environmentalism|natural environment]].\n\nAll members are required to sign and abide by the UNPO Covenant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unpo.org/section/2/1|title=UNPO: UNPO Covenant|website=unpo.org|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> UNPO members are required to be [[nonviolence|nonviolent]].<ref name=\"Bob\">{{Cite book|title=The Marketing of Rebellion: Insurgents, Media, and International Activism|first=Clifford|last=Bob|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|pages=47\u201348, 76\u201377}}</ref>\n\n== Members ==\nThe following are listed as members by the UNPO.<ref name=\"current members\">{{cite web|url=http://unpo.org/members.php|title=Members|publisher=UNPO|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOriginal members are listed with <span style=\"background:#FFE8E8;width:50px;border:1px solid #aaaaaa\">pink background</span> and in '''bold'''.\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS ARTICLE IS COVERING AN ORGANIZATION WITH SPECIFIC MEMBERS, IT IS NOT A LIST FOR ANY GROUP LOOKING FOR INDEPENDENCE OR AUTONOMY -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!

Its members consist of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Minority group|minorities]], and [[List of states with limited recognition|unrecognised]] or [[Military occupation|occupied]] territories. UNPO works to develop the understanding of and respect for the [[right to self-determination]], provides advice and support related to questions of [[international recognition]] and [[political autonomy]], trains groups on how to advocate for their causes effectively, and directly advocates for an international response to [[human rights]] violations perpetrated against UNPO member groups. Some former members, such as [[Armenia]], [[East Timor]], [[Estonia]], [[Latvia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] and [[Palau]], have gained full independence and joined the [[United Nations]] (UN).<ref>Barbara Crossette, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C0CE1DB1238F93BA25751C1A962958260 Those Knocking, Unheeded, at UN's Doors Find Champion], [[New York Times]], 18 December 1994.</ref><ref name=\"An Anthropology of NGOs\">Tishkov, Valerie, [http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2005-06-01-tishkov-en.html An Anthropology of NGOs], ''Eurozine'', July 2008</ref>\n\n== History ==\nUNPO was conceived of in the 1980s by leaders of self-determination movements, [[Linnart M\u00e4ll]] of the [[Congress of Estonia]], Erkin Alptekin, of [[East Turkestan]], and Lodi Gyari of [[Tibet]], together with Michael van Walt van Praag, long the international law adviser of the [[14th Dalai Lama]].

A Foundation was established in the Netherlands to provide secretarial support to the UNPO General Assembly and to carryout research and educational activities related to unrepresented peoples worldwide. The Foundation maintains a permanent presence before the European Union, United States and United Nations. It is funded by a combination of member contributions, donations from individuals and project-based grants from foundations.  \n<br />\n\n== Aims ==\nUNPO's vision is to affirm democracy as a fundamental human right, implement human, civil and political rights worldwide, uphold the universal right to autonomy and self-determination and further federalism. It encourages nonviolent methodologies to reach peaceful solutions to conflicts and oppression. UNPO supports members in getting their human and cultural [[right]]s respected and in preserving their environments. The organization provides a forum for members to network and assists them in participating at an international level.<ref name=\"UNPO\"/>\n\nAlthough UNPO members often have different goals, they have one thing in common: they are generally not represented diplomatically (or only with a minor status, such as observer) in major international institutions, such as the [[United Nations]] (UN). As a result, their ability to have their concerns addressed by the global bodies mandated to protect human rights and address conflict is limited.<ref name=\"UNPO\"/>\n\nUNPO is dedicated to the five principles enshrined in its [[Covenant (historical)|Covenant]]:\n\n* The equal right to [[self-determination]];\n* Adherence to the internationally accepted [[human rights]] standards as laid down in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and other international instruments;\n* Adherence to the principles of [[democracy|democratic]] pluralism and rejection of totalitarianism and religious intolerance;\n* Promotion of [[non-violence]] and the rejection of terrorism as an instrument of policy; and\n* Protection of the [[Environmentalism|natural environment]].\n\nAll members are required to sign and abide by the UNPO Covenant.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://unpo.org/section/2/1|title=UNPO: UNPO Covenant|website=unpo.org|access-date=2019-12-21}}</ref> UNPO members are required to be [[nonviolence|nonviolent]].<ref name=\"Bob\">{{Cite book|title=The Marketing of Rebellion: Insurgents, Media, and International Activism|first=Clifford|last=Bob|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|year=2005|pages=47\u201348, 76\u201377}}</ref>\n\n== Members ==\nThe following are listed as members by the UNPO.<ref name=\"current members\">{{cite web|url=http://unpo.org/members.php|title=Members|publisher=UNPO|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref>\n\nOriginal members are listed with <span style=\"background:#FFE8E8;width:50px;border:1px solid #aaaaaa\">pink background</span> and in '''bold'''.\n<!-- NOTE: THIS IS ARTICLE IS COVERING AN ORGANIZATION WITH SPECIFIC MEMBERS, IT IS NOT A LIST FOR ANY GROUP LOOKING FOR INDEPENDENCE OR AUTONOMY -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!
