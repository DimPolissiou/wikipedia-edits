{"title_page": "Pope Pius XI and Spain", "text_new": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past. The Republican alliance took 45 of Spain's 52 provincial capitals.<ref>Mary Vincent, p.117</ref> The Republican alliance perceived the religious question at this time as a matter of trying to define a new, subordinate place of the Catholic Church. Many of the constitutional articles were modeled on the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Portuguese Constitution of 1911]] \u2013 separation of church and state; freedom of worship became a fundamental civic right; civil marriage and divorce were introduced; schools and cemeteries were secularized. Catholic schools continued, but outside the state system, and in 1933 further legislation banned all [[Religious sister (Catholic)|religious sisters]] and male congregations from teaching. ''State education would be secular, obligatory, free of charge, and available to all.''<ref>Mary Vincent, Spain 1833\u20132002, p.122</ref> Also, the [[Jesuit]]s were expelled from Spain. \n\nReligion was to be placed in the private sphere, religious worship confined to religious buildings \u2013 the public world of the Republic was to be determinedly secular. Establishing a secular state was a fundamental tenet of Republicanism, but the alliance was 'a hybrid of traditions', encompassing liberals, radicals, federalists, anarchists \u2013 and there was less unanimity as to other anti-religious policies. The Socialist minister of justice [[w:es:Fernando de los Rios|Fernando de los Rios]], argued that the deputies should not deprive communities of their traditional festivities and that processions like [[Holy Week in Seville]] or [[Corpus Christi (feast)|Corpus Christi]] in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] transcended a purely religious significance \u2013 but was ignored.<ref>Vincent, p.122</ref> At [[Pentecost]] in 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded [[restitution]]. He asked the Catholics of Spain to fight with all legal means against the perceived injustices.\n\n==Nationalization of Church properties==\nOn 3 June 1933, Pius issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis|''Dilectissima Nobis'']], in which he described the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries. By law, they were now property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay rent and taxes in order to continuously use these properties. \"Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her.\"<ref>Dilectissima Nobis,  9\u201310</ref> Religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and similar objects necessary for worship were expropriated as well.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 12</ref>\n\n==Expropriation of private Catholic schools==\nThe churches were not spared in the expropriation. Numerous churches and temples were destroyed by burning, after they were nationalized. Jesuits were prohibited from teaching. Private Catholic schools of Religious Orders and Congregations were expropriated, without regard to the free will of founders and benefactors. The purpose was to create solely secular schools.<ref>Dilectissima Nobis, 21</ref>\n\n==Beginning of the Civil War==\nThe Civil War in Spain started in 1936, during which thousands of churches were destroyed and thirteen bishops and some 7000 clergy and religious Spaniards were assassinated.<ref>Franzen  397</ref> Another estimate is that in the course of the Red Terror, 6,832&nbsp;members of the Catholic clergy were killed.<ref name=\"Cueva 355\">{{Harvnb|de la Cueva|1998|p=355}}</ref> Though many right-wing Catholics, including the majority of bishops, had always been opposed to the Republic and \" bore a considerable responsibility for the growing friction that culminated in open warfare\", the wave of persecution of religion that swept across the Republican zone, where the rebellion had failed, during the first months of the war, helped to assure \"Franco of the highly useful support of the ecclesiastical establishment throughout the whole of the Civil War.\"<ref>Raguer, Gunpowder and Incense, p.51</ref> ([[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] for example, handed money, collected from Ireland for the reconstruction of churches and replacement of liturgical articles, to Franco's rebel army.)<ref>Raguer, p.74</ref>\n\n==The speech at Castelgandolfo, 14 September 1936==\nIn the first bloody months of the Civil War some ecclesiastics managed to escape to [[Marseilles]], [[Genoa]], or Rome and these brought news reports with them, with which they sought to apply pressure to the organs of the Vatican Curia with whom they maintained regular relations. (Hilari Raguer, a [[Benedictines]] writer on religious history, points out that they necessarily delivered a biased report \u2013 bishops and aristocrats carry more weight than peasants and workers \u2013 and poor workers had no means of escape to take them from the Francoist zone to Rome). [[Wlodimir Ledochowski|Father Ledochowski]], the superior general of the Jesuits, ordered the Jesuit press all over the world to support the rebels. It became known that Pius XI would grant an audience, at his summer residence at [[Castelgandolfo]], to a large group of Spanish refugees and deliver an address to them. Expectation rose amongst the Spanish clergy in Rome. Though it should have fallen to Cardinal [[Francisco Vidal y Barraquer]] to lead the group of Spanish clergy, there was great animosity to him from the majority of Spanish ecclesiastics and the Pope instructed him to say he judged it wiser not to attend. Some 500 Spaniards, mostly priests and religious, as well as some secular supporters of the Uprising, did attend. The content of the speech disappointed the more fanatical among the supporters of the military rising. He read it in Italian and a Spanish translation was distributed as a leaflet. Entitled ''La vostra presenza'' (Your Presence Here), it began with lamentation for the fate of the victims and condemned communism. This part of the speech was used from this point on in Francoist propaganda. He quoted from the [[Book of Revelation]], telling the refugees they ''came out of great tribulation'' (Rev. 7, 14). Yet whilst some hoped and expected that the Insurgent cause would be declared a Holy War or Crusade \u2013 it had already been so designated by various bishops and generals \u2013 Pius XI expressed horror at fratricidal war and exhorted the insurgents to love their enemies. He thanked those who had tried to alleviate the miseries of war, though their effect had been minimal. This too may have displeased the fervent supporters of Franco who were present, for the insurgents had always obstructed intervention of this kind by governments or neutral organisations such as the [[International Red Cross]]<ref>Raguer, p.83</ref>\n\n==Reactions to Pius XI's Castelgandolfo speech==\nFour days after the speech [[Eugenio Pacelli]] wrote to Vidal y Barraquer to say the Pope had wanted to comfort the refugees but not to identify himself with the warlike attitude of the side that called itself Catholic. In the so-called 'National' zone however, the Francoists widely publicized the speech \u2013 but only those paragraphs which seemed to endorse the idea of a Crusade, the second part being suppressed. The Spanish bishops acted upon the impulse suggested by the propagandist version of the speech and \"let loose a cascade of Pastoral Letters in favour of Franco.\"<ref>Raguer, p.85</ref> So, for example, [[Enrique Pla y Deniel]], the [[Bishop of Salamanca]], on receiving a version of Pius XI's speech from the military, published his Pastoral Letter, ''Las Dos ciudades'',(''The Two cities''), dated 30 September, an attempt at a theological justification for Franco's cause. The moral weight of the Vatican was considered of great significance to the generals of the Uprising \u2013 for one thing it was wanted at this time to aid the suppression of the separatist nationalisms in Spain. In 1936 it was [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalism which particularly troubled the Francoists as it presented to the world the sight of Catholics who were loyal to the Republic and resisting with arms the invasion of the ''Crusaders''.<ref>Raguer, p.86</ref>\n\n==Magaz, Goma, and Pius XI==\nThe [[Holy See]] maintained relations with the Republic in 1936\u2014thereafter they grew weaker. Relations began with [[Burgos]], the base of Franco's Nationalists, with the appointment of an unofficial Charg\u00e9. The Junta de Defensa at Burgos appointed a monarchist, Antonio de Magaz y Pers, the [[w:es:Marquesado de Magaz|Marqu\u00e9s de Magaz]] to establish contact with the Vatican. Magaz had been ambassador to the Holy See in the late 1920s and had sought to enrol the assistance of Pius XI in the suppression of ''catalanismo'' and ''bizcaitarrismo'' (Catalan and Basque nationalism)\u2014and the removal of Cardinal Vidal y Barraquer from the Primatial Archiepiscopal seat of [[Tarragona]]. Magaz did not succeed in removing the Catalan cardinal but did get decrees prohibiting the use of [[Catalan language|Catalan]] in pastoral matters and ordering the expulsion from the seminaries of all teachers and pupils suspected of separatism.<ref>Raguer, p.88</ref>\n\nMagaz's second mission to the Vatican in 1936 lasted barely a year. He endlessly demanded the canonical condemnation of the Basque nationalists, who refused to surrender to the rebels. He made complaints and threats against what he called the ''neutralism'' of the Vatican in the face of a war of religion. Pius XI met Magaz in a papal audience on 23 November 1936. Pius XI had just received a report from the Bishop of [[Vitoria-Gasteiz|Vitoria]], [[w:es:Mateo Mugica|Mateo Mugica Urresterazu]], telling him how the Franco insurgents had expelled him from his seat and telling him that 14 priests of his diocese had been shot, and many more jailed or banished from their parishes. According to a report of J.A. Gimenez Arnau, who asked Magaz about the audience, Magaz told him Pius XI replied to his complaints about the Vatican's attitude to the Nationalist authorities by declaring; \" In the National Spain, priests are shot just as they are in the Spain of the other side.\" In another account, when Magaz said that the slight sympathy for the National government of the Pope's words caused him great distress, Pius XI was thrown into a fury and declared; \"''How can anyone dare to speak of our slight sympathy when on many different and public occasions we have condemned Communism and conferred our benevolence on those who fight it?''\" From that moment Magaz had condemned himself in the eyes of both the Vatican and Franco.<ref>Raguer, p.95</ref> Pius XI appointed [[Isidro Goma y Tomas]] as his unofficial and confidential representative at Franco's headquarters, a role he performed from 19 December 1936 to 18 September 1937, while Monsignore [[Ildebrando Antoniutti|Antoniutti]], who had arrived in Spain in October 1936 on another mission, was named as the Papal Charg\u00e9 d'Affaires. Goma's influence on the attitude of Pius XI was powerful. Having met with [[Eugenio Pacelli]] and Pius XI on December 19, 1936, Goma wrote in his diary ; \" the unfriendly attitude towards Spain was abandoned after my report to Pacelli had been read and a formula was found to create close ties with the government of Franco.\"\n\nGoma was a man of the Church, unlike Magaz, and suspicious of some of those surrounding Franco\u2014an anti-clerical sector which could stain the perceived Christian spirit of the Franco movement. This anti-clerical sector, he confronted in his Pastoral Letter of 28 January 1938, to mark the fourteenth anniversary of the coronation of Pius XI. In the third part, entitled 'Pius XI and Spain' he spoke of the Pope's love for Spain and in the fourth part, ''Prevengamonos'' ('Let us prevent'), he challenged those who attacked Pius XI for not intervening more determinedly in favour of the Francoist Uprising. In the fifth he confronted anti-Vatican sentiment in the Movement ;\"We have heard and read, 'Catholics, yes; Vaticanists, no'; and it is with pain that we have seen it expressed in more sophisticated terms by a section of the press.\" Franco, since 1 October 1936 had taken over all the powers of the junta and sought to gain the full support of Pius XI. The policy of Pius XI, which Goma first and afterwards Antoniutti and [[Gaetano Cicognani|Cicognani]] maintained, towards Franco's government, was characterised by a strong anticommunism on the one hand, an on the other, a suspicion of [[falangism]], and of the influence of Franco's German Nazi and Italian Fascist allies; the Vatican policy sought to guide the regime into the repeal of the anti-clerical laws of the Republic and away from 'pagan' and imported totalitarian temptations. Goma was received by Franco on 29 December 1936 and six basic points were established at the meeting - points that were the seeds of the Concordat of 1953.\n\n==''The Divini Redemptoris'' encyclical, March 1937==\nPius XI's 'third way' policy of neither communism nor fascism was illustrated by the publication in early 1937 of one encyclical against Communism and another against Nazism. The ''Divini Redemptoris'' devoted a paragraph to ''the horrors of communism in Spain'', and dwelt on the assassination of priests and religious. In Franco's Spain this encyclical against Communism received wide circulation, but the publication of ''[[Mit brennender Sorge]]'' was prohibited. Franco told von Faupel, German Ambassador, that while Pius XI was recognised as the highest religious authority in Spain, any interference in internal Spanish affairs had to be rejected. He told the German ambassador that he too, Franco, had to fight against the Vatican. He had instructed the [[Archbishop of Toledo]], Goma, that no mention should be made in Spain of the encyclical ''Mit brennender Sorge'' and that in this way any criticism of Germany would be cut off.<ref>Raguer, p.103</ref>\n\nIn 1937 there was dual representation with the Salamanca government, raised to the level of Charg\u00e9s d'Affaires, with Antoniutti at Salamanca and Churruca at Rome, and mention of the Valencia (Republican) government reduced to a line of dots in the ''Annuario Pontificio''. By 1938 relations with Franco reached the level of full Ambassador and [[Nuncio]].\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Pope Pius Xi And Spain}}\n[[Category:Pope Pius XI]]\n[[Category:Spanish Civil War]]\n[[Category:Catholic Church in Spain]]\n", "text_old": "\n\nForeign relations between [[Pope Pius XI]] and [[Spain]] were very tense, especially because they occurred within the context of the [[Spanish Civil War]] and the period of troubles preceding it.\n\n==Anti-clerical government==\nThe Republican government which came to power in Spain in 1931, as the country embraced constitutional democracy, following the fall of [[Miguel Primo de Rivera]] and the exit of the King, [[Alfonso XIII of Spain|Alfonso XIII]], seemed to signal that Spain was breaking with elements of its past.

Unbeknownst to either, Tissaia and Stregobor were using Yennefer and Istredd respectively to spy on each other. Later, Yennefer witnesses Tissaia turning three students into eels to act as conduits powering Aretuza with magic. In 1240, Geralt is hired to investigate grain thefts in Posada and is followed by Jaskier the bard. They encounter a [[Silvanus (mythology)|Sylvan]] named Torque, who knocks them unconscious and takes them to his mountain cave. There, Geralt meets Filavandrel, the elven king and urges he lead his people to better lands after being banished by the humans. Instead of killing them, Filavandrel frees Geralt and Jaskier, taking the former's words to heart. In 1263, Cirilla encounters Dara, a boy in the woods, who guides her to a refugee camp.

While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd, knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. Having missed graduation, Yennefer undergoes the painful transformation to be beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Wearing her new body, Yennefer charms Aedirn's King Virfuril into taking her as advisor, sending Fringilla to Nilfgaard instead. In 1243, Geralt enters the kingdom of Temeria to investigate a monster, assisted by Triss Merigold, King Foltest's sorceress advisor. He identifies the monster as a [[Shtriga]], a creature born from a curse he later discovers was placed by the [[courtier]] Ostrit who learned about the [[incest|affair]] between Foltest and his sister, Princess Adda. Using Ostrit as bait, Geralt battles to contain the shtriga until dawn, which lifts the curse.

In 1249, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to the betrothal feast of Princess Pavetta, Queen Calanthe's daughter. Urcheon of Erlenwald (also named Duny) interrupts to demand Pavetta's hand through the Law of Surprise, having saved her father years earlier. Urcheon suffers from a curse that transformed him into a hedgehog/man creature. Despite Pavetta's acceptance, Calanthe refuses and a brawl ensues. When Calanthe tries killing Urcheon, Pavetta activates her power, unleashing a maelstrom until Geralt and Mousesack intervene. Wanting her daughter happy, Calanthe marries Duny and Pavetta, which lifts Duny's curse. Duny, thankful for Geralt's aid, insists he take a reward, so Geralt jokingly invokes the Law of Surprise for something Duny has but doesn't yet know. The crowd then immediately learns Pavetta is pregnant with Duny's child. In 1263, Nilfgaard's forces resume their pursuit of Cirilla with Mousesack as their prisoner. Meanwhile, Cirilla and Dara encounter Queen Eithne and her Dryads in Brokilon Forest, while Cahir and Fringilla track Ciri's location.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"A Question of Price\" from ''The Last Wish'', and \"Sword of Destiny\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bottled Appetites\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sneha Koorse\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Seven years after Pavetta's betrothal, in 1256, Geralt and Jaskier discover a [[Jinn|Djinn]] and accidentally release it.

Geralt seeks help from the nearest healer, the elf Chireadan, but as they need a mage to heal Jaskier, Chireadan reluctantly refers them to Yennefer. Although Yennefer cures Jaskier, her plan is to use him to capture the Djinn to grant her wish of regaining her fertility. As Jaskier uses his last wish, nothing happens and it's revealed that it is Geralt, not Jaskier, who actually has the wishes. Geralt realises the Djinn will kill Yennefer, so he uses his third and final wish to save her (but the wish itself is not revealed). The Djinn leaves. Now free and safe, Geralt and Yennefer act on their attraction and have sex. Yennefer asks what his third wish was, but Geralt does not answer as he has finally fallen asleep.

After camping overnight, the party finds the knight dead and the Reavers have departed. The dwarves take their party to a mountain shortcut, but the bridge gives way. Borch's group sacrifices themselves rather than endanger the party. Geralt and Yennefer reconcile before reaching the dragon's den, but find it dead with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a alive guarding the dragon's egg. Borch reveals himself as Vilentretenmerth, a golden dragon. The five of them defend the egg from the Reavers. Borch later pays off the dwarves with dragon teeth, and Geralt reveals to Yennefer his third wish bound their fates together. Believing her feelings for Geralt to be artificial, Yennefer declares that she can't be with him and leaves. Hurt, Geralt snaps at Jaskier, blaming him for all of his misfortunes and hopes that they never meet again.

When he announces his intention to rally mages to oppose Nilfgaard, she declines. The Brotherhood votes to remain neutral, but Tissaia, Vilgefortz, Triss and other mages resolve to fight.

Having escaped from Cintra and searching for Ciri, the girl who is his destiny, Geralt encounters a merchant burying the bodies of dead refugees. He defends the man from undead monsters, but is wounded and loses consciousness. Ciri is awakened by the woman she met earlier and discovers the dead bodies of her harassers around her, killed in gruesome ways. The woman takes her to her farm. The Nilfgaardians launch their attack, with both sides utilizing magic and inflicting heavy casualties on each other. Tissaia attempts to talk down Fringilla, but Fringilla disables her. Vilgefortz fights Cahir, but loses and is thrown down a hill. Geralt wakes to find himself on the merchant's cart en route to the man's farm. When Vilgefortz wakes up, he kills a Northern sorcerer, revealing himself to be a turncoat. When Nilfgaardian soldiers begin to overrun the fort, Yennefer channels a massive stream of fire, then seemingly disappears. In his delirious state, Geralt dreams about his mother Visenna, who abandoned him as a child in order for him to be made into a witcher. He later arrives at the same farm, and upon hearing the woman talk to the man about Ciri, heads into the forest. Seeing a vision of Geralt, Ciri wakes up and wanders into the forest, where she and Geralt finally meet, and hug each other.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"Something More\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n}}The timeline for the episodes, along with in-depth summaries of events, was later created by Netflix to further describe these episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.witchernetflix.com/en-gb|title=Netflix {{!}} The Witcher {{!}} Map of the Continent|website=www.witchernetflix.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s ''[[The Witcher]]'' book series was almost adapted into a standalone Netflix film, but Kelly Luegenbiehl, Vice President of International Originals at Netflix, dissuaded the producers.

She is taken to Aretuza for training in magic, but finds difficulty in the practice. She makes a friendship with Istredd, even revealing her quarter-[[elf]] heritage, a cause of her deformity. Unbeknownst to either, Tissaia and Stregobor were using Yennefer and Istredd respectively to spy on each other. Later, Yennefer witnesses Tissaia turning three students into eels to act as conduits powering Aretuza with magic. In 1240, Geralt is hired to investigate grain thefts in Posada and is followed by Jaskier the bard. They encounter a [[Silvanus (mythology)|Sylvan]] named Torque, who knocks them unconscious and takes them to his mountain cave. There, Geralt meets Filavandrel, the elven king and urges he lead his people to better lands after being banished by the humans. Instead of killing them, Filavandrel frees Geralt and Jaskier, taking the former's words to heart. In 1263, Cirilla encounters Dara, a boy in the woods, who guides her to a refugee camp.

While Yennefer has the chance to transform her body into her ideal image during graduation, the Brotherhood of Sorcerers discuss the allocation of their newly initiated to their respective kingdoms. But through Stregobor's scheme, Yennefer is assigned to Nilfgaard instead of her preferred Aedirn due to her elven blood. Realizing what happened, Yennefer angrily breaks up with Istredd, knowing only he could have told Stregobor about her blood. Having missed graduation, Yennefer undergoes the painful transformation to be beautiful at the cost of her fertility. Wearing her new body, Yennefer charms Aedirn's King Virfuril into taking her as advisor, sending Fringilla to Nilfgaard instead. In 1243, Geralt enters the kingdom of Temeria to investigate a monster, assisted by Triss Merigold, King Foltest's sorceress advisor. He identifies the monster as a [[Shtriga]], a creature born from a curse he later discovers was placed by the [[courtier]] Ostrit who learned about the [[incest|affair]] between Foltest and his sister, Princess Adda. Using Ostrit as bait, Geralt battles to contain the shtriga until dawn, which lifts the curse.

In 1249, Geralt accompanies Jaskier to the betrothal feast of Princess Pavetta, Queen Calanthe's daughter. Urcheon of Erlenwald (also named Duny) interrupts to demand Pavetta's hand through the Law of Surprise, having saved her father years earlier. Urcheon suffers from a curse that transformed him into a hedgehog/man creature. Despite Pavetta's acceptance, Calanthe refuses and a brawl ensues. When Calanthe tries killing Urcheon, Pavetta activates her power, unleashing a maelstrom until Geralt and Mousesack intervene. Wanting her daughter happy, Calanthe marries Duny and Pavetta, which lifts Duny's curse. Duny, thankful for Geralt's aid, insists he take a reward, so Geralt jokingly invokes the Law of Surprise for something Duny has but doesn't yet know. The crowd then immediately learns Pavetta is pregnant with Duny's child. In 1263, Nilfgaard's forces resume their pursuit of Cirilla with Mousesack as their prisoner. Meanwhile, Cirilla and Dara encounter Queen Eithne and her Dryads in Brokilon Forest, while Cahir and Fringilla track Ciri's location.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"A Question of Price\" from ''The Last Wish'', and \"Sword of Destiny\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 5\n| Title           = Bottled Appetites\n| DirectedBy      = [[Charlotte Br\u00e4ndstr\u00f6m]]\n| WrittenBy       = Sneha Koorse\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2019|12|20}}\n| ShortSummary    = Seven years after Pavetta's betrothal, in 1256, Geralt and Jaskier discover a [[Jinn|Djinn]] and accidentally release it.

Geralt seeks help from the nearest healer, the elf Chireadan, but as they need a mage to heal Jaskier, Chireadan reluctantly refers them to Yennefer. Although Yennefer cures Jaskier, her plan is to use him to capture the Djinn to grant her wish of regaining her fertility. As Jaskier uses his last wish, nothing happens and it's revealed that it is Geralt, not Jaskier, who actually has the wishes. Geralt realises the Djinn will kill Yennefer, so he uses his third and final wish to save her (but the wish itself is not revealed). The Djinn leaves. Now free and safe, Geralt and Yennefer act on their attraction and have sex. Yennefer asks what his third wish was, but Geralt does not answer as he has finally fallen asleep.

After camping overnight, the party finds the knight dead and the Reavers have departed. The dwarves take their party to a mountain shortcut, but the bridge gives way. Borch's group sacrifices themselves rather than endanger the party. Geralt and Yennefer reconcile before reaching the dragon's den, but find it dead with T\u00e9a and V\u00e9a alive guarding the dragon's egg. Borch reveals himself as Vilentretenmerth, a golden dragon. The five of them defend the egg from the Reavers. Borch later pays off the dwarves with dragon teeth, and Geralt reveals to Yennefer his third wish bound their fates together.

In his delirious state, Geralt dreams about his mother Visenna, who abandoned him as a child in order for him to be made into a witcher. He later arrives at the same farm, and upon hearing the woman talk to the man about Ciri, heads into the forest. Seeing a vision of Geralt, Ciri wakes up and wanders into the forest, where she and Geralt finally meet, and hug each other.\n{{hr}}\nBased on \"Something More\" from ''Sword of Destiny''.<ref name=\"gamespot\"/>\n| LineColor       = 515357\n}}\n}}The timeline for the episodes, along with in-depth summaries of events, was later created by Netflix to further describe these episodes.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.witchernetflix.com/en-gb|title=Netflix {{!}} The Witcher {{!}} Map of the Continent|website=www.witchernetflix.com|access-date=2020-04-14}}</ref>\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\n[[Andrzej Sapkowski]]'s ''[[The Witcher]]'' book series was almost adapted into a standalone Netflix film, but Kelly Luegenbiehl, Vice President of International Originals at Netflix, dissuaded the producers.
