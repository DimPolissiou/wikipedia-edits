He batted [[left-handed]] and threw [[right-handed]], and utilized a [[fastball]], a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], and a [[changeup]] for his pitches. In a 14-season career, Lieber compiled a 131\u2013124 record with 1,553 [[strikeout]]s and a 4.27 [[Earned run average|ERA]] in 2,198 [[innings pitched]].\n\nLieber attended the [[University of South Alabama]], helping them win the [[Sun Belt Conference]] Championship. He was drafted by the [[Kansas City Royals]] in the second round of the [[1992 Major League Baseball Draft]], but he was traded to the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]] the following season before even throwing a pitch in the major leagues. He made his debut in 1994 and was named the Pirates' [[Opening Day]] starter in 1995, but it was not until 1997 that he became a full-time major league starter. He was traded to the [[Chicago Cubs]] following the 1998 season. In 2000, he led the [[National League]] (NL) with 251 innings pitched. He had his best season in 2001, winning 20 games while losing just six. Lieber underwent [[Tommy John surgery]] in 2002 and missed the entire 2003 season. In 2004, he pitched for the [[New York Yankees]], reaching the playoffs for the only time in his career. He signed with the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] in 2005 and tied for fifth in the NL with 17 wins. Injuries cut into his playing time over the next three years; he finished his career as a reliever with the Cubs in 2008.\n\n==Biography==\n\n===Early life===\nLieber was born in [[Council Bluffs, Iowa]].

{"title_page": "Walk-off home run", "text_new": "{{short description|In baseball, a home run in the final inning that ends the game}}\n[[File:Iconic Moments in Pittsburgh History (4975612548).jpg|alt=|thumb|300x300px|[[Bill Mazeroski]] hit a walk-off home run in Game 7 to clinch the 1960 World Series title for the Pittsburgh Pirates over the New York Yankees.]]\nIn [[baseball]], a '''walk-off home run''' is a [[home run]] that ends the game. It must be a home run that gives the home team the lead and the win in the bottom of the final [[inning]] of the game. Thus the losing team (the visiting team) must then \"walk off\" the field immediately afterward, not finishing the inning, and the winning team (the home team) can \"walk off\" the field with the win. The winning runs must still be counted at home plate.\n\n==History and usage of the term==\nAlthough the concept of a game-ending home run is as old as baseball, the adjective \"walk-off\" attained widespread use only in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe first known usage of the word in print appeared in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' on April 21, 1988, Section D, Page 1. ''Chronicle'' writer Lowell Cohn wrote an article headlined \"What the Eck?\" about [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] reliever [[Dennis Eckersley]]'s unusual way of speaking: \"For a translation, I go in search of Eckersley. I also want to know why he calls short home runs 'street pieces,' and home runs that come in the last at-bat of a game 'walkoff pieces' ...\" Although the term originally was coined with a negative connotation, in reference to the [[pitcher]] (who must \"walk off\" the field with his head hung in shame),<ref>Dan Shaughnessy. [http://archive.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/06/24/term_covers_all_the_bases \"Term covers all the bases\"]. \"The Boston Globe.\" June 24, 2005. Retrieved June 30, 2016</ref> it has come to acquire a more celebratory connotation, for the batter who circles the bases with pride and with the adulation of the home crowd.\n\n===Other types of \"walk-off\" wins===\nSportscasters also use the term \"walk-off hit\" as any kind of hit which drives in the winning run to end the game. The terms \"walk-off [[hit by pitch]]\", \"walk-off walk\" (a [[base on balls]] with the bases loaded), \"walk-off [[wild pitch]]\", \"walk-off reach-on-[[Error (baseball)|error]]\", \"walk-off [[Stolen base|steal of home]]\", \"walk-off [[passed ball]]\", and \"walk-off [[balk]]\" have been also applied, and the latter has been dubbed a \"balk-off\". It is a separate stretch of the term to call a hit a walk-off when what ends the game is not the hit but the defense's failure to make a play (as in a single with a possible out at the plate). The day after [[Eric Bruntlett]] pulled off a game-ending [[unassisted triple play]] for the [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] against the [[2009 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] on August 23, {{mlby|2009}}, the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' used the term \"walk-off triple play\" in a subheadline describing the moment.\n\n===Walk-off grand slam===\nA [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] is a home run hit with all three bases occupied by baserunners (\"bases loaded\"), thereby scoring four runs\u2014the most possible in one play. A walk-off home run with the bases loaded is therefore known as a walk-off grand slam.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, a walk-off grand slam that erases a three-run deficit has come to be known as an ultimate grand slam.<ref>Krabbenhoft, Herm.

Norris surrendered both in the same week, and it was the second game-winning walk-off grand slam by Pearce in the same week.\n\n=== Walk-off celebration injury ===\nWalk-off celebrations typically consist of an entire baseball team leaving the dugout to meet a player at home plate after the batter hits a walk-off home run, or at whichever base the hitter happens to reach if a traditional base hit results in a walk-off victory. Players often encircle teammates who hit a walk-off before dancing and roughhousing to celebrate their victory. During a walk-off celebration on May 29, 2010, [[Kendrys Morales]], then a member of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], broke his left leg while celebrating a walk-off grand slam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=5232642|title=Angels' Morales breaks leg celebrating slam|date=2010-05-30|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> As a result of this injury, team manager Mike Scioscia instituted new guidelines for his team that ensured a much tamer response to all subsequent walk-off victories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/columns/story?id=5235375|title=Saxon: Angels party responsibly after walk-off|date=2010-05-31|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Relevant rules==\nThe rules of baseball<ref>2008 Official Rules of Major League Baseball, {{ISBN|978-1-60078-106-3}}</ref> provide that:\n* A batter is entitled to a home run only \"when he shall have touched all bases legally.\" (Rule 6.09(d); also 7.05(a))\n* A batter is out, on [[Appeal play|appeal]], for failing to touch each base in order or for passing a preceding runner.  In some cases, all runs that score are negated.  (Rule 7.10 and 7.12)\n* On a game-winning hit, a batter is credited for the full number of bases only if \"the batter runs out his hit.\" (Rule 10.06(f))\n* A game-winning home run is allowed to complete before the game ends, even if it puts the home team ahead by more than one run. (Rule 4.11(c), Exception; also 10.06(g))\n\nThe first point above was problematic in the [[1976 American League Championship Series]] between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. The Yankees and Royals entered the bottom of the ninth inning of the decisive fifth game with the score tied, 6\u20136; [[Mark Littell]] was the pitcher for [[1976 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City]], and [[Chris Chambliss]] was the first batter for [[1976 New York Yankees season|New York]].  Chambliss hit Littell's first pitch into the right field bleachers to win the game and the American League pennant for the Yankees. However, Yankees fans ran onto the field at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] to celebrate the victory, and prevented Chambliss from rounding the bases and touching home plate.  Recognizing the impossibility of Chambliss successfully negotiating the sea of people who had been on the field, umpires later escorted Chambliss back out to home plate and watched as he touched it with his foot, thereby making the Yankees victory \"official\". (A comment to Rule 4.09(b) permits the umpires to award the run if fans prevent the runner from touching home plate.)\n\nThe third point above led to [[Robin Ventura]]'s \"[[Grand Slam Single]]\" in the [[1999 National League Championship Series|1999 NLCS]]. In the bottom of the 15th inning, the [[1999 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] tied the score against the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] at 3\u20133. Ventura came to bat with the bases loaded, and hit a game-winning grand slam to deep right. [[Roger Cede\u00f1o]] scored from third and [[John Olerud]] appeared to score from second, but [[Todd Pratt]],<ref>Pratt himself had hit a walk-off homer just eight days earlier, on October 9, in the [[1999 National League Division Series|1999 NLDS]]. See: {{section link| |Division series}}, below.</ref> on first base when Ventura hit the home run, went to second, then turned around and hugged Ventura as the rest of the team rushed onto the field. The official ruling was that because Ventura never advanced past first base, it was not a home run but a single, and thus only Cede\u00f1o's run counted, making the official final score 4\u20133.\n\nThe fourth point above was not a rule prior to 1920; instead, the game ended at the moment the winning run scored.  This rule affected the scoring of 40 hits, from 1884 to 1918, that would now be scored as game-winning home runs.<ref>1996 ''Macmillan Baseball Encyclopedia'', Appendix B (Decisions of the Special Baseball Records Committee)</ref> [[Babe Ruth]] would have been credited with 715 career home runs had the modern rule been in effect in 1918; in a 10-inning game Ruth's fence-clearing, walk-off RBI hit was scored a triple because the game was deemed over when the lead baserunner reached home.<ref>http://www.fenwayfanatics.com/player/babe-ruth/</ref>\n\n==Playoff tiebreakers, postseason, and All-Star Game==\n\n===World Series===\nIn the charts below, home runs that ended a postseason series are denoted by the player's name in '''bold'''.

It must be a home run that gives the home team the lead and the win in the bottom of the final [[inning]] of the game. Thus the losing team (the visiting team) must then \"walk off\" the field immediately afterward, not finishing the inning, and the winning team (the home team) can \"walk off\" the field with the win. The winning runs must still be counted at home plate.\n\n==History and usage of the term==\nAlthough the concept of a game-ending home run is as old as baseball, the adjective \"walk-off\" attained widespread use only in the late 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe first known usage of the word in print appeared in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' on April 21, 1988, Section D, Page 1. ''Chronicle'' writer Lowell Cohn wrote an article headlined \"What the Eck?\" about [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland]] reliever [[Dennis Eckersley]]'s unusual way of speaking: \"For a translation, I go in search of Eckersley. I also want to know why he calls short home runs 'street pieces,' and home runs that come in the last at-bat of a game 'walkoff pieces' ...\" Although the term originally was coined with a negative connotation, in reference to the [[pitcher]] (who must \"walk off\" the field with his head hung in shame),<ref>Dan Shaughnessy. [http://archive.boston.com/sports/baseball/redsox/articles/2005/06/24/term_covers_all_the_bases \"Term covers all the bases\"]. \"The Boston Globe.\" June 24, 2005. Retrieved June 30, 2016</ref> it has come to acquire a more celebratory connotation, for the batter who circles the bases with pride and with the adulation of the home crowd.\n\n===Other types of \"walk-off\" wins===\nSportscasters also use the term \"walk-off hit\" as any kind of hit which drives in the winning run to end the game. The terms \"walk-off [[hit by pitch]]\", \"walk-off walk\" (a [[base on balls]] with the bases loaded), \"walk-off [[wild pitch]]\", \"walk-off reach-on-[[Error (baseball)|error]]\", \"walk-off [[Stolen base|steal of home]]\", \"walk-off [[passed ball]]\", and \"walk-off [[balk]]\" have been also applied, and the latter has been dubbed a \"balk-off\". It is a separate stretch of the term to call a hit a walk-off when what ends the game is not the hit but the defense's failure to make a play (as in a single with a possible out at the plate). The day after [[Eric Bruntlett]] pulled off a game-ending [[unassisted triple play]] for the [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|Philadelphia Phillies]] against the [[2009 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] on August 23, {{mlby|2009}}, the ''[[Philadelphia Daily News]]'' used the term \"walk-off triple play\" in a subheadline describing the moment.\n\n===Walk-off grand slam===\nA [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]] is a home run hit with all three bases occupied by baserunners (\"bases loaded\"), thereby scoring four runs\u2014the most possible in one play. A walk-off home run with the bases loaded is therefore known as a walk-off grand slam.\n\nStarting in the 1990s, a walk-off grand slam that erases a three-run deficit has come to be known as an ultimate grand slam.<ref>Krabbenhoft, Herm.

Rodr\u00edguez is the only pitcher to surrender two game-winning grand slams to two rookies.\n* [[Bud Norris]] of the [[Los Angeles Angels]], in {{Baseball year|2017}}, to [[Edwin Encarnaci\u00f3n]] of the [[Cleveland Indians]], on July 25, and [[Steve Pearce (baseball)|Steve Pearce]] of the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] on July 30. Norris surrendered both in the same week, and it was the second game-winning walk-off grand slam by Pearce in the same week.\n\n=== Walk-off celebration injury ===\nWalk-off celebrations typically consist of an entire baseball team leaving the dugout to meet a player at home plate after the batter hits a walk-off home run, or at whichever base the hitter happens to reach if a traditional base hit results in a walk-off victory. Players often encircle teammates who hit a walk-off before dancing and roughhousing to celebrate their victory. During a walk-off celebration on May 29, 2010, [[Kendrys Morales]], then a member of the [[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim]], broke his left leg while celebrating a walk-off grand slam.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/news/story?id=5232642|title=Angels' Morales breaks leg celebrating slam|date=2010-05-30|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref> As a result of this injury, team manager Mike Scioscia instituted new guidelines for his team that ensured a much tamer response to all subsequent walk-off victories.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/mlb/columns/story?id=5235375|title=Saxon: Angels party responsibly after walk-off|date=2010-05-31|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-03-16}}</ref>\n\n==Relevant rules==\nThe rules of baseball<ref>2008 Official Rules of Major League Baseball, {{ISBN|978-1-60078-106-3}}</ref> provide that:\n* A batter is entitled to a home run only \"when he shall have touched all bases legally.\" (Rule 6.09(d); also 7.05(a))\n* A batter is out, on [[Appeal play|appeal]], for failing to touch each base in order or for passing a preceding runner.  In some cases, all runs that score are negated.  (Rule 7.10 and 7.12)\n* On a game-winning hit, a batter is credited for the full number of bases only if \"the batter runs out his hit.\" (Rule 10.06(f))\n* A game-winning home run is allowed to complete before the game ends, even if it puts the home team ahead by more than one run. (Rule 4.11(c), Exception; also 10.06(g))\n\nThe first point above was problematic in the [[1976 American League Championship Series]] between the [[New York Yankees]] and the [[Kansas City Royals]]. The Yankees and Royals entered the bottom of the ninth inning of the decisive fifth game with the score tied, 6\u20136; [[Mark Littell]] was the pitcher for [[1976 Kansas City Royals season|Kansas City]], and [[Chris Chambliss]] was the first batter for [[1976 New York Yankees season|New York]].  Chambliss hit Littell's first pitch into the right field bleachers to win the game and the American League pennant for the Yankees. However, Yankees fans ran onto the field at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]] to celebrate the victory, and prevented Chambliss from rounding the bases and touching home plate.  Recognizing the impossibility of Chambliss successfully negotiating the sea of people who had been on the field, umpires later escorted Chambliss back out to home plate and watched as he touched it with his foot, thereby making the Yankees victory \"official\". (A comment to Rule 4.09(b) permits the umpires to award the run if fans prevent the runner from touching home plate.)\n\nThe third point above led to [[Robin Ventura]]'s \"[[Grand Slam Single]]\" in the [[1999 National League Championship Series|1999 NLCS]]. In the bottom of the 15th inning, the [[1999 New York Mets season|New York Mets]] tied the score against the [[1999 Atlanta Braves season|Atlanta Braves]] at 3\u20133. Ventura came to bat with the bases loaded, and hit a game-winning grand slam to deep right. [[Roger Cede\u00f1o]] scored from third and [[John Olerud]] appeared to score from second, but [[Todd Pratt]],<ref>Pratt himself had hit a walk-off homer just eight days earlier, on October 9, in the [[1999 National League Division Series|1999 NLDS]]. See: {{section link| |Division series}}, below.</ref> on first base when Ventura hit the home run, went to second, then turned around and hugged Ventura as the rest of the team rushed onto the field. The official ruling was that because Ventura never advanced past first base, it was not a home run but a single, and thus only Cede\u00f1o's run counted, making the official final score 4\u20133.\n\nThe fourth point above was not a rule prior to 1920; instead, the game ended at the moment the winning run scored.  This rule affected the scoring of 40 hits, from 1884 to 1918, that would now be scored as game-winning home runs.<ref>1996 ''Macmillan Baseball Encyclopedia'', Appendix B (Decisions of the Special Baseball Records Committee)</ref> [[Babe Ruth]] would have been credited with 715 career home runs had the modern rule been in effect in 1918; in a 10-inning game Ruth's fence-clearing, walk-off RBI hit was scored a triple because the game was deemed over when the lead baserunner reached home.<ref>http://www.fenwayfanatics.com/player/babe-ruth/</ref>\n\n==Playoff tiebreakers, postseason, and All-Star Game==\n\n===World Series===\nIn the charts below, home runs that ended a postseason series are denoted by the player's name in '''bold'''.
