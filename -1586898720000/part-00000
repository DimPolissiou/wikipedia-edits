In fact, before 2011, the BQ won at least seven of its nine seats in each of the preceding four elections, losing [[Saint-Maurice\u2014Champlain|Saint-Maurice]] ([[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s old riding) in 1993, 1997 and 2000 and Portneuf in 2000, which both went [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].  They swept all nine ridings in 2004, and in 2006 and 2008 lost only [[Lotbini\u00e8re\u2014Chutes-de-la-Chaudi\u00e8re]] to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and [[Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier]] to independent candidate [[Andr\u00e9 Arthur]].\n\nBefore the rise of Mulroney in 1984, this area was traditionally Liberal, except for [[Joliette]] (the only riding in Quebec that voted anything other than Liberal in 1980), and [[Lotbini\u00e8re (electoral district)|Lotbini\u00e8re]] (which voted Social Credit in 1979). Mulroney's Conservatives swept the area in 1988, and 1984 (except for Chr\u00e9tien's seat).\n\nThe 2011 NDP surge saw New Democrats sweeping all but two seats in the region, with the Conservatives and Bloc holding one each.  In 2015, the Bloc rebounded to take three more ridings, while the Liberals regained Saint-Maurice\u2014Champlain.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

one of the power bases for the [[Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] for two decades. In fact, before 2011, the BQ won at least seven of its nine seats in each of the preceding four elections, losing [[Saint-Maurice\u2014Champlain|Saint-Maurice]] ([[Jean Chr\u00e9tien]]'s old riding) in 1993, 1997 and 2000 and Portneuf in 2000, which both went [[Liberal Party of Canada|Liberal]].  They swept all nine ridings in 2004, and in 2006 and 2008 lost only [[Lotbini\u00e8re\u2014Chutes-de-la-Chaudi\u00e8re]] to the [[Conservative Party of Canada|Conservatives]] and [[Portneuf-Jacques-Cartier]] to independent candidate [[Andr\u00e9 Arthur]].\n\nBefore the rise of Mulroney in 1984, this area was traditionally Liberal, except for [[Joliette]] (the only riding in Quebec that voted anything other than Liberal in 1980), and [[Lotbini\u00e8re (electoral district)|Lotbini\u00e8re]] (which voted Social Credit in 1979). Mulroney's Conservatives swept the area in 1988, and 1984 (except for Chr\u00e9tien's seat).\n\nThe 2011 NDP surge saw New Democrats sweeping all but two seats in the region, with the Conservatives and Bloc holding one each.  In 2015, the Bloc rebounded to take three more ridings, while the Liberals regained Saint-Maurice\u2014Champlain.\n\n=== Votes by party throughout time ===\n{| class=\"wikitable

The firm also offered a [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] from 1995 until 2001, and a 5-door [[Station wagon|wagon]] from the Impreza's introduction in the form of a [[hatchback]]. Mainstream versions have received \"boxer\" [[flat-four engine]]s ranging from 1.5- to 2.5-liters, with the performance-oriented Impreza WRX and WRX STI models uprated with the addition of [[turbocharger]]s. Since the third generation series, some markets have adopted the abbreviated '''Subaru WRX''' name for these high-performance variants. The first three generations of Impreza in North America were also available with an off-road appearance package called the '''Outback Sport'''. For the fourth generation, this appearance package was renamed the '''XV''' ('''Crosstrek''' in North America), and, unlike the Outback Sport (which was exclusive to the North American market), is sold internationally. Colloquially, the car is sometimes referred to as '''Scooby'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-verdict-subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-scooby-doo-what-are-you-1529563.html|title=THE VERDICT SUBARU IMPREZA WRX STI: Scooby doo, what are you?|date=8 February 2005|website=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nThe Impreza (also Impreza WRX and Impreza WRX STI) was a major rival to the [[Mitsubishi Lancer]] (and [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]]).\n\nSubaru has offered both [[front-wheel drive|front-]] and [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] layouts for the Impreza. Since the late-1990s, some markets have restricted sales to the all-wheel drive model\u2014therefore granting the Impreza a [[unique selling proposition]] in the global compact class characterized by front-wheel drive. However, Japanese models remain available in either configuration.\n\nA 2019 iSeeCars study named the Impreza as the lowest-depreciating sedan after five years.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Blackley |first1=Julie |title=Cars With the Lowest and Highest Depreciation |url=https://www.iseecars.com/cars-low-high-depreciation-2018-study |website=iSeeCars.com |accessdate=16 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n=={{anchor|GC|GF|GM|first}} First generation (1992\u20132001) \u2013 GM, GC, GF==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = First generation\n| image = 1999 Subaru Impreza GT Turbo AWD (8094174665).jpg\n| caption = 1999 Subaru Impreza RX sedan\n| aka = Subaru Outback Sport<br/>Subaru Grand Leone (Israel, 1992\u20131996)\n| production = October 1992\u20132000\n| body_style = 2-door [[Coup\u00e9|coupe]] (GM)<br />4-door [[sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (GC)<br />5-door [[hatchback]] (GF)\n| engine = {{unbulleted list | 1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ15|EJ15]]'' [[flat-four engine|H4]] | 1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ16|EJ16]]'' H4 | 1.8&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ18|EJ18]]'' H4 | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ20|EJ20]]'' H4 | 2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ20 Turbocharged|EJ20]]'' H4-[[turbocharger|T]] | 2.2&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ22|EJ22]]'' H4 | 2.2&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ22G|EJ22G]]'' H4-T | 2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ25|EJ25]]'' H4}}\n| transmission = 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]\n| length = {{convert|4340|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = {{convert|1690|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1405|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| wheelbase = {{convert|2520|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1220|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}\n| designer = Tetsuya Hayashi, Hidefumi Kato (1990)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD337550 |title=Patent USD337550 \u2013 Passenger car |via=Google Patents |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/USD338639  |title=Patent USD338639 - Passenger car|via=Google Patents |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n}}\n\nAnnounced on 22 October 1992,<ref>[[#Long (2006)|Long (2006)]], p. 25.</ref> the Impreza was released in Japan in November and offered in either [[front-wheel drive]] (FWD) or [[all-wheel drive]] (AWD) versions and as a four-door sedan or five-door hatchback/wagon (Touring).<ref>[[#Long (2006)|Long (2006)]], p. 6.</ref> The car used a shortened version of the [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy's]] floor pan.<ref>{{cite magazine |editor-last=Anderson |editor-first=Donn |date=March 1993 |title=Subaru's Impressive Impreza |magazine=New Zealand Car |volume=7 |number=5 |location=Auckland |publisher=Accent Publishing |page=42 |issn=0113-0196}}</ref> According to a ''[[Motor Trend]]'' article written March 1992 on page 26, the name of Subaru's new compact was, initially, to be called the [[Subaru Leone|Loyale]], displaying an official photograph of the four-door sedan. In late 1995, a two-door [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] was introduced. Initial engine choices included 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 liter naturally aspirated engines.\n\nSubaru chose to continue their longstanding use of the [[boxer engine]] in the Impreza. According to Subaru, their configuration of the engine inline with the transmission minimizes body roll due to the lower center of gravity compared with offset engines in most other vehicles. The boxer design provides good vibration mitigation due to the principles of a [[engine balance|balanced engine]] because the movement of each piston is largely countered by a piston in the opposing cylinder bank, eliminating the need for a counter-weighted rotating crankshaft ([[harmonic balancer]]), but with some vibration from offsets. [[Torque steer]] is also reduced with this type of powertrain layout since the front drive shafts are of equal length and weight.\n\n[[File:Subaru Impreza Gravel Express no1.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru Impreza Gravel Express (Japan)]]\n[[File:1st-Subaru-Outback-Sport.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A 2001 Subaru Outback Sport|2001 model year Subaru Outback Sport]]\n\nAt the time of introduction, the Japanese and European market naturally aspirated models (1.6 and 1.8) received an unusual grille with a small central opening. Only the WRX and regular North American models received a conventional \"full\" grille until the 1994 facelift, when the regular models' appearance was brought in line with that of the sporting models.\n\nThe Outback Sport was introduced to North America in 1994 for the 1995 model year as an updated Impreza \"L\" Sports Wagon. It was the top trim level of the Impreza wagon model with no significant mechanical or performance changes from the lower trim levels aside from a slightly lifted suspension. Subaru found some sales success with the Outback Sport as a smaller companion with similar ride height changes, body colors and trim levels to the larger, more successful selling Legacy-based Outback. For the first time, the 2.2-liter engine was used in the American Impreza. Later, the 2.5-liter engine was introduced. In Japan, the Impreza WRX Sports Wagon was offered with a similar approach to the Outback Sport, calling it the \"Impreza Gravel Express\". Subaru discontinued the Gravel Express when the second generation Impreza was introduced due to very limited sales. The hood-scoop found on the American Outback Sport was non-functional but was probably included because the American and Japanese versions were built at the same factory in Japan. The Outback Sport was offered with optional equipment, such as a gauge pack installed on top of the dashboard, that included a digital compass, outside temperature and [[barometer]] or [[altimeter]] readings.\n\nTrim levels were LX, GL and Sport generation. LX models were front-wheel drive, and powered by a 1.6-liter engine. GL trim levels were either front-wheel drive (Subaru badged these 2WD) or all-wheel-drive (badged AWD); cars launched in 1993 had a choice of 1.6- and 1.8-liter [[flat-4]] engines, the 1.6 being available with 2WD, the 1.8 an AWD version only. From 1996, the 1.8-liter versions were dropped (in the European market), and replaced by a 2.0-liter engine. Sport versions had alloy wheels, and a 2.0-liter engine only.\n\nDuring this generation, Subaru offered a limited edition Impreza Sports Wagon called the Casa Blanca,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardatabase.net/?pid=00079059 |title=CarDatabase.net \u2013 Subaru Impreza Casablanca Wagon |accessdate=6 February 2008 |publisher=CarDatabase.net}}</ref> which had a [[retro]]-inspired front and rear end treatment, which was inspired by the popular [[kei car]] [[Subaru Vivio|Subaru Vivio Bistro]] styling package and [[Subaru Sambar#1990\u20131998|Subaru Sambar Dias Classic]].\n\nThe Impreza received an external facelift for the 1997 model year, followed by an interior redesign in 1998, using the new redesigned dashboard from the Forester.\n\nSubaru of North America initially offered the Impreza with the 1.8-liter engine only, with either front- or all-wheel drive; a 2.2-liter engine became optional for 1995.<ref name=\"cars101.com\">{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Spitz |url=http://www.cars101.com/impreza_archive93_96.html |title=Subaru Impreza 1993\u20131996; options, prices, and more in Seattle |publisher=Cars101.com |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref> For the 1995 model year, the 1.8/EJ18 was available with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission on the 'base' model only.<ref name=\"cars101.com\"/> The 2.2/EJ22 was only available with an automatic transmission for the L, LX, and Outback Sport trims. The 1995 model year also introduced OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics version 2) in the EJ22/Automatic transmission equipped models. The 1996 model line-up replaced the base version with the low-content Brighton trim, also used in the Legacy model. A five-speed manual transmission became available with the 2.2 engine on all models, except the Brighton which was only available with the 1.8 and a 5-speed.\n\nSubaru later decided to emphasize all-wheel drive in North America, making it standard on every Impreza (and Legacy) from 1997 onwards. North American markets never received the WRX version of the first generation Impreza. To test the waters for a full-fledged turbocharged model, Subaru showcased a turbocharged Impreza at various car shows around the country. The vehicle was named the 2.5RX and is now located in Subaru of America's Cherry Hill, New Jersey storage facility. Subsequently, the 2.5RS performance model was introduced in 1998 (the same year the 1.8-liter engine was dropped). A naturally aspirated 2.5-liter engine and larger brakes were fitted into the coupe body with gold-colored 16-inch five-spoke alloy wheels. The 2.5RS also featured several external cues from its overseas brethren such as hood vents, a hood scoop, and a rally-inspired rear spoiler. The 2.5/EJ25D (DOHC) used in the 1998 RS suffered from a high-rate of head gasket failures.<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Spitz |url=http://www.cars101.com/impreza_archive97_98.html |title=Subaru Impreza Archives: 1997\u20131998 |publisher=Cars101.com |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref> The 1999 model featured several changes: the newly designed \"Phase II\" [[SOHC]] version of the same 2.5&nbsp;L engine featured a slightly higher peak torque by {{convert|5|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, the wheels turned to a standard silver, the interior got an update, and the exterior became visually similar to the Japanese model with an updated front bumper borrowed from the Japanese Version 5 Impreza WRX STI. 2.5RS models became available in sedan form for 2000.\n\n{{gallery | width = 190 | height = 120\n|File:1994 Subaru Sportswagon (GF6) 4WD hatchback (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|1992\u20131994 Subaru Impreza hatchback\n|File:1995 Subaru Impreza (GC5) GX 2WD sedan (2009-03-13).jpg|1994\u20131995 Subaru Impreza GX sedan\n|File:1995 Subaru Impreza (GC5) GX 2WD sedan (2007-12-12).jpg|1994\u20131995 Subaru Impreza GX sedan\n|File:1996 Subaru Impreza (GF3 MY96) LX 2WD hatchback (2015-06-18) 01.jpg|1995\u20131996 Subaru Impreza LX hatchback\n|File:1996 Subaru Impreza (GF3 MY96) LX 2WD hatchback (2015-06-18) 02.jpg|1995\u20131996 Subaru Impreza LX hatchback\n|File:Subaru Impreza two-door -- 09-12-2010.jpg|1997\u20132001 Subaru Impreza coupe\n|File:1995 Subaru Impreza (GF5 MY95) GX 2WD hatchback (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|1995 Subaru Impreza GX hatchback\n|File:2001 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS 4-dr, front right.jpg|2001 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS sedan\n|File:Subaru Impreza Casa Blanca 001.JPG|Subaru Impreza Casa Blanca\n}}\n\n===WRX===\nThere have been seven noted versions of the WRX dating back from Subaru's original World Rally Cross staging vehicles. Subaru adopted the name \"WRX\" to stand for \"World Rally eXperimental\" as all WRX versions (1992 to present) feature rally inspired technology, including all wheel drive, stiffened suspensions and turbocharged four cylinder engines. The STi versions were marketed with consecutive numbers. Another way to determine the version of a WRX was to look at the chassis code. All WRX sold between 1992 and 2000 have the beginning chassis code of GC8 2/4 door sedan or GF8 hatchback; this is followed by a letter from A to G. Coupe versions share the \"GC\" code with sedans, except in the US, where they have a separate chassis code of \"GM\".\n\nIn 1994, Subaru introduced [[Subaru Tecnica International]] (STi badged) versions of the WRX in Japan. These models were upgraded from the standard WRX in many categories, including blueprinted performance-tuned engines, transmissions, and suspensions. The STi versions of the WRX were immensely successful in rallies and popular among street racers but were only sold in the Japanese market. Compared to the WRX, the STi had mostly mechanical modifications. (STi prepped Subaru rally cars since 1988 including the Legacy RS, the WRX STi Version was just the first car with an actual STi badge, though with handcrafted tuning)\n\n;GC8A (11/1992-9/1993)\nThe WRX debuted in November 1992 with {{convert|240|PS|kW hp|1|abbr=on}}. The center differential was a [[viscous coupling]] type, the rear [[limited slip differential]] was a viscous type. The WRX Type RA is a stripped down version of the WRX that was available in the Japanese market for people to purchase for motorsports and tuning. Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced soundproofing, manual windows, car horn delete, no air conditioning, no [[anti-lock brakes]], and added racing features such as more robust engines, 5th injection, intercooler water spray and shorter gearing. The WRX Type RA uses a closer ratio gearbox and a three-spoke leather steering wheel from Nardi. The ra model chassis code between GC8-(000000 to 005000) are only sold to the race team by order. Close ratio transmission is anticipated race use, the gap between each gear is brought closer together and a specific close ratio transmission is used.\n\nIn Europe, the WRX was introduced as the Impreza GT, and as the Impreza Turbo 2000 (UK). It came with {{convert|208|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n;GC8B (10/1993-8/1994)\nIn October 1993, Subaru introduced the 1994 model year WRX which produced {{convert|240|PS|kW hp|1|abbr=on}}. The rear rotors were substituted from ventilated disk to solid disk. October 1993 was also the start of production of the hatchback version, with {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first STi was known simply as \"WRX STi version\", with 100 per month were produced starting from February 1994. It had {{convert|250|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. This version of the STi was the only version where the standard cars were taken at the end of the assembly line and replaced by STi parts. A STi version of the Type RA was also offered, again with many amenities deleted to reduce weight and cost. Producing {{convert|275|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, this version of the WRX STi came with a Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD). This device was an electromechanical differential that could lock the differential.\n\n;GC8C (9/1994-9/1996)\n[[File:1995 Subaru WRX rear (NZ).jpg|thumb|1995 Subaru Impreza WRX (GC8C)]]\nIn November 1994, the WRX had a power increase to {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|1|abbr=on}}. The wheel diameters were increased to {{convert|16|in|mm}} and brake rotors were both changed to ventilated disks. In Japan, there was a Version of the WRX Sports Wagon with Outback trim, a bull bar and tailgate mounted spare wheel called the \"Impreza Gravel Express\". It was discontinued due to very limited sales. This car is considered the inspiration for the Subaru Forester.\n\nTo commemorate [[Colin McRae]]'s success in the international rally scene, Subaru in the UK released 200 limited edition \"Series McRae\" Turbo 2000's in June 1995, prepared by [[Prodrive]]. These vehicles were finished in a very limited \"Rally Blue\" colour scheme, sported gold 16-inch alloy wheels, McRae decals, individual numbered badging from 1\u2013201 (car 13 was never built since the number 13 is considered unlucky), and a factory-fitted electric tilt/slide sunroof. [[Recaro]] seats were fitted in the front, and the rear seats and side panels were retrimmed in the same Le Mans/Avus material.\n\nThe regular STi's engine output stood at {{convert|275|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The car weighed {{convert|1240|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and had gold wheels like those on the World Rally Championship Impreza. Now, the STi was built alongside the WRX on the production lines.\n\n[[File:1995 WRX STI RA GC8.jpg|thumb|1995 Subaru Impreza WRX STI RA]]\nThe 1996 model year WRX debuted in January 1996. The WRX design received minimal mechanical changes, but a WRX V-Limited Edition was introduced to celebrate the success of the Impreza WRC car in the FIA [[World Rally Championship|WRC]]. It was mechanically the same to the WRX but had a curb weight nudge to {{convert|1240|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. The V-limited cars are painted in World Rally Blue. A WRX STi Version II V-Limited edition was also produced. The interior is colored blue on the seat inserts and carpeting. The WRX Type RA STi Version II received a radio and air-conditioning in the V-limited form. 1,000 WRX STi Version II V-limited were produced, with 555 WRX Type RA STi Version II V-limited models produced.\n\n;GC8D (9/1996-9/1997)\nIn September 1996, the WRX was updated with new styling. The WRX now has a power rating of {{convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and now weighed {{convert|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Although it actually developed about 300 PS, the output was under-reported at the then-established gentlemen's agreement power limit of 280 PS.\n\nSubaru in the UK released the Turbo 2000 \"Catalunya\" in March 1997, a limited production of 200 cars (again excluding car number 13) in black with red flecks riding on gold alloy wheels. The Catalunya was made to celebrate winning Subaru's [[1996 World Rally Championship|second WRC manufacturer's title]] at the Rally of Spain (Catalunya).\n\nWith GC8D came the start of the coupe version of the WRX. It is called the WRX Type R. The coupe was chosen by [[Prodrive]] for use in the WRC because it was lighter and stiffer than the sedan, although it carried the same exterior dimensions. It was essentially a two-door version of the WRX Type RA meaning it had DCCD, minimal sound insulation, close-gear ratios and hardened gearbox. This car also has a water-spray nozzle to dampen the top of the intercooler. The water will then evaporate, taking heat away from the intercooler and cooling the intake charge. This car was produced on an order-only basis. An estimated 10,000 Type R models were produced for the Japanese Domestic Market. Also, there was a WRX Type RA (sedan) available, with a roof vent instead of map lights, and wind up windows, although electrics are an option from factory.\n\nAlso available was a WRX Type R V-limited. It has a WRX motor with no forged internals like the STI, and it misses out on the four-pot front brakes as they are to be installed by rally teams. It has a roof vent and is lightweight, making a good base for a rally car.\n\n;GC8E (September 1997 to August 1998)\nIn Europe, the Subaru Impreza GT's (Turbo 2000 in UK) interior was updated to leather. For the STi, power remained at 280&nbsp;PS. Forged pistons were also added. The interior and the cockpit were changed into a newer design along with the new white colored gauges. (<- leather was an option and there was no such thing as an EU spec STi.)\n\nFor the UK, the Turbo 2000 \"Terzo\" was released in April 1998. 333 cars in blue with gold alloy wheels were produced to celebrate Subaru's WRC title.\n\n[[File:Subaru Impreza 22B STi-Version.jpg|thumb|Subaru Impreza 22B STI]]\nIn 1998, Subaru of Japan produced a widebody, coupe WRX STi called the \"22B STi\" produced between March and August 1998. The 22B was used to commemorate both Subaru's 40th anniversary as well as the third consecutive manufacturer's title for Subaru in the [[FIA World Rally Championship]]. On the release of the sales, all 400 Japanese units sold out in from 30 minutes to 48 hours, depending on the report.<ref name=\"driveperformancesubaru.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.driveperformancesubaru.com/ |title=Subaru's ''Drive Performance'' Version 3.2 |publisher=Driveperformancesubaru.com |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> Another 24 were produced for export markets\u201416 for the UK, along with another 5 for Australia, and 3 prototypes. The 16 cars imported to the UK were modified by [[Prodrive]], with longer gear ratios, and UK specification lights. Because 50 22Bs had already been imported privately into the UK, Subaru had to wait until 1999 to register the 16 officially imported cars under the [[Vehicle Certification Agency|VCA's]] Single Vehicle Approval scheme.\n\nThe 22B had the [[Subaru EJ engine#EJ22G|''EJ22G engine'']] (note, the internal Subaru material states the closed-deck block comes from a version III ''EJ20G''). This means the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] was increased from {{cvt|1994|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} to {{cvt|2212|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, bored up to {{cvt|96.9|mm|2|abbr=on}}. Officially, it produced {{convert|280|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm and {{convert|37|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,200 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]], fuel feed by [[Fuel injection#Electronic injection|Electronic Fuel Injection]] and an [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] RHF 5HB [[turbocharger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=115016|website=carfolio.com|title=1998 Subaru Impreza 22B STi GC8E2SD |date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref> This car was given a unique color of blue and had fender flared widebody taken from the [[Peter Stevens (car designer)|Peter Stevens]] designed WRC car, thus widening the width by 80&nbsp;mm (3.15&nbsp;inches). The car has a unique hood, front and rear fenders, a WRC-inspired front bumper and a unique adjustable rear wing. During assembly, a WRX Type R chassis was taken off the line. The fenders were replaced with the 22B STi fenders. The suspension is provided by [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]], while the brakes were four-pot front/two-pot rear STi calipers, painted red. The wheels were increased in size from the standard WRX Type R STI Version from 16- to 17-inches and the clutch was upgraded to a sintered twin clutch with a ceramic disk. The origin of the name 22B has been debated. The 22 referred to the 2.2-liter displacement and the B was thought to be for the Bilstein suspension. This would correlate with the idea that Subaru sells a Legacy Spec B, where the B represents the Bilstein suspension. However, the B is actually a Subaru internal code for Turbo. 22B is also [[hexadecimal]] for the number 555, in reference to [[State Express 555]], Subaru's major sponsor in the WRC from 1993 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a535xyidmF0&t=1m43s|title=Subaru Vintage Garage- 1998 Impreza 22B STI|last=Subaru|date=5 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> The car's curb weight is {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0}}.\n\n;GC8F (9/1998-9/1999)\n[[File:1999 Subaru Impreza (MY99) WRX STI Version 5 coupe (23295614974).jpg|thumb|Subaru Impreza (MY99) WRX STI Version 5 coupe]]\n\nMechanically the GC8F was virtually the same as its predecessor. The torque was increased a little from {{convert|242|to|250|lbft|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm. The weight also continues to increase and is set at {{convert|2800|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n[[File:RB5.jpg|thumb|Subaru Impreza WRX RB5]]\n\nTo celebrate the return of British driver [[Richard Burns]] to the rally team, a limited edition of 444 Turbo 2000 \"RB5\" models in gray were created in 1999 for the UK. The basic model had little more than cosmetic differences, but most had the WR Sport Performance Pack, an option consisting of a new ECU and exhaust for {{convert|240|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque. There was also an optional [[Prodrive]] suspension pack.\n\nThe standard UK Impreza Turbo 2000 was also tuned and partly restyled by [[Prodrive]] in 1999 to create the \"Prodrive WR Sport\". It featured a unique interior, suspension upgrade, new bodykit and wheels, plus WR Sport decals and an optional ECU upgrade.\n\nFor the STI, the power stayed the same as the previous version but the engine layout and design was made cleaner and was dubbed as the \"Boxer Phase 2\" engine. The facelift the rest of the Impreza line had was also applied to the STI. The WRX STI weighed {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. There were 1000 WRX Type RA STI Version 5 Limited cars and each had a four-month waiting period. The interior was also changed slightly, including seats and steering. This model was also produced as a 555 limited edition.\n\n;GC8G (9/1999-9/2000)\n[[File:1999\u20132000 Subaru Impreza WRX sedan.jpg|thumb|1999\u20132000 Subaru Impreza WRX sedan (GC8G)]]\n\nThe last version of the GC WRX was introduced in September 1999. There is no change in the mechanical specifications. Added features are newly designed alloy wheels, color-coded mirrors and door handles, remote central locking, intermittent wipers with a timer and map lights.\n\nThe European GT model received further upgrades in the form of more parts from the STI range. The front brakes became Subaru branded four-pot calipers with {{convert|294|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} discs, the wheels having become 16-inch lightweight alloys. The STI 4 high-level wing was fitted to the sedan, and STI-style front bucket seats and firmer suspension were also fitted. The \"Phase 2\" engine now fitted developed {{convert|160|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, an increase of {{convert|5|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} over the previous model.\n\nTo counter the grey imports of high-performance Japanese variants, Subaru UK commissioned [[Prodrive]] to produce a limited edition of 1,000 two-door cars in Sonic Blue, called the WRX \"P1\". Released in March 2000, they were taken from the STI Type R lines and used for the P1. The car was the only coupe version of the WRX STI GC chassis to receive ABS. In order to allow for ABS, the DCCD was dropped. Engine output was boosted to {{convert|276|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and the suspension optimised for British roads. Options were available from Subaru consisting of four-piston front brake calipers, electric Recaro seats, 18-inch wheels and a P1 stamped backbox. The P1, or Prodrive One, is echoed in the name of the [[Prodrive P2]] concept car.\n\nLikewise, for the STI, most of the changes were cosmetic with the fender being sculpted to be more aggressive. There were 2,000 WRX STI Version 6 Limited model produced, plus 1000 of the WRX STI Type R coupe Version 6 Limited, 2,000 of the WRX STI RA Version 6 Limited, and also 500 of the WRX STI Version 6 Limited hatchback models.\n\nIn 2000, STI released the WRX STI \"S201\", of which 300 were produced. This series is a limited production series that sports an engine output of 224&nbsp;kW (305 PS) as special variants were excluded from the gentlemen's agreement. The car was decked with nearly every single part from the STI catalogue. The S201 was a sedan that sported the only body-kitted S-series WRX STI. Weighing in at {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, the S201 had a tri-planar wing and a massive front air splitter.

Larger in size compared to the previous iteration, the sedan increased its width by {{convert|40|mm|in|1}}, while the wagon notably increased by just {{convert|5|mm|in|1}}\u2014placing the two variants in different [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese classification categories]]. The coupe body style from the first generation did not reappear for the new series, and the off-road appearance package that included contrasting-colored bumpers did carry over forward. Marketed as a separate model line, this North America-only variant was, as before, badged the [[Subaru Outback|Outback Sport]].\n\nNaturally aspirated flat-four (boxer) engines comprised the 1.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ15|EJ15]]'', the 1.6-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ16|EJ16]]'', the 2.0-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ20|EJ20]]'', and the 2.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ25|EJ25]]''. Turbocharged versions of the 2.0- and 2.5-liter engines were offered in the WRX and WRX STI models. STI models featured a more powerful 2.0-liter (2.5-liter outside of the Japanese market) turbocharged engine. WRX models featured a 2.0-liter turbocharged boxer engine until 2005, after which they switched to the 2.5-liter turbocharged engine.\n\nAt the Australian [[Wheels Car of the Year]], the car won the overall COTY award in 2000. At the American [[MotorWeek Drivers' Choice Awards]], the Impreza won the Best Sport Sedan in 2002 and the Best Performance Car in 2004.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"120\">\nFile:2005 Subaru Impreza (GD9 MY05) GX sedan (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|First facelift (\"Blobeye\") sedan (2002)<!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO MODEL YEAR 2004: the first facelift introduced to Japan in November 2002 -->\nFile:2007 Subaru Impreza (GD9 MY07) Luxury sedan (2010-11-28).jpg|Second facelift (\"Hawkeye\") sedan (2005) <!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO MODEL YEAR 2006: the second facelift introduced to Japan in June 2005 -->\nFile:2001-2002 Subaru Impreza (GDE MY02) RS sedan (2011-06-15) 02.jpg|Pre-facelift (\"Bugeye\") sedan (2000) <!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO MODEL YEAR 2002: the pre-facelift model introduced to Japan in August 2000 -->\nFile:Subaru Impreza Sportkombi rear 20090313.jpg|Second facelift wagon <!-- DO NOT CHANGE TO MODEL YEAR 2006: the second facelift introduced to Japan in June 2005 -->\n</gallery>\n\n===Saab 9-2x===\nSubaru manufactured a [[Badge engineering|badge engineered]] variant, marketed by Saab as the '''9-2x''' for the North American market (2005-2006) in solely the wagon bodystyle.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.detnews.com/article/20091230/OPINION03/912300431/1362/OPINION0339/Saab+hangs+on+by+its+fingernails |title=Saab hangs on by its fingernails |publisher=The Detroit News |accessdate=2 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The 9-2X received redesigned front and rear styling as well as other interior, acoustic and technical modifications.\n\n===WRX===\nAs with the first generation, the turbocharged STI variants were available in numerous specifications with a myriad of limited edition variants sold.

Initially, the new Impreza was offered as a five-door hatchback (designated ''GH''), with the four-door sedan (designated ''GE'') introduced in 2008. This generation also saw the discontinuation of the wagon, replaced by a new 5-door hatchback body style. The wide-body variants of the hatchback and sedan are labelled ''GR'' and ''GV'', respectively. Dimensionally, this version is wider by {{convert|2.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and increases track by approximately {{convert|1.5|in|mm|0|order=flip}}. Although first adopted by the STI, the wide-body platform was later utilized by the standard WRX range.\n\nThe third series of the Impreza is slightly longer, wider and offers a longer wheelbase. Two Subaru traditions were discontinued with the new model: the parking light switch atop the steering column is no longer present, and for the first time the windows have frames to improve [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] levels.<ref>{{cite news |title=Subaru Impreza |magazine=[[Wheels Magazine]] |date=July 2007 |page=198}}</ref> Subaru made an effort to control the weight of the new chassis. Despite the increase in size, stiffness, and safety equipment, the car's weight is similar to the previous generation. The front suspension uses a [[MacPherson strut]] setup, while the rear features a new [[double wishbone]] suspension.\n\nFlat-four gasoline engines in the naturally aspirated tune comprised a 1.5-liter ''[[EL15]]'' producing {{convert|80|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}, the 2.0-liter ''EJ20'' with {{convert|110|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|196|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}, and the 2.5-liter ''EJ25'' with {{convert|127|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}. Turbocharged versions of the two latter engines were fitted to the WRX and WRX STI versions as discussed later. Subaru introduced a flat-four diesel engine, designated ''[[Subaru EE engine|EE20]]'' at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show]]. Sales began in several European countries from early 2009, with the 2.0-liter turbo diesel engine of {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Two models are available as of July 2009, '''2.0 TD''' and '''2.0 TD Sport'''.\n\nIn the Japanese domestic market the range comprised the 1.5-liter 15S, plus the 2.0-liter '''20S''' and turbocharged '''S-GT''', both using the 2.0-liter engine. Japanese dealers retailed the hatchback initially, with the sedan body variant arriving in autumn 2008 as the '''Impreza Anesis'''. This generation represented the first time that the Impreza was no longer in compliance with [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions. Japanese specification models are fitted with an engine start button.\n\nSubaru Australia released the third generation hatchback in September 2007. Naturally aspirated 2.0-liter versions fell under the '''R''', '''RX''' and '''RS''' trims, with the turbocharged 2.5-liter reserved for the WRX. The sedan body style came later in 2008, paralleling the hatchbacks's model range.\n\nNorth America received only the 2.5-liter models. Released to the United States market for the 2008 model year, the model range consists of the '''2.5i''', the turbocharged WRX, and the Outback Sport that Subaru marketed as a separate model line. The naturally aspirated models are electronically limited from surpassing {{convert|190|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. For 2009, a new '''2.5i GT''' trim arrived to the market with the turbocharged {{convert|224|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine from the 2008 model WRX (this 2009 WRX received a boost in power). While automatic transmission was not available with the WRX, the 2.5i GT did gain an optional four-speed automatic. In the Canadian market, the base Impreza 2.5i received upgrades for the 2009 model year, including rear disc brakes, electronic stability control, and body-colored door handles\u2014features previously only found on the 2.5i Sport and more expensive trims.\n\nIn Israel, the Impreza is denoted as the '''B3''', and three styles are offered: the B3 1.5, with a 1.5-liter engine, the B3 2.0 and the B3 2.0 Sport, both with the 2.0-liter engine. Four-door and five-door models are available for each engine type, ranging from the basic R class, to the medium RX and top RXI class.\n\nIndonesian-specification versions were initially only available as the hatchback style, with the sedan arriving in 2011. The 1.5R and 2.0R could be ordered with a dual-range five-speed manual, or four-speed automatic transmission. However, in Singapore and Thailand, the Impreza 1.5 R, 2.0 R, and 2.5 WRX are also offered as four-door sedan. The WRX STI trim in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand can be ordered with the dual-range six-speed manual, or five-speed automatic if WRX STI A-Line is available.\n\nSafety of the car has been increased with range wide inclusion of [[electronic stability control]] as standard in many markets. When the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) in the US crash-tested the five-door Impreza, the organization granted the Impreza the highest ranking available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=349 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Subaru Impreza |access-date=6 February 2008 |publisher=IIHS.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213130840/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=349 |archive-date=13 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] in Australia tested the Impreza where it scored 34.66 out of 37 points, or the full five-star rating in the occupant safety crash test; the Impreza also scored a four-star pedestrian safety test.\n\nThe Impreza range received a facelift in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, gaining a new grille insert.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:2010 Subaru Impreza (GH7 MY11) XV hatchback (2010-10-19) 01.jpg| Subaru Impreza XV hatchback\nFile:Subaru Impreza XV 2.0D AWD rear 20101010.jpg| Subaru Impreza XV hatchback\nFile:3rd Subaru Impreza Outback Sport.jpg| Subaru Outback Sport hatchback\nFile:2010 Subaru Impreza (GH7 MY11) RX hatchback 04.jpg| Interior\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===WRX===\n[[File:08 Subaru WRX hatch front.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza hatchback]]\n[[File:08 Subaru WRX hatch rear.jpg|thumb|right|Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza hatchback]]\n[[File:Tino Rossini's Reviews - 038 - 2011 Subaru WRX.jpg|thumb|left|Facelift Subaru Impreza WRX sedan]]\n[[File:2010 Subaru Impreza (GVE MY11) WRX sedan (2010-10-19) 02.jpg|thumb|Facelift Subaru Impreza WRX sedan]]\n\nSubaru debuted the turbocharged WRX performance variant of the third generation series alongside the mainstream naturally aspirated models on 2 April 2007. For this generation, most markets adopted the abbreviated name \"WRX\", although the Japanese, North American and UK markets retained the full \"Subaru Impreza WRX\" title. The 2.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ255|EJ255]]'' engine is largely unchanged internally. Changes in the engine compartment consist primarily of a fourth generation Legacy GT style intake manifold and intercooler. The TD04 turbo remains from the previous generation, however it has been adjusted to fit the new intake design. Power output consists of {{convert|169|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} from its 2.5-liter engine. It was offered in either a five-speed manual, or 4 speed automatic. The five-speed manual transmission was changed to the same found in the fourth-generation Legacy GT. The rear limited slip differential has been discarded in exchange for the new VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) system. The weight of the car also has been reduced and gives the WRX a {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} time of 5.8 seconds. In contrast, curb weight of the standard Impreza model is around {{convert|60|lb|kg|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} heavier. For the US market, the WRX was offered in \"base\", Premium, and Limited trim levels. In Australia, the WRX is available as a sedan or hatchback. An optional premium package adds the satellite navigation with DVD player and 7-inch screen, leather upholstery and a sunroof.\n\nIn response to criticism that the third generation WRX suspension is too soft, and needing to keep on par with rival car companies new releases, Subaru issued several changes in 2008 for the 2009 model year, known in the UK as the WRX-S. The ''EJ255'' engine received an output boost to {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|244|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque by swapping the previous ''TD04'' turbocharger to an [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] ''VF52''. This led to the car now achieving a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (0\u201397&nbsp;km/h) time of 4.7 seconds, as tested by ''[[Car and Driver]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 22, 2008 |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2009-subaru-impreza-wrx-short-take-road-test |title=2009 Subaru Impreza WRX \u2013 Short Take Road Test \u2013 Car Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref> In addition, the updated model received altered springs/struts, sway bars, and Dunlop summer tires to improve handling. Exterior cosmetic changes included the 2008 WRX Premium aero package, STi spoiler (Hatchback only), updated grill with WRX badge, and darker Gunmetal colored wheels as standard equipment. Interior changes consisted of aluminum pedals, silver trim around the shifter, red stitching on the shift boot and seats, and a red WRX logo embroidered on the driver and passenger seat.\n\nFurther changes in 2010 for year model 2011 saw the WRX gain the wide-body shell from the STI, as well as the addition of quad muffler tips with diffuser. The new model gains {{convert|33|lb|kg|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Firmer rear sub-frame bushings and wider 17-inch wheels contribute to improved traction.\n\n==={{anchor|GR|GV}} WRX STI===\n{{multiple image\n | total_width       = 400\n | align             = \n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            =  ImprezaSTI3rd.jpg\n | caption1          = \n | image2            = Subaru Impreza STI - Flickr - David Villarreal Fern\u00e1ndez (19).jpg\n | caption2          = \n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = center\n | footer            = Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza WRX STI hatchback\n}}\n{{multiple image\n | total_width       = 400\n | align             = \n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            =  11-09-04-iaa-by-RalfR-124.jpg\n | caption1          = \n | image2            = 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan rear -- 2011 DC.jpg\n | caption2          = \n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = center\n | footer            = Facelift Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan\n}}\n\nDebuting at the Tokyo Auto Show in October 2007, WRX STI versions build further on the standard WRX cars. The STI available in Japan is fitted with the 2.0-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ207|EJ207]]'' engine with twin scroll turbocharger generating {{convert|308|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|422|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,400 rpm. Export markets receive the higher-displacement 2.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ257|EJ257]]'' unit with the single-scroll ''VF48'' turbocharger rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|407|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque. The turbocharger directs air through a larger top-mount intercooler which has lost the red \"STI\" that was on previous generations. The STI (3,395&nbsp;lbs) is heavier than the WRX (3,174- 3,240&nbsp;lbs depending on trim) due to a more robust transmission, rear differential and other chassis reinforcements.\n\nLike the standard WRX, the third generation model was shortened to \"Subaru WRX STI\", with the Japanese markets notably abstaining from this convention. To differentiate the STI from the regular WRX, Subaru opted to manufacture the STI with a wider body and therefore track\u2014as noted by the flared wheel arches. Furthermore, Subaru utilized aluminum suspension components for the STI. Electronic modifications include a multi-mode [[electronic stability control]] with \"normal\", \"traction\", and \"off\" modes; Subaru Intelligent-Drive (SI-Drive) with three modes: \"intelligent\", \"sport\", and \"sport sharp\"; and multi-mode driver controlled center differential (DCCD). The DCCD is a combined mechanical and solenoid operated [[limited-slip differential]] which enables the driver to switch between manual and automated centre differential locking. The locking strength can vary from fully open to fully locked <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motec.com.au/sdc/sdcoverview/ |title=Subaru SDC |publisher=MoTeC |accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref> with a 40/60 front/rear open torque bias.\n\nThe STI hatchback was released in the United States in March 2008.\n\nA Subaru Impreza WRX STI Group R4 was entered in the 2012 FIA [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship|Asia-Pacific Rally]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.co.jp/news/12_07_09/12_09_12.html |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u91cd\u5de5\u696d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9 |publisher=fhi.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 for the 2011 model year, the WRX STI became available as a four-door. The most noticeable feature on the STI sedan is a large rear spoiler. Australia also received the 2011 model year STI as a sedan to complement the hatchback released in 2008. Australian STIs were offered in standard form, plus the STI spec.R. An electric sunroof, leather upholstery, satellite navigation, and [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels are standard on the spec.R, while Recaro seats are optional.\n\nA facelift of the STI arrived in 2010 for the 2011 model year, distinguished by a new front bumper.

The WRX STI 380S includes increased engine power to {{convert|380|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, new wheels, an upgraded body kit. The vehicles were unveiled at the [[British Motor Show]].\n\nSubaru announced, on 10 September 2008, that the 380S variation would not be produced, due to homologation and specification difficulties. However, the regular 330S model did enter production as the \"WRX STI Type UK\".\n\n;WRX STI R205\nThe R205 was a complete car from STI; the \"R\" signifying the \"road\". Based on the Impreza WRX STI, the model utilised technology developed through STI's participation in the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] Race to the full. As the name implies, focus was given to the car's performance on public roads in its development in order to create the best road-going car possible. As for the engine, maximum output was increased to 320PS and the maximum torque to 44.0&nbsp;kg-m by the introduction of such components as a special ball bearing twin scroll turbo. In addition, [[Brembo]] 13-inch discs and calipers were installed on the front and rear brakes. With regard to the exterior, aerodynamic devices including STI front and rear under spoilers were fitted. In order to further enhance the \"flexible yet elegant driving feel\" that STI aims for, a newly developed Flexible Draw Stiffener was installed along with STI dampers/springs and Flexible Tower Bar. As a result, the car could achieve exceptional vehicle maneuverability, which made the car react smoothly to the driver's intention.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sti.jp/e/product/previousmodel/2010r205.html |title=STI |publisher=Sti.jp |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref>\n\n;WRX STI Special Edition (MY 2010)\nIt is a version of the Impreza WRX STI for the North American market, similar to the Japanese STI Spec C.

It is now almost exactly the same dimensions as the first and second Subaru Legacy (1990\u20131999). The 2015\u20132016 models had an updated grille, bumper, side mirrors and increased sound deadening.\n\nThe third generation high-performance WRX variants continued in production until new versions were released in early 2014. In 2014, Subaru decided to move away from marketing the WRX and WRX STI under the Impreza name. The WRX and WRX STI are performance trims of the Impreza with higher output engines, firmer suspension, larger brakes, slightly resculpted body panels, lowered ride height and larger intakes. Subaru had promised to completely move the WRX and STi off the Impreza chassis and body to create a standalone model, but they instead chose to simply alter the Impreza's body, and chassis and remove the Impreza name. Subaru decided to not produce a WRX or WRX STi wagon as had been previously offered. The wagon made up approximately 50&nbsp;percent of US WRX and WRX STI sales.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stoklosa |first=Alexander |title=2014 Subaru Spy Photos |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-subaru-wrx-spy-photos-news |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=29 November 2013|date=2012-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the regular models, Subaru also offered the '''Impreza Sport''' Hatchback in the Premium and Limited trim levels. The so-called American Impreza Sport (not to be confused with the JDM regular hatchback with the same name) has the rugged style with side spoilers, roof rack, different style alloys, and availability of two-tone colors. However it also has the normal ground clearance, unlike the new XV. For the Premium model grade, buyers can choose 5 speed manual or Lineartronic CVT, while the Limited is only available with CVT.\n\nEyeSight consists of two cameras with one on each side of the interior rear view mirror, that use human like [[stereoscopic]] vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a [[lane departure warning system]], a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. [[Autonomous cruise control system]] has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid. This feature is initially available only in Japan, but was expanded to US models of other vehicles, beginning with 2013 Legacy and Outback models.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/16/2013-subaru-models-to-see-with-optional-eyesight-safety-system/ |title=2013 Subaru models to see with optional EyeSight safety system |first=John |last=Neff |work=Autoblog}}</ref>\n\n==={{visible anchor|XV / Crosstrek|XV}}===\n{{Main|Subaru Crosstrek#First generation (2012\u20132017) \u2013 GP}}\n[[File:Subaru XV 2.0i-L EyeSight (GP7) interior.JPG|thumb|Interior]]\n\nSubaru demonstrated the Subaru XV concept vehicle in 2011.

This time, the Impreza name was dropped in all markets in which the new model is named simply as the WRX, as had been the case in North America with the previous model, while in Japan it was sold as the WRX S4. The body design also took a stronger departure from the Impreza donor model than in the past. The general WRX profile/silhouette was carried over from the Impreza, as were the front doors, trunk lid, and interior. However, the entire front end bodywork plus the rear quarter panels were unique to the WRX. The rear doors received a subtle reskin with an upwards kink and revised character line, but retained an otherwise identical shape.\n\nThis model is the first of the WRX line to deviate from the ''EJ''-series engine. It uses the new 2.0-liter [[Subaru FA engine|''FA20F'']] engine, which has direct injection and a twin-scroll turbocharger. On all previous WRXs the turbocharger was located near the right-hand side of the firewall, close to the third cylinder. With the new ''FA20F'', Subaru fitted the turbocharger at the front of the car, close to the serpentine accessory belts. There is a robust aluminum skid plate that protects the underside of the turbocharger. Mounting the turbo lower in the engine bay helps reduce the car's center of gravity to {{convert|19.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Pund2014>{{cite news |last=Pund |first=Daniel |date=September 2014 |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2015-subaru-wrx-vs-2015-volkswagen-gti-final-scoring-performance-data-and-complete-specs-page-4 |title=2015 Subaru WRX |work=[[Car and Driver]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> The FA20's high compression ratio of 10.6:1 combined with its 68\u00b0 intake and 54\u00b0 exhaust cam phasing range allow it to produce excellent off-boost efficiency as well as a wide torque peak.<ref>{{cite web|title=FA20 DIT Engine Specs|url=http://www.comeanddriveit.com/specs/fa20dit|website=Come and Drive It}}</ref>\n\nBehind the wheel, the most noticeable difference between the EJ and FA engines is the latter's broader torque curve. The 2.5L EJ produced a maximum of {{Convert|240|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm, while the new 2.0L FA peaks twice as soon ({{Convert|258|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2,000 rpm).<ref name=Pund2014/> Less obvious is a {{Convert|3|hp|kW|abbr=on}} increase over the old engine; the FA is rated at {{Convert|268|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm.<ref name=Pund2014/>\n\nFrom 2009 through 2014 the WRX's engine was mated exclusively to a five-speed manual. That changes for 2015. In base trim, the sole transmission is a six-speed manual, the first ever available in a non-STi WRX while the Limited and Premium trim levels add the option of a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with paddle shifters for the first time.\n\nWhen left in Intelligent mode (the most frugal of its three settings) the CVT returns better fuel economy than the manual. In Sport and Sport# modes it shifts more aggressively, mimicking a six and eight-speed gearbox, respectively, but its acceleration still lags that of the manual transmission.\n\nThe new powertrain gives the 2015 WRX a different character than the car it replaces, but its acceleration times are virtually unchanged. The biggest performance gains come from the 2015 redesigned chassis. Structural stiffness and spring rates are up 40 to 60&nbsp;percent, raising roadholding numbers by about 0.80&nbsp;G.\n\nThe 2015 WRX has been met with mixed reviews by automotive journalists. It placed second to the 2015 Volkswagen GTI in separate comparison tests in the September 2014 issues of ''Car and Driver'' and ''Motor Trend''. In general, it bests its sub-$30,000 competition in nearly every performance metric, but suffers from a cheaper interior and a less comfortable ride. Its sharp styling is usually listed as polarizing, too, although the bulk of criticism in that area is based on the lack of a hatchback model.\n\nPerformance numbers vary from publication to publication. Testing from ''Car and Driver'', ''Road & Track'' and ''Motor Trend'' has produced 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) times as fast as 4.8 seconds and as slow as 5.5 seconds. It runs the quarter-mile anywhere from 13.6 sec at {{Convert|102|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to 14.0 sec at {{Convert|98|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. (CVT-equipped WRXs are about a half-second slower to 60&nbsp;mph and through the quarter-mile.) On the skidpad, roadholding numbers range from 0.92 G to 0.96 G. Braking from {{Convert|70|mph|0|abbr=on}} results in stops as short as 156\u2013166 feet.\n\nIn base trim, the car starts at $27,090 (including destination) and weighs 3,267&nbsp;lbs. Limited and Premium trim levels add more comfort and convenience, such as heated seats and LED headlights, but not more performance. Starting in 2016 the Premium and Limited trim levels also come with 18\" wheels, similar to the last generation STI [[Enkei Corporation|Enkei]] wheels.\n\nFor the 2018 model year, the WRX received some mid-generation improvements. The 2018 model first went on sale at dealerships in summer 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/newsrelease.do?id=1108&mid=171&allImage=1&teaser=subaru-america-announces-pricing-updated-2018-wrx-wrx|title=Subaru U.S. Media Center - SUBARU OF AMERICA ANNOUNCES PRICING ON UPDATED 2018 WRX\u00ae AND WRX STI\u00ae MODELS|website=http://media.subaru.com}}</ref>\n\nA January 2017 announcement<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/newsrelease.do?id=1067&mid=&allImage=1&teaser=subaru-debuts-2018-wrx-wrx-sti-performance-comfort|title=Subaru U.S. Media Center - SUBARU DEBUTS 2018 WRX AND WRX STI WITH PERFORMANCE, COMFORT AND SAFETY UPGRADES|website=http://media.subaru.com}}</ref> presaged improvements that addressed some of the criticism of the 2015 model debut, including a newly revised suspension, revised, upgraded interior materials and a quieter cabin, and a revised front styling. For the WRX, a newly available performance Package option included Recaro front seats with 8-way power driver's seat, improved brake pads, and a moonroof delete to reduce weight. Also new was upgraded EyeSight Driver Assist Technology safety features.\n\nThe 2018 WRX and WRX STI mid-model improvement continued with the 6-speed manual transmission came as standard equipment, and the optional Lineartronic CVT automatic transmission with Intelligent, Sport 6-speed paddle shift emulation and Sport# (pronounced \"Sport Sharp\") 8-speed paddle shift emulation.\n\nThe standard WRX added heated exterior mirrors (already a standard on higher level trims). A new, larger 5.9-inch high-definition multi-function display replaced the older 4.3-inch unit allowing the driver to see vehicle functions more easily. The WRX Premium trim added a larger multimedia audio unit. WRX Limited models added an 8-way power driver's seat with lumbar adjustment.\n\nIn May 2018,<ref name=\"media.subaru.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/newsrelease.do?id=1375&mid=171&allImage=1&teaser=subaru-announces-2019-wrx-model-new-subaru-starlink|title=Subaru U.S. Media Center - SUBARU ANNOUNCES 2019 WRX MODEL WITH NEW SUBARU STARLINK IN-VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY AND SERIES.GRAY LIMITED EDITION|website=http://media.subaru.com}}</ref> the 2019 model year WRX and WRX STI was announced.

Other performance upgrades included Jurid high performance front brake pads and a moonroof delete to save weight. The interior front seats were upgraded to ultrasuede covered Recaro seats with an 8-way power feature for the driver. The Series Gray cars received upgraded LED Steering Responsive Headlights, LED fog lights and Keyless Access with Push-Button Start, usually reserved for the upmarket Limited trim WRX models. The WRX STI also received a limited run of 250 Series Gray cars, with similar WRX STI only upgrades. LL Series Gray WRX and WRX STI models were equipped with a 6-speed manual transmissions only.\n\nOf note, for 2019, was the introduction of a new Subaru STARLINK infotainment system integrated with standard with the increasingly popular Apple CarPlay and Android Auto upgrade packages with the optional Harman Kardon entertainment system also increased the infotainment screen size from 6.2 inches to a larger 7.0 inches.\n\nThe 2019 WRX equipped with the optional Lineartronic CVT also came standard with the Subaru EyeSight Driver Assist Technology. On previous models, Eyesight was only available as an option package. Also optional on the CVT equipped WRX was Reverse Automatic Braking, a feature unlikely to be implemented in non-CVT equipped vehicles.\n\n===WRX STI===\n[[File:2015 Subaru WRX STi Type UK Symetrica 2.5 Front.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru WRX STI (Pre-facelift)]]\n[[File:2015 Subaru WRX STi Type UK Symetrica 2.5 Rear.jpg|thumb|right|Subaru WRX STI (Pre-facelift)]]\n[[File:2018 Subaru WRX (VAF MY18) STI sedan (2018-11-29) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru WRX STI (Facelift)]]\n[[File:2018 Subaru WRX (VAF MY18) STI sedan (2018-11-29) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Subaru WRX STI (Facelift)]]\n[[File:Subaru WRX STI (VAB) interior.JPG|thumb|right|Interior]]\nThis model retains the same engine as the previous generation STI, which is a 2.5-liter ''EJ257'' with dual AVCS however with modifications to the ECU which have increased fuel economy slightly, and has given a {{Convert|6|kW|hp|abbr=on}} boost in power to 227&nbsp;kW (305 HP). Torque, however, has dropped from {{Convert|407|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|394|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm and top speed is now 160&nbsp;mph (258&nbsp;km/h).\n\nThere are also reports that along with the ECU changes, the rev limit was raised to 7,100&nbsp;rpm to support the power increase at the upper rev range to support a stronger top end.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It also retains a hydraulic power steering system as opposed to the WRX's new electric-assisted rack. The steering rack was changed to a quicker 13:1 ratio, as used in the Japan delivered vehicles, as opposed to the 15:1 ratio of the previous models. Also, the 2.0-liter ''EJ207'' that is standard for Japanese STIs was retained specifically for the Japanese market in the new 2015 WRX STI.\n\nA sound tube device, also seen on the [[Subaru BRZ|BRZ]], has also been fitted to the air intake system to channel certain induction and turbo frequencies into the cabin, reports show this is only fitted to vehicles in some markets.\nIn Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan, the STI is available with and without the wing. Starting in 2016 the US version of the limited STI was also made available with either the traditional high wing or, optionally, with the standard WRX low profile wing.\n\nIn 2013, British rally champion [[Mark Higgins (driver)|Mark Higgins]] lapped the [[Isle of Man TT]] course in 17&nbsp;minutes, 35.139&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web |last=Burt |first=Matt |date=28 June 2016 |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/Subaru-Isle-of-Man-video-TT-record-2016 |title=New onboard video: Subaru's record-breaking Isle of Man TT lap |work=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |access-date=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 Subaru released the WRX STI Launch Edition that came in World Rally Blue Pearl exterior paint combined with gold-painted, 18-inch, BBS alloy wheels. Only 1000 Launch Editions were released in North America.\n\nIn 2015 Subaru released the WRX STI S207, limited to 400 units sold only for the Japanese market. The S207 used the 2 liter EJ20 engine which was tuned to 328 PS (323.5&nbsp;hp, 241&nbsp;kW) and {{Convert|318|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Upgrades also include a quicker-ratio 11-to-1 steering rack (compared to 13-to-1 for the stock unit). STI-spec Recaro front bucket seats, Bilstein adjustable DampMatic II front suspension, and drilled rotors clamped by Brembo monoblock six-piston front calipers and four-pot rear calipers. Up to 200 of the units could be equipped with the NBR Challenge Package, which features a carbon-fibre wing and a badge commemorating Subaru's class victory at the 2015 N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours.\n\nIn 2016 Subaru released the WRX STI Hyper Blue special edition series, with production limited to 700 units for the United States. The new color covers the outside, and it is also offset with gloss black 18-inch BBS wheels, badges and mirror caps. Blue stitching brings the color into the interior, and Subaru's seven-inch navigation system with a nine-speaker stereo is standard for this version. In Australia, Subaru announced the WRX Premium Hyper Blue special edition with the CVT automatic will be limited to 200 units targeted to customers, and WRX STI Premium with the six-speed gearbox will be limited to just 50 units.\n\nAs a way of celebrating 30 years of the STI nameplate (in 2018), Subaru offered a limited edition WRX STi Diamond Edition which was developed by Subaru Southern Africa's technical team making it exclusively available to the region with only 30 being produced. The WRX STi Diamond Edition is powered by a fettled 2.5-litre, high-boost turbocharged Boxer engine that offers {{convert|260|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,500 rpm and {{convert|464|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque at 4 000 rpm. The remapping of the Electronic Control Unit and the fitment of a performance exhaust system has contributed to improved performance. A new engine brace has been fitted for better stability and balance. The WRX STi Diamond Edition rides 20mm lower than the standard WRX STi and the body kit, in a High Viz yellow further lowers the front-end by 10&nbsp;mm. The spoiler vane gets a stainless steel STI badge unique to this limited edition model and high gloss black Diamond Edition badges appear on the sides of the rear wing. The WRX STi Diamond Edition rides on 19-inch lightweight and darkened aluminium Y-design alloy wheels.\n\nIn 2017 Subaru released the WRX STI S208, limited to 450 units sold only for the Japanese market. The S208 used a 2-liter EJ20 engine tuned to 329 PS (324.36&nbsp;hp, 242&nbsp;kW) and {{Convert|432|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It has other upgrades similar to those of the WRX STI S207- a quicker 11:1 ratio steering rack, Bilstein DampMatic II front suspension, Recaro front bucket seats, 19-inch BBS wheels, drilled rotors clamped by Brembo monoblock six-piston front calipers and four-pot rear calipers, intercooler water spray, a torque vectoring system, and more.

North American models are now produced for the first time at [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.]] in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], while the Crosstrek continues to be produced in Japan.<ref name=\"SIA Impreza production 11/2016 fhi.co.jp\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fhi.co.jp/press/news-en/2016_11_02_3125/ |title=First American-made Impreza rolls off the assembly line in Subaru of Indiana Automotive plant |publisher=Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. |date=2 November 2016 |access-date=17 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117224018/http://www.fhi.co.jp/press/news-en/2016_11_02_3125/ |archive-date=17 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Models for markets outside of North America continue to be produced in Japan. SIA also produces the North American-market [[Subaru Outback]] and [[Subaru Legacy]], and will produce the three-row [[Subaru Ascent|Ascent]] crossover previewed by the Viziv 7 concept from the 2016 [[Los Angeles Auto Show]] in 2018.\n\nThe new Subaru Global Platform underpins both sedan and hatch versions of the Impreza. This new platform has an increased rigidity of 70% to 100% over the outgoing model and a lower centre of gravity by 5&nbsp;mm (0.2 inches). 95% of this new Impreza is all-new when compared to the fourth generation. The suspension has been set up for better comfort, while Active Torque Vectoring in some models also helps improve dynamics. The car is longer and wider than the old one, with a longer wheelbase. Much of the increase in wheelbase was used to improve both front- and rear-seat legroom; in the United States, Subaru now boasts that the new Impreza has category-leading passenger room.\n\nPowering the new Subaru Impreza<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atvmagblog.com/2017-new-subaru-impreza-debut-frankfurt-motor-show/|title=Atvmagblog.com|website=www.atvmagblog.com}}</ref> is a revised version of the FB20 2.0 litre direct-injection boxer-four. This engine is sold in all markets except Europe. A 1.6 litre engine continues to be available in Europe and in the Japanese domestic market. With around 80% of parts revamped, the engine produces 152&nbsp;hp, four more than before. Subaru's Lineartronic CVT was also improved with enhanced ratio coverage, and a 5-speed manual transmission continues to be available. The changes made to the Impreza's 2.0L engine are supposed to offer slightly improved acceleration and flexibility of power delivery. Although the engine is 152&nbsp;hp, some auto reviewers feel that the new Impreza continues to fall short in power when compared to competitors from other brands. Some competing compact sedans such as the [[Volkswagen Jetta]], [[Honda Civic]], and [[Hyundai Elantra]] are sold with optional engines offering 200&nbsp;hp or more. Subaru has rated the new Impreza in the US market <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.atvmagblog.com/2017-new-subaru-impreza-debut-frankfurt-motor-show/ |script-title=th:2017 New Subaru Impreza debut Frankfurt Motor Show |publisher=atvmagblog.com |date=4 July 2017 |accessdate=4 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> (with 2.0L engine) an [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]]-estimated {{convert|28|mpgus}} city /{{convert|38|mpgus}} highway.

In the North American and Australian market models, CarPlay and Android Auto are standard on all trims. The North American model Impreza Limited is also offered with a power driver's seat for the first time in the model's history. Although not present in the North American model, the new Impreza is also the first car ever produced by a Japanese brand to include a pedestrian protection airbag as standard. The new Impreza earned a record high safety score under the Japan [[New Car Assessment Program]]<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.media.subaru-global.com/en/news/2416 |title=All-New Subaru XV and Impreza Win Grand Prix Award in JNCAP Collision Safety Performance Assessment with Highest Score Ever |date=6 April 2017 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref> and earned top safety marks from the [[Euro NCAP]] in 2017.<ref>{{cite press release |url=https://www.media.subaru-global.com/en/news/2527 |title=Subaru XV and Impreza Models Awarded Top Five-Star Rating in 2017 Euro NCAP Safety Test |date=29 November 2017 |publisher=Subaru Corporation |accessdate=1 March 2018}}</ref>\n\nAt the car's introduction in 2016, it won the [[Car of the Year Japan]] Award.

Prior to the introduction of the Impreza into [[World Rally Championship]] racing in 1993, the [[Subaru World Rally Team]] had fielded its larger [[mid-size]] [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]]. However, with the rest of the rally competition increasingly shifting towards smaller and lighter chassis, Subaru introduced the smaller Impreza, immediately achieving a podium on its debut on the 1993 [[1000 Lakes Rally]]. To jumpstart its early rally efforts, and to develop the Impreza into a competitive rally car, Subaru teamed up with preparatory firm and British motorsports company [[Prodrive]], in 1989.\n\nImmediately following the first overall WRC event win for both the fledgling Subaru team and its young driver, the late [[Colin McRae]] aboard a [[Group A]] [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]] on the [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] [[Rally New Zealand]], the [[Scotland|Scotsman]]'s teammate and childhood idol, [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|World Rally Champion]], [[Ari Vatanen]] of Finland, went on to finish second in the debut rally of the first ever factory Impreza. New recruit for the following season, [[1990 World Rally Championship season|1990]] and [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]] World Champion, [[Carlos Sainz]] brought the Impreza its inaugural victory on the [[1994 World Rally Championship season|1994]] [[Acropolis Rally]].\n\nThe Impreza brought [[Subaru]] three consecutive WRC [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|constructors' titles]] ([[1995 World Rally Championship season|1995]]\u2013[[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]], the latter season the first for the newly introduced [[World Rally Car]] class) and a driver's championship for McRae in 1995, the late [[Richard Burns]] in [[2001 World Rally Championship season|2001]], and the Norwegian, [[Petter Solberg]] in [[2003 World Rally Championship season|2003]].\n\nAnother evolution of the Impreza WRC made its debut in the 2007 [[Corona Rally Mexico]].

Mainstream versions have received \"boxer\" [[flat-four engine]]s ranging from 1.5- to 2.5-liters, with the performance-oriented Impreza WRX and WRX STI models uprated with the addition of [[turbocharger]]s. Since the third generation series, some markets have adopted the abbreviated '''Subaru WRX''' name for these high-performance variants. The first three generations of Impreza in North America were also available with an off-road appearance package called the '''Outback Sport'''. For the fourth generation, this appearance package was renamed the '''XV''' ('''Crosstrek''' in North America), and, unlike the Outback Sport (which was exclusive to the North American market), is sold internationally. Colloquially, the car is sometimes referred to as '''Scooby'''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/the-verdict-subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-scooby-doo-what-are-you-1529563.html|title=THE VERDICT SUBARU IMPREZA WRX STI: Scooby doo, what are you?|date=8 February 2005|website=The Independent}}</ref>\n\nThe Impreza (also Impreza WRX and Impreza WRX STI) was a major rival to the [[Mitsubishi Lancer]] (and [[Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution]]).\n\nSubaru has offered both [[front-wheel drive|front-]] and [[four-wheel drive|all-wheel drive]] layouts for the Impreza.

In late 1995, a two-door [[coup\u00e9|coupe]] was introduced. Initial engine choices included 1.5, 1.6, 1.8, and 2.0 liter naturally aspirated engines.\n\nSubaru chose to continue their longstanding use of the [[boxer engine]] in the Impreza. According to Subaru, their configuration of the engine inline with the transmission minimizes body roll due to the lower center of gravity compared with offset engines in most other vehicles. The boxer design provides good vibration mitigation due to the principles of a [[engine balance|balanced engine]] because the movement of each piston is largely countered by a piston in the opposing cylinder bank, eliminating the need for a counter-weighted rotating crankshaft ([[harmonic balancer]]), but with some vibration from offsets. [[Torque steer]] is also reduced with this type of powertrain layout since the front drive shafts are of equal length and weight.\n\n[[File:Subaru Impreza Gravel Express no1.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru Impreza Gravel Express (Japan)]]\n[[File:1st-Subaru-Outback-Sport.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A 2001 Subaru Outback Sport|2001 model year Subaru Outback Sport]]\n\nAt the time of introduction, the Japanese and European market naturally aspirated models (1.6 and 1.8) received an unusual grille with a small central opening. Only the WRX and regular North American models received a conventional \"full\" grille until the 1994 facelift, when the regular models' appearance was brought in line with that of the sporting models.\n\nThe Outback Sport was introduced to North America in 1994 for the 1995 model year as an updated Impreza \"L\" Sports Wagon. It was the top trim level of the Impreza wagon model with no significant mechanical or performance changes from the lower trim levels aside from a slightly lifted suspension. Subaru found some sales success with the Outback Sport as a smaller companion with similar ride height changes, body colors and trim levels to the larger, more successful selling Legacy-based Outback. For the first time, the 2.2-liter engine was used in the American Impreza. Later, the 2.5-liter engine was introduced. In Japan, the Impreza WRX Sports Wagon was offered with a similar approach to the Outback Sport, calling it the \"Impreza Gravel Express\". Subaru discontinued the Gravel Express when the second generation Impreza was introduced due to very limited sales. The hood-scoop found on the American Outback Sport was non-functional but was probably included because the American and Japanese versions were built at the same factory in Japan. The Outback Sport was offered with optional equipment, such as a gauge pack installed on top of the dashboard, that included a digital compass, outside temperature and [[barometer]] or [[altimeter]] readings.\n\nTrim levels were LX, GL and Sport generation. LX models were front-wheel drive, and powered by a 1.6-liter engine. GL trim levels were either front-wheel drive (Subaru badged these 2WD) or all-wheel-drive (badged AWD); cars launched in 1993 had a choice of 1.6- and 1.8-liter [[flat-4]] engines, the 1.6 being available with 2WD, the 1.8 an AWD version only. From 1996, the 1.8-liter versions were dropped (in the European market), and replaced by a 2.0-liter engine. Sport versions had alloy wheels, and a 2.0-liter engine only.\n\nDuring this generation, Subaru offered a limited edition Impreza Sports Wagon called the Casa Blanca,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cardatabase.net/?pid=00079059 |title=CarDatabase.net \u2013 Subaru Impreza Casablanca Wagon |accessdate=6 February 2008 |publisher=CarDatabase.net}}</ref> which had a [[retro]]-inspired front and rear end treatment, which was inspired by the popular [[kei car]] [[Subaru Vivio|Subaru Vivio Bistro]] styling package and [[Subaru Sambar#1990\u20131998|Subaru Sambar Dias Classic]].\n\nThe Impreza received an external facelift for the 1997 model year, followed by an interior redesign in 1998, using the new redesigned dashboard from the Forester.\n\nSubaru of North America initially offered the Impreza with the 1.8-liter engine only, with either front- or all-wheel drive; a 2.2-liter engine became optional for 1995.<ref name=\"cars101.com\">{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Spitz |url=http://www.cars101.com/impreza_archive93_96.html |title=Subaru Impreza 1993\u20131996; options, prices, and more in Seattle |publisher=Cars101.com |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref> For the 1995 model year, the 1.8/EJ18 was available with a 5-speed manual or a 4-speed automatic transmission on the 'base' model only.<ref name=\"cars101.com\"/> The 2.2/EJ22 was only available with an automatic transmission for the L, LX, and Outback Sport trims. The 1995 model year also introduced OBD-II (On-Board Diagnostics version 2) in the EJ22/Automatic transmission equipped models. The 1996 model line-up replaced the base version with the low-content Brighton trim, also used in the Legacy model. A five-speed manual transmission became available with the 2.2 engine on all models, except the Brighton which was only available with the 1.8 and a 5-speed.\n\nSubaru later decided to emphasize all-wheel drive in North America, making it standard on every Impreza (and Legacy) from 1997 onwards. North American markets never received the WRX version of the first generation Impreza. To test the waters for a full-fledged turbocharged model, Subaru showcased a turbocharged Impreza at various car shows around the country. The vehicle was named the 2.5RX and is now located in Subaru of America's Cherry Hill, New Jersey storage facility. Subsequently, the 2.5RS performance model was introduced in 1998 (the same year the 1.8-liter engine was dropped). A naturally aspirated 2.5-liter engine and larger brakes were fitted into the coupe body with gold-colored 16-inch five-spoke alloy wheels. The 2.5RS also featured several external cues from its overseas brethren such as hood vents, a hood scoop, and a rally-inspired rear spoiler. The 2.5/EJ25D (DOHC) used in the 1998 RS suffered from a high-rate of head gasket failures.<ref>{{cite web |first=Joe |last=Spitz |url=http://www.cars101.com/impreza_archive97_98.html |title=Subaru Impreza Archives: 1997\u20131998 |publisher=Cars101.com |accessdate=21 May 2014}}</ref> The 1999 model featured several changes: the newly designed \"Phase II\" [[SOHC]] version of the same 2.5&nbsp;L engine featured a slightly higher peak torque by {{convert|5|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}}, the wheels turned to a standard silver, the interior got an update, and the exterior became visually similar to the Japanese model with an updated front bumper borrowed from the Japanese Version 5 Impreza WRX STI. 2.5RS models became available in sedan form for 2000.\n\n{{gallery | width = 190 | height = 120\n|File:1994 Subaru Sportswagon (GF6) 4WD hatchback (2015-07-03) 01.jpg|1992\u20131994 Subaru Impreza hatchback\n|File:1995 Subaru Impreza (GC5) GX 2WD sedan (2009-03-13).jpg|1994\u20131995 Subaru Impreza GX sedan\n|File:1995 Subaru Impreza (GC5) GX 2WD sedan (2007-12-12).jpg|1994\u20131995 Subaru Impreza GX sedan\n|File:1996 Subaru Impreza (GF3 MY96) LX 2WD hatchback (2015-06-18) 01.jpg|1995\u20131996 Subaru Impreza LX hatchback\n|File:1996 Subaru Impreza (GF3 MY96) LX 2WD hatchback (2015-06-18) 02.jpg|1995\u20131996 Subaru Impreza LX hatchback\n|File:Subaru Impreza two-door -- 09-12-2010.jpg|1997\u20132001 Subaru Impreza coupe\n|File:1995 Subaru Impreza (GF5 MY95) GX 2WD hatchback (2015-07-14) 02.jpg|1995 Subaru Impreza GX hatchback\n|File:2001 Subaru Impreza 2.5 RS 4-dr, front right.jpg|2001 Subaru Impreza 2.5RS sedan\n|File:Subaru Impreza Casa Blanca 001.JPG|Subaru Impreza Casa Blanca\n}}\n\n===WRX===\nThere have been seven noted versions of the WRX dating back from Subaru's original World Rally Cross staging vehicles. Subaru adopted the name \"WRX\" to stand for \"World Rally eXperimental\" as all WRX versions (1992 to present) feature rally inspired technology, including all wheel drive, stiffened suspensions and turbocharged four cylinder engines. The STi versions were marketed with consecutive numbers. Another way to determine the version of a WRX was to look at the chassis code. All WRX sold between 1992 and 2000 have the beginning chassis code of GC8 2/4 door sedan or GF8 hatchback; this is followed by a letter from A to G. Coupe versions share the \"GC\" code with sedans, except in the US, where they have a separate chassis code of \"GM\".\n\nIn 1994, Subaru introduced [[Subaru Tecnica International]] (STi badged) versions of the WRX in Japan. These models were upgraded from the standard WRX in many categories, including blueprinted performance-tuned engines, transmissions, and suspensions. The STi versions of the WRX were immensely successful in rallies and popular among street racers but were only sold in the Japanese market. Compared to the WRX, the STi had mostly mechanical modifications. (STi prepped Subaru rally cars since 1988 including the Legacy RS, the WRX STi Version was just the first car with an actual STi badge, though with handcrafted tuning)\n\n;GC8A (11/1992-9/1993)\nThe WRX debuted in November 1992 with {{convert|240|PS|kW hp|1|abbr=on}}. The center differential was a [[viscous coupling]] type, the rear [[limited slip differential]] was a viscous type. The WRX Type RA is a stripped down version of the WRX that was available in the Japanese market for people to purchase for motorsports and tuning. Targeted for race and rally, the RA versions were generally lighter in weight; featuring reduced soundproofing, manual windows, car horn delete, no air conditioning, no [[anti-lock brakes]], and added racing features such as more robust engines, 5th injection, intercooler water spray and shorter gearing. The WRX Type RA uses a closer ratio gearbox and a three-spoke leather steering wheel from Nardi. The ra model chassis code between GC8-(000000 to 005000) are only sold to the race team by order. Close ratio transmission is anticipated race use, the gap between each gear is brought closer together and a specific close ratio transmission is used.\n\nIn Europe, the WRX was introduced as the Impreza GT, and as the Impreza Turbo 2000 (UK). It came with {{convert|208|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}.\n\n;GC8B (10/1993-8/1994)\nIn October 1993, Subaru introduced the 1994 model year WRX which produced {{convert|240|PS|kW hp|1|abbr=on}}. The rear rotors were substituted from ventilated disk to solid disk. October 1993 was also the start of production of the hatchback version, with {{convert|220|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nThe first STi was known simply as \"WRX STi version\", with 100 per month were produced starting from February 1994. It had {{convert|250|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. This version of the STi was the only version where the standard cars were taken at the end of the assembly line and replaced by STi parts. A STi version of the Type RA was also offered, again with many amenities deleted to reduce weight and cost. Producing {{convert|275|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}, this version of the WRX STi came with a Driver Controlled Center Differential (DCCD). This device was an electromechanical differential that could lock the differential.\n\n;GC8C (9/1994-9/1996)\n[[File:1995 Subaru WRX rear (NZ).jpg|thumb|1995 Subaru Impreza WRX (GC8C)]]\nIn November 1994, the WRX had a power increase to {{convert|260|PS|kW hp|1|abbr=on}}. The wheel diameters were increased to {{convert|16|in|mm}} and brake rotors were both changed to ventilated disks. In Japan, there was a Version of the WRX Sports Wagon with Outback trim, a bull bar and tailgate mounted spare wheel called the \"Impreza Gravel Express\". It was discontinued due to very limited sales. This car is considered the inspiration for the Subaru Forester.\n\nTo commemorate [[Colin McRae]]'s success in the international rally scene, Subaru in the UK released 200 limited edition \"Series McRae\" Turbo 2000's in June 1995, prepared by [[Prodrive]]. These vehicles were finished in a very limited \"Rally Blue\" colour scheme, sported gold 16-inch alloy wheels, McRae decals, individual numbered badging from 1\u2013201 (car 13 was never built since the number 13 is considered unlucky), and a factory-fitted electric tilt/slide sunroof. [[Recaro]] seats were fitted in the front, and the rear seats and side panels were retrimmed in the same Le Mans/Avus material.\n\nThe regular STi's engine output stood at {{convert|275|PS|kW bhp|0|abbr=on}}. The car weighed {{convert|1240|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}} and had gold wheels like those on the World Rally Championship Impreza. Now, the STi was built alongside the WRX on the production lines.\n\n[[File:1995 WRX STI RA GC8.jpg|thumb|1995 Subaru Impreza WRX STI RA]]\nThe 1996 model year WRX debuted in January 1996. The WRX design received minimal mechanical changes, but a WRX V-Limited Edition was introduced to celebrate the success of the Impreza WRC car in the FIA [[World Rally Championship|WRC]]. It was mechanically the same to the WRX but had a curb weight nudge to {{convert|1240|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. The V-limited cars are painted in World Rally Blue. A WRX STi Version II V-Limited edition was also produced. The interior is colored blue on the seat inserts and carpeting. The WRX Type RA STi Version II received a radio and air-conditioning in the V-limited form. 1,000 WRX STi Version II V-limited were produced, with 555 WRX Type RA STi Version II V-limited models produced.\n\n;GC8D (9/1996-9/1997)\nIn September 1996, the WRX was updated with new styling. The WRX now has a power rating of {{convert|280|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and now weighed {{convert|1250|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. Although it actually developed about 300 PS, the output was under-reported at the then-established gentlemen's agreement power limit of 280 PS.\n\nSubaru in the UK released the Turbo 2000 \"Catalunya\" in March 1997, a limited production of 200 cars (again excluding car number 13) in black with red flecks riding on gold alloy wheels. The Catalunya was made to celebrate winning Subaru's [[1996 World Rally Championship|second WRC manufacturer's title]] at the Rally of Spain (Catalunya).\n\nWith GC8D came the start of the coupe version of the WRX. It is called the WRX Type R. The coupe was chosen by [[Prodrive]] for use in the WRC because it was lighter and stiffer than the sedan, although it carried the same exterior dimensions. It was essentially a two-door version of the WRX Type RA meaning it had DCCD, minimal sound insulation, close-gear ratios and hardened gearbox. This car also has a water-spray nozzle to dampen the top of the intercooler. The water will then evaporate, taking heat away from the intercooler and cooling the intake charge. This car was produced on an order-only basis. An estimated 10,000 Type R models were produced for the Japanese Domestic Market. Also, there was a WRX Type RA (sedan) available, with a roof vent instead of map lights, and wind up windows, although electrics are an option from factory.\n\nAlso available was a WRX Type R V-limited. It has a WRX motor with no forged internals like the STI, and it misses out on the four-pot front brakes as they are to be installed by rally teams. It has a roof vent and is lightweight, making a good base for a rally car.\n\n;GC8E (September 1997 to August 1998)\nIn Europe, the Subaru Impreza GT's (Turbo 2000 in UK) interior was updated to leather. For the STi, power remained at 280&nbsp;PS. Forged pistons were also added. The interior and the cockpit were changed into a newer design along with the new white colored gauges. (<- leather was an option and there was no such thing as an EU spec STi.)\n\nFor the UK, the Turbo 2000 \"Terzo\" was released in April 1998. 333 cars in blue with gold alloy wheels were produced to celebrate Subaru's WRC title.\n\n[[File:Subaru Impreza 22B STi-Version.jpg|thumb|Subaru Impreza 22B STI]]\nIn 1998, Subaru of Japan produced a widebody, coupe WRX STi called the \"22B STi\" produced between March and August 1998. The 22B was used to commemorate both Subaru's 40th anniversary as well as the third consecutive manufacturer's title for Subaru in the [[FIA World Rally Championship]]. On the release of the sales, all 400 Japanese units sold out in from 30 minutes to 48 hours, depending on the report.<ref name=\"driveperformancesubaru.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.driveperformancesubaru.com/ |title=Subaru's ''Drive Performance'' Version 3.2 |publisher=Driveperformancesubaru.com |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref> Another 24 were produced for export markets\u201416 for the UK, along with another 5 for Australia, and 3 prototypes. The 16 cars imported to the UK were modified by [[Prodrive]], with longer gear ratios, and UK specification lights. Because 50 22Bs had already been imported privately into the UK, Subaru had to wait until 1999 to register the 16 officially imported cars under the [[Vehicle Certification Agency|VCA's]] Single Vehicle Approval scheme.\n\nThe 22B had the [[Subaru EJ engine#EJ22G|''EJ22G engine'']] (note, the internal Subaru material states the closed-deck block comes from a version III ''EJ20G''). This means the [[Engine displacement|displacement]] was increased from {{cvt|1994|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} to {{cvt|2212|cc|L|1|abbr=on|order=flip}}, bored up to {{cvt|96.9|mm|2|abbr=on}}. Officially, it produced {{convert|280|PS|bhp kW|0|abbr=on}} at 6,000 rpm and {{convert|37|kgm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 3,200 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]], fuel feed by [[Fuel injection#Electronic injection|Electronic Fuel Injection]] and an [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] RHF 5HB [[turbocharger]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.carfolio.com/specifications/models/car/?car=115016|website=carfolio.com|title=1998 Subaru Impreza 22B STi GC8E2SD |date=April 10, 2013|accessdate=July 26, 2018}}</ref> This car was given a unique color of blue and had fender flared widebody taken from the [[Peter Stevens (car designer)|Peter Stevens]] designed WRC car, thus widening the width by 80&nbsp;mm (3.15&nbsp;inches). The car has a unique hood, front and rear fenders, a WRC-inspired front bumper and a unique adjustable rear wing. During assembly, a WRX Type R chassis was taken off the line. The fenders were replaced with the 22B STi fenders. The suspension is provided by [[ThyssenKrupp|Bilstein]], while the brakes were four-pot front/two-pot rear STi calipers, painted red. The wheels were increased in size from the standard WRX Type R STI Version from 16- to 17-inches and the clutch was upgraded to a sintered twin clutch with a ceramic disk. The origin of the name 22B has been debated. The 22 referred to the 2.2-liter displacement and the B was thought to be for the Bilstein suspension. This would correlate with the idea that Subaru sells a Legacy Spec B, where the B represents the Bilstein suspension. However, the B is actually a Subaru internal code for Turbo. 22B is also [[hexadecimal]] for the number 555, in reference to [[State Express 555]], Subaru's major sponsor in the WRC from 1993 to 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a535xyidmF0&t=1m43s|title=Subaru Vintage Garage- 1998 Impreza 22B STI|last=Subaru|date=5 December 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> The car's curb weight is {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0}}.\n\n;GC8F (9/1998-9/1999)\n[[File:1999 Subaru Impreza (MY99) WRX STI Version 5 coupe (23295614974).jpg|thumb|Subaru Impreza (MY99) WRX STI Version 5 coupe]]\n\nMechanically the GC8F was virtually the same as its predecessor. The torque was increased a little from {{convert|242|to|250|lbft|abbr=on}} at 4000 rpm. The weight also continues to increase and is set at {{convert|2800|lb|kg|abbr=on|order=flip}}.\n\n[[File:RB5.jpg|thumb|Subaru Impreza WRX RB5]]\n\nTo celebrate the return of British driver [[Richard Burns]] to the rally team, a limited edition of 444 Turbo 2000 \"RB5\" models in gray were created in 1999 for the UK. The basic model had little more than cosmetic differences, but most had the WR Sport Performance Pack, an option consisting of a new ECU and exhaust for {{convert|240|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|350|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} torque. There was also an optional [[Prodrive]] suspension pack.\n\nThe standard UK Impreza Turbo 2000 was also tuned and partly restyled by [[Prodrive]] in 1999 to create the \"Prodrive WR Sport\". It featured a unique interior, suspension upgrade, new bodykit and wheels, plus WR Sport decals and an optional ECU upgrade.\n\nFor the STI, the power stayed the same as the previous version but the engine layout and design was made cleaner and was dubbed as the \"Boxer Phase 2\" engine. The facelift the rest of the Impreza line had was also applied to the STI. The WRX STI weighed {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}. There were 1000 WRX Type RA STI Version 5 Limited cars and each had a four-month waiting period. The interior was also changed slightly, including seats and steering. This model was also produced as a 555 limited edition.\n\n;GC8G (9/1999-9/2000)\n[[File:1999\u20132000 Subaru Impreza WRX sedan.jpg|thumb|1999\u20132000 Subaru Impreza WRX sedan (GC8G)]]\n\nThe last version of the GC WRX was introduced in September 1999. There is no change in the mechanical specifications. Added features are newly designed alloy wheels, color-coded mirrors and door handles, remote central locking, intermittent wipers with a timer and map lights.\n\nThe European GT model received further upgrades in the form of more parts from the STI range. The front brakes became Subaru branded four-pot calipers with {{convert|294|mm|in|1|abbr=on}} discs, the wheels having become 16-inch lightweight alloys. The STI 4 high-level wing was fitted to the sedan, and STI-style front bucket seats and firmer suspension were also fitted. The \"Phase 2\" engine now fitted developed {{convert|160|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}}, an increase of {{convert|5|kW|PS bhp|0|abbr=on}} over the previous model.\n\nTo counter the grey imports of high-performance Japanese variants, Subaru UK commissioned [[Prodrive]] to produce a limited edition of 1,000 two-door cars in Sonic Blue, called the WRX \"P1\". Released in March 2000, they were taken from the STI Type R lines and used for the P1. The car was the only coupe version of the WRX STI GC chassis to receive ABS. In order to allow for ABS, the DCCD was dropped. Engine output was boosted to {{convert|276|bhp|kW PS|0|abbr=on}}, and the suspension optimised for British roads. Options were available from Subaru consisting of four-piston front brake calipers, electric Recaro seats, 18-inch wheels and a P1 stamped backbox. The P1, or Prodrive One, is echoed in the name of the [[Prodrive P2]] concept car.\n\nLikewise, for the STI, most of the changes were cosmetic with the fender being sculpted to be more aggressive. There were 2,000 WRX STI Version 6 Limited model produced, plus 1000 of the WRX STI Type R coupe Version 6 Limited, 2,000 of the WRX STI RA Version 6 Limited, and also 500 of the WRX STI Version 6 Limited hatchback models.\n\nIn 2000, STI released the WRX STI \"S201\", of which 300 were produced. This series is a limited production series that sports an engine output of 224&nbsp;kW (305 PS) as special variants were excluded from the gentlemen's agreement. The car was decked with nearly every single part from the STI catalogue. The S201 was a sedan that sported the only body-kitted S-series WRX STI. Weighing in at {{convert|1270|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}, the S201 had a tri-planar wing and a massive front air splitter. The entire suspension was composed of STI parts.\n\n=={{anchor|GD|GG|second}} Second generation (2000\u20132007) \u2013 GD, GG==\n{{Infobox automobile\n| name = Second generation\n| image = 2001-2002 Subaru Impreza (GDE MY02) RS sedan (2011-06-15) 01.jpg\n| caption = Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza RS sedan\n| aka = Subaru Outback Sport<br />[[Subaru Impreza (second generation)#Saab 9-2X|Saab 9-2X]] (2005\u20132006)\n| production = 2000\u20132007<br />2001\u20132007 (United States)\n| body_style = 4-door [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan]] (GD)<br />5-door [[wagon]] (GG)\n| engine = 1.5&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ15|EJ15]]'' [[flat-four engine|H4]]<br />1.6&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ16|EJ16]]'' H4<br />2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ20|EJ20]]'' H4<br />2.0&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ20 Turbocharged|EJ20]]'' H4-[[turbocharger|T]]<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ25|EJ25]]'' H4<br />2.5&nbsp;L ''[[Subaru EJ25|EJ25]]'' H4-T\n| transmission = 4-speed [[automatic transmission|automatic]]<br />5-speed [[manual transmission|manual]]<br />6-speed [[List of Subaru transmissions#Six-speed 2|TY856WH3MA/TY856WH4MA/TY856WW6MA]] manual\n| wheelbase={{convert|2525|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| length = {{convert|4415|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| width = Sedan: {{convert|1730|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}<br />Wagon: {{convert|1695|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| height = {{convert|1425|mm|in|1|abbr=on}}\n| weight = {{convert|1360|kg|lb|1|abbr=on}}}}\n{{main|Subaru Impreza (second generation)}}\n\nSubaru introduced the \"New Age\" Impreza to Japan in August 2000.

The coupe body style from the first generation did not reappear for the new series, and the off-road appearance package that included contrasting-colored bumpers did carry over forward. Marketed as a separate model line, this North America-only variant was, as before, badged the [[Subaru Outback|Outback Sport]].\n\nNaturally aspirated flat-four (boxer) engines comprised the 1.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ15|EJ15]]'', the 1.6-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ16|EJ16]]'', the 2.0-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ20|EJ20]]'', and the 2.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ25|EJ25]]''. Turbocharged versions of the 2.0- and 2.5-liter engines were offered in the WRX and WRX STI models. STI models featured a more powerful 2.0-liter (2.5-liter outside of the Japanese market) turbocharged engine. WRX models featured a 2.0-liter turbocharged boxer engine until 2005, after which they switched to the 2.5-liter turbocharged engine.\n\nAt the Australian [[Wheels Car of the Year]], the car won the overall COTY award in 2000.

Initially, the new Impreza was offered as a five-door hatchback (designated ''GH''), with the four-door sedan (designated ''GE'') introduced in 2008. This generation also saw the discontinuation of the wagon, replaced by a new 5-door hatchback body style. The wide-body variants of the hatchback and sedan are labelled ''GR'' and ''GV'', respectively. Dimensionally, this version is wider by {{convert|2.2|in|mm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and increases track by approximately {{convert|1.5|in|mm|0|order=flip}}. Although first adopted by the STI, the wide-body platform was later utilized by the standard WRX range.\n\nThe third series of the Impreza is slightly longer, wider and offers a longer wheelbase. Two Subaru traditions were discontinued with the new model: the parking light switch atop the steering column is no longer present, and for the first time the windows have frames to improve [[noise, vibration, and harshness]] levels.<ref>{{cite news |title=Subaru Impreza |magazine=[[Wheels Magazine]] |date=July 2007 |page=198}}</ref> Subaru made an effort to control the weight of the new chassis. Despite the increase in size, stiffness, and safety equipment, the car's weight is similar to the previous generation. The front suspension uses a [[MacPherson strut]] setup, while the rear features a new [[double wishbone]] suspension.\n\nFlat-four gasoline engines in the naturally aspirated tune comprised a 1.5-liter ''[[EL15]]'' producing {{convert|80|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}, the 2.0-liter ''EJ20'' with {{convert|110|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|196|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}}, and the 2.5-liter ''EJ25'' with {{convert|127|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}}. Turbocharged versions of the two latter engines were fitted to the WRX and WRX STI versions as discussed later. Subaru introduced a flat-four diesel engine, designated ''[[Subaru EE engine|EE20]]'' at the [[2008 Paris Motor Show]]. Sales began in several European countries from early 2009, with the 2.0-liter turbo diesel engine of {{convert|150|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}}. Two models are available as of July 2009, '''2.0 TD''' and '''2.0 TD Sport'''.\n\nIn the Japanese domestic market the range comprised the 1.5-liter 15S, plus the 2.0-liter '''20S''' and turbocharged '''S-GT''', both using the 2.0-liter engine. Japanese dealers retailed the hatchback initially, with the sedan body variant arriving in autumn 2008 as the '''Impreza Anesis'''. This generation represented the first time that the Impreza was no longer in compliance with [[vehicle size class#Japan|Japanese government regulations]] concerning exterior dimensions. Japanese specification models are fitted with an engine start button.\n\nSubaru Australia released the third generation hatchback in September 2007. Naturally aspirated 2.0-liter versions fell under the '''R''', '''RX''' and '''RS''' trims, with the turbocharged 2.5-liter reserved for the WRX. The sedan body style came later in 2008, paralleling the hatchbacks's model range.\n\nNorth America received only the 2.5-liter models. Released to the United States market for the 2008 model year, the model range consists of the '''2.5i''', the turbocharged WRX, and the Outback Sport that Subaru marketed as a separate model line. The naturally aspirated models are electronically limited from surpassing {{convert|190|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. For 2009, a new '''2.5i GT''' trim arrived to the market with the turbocharged {{convert|224|hp|kW PS|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} engine from the 2008 model WRX (this 2009 WRX received a boost in power). While automatic transmission was not available with the WRX, the 2.5i GT did gain an optional four-speed automatic. In the Canadian market, the base Impreza 2.5i received upgrades for the 2009 model year, including rear disc brakes, electronic stability control, and body-colored door handles\u2014features previously only found on the 2.5i Sport and more expensive trims.\n\nIn Israel, the Impreza is denoted as the '''B3''', and three styles are offered: the B3 1.5, with a 1.5-liter engine, the B3 2.0 and the B3 2.0 Sport, both with the 2.0-liter engine. Four-door and five-door models are available for each engine type, ranging from the basic R class, to the medium RX and top RXI class.\n\nIndonesian-specification versions were initially only available as the hatchback style, with the sedan arriving in 2011. The 1.5R and 2.0R could be ordered with a dual-range five-speed manual, or four-speed automatic transmission. However, in Singapore and Thailand, the Impreza 1.5 R, 2.0 R, and 2.5 WRX are also offered as four-door sedan. The WRX STI trim in Singapore, Indonesia and Thailand can be ordered with the dual-range six-speed manual, or five-speed automatic if WRX STI A-Line is available.\n\nSafety of the car has been increased with range wide inclusion of [[electronic stability control]] as standard in many markets. When the [[Insurance Institute for Highway Safety]] (IIHS) in the US crash-tested the five-door Impreza, the organization granted the Impreza the highest ranking available.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=349 |title=IIHS-HLDI: Subaru Impreza |access-date=6 February 2008 |publisher=IIHS.org |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080213130840/http://www.iihs.org/ratings/ratingsbyseries.aspx?id=349 |archive-date=13 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> [[Australasian New Car Assessment Program|ANCAP]] in Australia tested the Impreza where it scored 34.66 out of 37 points, or the full five-star rating in the occupant safety crash test; the Impreza also scored a four-star pedestrian safety test.\n\nThe Impreza range received a facelift in late 2009 for the 2010 model year, gaining a new grille insert.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"120px\">\nFile:2010 Subaru Impreza (GH7 MY11) XV hatchback (2010-10-19) 01.jpg| Subaru Impreza XV hatchback\nFile:Subaru Impreza XV 2.0D AWD rear 20101010.jpg| Subaru Impreza XV hatchback\nFile:3rd Subaru Impreza Outback Sport.jpg| Subaru Outback Sport hatchback\nFile:2010 Subaru Impreza (GH7 MY11) RX hatchback 04.jpg| Interior\n</gallery>\n{{Clear}}\n\n===WRX===\n[[File:08 Subaru WRX hatch front.jpg|thumb|left|Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza hatchback]]\n[[File:08 Subaru WRX hatch rear.jpg|thumb|right|Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza hatchback]]\n[[File:Tino Rossini's Reviews - 038 - 2011 Subaru WRX.jpg|thumb|left|Facelift Subaru Impreza WRX sedan]]\n[[File:2010 Subaru Impreza (GVE MY11) WRX sedan (2010-10-19) 02.jpg|thumb|Facelift Subaru Impreza WRX sedan]]\n\nSubaru debuted the turbocharged WRX performance variant of the third generation series alongside the mainstream naturally aspirated models on 2 April 2007. For this generation, most markets adopted the abbreviated name \"WRX\", although the Japanese, North American and UK markets retained the full \"Subaru Impreza WRX\" title. The 2.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ255|EJ255]]'' engine is largely unchanged internally. Changes in the engine compartment consist primarily of a fourth generation Legacy GT style intake manifold and intercooler. The TD04 turbo remains from the previous generation, however it has been adjusted to fit the new intake design. Power output consists of {{convert|169|kW|hp|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|320|Nm|lbft|0|abbr=on}} from its 2.5-liter engine. It was offered in either a five-speed manual, or 4 speed automatic. The five-speed manual transmission was changed to the same found in the fourth-generation Legacy GT. The rear limited slip differential has been discarded in exchange for the new VDC (Vehicle Dynamics Control) system. The weight of the car also has been reduced and gives the WRX a {{convert|0|to|100|km/h|mph|0|abbr=on}} time of 5.8 seconds. In contrast, curb weight of the standard Impreza model is around {{convert|60|lb|kg|1|order=flip|abbr=on}} heavier. For the US market, the WRX was offered in \"base\", Premium, and Limited trim levels. In Australia, the WRX is available as a sedan or hatchback. An optional premium package adds the satellite navigation with DVD player and 7-inch screen, leather upholstery and a sunroof.\n\nIn response to criticism that the third generation WRX suspension is too soft, and needing to keep on par with rival car companies new releases, Subaru issued several changes in 2008 for the 2009 model year, known in the UK as the WRX-S. The ''EJ255'' engine received an output boost to {{convert|265|hp|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|244|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} of torque by swapping the previous ''TD04'' turbocharger to an [[IHI Corporation|IHI]] ''VF52''. This led to the car now achieving a 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (0\u201397&nbsp;km/h) time of 4.7 seconds, as tested by ''[[Car and Driver]]''.<ref>{{cite web |date=October 22, 2008 |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/reviews/2009-subaru-impreza-wrx-short-take-road-test |title=2009 Subaru Impreza WRX \u2013 Short Take Road Test \u2013 Car Reviews |publisher=Car and Driver |accessdate=24 June 2012}}</ref> In addition, the updated model received altered springs/struts, sway bars, and Dunlop summer tires to improve handling. Exterior cosmetic changes included the 2008 WRX Premium aero package, STi spoiler (Hatchback only), updated grill with WRX badge, and darker Gunmetal colored wheels as standard equipment. Interior changes consisted of aluminum pedals, silver trim around the shifter, red stitching on the shift boot and seats, and a red WRX logo embroidered on the driver and passenger seat.\n\nFurther changes in 2010 for year model 2011 saw the WRX gain the wide-body shell from the STI, as well as the addition of quad muffler tips with diffuser. The new model gains {{convert|33|lb|kg|0|order=flip|abbr=on}}. Firmer rear sub-frame bushings and wider 17-inch wheels contribute to improved traction.\n\n==={{anchor|GR|GV}} WRX STI===\n{{multiple image\n | total_width       = 400\n | align             = \n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            =  ImprezaSTI3rd.jpg\n | caption1          = \n | image2            = Subaru Impreza STI - Flickr - David Villarreal Fern\u00e1ndez (19).jpg\n | caption2          = \n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = center\n | footer            = Pre-facelift Subaru Impreza WRX STI hatchback\n}}\n{{multiple image\n | total_width       = 400\n | align             = \n | caption_align     = center\n | image1            =  11-09-04-iaa-by-RalfR-124.jpg\n | caption1          = \n | image2            = 2011 Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan rear -- 2011 DC.jpg\n | caption2          = \n | footer_background = \n | footer_align      = center\n | footer            = Facelift Subaru Impreza WRX STI sedan\n}}\n\nDebuting at the Tokyo Auto Show in October 2007, WRX STI versions build further on the standard WRX cars. The STI available in Japan is fitted with the 2.0-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ207|EJ207]]'' engine with twin scroll turbocharger generating {{convert|308|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} at 6,500 rpm and {{convert|422|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque at 4,400 rpm. Export markets receive the higher-displacement 2.5-liter ''[[Subaru EJ engine#EJ257|EJ257]]'' unit with the single-scroll ''VF48'' turbocharger rated at {{convert|300|PS|kW|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} and {{convert|407|Nm|lb\u00b7ft|abbr=on}} of torque. The turbocharger directs air through a larger top-mount intercooler which has lost the red \"STI\" that was on previous generations. The STI (3,395&nbsp;lbs) is heavier than the WRX (3,174- 3,240&nbsp;lbs depending on trim) due to a more robust transmission, rear differential and other chassis reinforcements.\n\nLike the standard WRX, the third generation model was shortened to \"Subaru WRX STI\", with the Japanese markets notably abstaining from this convention. To differentiate the STI from the regular WRX, Subaru opted to manufacture the STI with a wider body and therefore track\u2014as noted by the flared wheel arches. Furthermore, Subaru utilized aluminum suspension components for the STI. Electronic modifications include a multi-mode [[electronic stability control]] with \"normal\", \"traction\", and \"off\" modes; Subaru Intelligent-Drive (SI-Drive) with three modes: \"intelligent\", \"sport\", and \"sport sharp\"; and multi-mode driver controlled center differential (DCCD). The DCCD is a combined mechanical and solenoid operated [[limited-slip differential]] which enables the driver to switch between manual and automated centre differential locking. The locking strength can vary from fully open to fully locked <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.motec.com.au/sdc/sdcoverview/ |title=Subaru SDC |publisher=MoTeC |accessdate=12 July 2016}}</ref> with a 40/60 front/rear open torque bias.\n\nThe STI hatchback was released in the United States in March 2008.\n\nA Subaru Impreza WRX STI Group R4 was entered in the 2012 FIA [[Asia-Pacific Rally Championship|Asia-Pacific Rally]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fhi.co.jp/news/12_07_09/12_09_12.html |title=\u5bcc\u58eb\u91cd\u5de5\u696d\u682a\u5f0f\u4f1a\u793e \u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9 |publisher=fhi.co.jp}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010 for the 2011 model year, the WRX STI became available as a four-door. The most noticeable feature on the STI sedan is a large rear spoiler. Australia also received the 2011 model year STI as a sedan to complement the hatchback released in 2008. Australian STIs were offered in standard form, plus the STI spec.R. An electric sunroof, leather upholstery, satellite navigation, and [[BBS Kraftfahrzeugtechnik|BBS]] wheels are standard on the spec.R, while Recaro seats are optional.\n\nA facelift of the STI arrived in 2010 for the 2011 model year, distinguished by a new front bumper. Tweaks to the suspension\u2014stiffer springs, larger anti-roll bars, new pillow ball bushings on the front lower arms, as well as wider standard tires\u2014had the effect of improved handling.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.automoblog.net/2011/07/30/2011-subaru-wrx-sti-review/ |title=2011 Subaru WRX STI Review |publisher=Automoblog.net |date=30 July 2011 |accessdate=3 September 2011}}</ref>\n\n;Subaru WRX STI Takumi (2008)\nIt is a concept vehicle based on the Impreza WRX STI hatchback with upgraded springs and shocks, revised suspension bits, lightweight 12-spoke wheels, undisclosed engine tweaks and a slightly reworked exterior.\n\nThe vehicle was unveiled in Motorsport Japan 2008.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/06/subaru-impreza-wrx-sti-takumi-concept-hints-at-future-spec-c/ |title=Subaru Impreza WRX STI Takumi concept hints at future Spec-C |first=Damon |last=Lavrinc |work=Autoblog}}</ref>\n\n;20th Anniversary Edition WRX STI (2008)\n\nIt is a limited (300 units) version of the Impreza WRX STI hatchback for the Japanese market, with a new set of coilovers with retuned springs and shocks, thicker front and rear anti-roll bars, 18-inch aluminum wheels, white body colour, black lip spoiler, Recaro leather seats with red stitching, a commemorative plaque on the center console, new set of door sills.<ref>{{cite web |last=Lavrinc |first=Damon |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2008/10/23/subaru-releases-jdm-only-20th-anniversary-edition-impreza-wrx-st/ |title=Subaru releases JDM-only 20th Anniversary Edition Impreza WRX STI |publisher=Autoblog.com |date=23 October 2008 |accessdate=1 October 2010}}</ref>\n\n;WRX STI spec C (2009)\nIt is a limited (900 units) version of the Impreza WRX STI for the Japanese market.

The WRX STI 330S includes increased engine power to {{convert|330|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}. The WRX STI 380S includes increased engine power to {{convert|380|PS|kW hp|0|abbr=on}}, new wheels, an upgraded body kit. The vehicles were unveiled at the [[British Motor Show]].\n\nSubaru announced, on 10 September 2008, that the 380S variation would not be produced, due to homologation and specification difficulties. However, the regular 330S model did enter production as the \"WRX STI Type UK\".\n\n;WRX STI R205\nThe R205 was a complete car from STI; the \"R\" signifying the \"road\". Based on the Impreza WRX STI, the model utilised technology developed through STI's participation in the [[24 Hours N\u00fcrburgring]] Race to the full. As the name implies, focus was given to the car's performance on public roads in its development in order to create the best road-going car possible. As for the engine, maximum output was increased to 320PS and the maximum torque to 44.0&nbsp;kg-m by the introduction of such components as a special ball bearing twin scroll turbo. In addition, [[Brembo]] 13-inch discs and calipers were installed on the front and rear brakes. With regard to the exterior, aerodynamic devices including STI front and rear under spoilers were fitted. In order to further enhance the \"flexible yet elegant driving feel\" that STI aims for, a newly developed Flexible Draw Stiffener was installed along with STI dampers/springs and Flexible Tower Bar.

It is now almost exactly the same dimensions as the first and second Subaru Legacy (1990\u20131999). The 2015\u20132016 models had an updated grille, bumper, side mirrors and increased sound deadening.\n\nThe third generation high-performance WRX variants continued in production until new versions were released in early 2014. In 2014, Subaru decided to move away from marketing the WRX and WRX STI under the Impreza name. The WRX and WRX STI are performance trims of the Impreza with higher output engines, firmer suspension, larger brakes, slightly resculpted body panels, lowered ride height and larger intakes. Subaru had promised to completely move the WRX and STi off the Impreza chassis and body to create a standalone model, but they instead chose to simply alter the Impreza's body, and chassis and remove the Impreza name. Subaru decided to not produce a WRX or WRX STi wagon as had been previously offered. The wagon made up approximately 50&nbsp;percent of US WRX and WRX STI sales.<ref>{{cite web |last=Stoklosa |first=Alexander |title=2014 Subaru Spy Photos |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-subaru-wrx-spy-photos-news |work=Car and Driver |accessdate=29 November 2013|date=2012-08-25 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to the regular models, Subaru also offered the '''Impreza Sport''' Hatchback in the Premium and Limited trim levels. The so-called American Impreza Sport (not to be confused with the JDM regular hatchback with the same name) has the rugged style with side spoilers, roof rack, different style alloys, and availability of two-tone colors. However it also has the normal ground clearance, unlike the new XV. For the Premium model grade, buyers can choose 5 speed manual or Lineartronic CVT, while the Limited is only available with CVT.\n\nEyeSight consists of two cameras with one on each side of the interior rear view mirror, that use human like [[stereoscopic]] vision to judge distances and generally keep tabs on the driver. The system can help maintain a safe distance on the highway, a [[lane departure warning system]], a wake up call when traffic lights change, and even keeps an eye out for pedestrians. [[Autonomous cruise control system]] has been integrated into the EyeSight feature as a driver safety aid. This feature is initially available only in Japan, but was expanded to US models of other vehicles, beginning with 2013 Legacy and Outback models.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/03/16/2013-subaru-models-to-see-with-optional-eyesight-safety-system/ |title=2013 Subaru models to see with optional EyeSight safety system |first=John |last=Neff |work=Autoblog}}</ref>\n\n==={{visible anchor|XV / Crosstrek|XV}}===\n{{Main|Subaru Crosstrek#First generation (2012\u20132017) \u2013 GP}}\n[[File:Subaru XV 2.0i-L EyeSight (GP7) interior.JPG|thumb|Interior]]\n\nSubaru demonstrated the Subaru XV concept vehicle in 2011.

This time, the Impreza name was dropped in all markets in which the new model is named simply as the WRX, as had been the case in North America with the previous model, while in Japan it was sold as the WRX S4. The body design also took a stronger departure from the Impreza donor model than in the past. The general WRX profile/silhouette was carried over from the Impreza, as were the front doors, trunk lid, and interior. However, the entire front end bodywork plus the rear quarter panels were unique to the WRX. The rear doors received a subtle reskin with an upwards kink and revised character line, but retained an otherwise identical shape.\n\nThis model is the first of the WRX line to deviate from the ''EJ''-series engine. It uses the new 2.0-liter [[Subaru FA engine|''FA20F'']] engine, which has direct injection and a twin-scroll turbocharger. On all previous WRXs the turbocharger was located near the right-hand side of the firewall, close to the third cylinder. With the new ''FA20F'', Subaru fitted the turbocharger at the front of the car, close to the serpentine accessory belts. There is a robust aluminum skid plate that protects the underside of the turbocharger. Mounting the turbo lower in the engine bay helps reduce the car's center of gravity to {{convert|19.5|in|mm|abbr=on}}.<ref name=Pund2014>{{cite news |last=Pund |first=Daniel |date=September 2014 |url=http://www.caranddriver.com/comparisons/2015-subaru-wrx-vs-2015-volkswagen-gti-final-scoring-performance-data-and-complete-specs-page-4 |title=2015 Subaru WRX |work=[[Car and Driver]] |volume=60 |issue=3 |access-date=15 June 2016}}</ref> The FA20's high compression ratio of 10.6:1 combined with its 68\u00b0 intake and 54\u00b0 exhaust cam phasing range allow it to produce excellent off-boost efficiency as well as a wide torque peak.<ref>{{cite web|title=FA20 DIT Engine Specs|url=http://www.comeanddriveit.com/specs/fa20dit|website=Come and Drive It}}</ref>\n\nBehind the wheel, the most noticeable difference between the EJ and FA engines is the latter's broader torque curve. The 2.5L EJ produced a maximum of {{Convert|240|lbft|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm, while the new 2.0L FA peaks twice as soon ({{Convert|258|lbft|Nm|abbr=on}} at 2,000 rpm).<ref name=Pund2014/> Less obvious is a {{Convert|3|hp|kW|abbr=on}} increase over the old engine; the FA is rated at {{Convert|268|hp|kW|abbr=on}} at 5,600 rpm.<ref name=Pund2014/>\n\nFrom 2009 through 2014 the WRX's engine was mated exclusively to a five-speed manual. That changes for 2015. In base trim, the sole transmission is a six-speed manual, the first ever available in a non-STi WRX while the Limited and Premium trim levels add the option of a continuously variable transmission (CVT) with paddle shifters for the first time.\n\nWhen left in Intelligent mode (the most frugal of its three settings) the CVT returns better fuel economy than the manual. In Sport and Sport# modes it shifts more aggressively, mimicking a six and eight-speed gearbox, respectively, but its acceleration still lags that of the manual transmission.\n\nThe new powertrain gives the 2015 WRX a different character than the car it replaces, but its acceleration times are virtually unchanged. The biggest performance gains come from the 2015 redesigned chassis. Structural stiffness and spring rates are up 40 to 60&nbsp;percent, raising roadholding numbers by about 0.80&nbsp;G.\n\nThe 2015 WRX has been met with mixed reviews by automotive journalists. It placed second to the 2015 Volkswagen GTI in separate comparison tests in the September 2014 issues of ''Car and Driver'' and ''Motor Trend''. In general, it bests its sub-$30,000 competition in nearly every performance metric, but suffers from a cheaper interior and a less comfortable ride. Its sharp styling is usually listed as polarizing, too, although the bulk of criticism in that area is based on the lack of a hatchback model.\n\nPerformance numbers vary from publication to publication. Testing from ''Car and Driver'', ''Road & Track'' and ''Motor Trend'' has produced 0\u201360&nbsp;mph (97&nbsp;km/h) times as fast as 4.8 seconds and as slow as 5.5 seconds. It runs the quarter-mile anywhere from 13.6 sec at {{Convert|102|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} to 14.0 sec at {{Convert|98|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. (CVT-equipped WRXs are about a half-second slower to 60&nbsp;mph and through the quarter-mile.) On the skidpad, roadholding numbers range from 0.92 G to 0.96 G. Braking from {{Convert|70|mph|0|abbr=on}} results in stops as short as 156\u2013166 feet.\n\nIn base trim, the car starts at $27,090 (including destination) and weighs 3,267&nbsp;lbs. Limited and Premium trim levels add more comfort and convenience, such as heated seats and LED headlights, but not more performance. Starting in 2016 the Premium and Limited trim levels also come with 18\" wheels, similar to the last generation STI [[Enkei Corporation|Enkei]] wheels.\n\nFor the 2018 model year, the WRX received some mid-generation improvements. The 2018 model first went on sale at dealerships in summer 2017.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/newsrelease.do?id=1108&mid=171&allImage=1&teaser=subaru-america-announces-pricing-updated-2018-wrx-wrx|title=Subaru U.S. Media Center - SUBARU OF AMERICA ANNOUNCES PRICING ON UPDATED 2018 WRX\u00ae AND WRX STI\u00ae MODELS|website=http://media.subaru.com}}</ref>\n\nA January 2017 announcement<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/newsrelease.do?id=1067&mid=&allImage=1&teaser=subaru-debuts-2018-wrx-wrx-sti-performance-comfort|title=Subaru U.S. Media Center - SUBARU DEBUTS 2018 WRX AND WRX STI WITH PERFORMANCE, COMFORT AND SAFETY UPGRADES|website=http://media.subaru.com}}</ref> presaged improvements that addressed some of the criticism of the 2015 model debut, including a newly revised suspension, revised, upgraded interior materials and a quieter cabin, and a revised front styling. For the WRX, a newly available performance Package option included Recaro front seats with 8-way power driver's seat, improved brake pads, and a moonroof delete to reduce weight. Also new was upgraded EyeSight Driver Assist Technology safety features.\n\nThe 2018 WRX and WRX STI mid-model improvement continued with the 6-speed manual transmission came as standard equipment, and the optional Lineartronic CVT automatic transmission with Intelligent, Sport 6-speed paddle shift emulation and Sport# (pronounced \"Sport Sharp\") 8-speed paddle shift emulation.\n\nThe standard WRX added heated exterior mirrors (already a standard on higher level trims). A new, larger 5.9-inch high-definition multi-function display replaced the older 4.3-inch unit allowing the driver to see vehicle functions more easily. The WRX Premium trim added a larger multimedia audio unit. WRX Limited models added an 8-way power driver's seat with lumbar adjustment.\n\nIn May 2018,<ref name=\"media.subaru.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://media.subaru.com/newsrelease.do?id=1375&mid=171&allImage=1&teaser=subaru-announces-2019-wrx-model-new-subaru-starlink|title=Subaru U.S. Media Center - SUBARU ANNOUNCES 2019 WRX MODEL WITH NEW SUBARU STARLINK IN-VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY AND SERIES.GRAY LIMITED EDITION|website=http://media.subaru.com}}</ref> the 2019 model year WRX and WRX STI was announced. The 2019 model first went on sale at dealerships in the summer of 2018.\n\nExclusive to the USA spec 2019 WRX Premium trim was a limited run of 750 Series Gray cars.<ref name=\"media.subaru.com\"/> The exterior color was Cool Gray Khaki, featuring exclusive black finish WRX 18-inch alloy wheels, Crystal Black Silica badging and foldable exterior mirrors. Other performance upgrades included Jurid high performance front brake pads and a moonroof delete to save weight. The interior front seats were upgraded to ultrasuede covered Recaro seats with an 8-way power feature for the driver. The Series Gray cars received upgraded LED Steering Responsive Headlights, LED fog lights and Keyless Access with Push-Button Start, usually reserved for the upmarket Limited trim WRX models. The WRX STI also received a limited run of 250 Series Gray cars, with similar WRX STI only upgrades. LL Series Gray WRX and WRX STI models were equipped with a 6-speed manual transmissions only.\n\nOf note, for 2019, was the introduction of a new Subaru STARLINK infotainment system integrated with standard with the increasingly popular Apple CarPlay and Android Auto upgrade packages with the optional Harman Kardon entertainment system also increased the infotainment screen size from 6.2 inches to a larger 7.0 inches.\n\nThe 2019 WRX equipped with the optional Lineartronic CVT also came standard with the Subaru EyeSight Driver Assist Technology. On previous models, Eyesight was only available as an option package. Also optional on the CVT equipped WRX was Reverse Automatic Braking, a feature unlikely to be implemented in non-CVT equipped vehicles.\n\n===WRX STI===\n[[File:2015 Subaru WRX STi Type UK Symetrica 2.5 Front.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru WRX STI (Pre-facelift)]]\n[[File:2015 Subaru WRX STi Type UK Symetrica 2.5 Rear.jpg|thumb|right|Subaru WRX STI (Pre-facelift)]]\n[[File:2018 Subaru WRX (VAF MY18) STI sedan (2018-11-29) 01.jpg|thumb|left|Subaru WRX STI (Facelift)]]\n[[File:2018 Subaru WRX (VAF MY18) STI sedan (2018-11-29) 02.jpg|thumb|right|Subaru WRX STI (Facelift)]]\n[[File:Subaru WRX STI (VAB) interior.JPG|thumb|right|Interior]]\nThis model retains the same engine as the previous generation STI, which is a 2.5-liter ''EJ257'' with dual AVCS however with modifications to the ECU which have increased fuel economy slightly, and has given a {{Convert|6|kW|hp|abbr=on}} boost in power to 227&nbsp;kW (305 HP). Torque, however, has dropped from {{Convert|407|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} to {{Convert|394|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm and top speed is now 160&nbsp;mph (258&nbsp;km/h).\n\nThere are also reports that along with the ECU changes, the rev limit was raised to 7,100&nbsp;rpm to support the power increase at the upper rev range to support a stronger top end.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} It also retains a hydraulic power steering system as opposed to the WRX's new electric-assisted rack. The steering rack was changed to a quicker 13:1 ratio, as used in the Japan delivered vehicles, as opposed to the 15:1 ratio of the previous models. Also, the 2.0-liter ''EJ207'' that is standard for Japanese STIs was retained specifically for the Japanese market in the new 2015 WRX STI.\n\nA sound tube device, also seen on the [[Subaru BRZ|BRZ]], has also been fitted to the air intake system to channel certain induction and turbo frequencies into the cabin, reports show this is only fitted to vehicles in some markets.\nIn Europe, Australia, Canada and Japan, the STI is available with and without the wing. Starting in 2016 the US version of the limited STI was also made available with either the traditional high wing or, optionally, with the standard WRX low profile wing.\n\nIn 2013, British rally champion [[Mark Higgins (driver)|Mark Higgins]] lapped the [[Isle of Man TT]] course in 17&nbsp;minutes, 35.139&nbsp;seconds.<ref>{{cite web |last=Burt |first=Matt |date=28 June 2016 |url=http://www.autocar.co.uk/Subaru-Isle-of-Man-video-TT-record-2016 |title=New onboard video: Subaru's record-breaking Isle of Man TT lap |work=[[Autocar (magazine)|Autocar]] |access-date=14 August 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn 2015 Subaru released the WRX STI Launch Edition that came in World Rally Blue Pearl exterior paint combined with gold-painted, 18-inch, BBS alloy wheels. Only 1000 Launch Editions were released in North America.\n\nIn 2015 Subaru released the WRX STI S207, limited to 400 units sold only for the Japanese market. The S207 used the 2 liter EJ20 engine which was tuned to 328 PS (323.5&nbsp;hp, 241&nbsp;kW) and {{Convert|318|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Upgrades also include a quicker-ratio 11-to-1 steering rack (compared to 13-to-1 for the stock unit). STI-spec Recaro front bucket seats, Bilstein adjustable DampMatic II front suspension, and drilled rotors clamped by Brembo monoblock six-piston front calipers and four-pot rear calipers. Up to 200 of the units could be equipped with the NBR Challenge Package, which features a carbon-fibre wing and a badge commemorating Subaru's class victory at the 2015 N\u00fcrburgring 24 Hours.\n\nIn 2016 Subaru released the WRX STI Hyper Blue special edition series, with production limited to 700 units for the United States. The new color covers the outside, and it is also offset with gloss black 18-inch BBS wheels, badges and mirror caps. Blue stitching brings the color into the interior, and Subaru's seven-inch navigation system with a nine-speaker stereo is standard for this version. In Australia, Subaru announced the WRX Premium Hyper Blue special edition with the CVT automatic will be limited to 200 units targeted to customers, and WRX STI Premium with the six-speed gearbox will be limited to just 50 units.\n\nAs a way of celebrating 30 years of the STI nameplate (in 2018), Subaru offered a limited edition WRX STi Diamond Edition which was developed by Subaru Southern Africa's technical team making it exclusively available to the region with only 30 being produced. The WRX STi Diamond Edition is powered by a fettled 2.5-litre, high-boost turbocharged Boxer engine that offers {{convert|260|kW|hp|abbr=on}} at 4,500 rpm and {{convert|464|Nm|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque at 4 000 rpm. The remapping of the Electronic Control Unit and the fitment of a performance exhaust system has contributed to improved performance. A new engine brace has been fitted for better stability and balance. The WRX STi Diamond Edition rides 20mm lower than the standard WRX STi and the body kit, in a High Viz yellow further lowers the front-end by 10&nbsp;mm. The spoiler vane gets a stainless steel STI badge unique to this limited edition model and high gloss black Diamond Edition badges appear on the sides of the rear wing. The WRX STi Diamond Edition rides on 19-inch lightweight and darkened aluminium Y-design alloy wheels.\n\nIn 2017 Subaru released the WRX STI S208, limited to 450 units sold only for the Japanese market. The S208 used a 2-liter EJ20 engine tuned to 329 PS (324.36&nbsp;hp, 242&nbsp;kW) and {{Convert|432|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. It has other upgrades similar to those of the WRX STI S207- a quicker 11:1 ratio steering rack, Bilstein DampMatic II front suspension, Recaro front bucket seats, 19-inch BBS wheels, drilled rotors clamped by Brembo monoblock six-piston front calipers and four-pot rear calipers, intercooler water spray, a torque vectoring system, and more. Up to 350 units could be equipped with the NBR Challenge Package, which features a carbon fibre wing, front lip spoiler, and roof.

In Japan, the new Impreza outsold its monthly sales target of 2,500 units by more than fourfold, with 11,050 orders. According to Subaru, demand from customers in the Japanese domestic market switching from other brands has been notable, representing 51% of all orders. This is an indication that the Impreza is now attracting a wider range of customers in Japan. North American models are now produced for the first time at [[Subaru of Indiana Automotive, Inc.]] in [[Lafayette, Indiana]], while the Crosstrek continues to be produced in Japan.<ref name=\"SIA Impreza production 11/2016 fhi.co.jp\">{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.fhi.co.jp/press/news-en/2016_11_02_3125/ |title=First American-made Impreza rolls off the assembly line in Subaru of Indiana Automotive plant |publisher=Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. |date=2 November 2016 |access-date=17 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170117224018/http://www.fhi.co.jp/press/news-en/2016_11_02_3125/ |archive-date=17 January 2017 |url-status=live }}</ref> Models for markets outside of North America continue to be produced in Japan.

This new platform has an increased rigidity of 70% to 100% over the outgoing model and a lower centre of gravity by 5&nbsp;mm (0.2 inches). 95% of this new Impreza is all-new when compared to the fourth generation. The suspension has been set up for better comfort, while Active Torque Vectoring in some models also helps improve dynamics. The car is longer and wider than the old one, with a longer wheelbase. Much of the increase in wheelbase was used to improve both front- and rear-seat legroom; in the United States, Subaru now boasts that the new Impreza has category-leading passenger room.\n\nPowering the new Subaru Impreza<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.atvmagblog.com/2017-new-subaru-impreza-debut-frankfurt-motor-show/|title=Atvmagblog.com|website=www.atvmagblog.com}}</ref> is a revised version of the FB20 2.0 litre direct-injection boxer-four. This engine is sold in all markets except Europe. A 1.6 litre engine continues to be available in Europe and in the Japanese domestic market. With around 80% of parts revamped, the engine produces 152&nbsp;hp, four more than before. Subaru's Lineartronic CVT was also improved with enhanced ratio coverage, and a 5-speed manual transmission continues to be available. The changes made to the Impreza's 2.0L engine are supposed to offer slightly improved acceleration and flexibility of power delivery.

Prior to the introduction of the Impreza into [[World Rally Championship]] racing in 1993, the [[Subaru World Rally Team]] had fielded its larger [[mid-size]] [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]]. However, with the rest of the rally competition increasingly shifting towards smaller and lighter chassis, Subaru introduced the smaller Impreza, immediately achieving a podium on its debut on the 1993 [[1000 Lakes Rally]]. To jumpstart its early rally efforts, and to develop the Impreza into a competitive rally car, Subaru teamed up with preparatory firm and British motorsports company [[Prodrive]], in 1989.\n\nImmediately following the first overall WRC event win for both the fledgling Subaru team and its young driver, the late [[Colin McRae]] aboard a [[Group A]] [[Subaru Legacy|Legacy]] on the [[1993 World Rally Championship season|1993]] [[Rally New Zealand]], the [[Scotland|Scotsman]]'s teammate and childhood idol, [[1981 World Rally Championship season|1981]] [[List of World Rally Championship Drivers' Champions|World Rally Champion]], [[Ari Vatanen]] of Finland, went on to finish second in the debut rally of the first ever factory Impreza. New recruit for the following season, [[1990 World Rally Championship season|1990]] and [[1992 World Rally Championship season|1992]] World Champion, [[Carlos Sainz]] brought the Impreza its inaugural victory on the [[1994 World Rally Championship season|1994]] [[Acropolis Rally]].\n\nThe Impreza brought [[Subaru]] three consecutive WRC [[List of World Rally Championship Constructors' Champions|constructors' titles]] ([[1995 World Rally Championship season|1995]]\u2013[[1997 World Rally Championship season|1997]], the latter season the first for the newly introduced [[World Rally Car]] class) and a driver's championship for McRae in 1995, the late [[Richard Burns]] in [[2001 World Rally Championship season|2001]], and the Norwegian, [[Petter Solberg]] in [[2003 World Rally Championship season|2003]].\n\nAnother evolution of the Impreza WRC made its debut in the 2007 [[Corona Rally Mexico]]. Unfortunately, the team had several major problems with reliability as the car experienced mechanical difficulties in almost every rally from its first.\n\n[[File:Petter Solberg - 2008 Rally Catalunya.jpg|thumb|[[Petter Solberg|Petter Solberg's]] Subaru Impreza WRC 2008 at the [[2008 Rally Catalunya]]|alt=]]\n\nSubaru debuted an Impreza WRC in hatchback form for the first time from the [[2008 World Rally Championship season|2008]] [[Acropolis Rally]] onwards, on which event Solberg scored a second-place finish.

Merz\u2019s blog has not been updated since 2016 and a ''Lawson Vampire'' book has not been published since 2015. It is unknown whether or not Merz will be continuing the Lawson series, as he has largely gone inactive on his website.
