Produced by The Ink Tank and [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]], the show lasted for 2 seasons and 52 episodes.\n\n== Episode format ==\n: The episode starts off with Spyler (who had a tennis ball head) and CeCe (who looked as though she was made of blocks) trying to find something to do. When they find something, they discover that they need different items. Duck arrives and gives Spyler and CeCe four (or sometimes three) items to find, which she says in a riddle. Spyler and CeCe then start searching for the items. After each item is found they sing their \"Whoop! We Found It!\"  song. Duck appears again and tells them what they have found and what they need to find in riddle. Spyler also calls for Wheeler to take their items home. After all the items are found, Spyler and CeCe do their activity/task. They always find a use for every item.\n\n==Characters==\n\n* '''Spyler''' \u2013 Spyler is one of the main characters in ''I Spy''. He is a [[plasticine]] clay model, similar to Aardman's [[Wallace and Gromit]], with a tennis ball head, red pipe cleaner hair, mini green gloves for hands, an eraser for a body, yellow pipe cleaners for arms and legs, and buttons for feet. In every episode of ''I-Spy'', Spyler and CeCe find four items, except for \"A Broom, a Whistle, and a Drum/\"Sky High\" where they find three items, that are in every riddle that Duck gives, hence beginning to play the game [[I spy]]. The items they find are used for a certain purpose, such as getting rid of CeCe's hiccups in \"I Spy a Tick-illy Hiccup\", or building a robot in \"I Spy a Runaway Robot\". While playing I spy, when they find an item, Spyler and CeCe sing their \"Whoop! We Found It!\" song. Occasionally, when they are carrying different large items and need help doing this, Spyler and CeCe call for Wheeler, their big red dump truck, to carry these items back home.\n:Gender: Male\n:Voiced by: [[Tara Sands]]\n\n* '''CeCe''' \u2013 CeCe is Spyler's best friend and pet dog. Like Spyler, she is made of plasticine clay with orange building blocks and yellow and green paper dots on her. She talks, like Spyler. She has jokes for Spyler when they are around things that are in the game, jokes for when they are around things that are not in the game, jokes for when they are around what they use for a purpose and jokes for when they are around in places where the things in the game are.\n:Gender: Female\n:Voiced by: [[Ellen Lee]]\n\n* '''Duck''' \u2013 Duck is Spyler and Cece's friend. She is a [[rubber duck]] on wheels who gives out things to find for Spyler and Cece.\n:Gender: Female\n:Voiced by: Cindy Creekmore\n\n* '''Wheeler''' \u2013 Wheeler is a big red [[dump truck]]. He is called upon every so often to bring items Spyler and Cece can use for their activity back home.\n:Gender: Male\n:Voiced by: Joanna Ferner\n\n* '''Domino General''' \u2013 Domino General is the leader of the [[Dominos]] who has a white mustache in the front of his face. He talks half indistinctly.\n:Gender: Male\n:Voiced by: Big Al\n\n* '''Mumble Monster''' \u2013 Mumble Monster is a monster that has yellow fur and wears purple, yellow and blue striped socks. He speaks in a mumble voice, hence why he is called the Mumble Monster.\n:Gender: Male\n:Voiced by: Big Al\n\n* '''Silly Knights''' - The [[knights]] are people who wear armor and have shields who live in a sand castle on the beach. They don't get along so much because each one of them thinks he's better than the rest of them, like who is the tallest, who is the best singer, etc.\n:Gender: Males\n:Voiced by Unknown\n\n* '''Polka and Dot''' - Polka and Dot are twin [[ladybug]] sisters. When Spyler and Cece come by, they ask Polka and Dot if they can borrow the missing item after they find it. Polka and Dot say they can't \"borrow\" the item, but they can \"have\" it.\n:Gender: Females\n:Voiced by: Unknown\n\n* '''Clankenspy''' - Clankenspy is a [[robot]] made with a tin can body, a light bulb head, and a red button on the center of him. He was invented by Spyler and Cece in the \"I Spy a Runaway Robot\" to help them clean up a mess they made at the beginning of the episode. He is described as \"strong and fast and nice.\"\n:Gender: Male\n\n== Episode guide ==\n===Season 1===\n#A Mumble Monster Mystery/Cece's Special Scrap Book - (December 14, 2002)\n#A Bike I Like!/A Tick-illy Hiccup - (December 15, 2002)\n#A Broom, a Whistle, and a Drum/Sky High - (December 21, 2002)\n#A Runaway Robot/A Little Lost Lamb - (December 22, 2002)\n#A Starry Sky/Circus Things in Three Rings - (December 28, 2002)\n#A Mumble Monster Picture Day/Clouds Rolled By - (December 29, 2002)\n#A Thing That Flings/Seashells by the Seashore - (January 4, 2003)\n#Home Run Fun/A Race in a High-Flying Place - (January 5, 2003)\n#A Mumble Monster Mid-Day Snack/A Polk-A-Dot Puppet Princess - (January 11, 2003)\n#A Rockin' Bronco/A Wish for a Fish - (January 12, 2003)\n#A Bird I've Heard/A Super Silly Pizza - (January 18, 2003)\n#An Out of Luck Truck/A Kite in Flight - (January 19, 2003)\n#A Campfire Light Night/Freewheelin' Fun - (January 25, 2003)\n\n===Season 2===\n#A Mumble Movie/A Book Wherever I Look - (June 23, 2003)\n#A Surprise Before Your Eyes/Something Nice for the Mice - (July 6, 2003)\n#A Marble Maze Craze/Toys That Roam - (July 13, 2003)\n#A Rhyme Just in Time/A Toe-Tapping Talent Show - (July 20, 2003)\n#Red She Said/One Quick Magic Trick - (July 27, 2003)\n#A Superhero/A Silly Sleepover - (August 3, 2003)\n#The Case of the Missing Truck/Something Really Cool - (August 10, 2003)\n#The Best Car by Far/Something Fit for a Queen - (August 17, 2003)\n#A Very Merry Musical/A Sled up Ahead! - (August 24, 2003)\n#A Rundown Robot/A Game That's Not the Same - (August 31, 2003)\n#A Dinosaur with a Scritch-Scratch Itch/Fun and a Hole-in-One! - (September 7, 2003)\n#A 'Moo' in Act Two/A Train Back on Track - (September 14, 2003)\n#Fun in the Jungle/A Squeeze for a Sneeze - (September 21, 2003)\n\n== External links ==\n* {{IMDb title|0397161|I Spy}}\n\n{{HBONetwork Shows}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:I Spy}}\n[[Category:2000s American animated television series]]\n[[Category:HBO original programming]]\n[[Category:2003 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:2004 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:American preschool education television series]]\n[[Category:American television programs based on children's books]]\n[[Category:American animated television programs featuring anthropomorphic characters]]\n[[Category:Clay animation television series]]\n[[Category:PBS Kids shows]]\n[[Category:HBO Family]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:American stop-motion animated television series]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|I Spy (disambiguation){{!}}I Spy}}\n{{Infobox television\n | show_name = I Spy\n | based_on = [[I Spy (Scholastic)|I Spy]] written by [[Jean Marzollo]] and photographed by [[Walter Wick]]\n | creator = [[Deborah Forte]]<br/>Martha Atwater<br/>Jef Kaminsky<br/>Tish Rabe\n | producer = [[Jean Marzollo]]<br/>[[Walter Wick]]\n | directer =\n | starring = [[Tara Sands]]<br />[[Ellen Lee]]<br />Cindy Creekmore<br />Joanna Ferner<br />Big Al\n | country = United States\n | language = English\n | num_seasons = 1\n | num_episodes = 52 (26 half-hour episodes)\n| executive_producer = [[Deborah Forte]]\n | runtime = 11 minutes\n | company = [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] (2002-2003)<br/>The Ink Tank (2002-2003)<br/>JWL Entertainment Productions (2003)\n | network = [[HBO|HBO Family]]\n | picture_format  = 4:3\n | first_aired = December 14, 2002\n | last_aired = September 21, 2003\n }}\n'''''I Spy''''' is an American [[stop-motion]]/[[claymation]] [[television series]] that aired on the [[HBO Family]] [[digital television|digital]] [[cable television|cable]] [[television channel]] and [[Qubo]] in the [[United States]] from December 14, 2002 to September 21, 2003, based on the popular [[I Spy (book series)|children's book series]] created and written by [[Jean Marzollo]] and [[Walter Wick]].
