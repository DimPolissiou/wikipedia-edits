On receiving the bill he sends Lucy on to the musical they are to attend while he forcefully disputes the liquor charge. He leaves without paying it, his personal force-field allowing him to act in relative impunity. At the theater he finds the frightened Lucy has stood him up, so he invites in a woman off the street. Unimpressed by the show, he throws tomatoes at the performers and then at the ushers when they come to kick him out. Fleeing behind the scenes he swipes a can of green paint from a scenery painter and amuses himself daubing it on half-naked chorus girls; in the ruckus created he escapes the building. Next he steals a policeman's horse for a joy ride. Abandoning it soon after, he ducks pursuit in a barbershop and contemplates more hell-raising.\n\nThe next morning Otterburn is arrested in his home; Lucy, having realized what was going on, has reported him. His laboratory bails him out, and the field-generating device is removed, but Otterburn does not revert to his former self; the effect on his mind, it seems, may be permanent. Reasoning that even in the absence of inhibitions a sense of self-interest will lead him to curb his wild behavior, the lab-workers decide it will be safe to let him go free. For his part, Otterburn is unconcerned, supremely confident in his ability to manage his own life. Quitting his position, he leaves, whistling.\n\nSome time later the altered Otterburn checks in at his former job and reveals he talked the restaurant and theater out of pressing charges, successfully convincing them his escapades were good publicity, and talked himself into a being a salesman for the paint brand he had used, at twice his former engineering salary.

It is the only law school in the [[Tulsa Metropolitan Area]] and [[Northeastern Oklahoma|northeastern Oklahoma]].\n\n== History ==\nThe University of Tulsa College of Law was founded by local attorneys in 1923, during one of Tulsa's oil booms.  The law school was originally known simply as the Tulsa Law School and was independent of the [[University of Tulsa]]. Initially, classes took place in the Central High School building in downtown Tulsa, while the law library was in the Tulsa County courthouse, a few blocks away. The faculty initially consisted of practicing Tulsa attorneys who taught classes at night.<ref name=\"UTCL\">The University of Tulsa College of Law: History of the College of Law.\" Accessed April 25, 2012 [http://www.utulsa.edu/academics/colleges/college-of-law/About%20the%20College%20of%20Law/History%20of%20the%20College%20of%20Law.aspx]</ref>\n\nTulsa Law was formally absorbed by the [[University of Tulsa]] in 1943.

In 1953, the school was accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]. During the 1950s and 60s, the library, classrooms and administrative offices were consolidated at a single location and full-time tenured and tenure-track research faculty were hired. The school became a member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1966. The name of the school was formally changed to the University of Tulsa College of Law.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tulsa Law became increasingly prominent in the field of energy law and policy; during this period, the ''Energy Law Journal'' and the National Energy and Law Policy Institute were established at the law school (NELPI).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tulsa County Bar Association |title=Building Tulsa: Lawyers at Work |date=2003 |publisher=Hawk Publishing |location=Tulsa |page=112 }}</ref> The National Energy Law and Policy Institute was initially led by [[Kent Frizzell]], who had served as Assistant Attorney General of the United States from 1972\u20131973 and Undersecretary of the Department of the Interior from 1975\u20131977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/enrd/kent-frizzell |title=Kent Frizzell (1972\u20131973)| website=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=30 July 2018|date=2015-04-14}}</ref> During this time, Frizzell also taught at Tulsa Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Tulsa Law developed a reputation for strength in legal history, hiring legal historian Bernard Schwartz (formerly of [[New York University Law School]]) and, later, [[Paul Finkelman]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Bernard Schwartz Dies at 74; Legal Scholar and Historian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/us/bernard-schwartz-dies-at-74-legal-scholar-and-historian.html|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=New York Times|date=26 December 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Law School Building==\nTulsa Law moved from downtown Tulsa to its present location on the University of Tulsa's main campus in 1973, where it was housed in what was then named John Rogers Hall. <ref name=\"UTCL\"/> The building was formally dedicated with a speech by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhenquist|first1=William|title=LEGAL EDUCATION: A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW|journal=Tulsa Law Journal|date=1974|volume=10|page=9|url=https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&context=tlr|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2016, the university decided to remove the name of John Rogers from the law school's building, in response to increased controversy about Rogers' role in the founding of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Tulsa in the 1920s.<ref>Laura Bult, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tulsa-law-school-remove-founder-due-kkk-associations-article-1.2626106 \"University of Tulsa law school to remove founder's name after discovering his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan\"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', May 5, 2016.</ref>\n\n== Academic Programs and Offerings ==\nTU College of Law offers [[Juris Doctor]] programs for full-time and part-time students.  TU Law also grants the degree of [[Master of Laws]], or [[LLM]], in the areas of Native American Law, Natural Resources and Energy Law, and International Law for foreign students.  Additionally, the College of Law offers two online Master of Jurisprudence (MJ) degrees in Indian law and energy law. Students  have the ability to obtain joint JD/MA degrees in a variety of fields including, history, English, psychology, as well as a joint [[JD/MBA]], joint JD/[[Master of Science|Masters in]] Taxation]], and joint JD/[[Master of Science|MS]] in geosciences, biological sciences, and finance.  TU Law offers certificate programs in sustainable energy and resources law, Native American law, and health law.\n\nThe College also hosts a number of endowed lecture series which bring renowned scholars and jurists to campus:\n* ''The John W. Hager Distinguished Lecture'' in Law has brought [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[William Eskridge]], [[Michelle Alexander]] and [[Harold Koh]] to speak at the College of Law in recent years.  \n* ''The Buck Colbert Franklin Memorial Civil Rights Lecture'' honors the pioneering attorney and early leader of Tulsa's black community (who was also the father of famed historian [[John Hope Franklin]].

For 2020, ''U.S. News & World Report'' ranked the University of Tulsa College of Law at #87 among all law schools in the United States. It is the only law school in the [[Tulsa Metropolitan Area]] and [[Northeastern Oklahoma|northeastern Oklahoma]].\n\n== History ==\nThe University of Tulsa College of Law was founded by local attorneys in 1923, during one of Tulsa's oil booms.  The law school was originally known simply as the Tulsa Law School and was independent of the [[University of Tulsa]]. Initially, classes took place in the Central High School building in downtown Tulsa, while the law library was in the Tulsa County courthouse, a few blocks away. The faculty initially consisted of practicing Tulsa attorneys who taught classes at night.<ref name=\"UTCL\">The University of Tulsa College of Law: History of the College of Law.\" Accessed April 25, 2012 [http://www.utulsa.edu/academics/colleges/college-of-law/About%20the%20College%20of%20Law/History%20of%20the%20College%20of%20Law.aspx]</ref>\n\nTulsa Law was formally absorbed by the [[University of Tulsa]] in 1943. A pioneering Tulsa attorney named John Rogers is credited with making this association.<ref name=\"TU-History\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |title=.TU website \"History of TU.\" Accessed February 24, 2011 |access-date=March 24, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110317033428/http://www.utulsa.edu/about-TU/HistoryofTU.aspx |archive-date=March 17, 2011 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1949, the school moved into a downtown office building. In 1953, the school was accredited by the [[American Bar Association]]. During the 1950s and 60s, the library, classrooms and administrative offices were consolidated at a single location and full-time tenured and tenure-track research faculty were hired. The school became a member of the Association of American Law Schools in 1966. The name of the school was formally changed to the University of Tulsa College of Law.\n\nIn the late 1970s, Tulsa Law became increasingly prominent in the field of energy law and policy; during this period, the ''Energy Law Journal'' and the National Energy and Law Policy Institute were established at the law school (NELPI).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Tulsa County Bar Association |title=Building Tulsa: Lawyers at Work |date=2003 |publisher=Hawk Publishing |location=Tulsa |page=112 }}</ref> The National Energy Law and Policy Institute was initially led by [[Kent Frizzell]], who had served as Assistant Attorney General of the United States from 1972\u20131973 and Undersecretary of the Department of the Interior from 1975\u20131977.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/enrd/kent-frizzell |title=Kent Frizzell (1972\u20131973)| website=United States Department of Justice |accessdate=30 July 2018|date=2015-04-14}}</ref> During this time, Frizzell also taught at Tulsa Law.\n\nIn the 1990s, Tulsa Law developed a reputation for strength in legal history, hiring legal historian Bernard Schwartz (formerly of [[New York University Law School]]) and, later, [[Paul Finkelman]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Saxon|first1=Wolfgang|title=Bernard Schwartz Dies at 74; Legal Scholar and Historian|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/12/26/us/bernard-schwartz-dies-at-74-legal-scholar-and-historian.html|accessdate=12 December 2017|work=New York Times|date=26 December 1997}}</ref>\n\n==Law School Building==\nTulsa Law moved from downtown Tulsa to its present location on the University of Tulsa's main campus in 1973, where it was housed in what was then named John Rogers Hall. <ref name=\"UTCL\"/> The building was formally dedicated with a speech by U.S. Supreme Court Justice [[William Rehnquist]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhenquist|first1=William|title=LEGAL EDUCATION: A CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW|journal=Tulsa Law Journal|date=1974|volume=10|page=9|url=https://digitalcommons.law.utulsa.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1234&context=tlr|accessdate=24 April 2018}}</ref> \n\nIn May 2016, the university decided to remove the name of John Rogers from the law school's building, in response to increased controversy about Rogers' role in the founding of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in Tulsa in the 1920s.<ref>Laura Bult, [http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tulsa-law-school-remove-founder-due-kkk-associations-article-1.2626106 \"University of Tulsa law school to remove founder's name after discovering his affiliation with the Ku Klux Klan\"], ''[[New York Daily News]]'', May 5, 2016.</ref>\n\n== Academic Programs and Offerings ==\nTU College of Law offers [[Juris Doctor]] programs for full-time and part-time students.

Additionally, the College of Law offers two online Master of Jurisprudence (MJ) degrees in Indian law and energy law. Students  have the ability to obtain joint JD/MA degrees in a variety of fields including, history, English, psychology, as well as a joint [[JD/MBA]], joint JD/[[Master of Science|Masters in]] Taxation]], and joint JD/[[Master of Science|MS]] in geosciences, biological sciences, and finance.  TU Law offers certificate programs in sustainable energy and resources law, Native American law, and health law.\n\nThe College also hosts a number of endowed lecture series which bring renowned scholars and jurists to campus:\n* ''The John W. Hager Distinguished Lecture'' in Law has brought [[Lawrence Lessig]], [[William Eskridge]], [[Michelle Alexander]] and [[Harold Koh]] to speak at the College of Law in recent years.  \n* ''The Buck Colbert Franklin Memorial Civil Rights Lecture'' honors the pioneering attorney and early leader of Tulsa's black community (who was also the father of famed historian [[John Hope Franklin]].

Several video clips from different tapes are recorded to one single tape in the order that they will appear.\n\n*[[Non-linear editing system|Non-linear editing systems]] (NLE) allow video to be edited on computers with specialized software. This process is not destructive to the raw video footage and is done by using programs such as DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.\n\n* [[Offline editing]] is the process by which raw footage is copied from an original source, without affecting the original film stock or video tape. Once the editing is complete, the original media is then re-assembled in the online '''editing''' stage.\n\n* [[Online editing]] is the process of reassembling the edit to full resolution video after an offline edit has been performed. It is done in the final stage of a video production.\n\n* [[Cloud_computing|Cloud-based]] editing is the process of utilising the internet to work with content remotely, collaboratively or of a time-critical nature such as [[Real-time_video_editing|editing of live sports events in real-time]] using video proxies (lower resolution copies) of original material.\n\n* [[Vision mixing]] is used when working within [[live television]] and [[video production]] environments. A vision mixer is used to cut live feed coming from several cameras in real time.\n\n==Background==\nVideo editing is the process of editing segments of motion [[video production]] footage, [[Special effect|special effects]] and sound recordings in the [[post-production]] process. Motion picture [[film editing]] is a predecessor to video editing and, in several ways, video editing simulates motion picture film editing, in theory and the use of [[linear video editing]] and [[video editing software]] on [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear editing systems]] (NLE). Using video, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goal of editing is to manipulate these events to bring the communication closer to the original goal or target. It is a visual art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videouniversity.com/articles/the-art-of-film-and-video-editing-part-1/|title=The Art Of Film And Video Editing Part-1 \u00ab Video University|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=17 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301084719/http://www.videouniversity.com/articles/the-art-of-film-and-video-editing-part-1/|archivedate=1 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nEarly 1950s [[video tape recorder]]s (VTR) were so expensive, and the quality degradation caused by copying was so great, that a [[Quadruplex videotape|2-inch Quadruplex videotape]] was edited by visualizing the recorded track with [[ferrofluid]], cutting it with a [[razor|razor blade]] or [[guillotine]] cutter, and splicing with [[video tape]]. The two pieces of tape to be joined were painted with a solution of extremely fine iron filings suspended in [[carbon tetrachloride]], a toxic and carcinogenic compound. This \"developed\" the magnetic tracks, making them visible when viewed through a [[microscope]] so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task.\n\nImprovements in quality and economy, and the invention of the [[Videocassette recorder#Flying erase heads|flying erase-head]], allowed new video and audio material to be recorded over the material already present on an existing [[magnetic tape]]. This was introduced into the [[linear editing]] technique. If a scene closer to the beginning of the video tape needed to be changed in length, all later scenes would need to be recorded onto the video tape again in [[sequence]]. In addition, sources could be played back simultaneously through a [[vision mixer]] (video switcher) to create more complex transitions between scenes. A popular 1970-80s system for creating these transitions was the U-matic equipment (named for the U-shaped tape path). That system used two tape players and one tape recorder, and edits were done by automatically having the machines back up, then speed up together simultaneously, so that the edit didn't roll or glitch. Later, in the 1980-90's came the smaller beta equipment (named for the B-shaped tape path), and more complex controllers, some of which did the synchronizing electronically.\n\n[[Image:editor in linear suite.png|thumb|right|Editor in linear VCR suite]]\nThere was a transitional analog period using multiple source [[Videocassette recorder|videocassette recorders]] (VCR) with the [[EditDroid]] using [[LaserDisc]] players, but modern NLE systems edit video digitally captured onto a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] from an [[analog video]] or [[digital video]] source. Content is ingested and recorded natively with the appropriate [[codec]] that the video editing software uses to process captured footage. [[High-definition video]] is becoming more popular and can be readily edited using the same video editing software along with related [[motion graphics]] programs. [[Video clips]] are arranged on a timeline, music tracks, titles, [[digital on-screen graphic]]s are added, [[Special effect|special effects]] can be created, and the finished program is \"[[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]\" into a finished video. The video may then be distributed in a variety of ways including [[DVD]], [[Streaming media|web streaming]], [[QuickTime]] Movies, iPod, [[CD-ROM]], or video tape.\n\n==Home video editing==\nLike some other technologies, the cost of video editing has declined over time. The original 2\" Quadruplex system cost so much that many television production facilities could only afford a single unit, and editing was a highly involved process that required special training. In contrast to this, nearly any home computer sold since the year 2000 has the speed and storage capacity to digitize and edit [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV). The two major retail operating systems include basic video editing software - [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iMovie]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Movie Maker]]. Additional options exist, usually as more advanced commercial products. As well as these commercial products, there are [[opensource]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://taleproduction.com/video-production/best-free-video-editing-software/|title=Best free video editing software|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Tale Production|accessdate=25 August 2017}}</ref> video-editing programs. Automatic video editing products have also emerged, opening up video editing to a broader audience of amateurs and reducing the time it takes to edit videos. These exist usually as media storage services, such as [[Google]] with its [[Google Photos]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://support.google.com/photos/answer/6128826?co=GENIE.Platform=Android&hl=en|title=Create movies, animations & collages - Android - Google Photos Help|website=Support.google.com|accessdate=17 October 2017}}</ref> or smaller companies like Vidify.\n\n== Applications ==\n[[File:Social Media Marketing Strategy.jpg|thumb|Video editing can be used to create videos that are then shared on social media.]]\nVideo editing can be used for many purposes such as education, entertainment, and documentation.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mackay|first=Wendy E.|last2=Davenport|first2=Glorianna|date=July 1989|title=Virtual video editing in interactive multimedia applications|url=|journal=Communications of the ACM|volume=32|issue=7|pages=802\u2013810|doi=10.1145/65445.65447}}</ref>\n\n*[[Virtual reality]]\u2014Advancements are being made to help with editing spherical video used in virtual reality settings.

Video editing includes cutting segments (trimming), re-sequencing clips, and adding transitions and other [[Special effects|Special Effects]].<ref name=\"Editing Video\">{{cite web|title=What is video editing?|url=http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/V/video_editing.html|publisher=Webopedia|accessdate=26 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n* [[Linear video editing]] uses [[video tape]] and is edited in a very linear way. Several video clips from different tapes are recorded to one single tape in the order that they will appear.\n\n*[[Non-linear editing system|Non-linear editing systems]] (NLE) allow video to be edited on computers with specialized software. This process is not destructive to the raw video footage and is done by using programs such as DaVinci Resolve, Avid Media Composer, Adobe Premiere Pro and Final Cut Pro.\n\n* [[Offline editing]] is the process by which raw footage is copied from an original source, without affecting the original film stock or video tape. Once the editing is complete, the original media is then re-assembled in the online '''editing''' stage.\n\n* [[Online editing]] is the process of reassembling the edit to full resolution video after an offline edit has been performed. It is done in the final stage of a video production.\n\n* [[Cloud_computing|Cloud-based]] editing is the process of utilising the internet to work with content remotely, collaboratively or of a time-critical nature such as [[Real-time_video_editing|editing of live sports events in real-time]] using video proxies (lower resolution copies) of original material.\n\n* [[Vision mixing]] is used when working within [[live television]] and [[video production]] environments. A vision mixer is used to cut live feed coming from several cameras in real time.\n\n==Background==\nVideo editing is the process of editing segments of motion [[video production]] footage, [[Special effect|special effects]] and sound recordings in the [[post-production]] process. Motion picture [[film editing]] is a predecessor to video editing and, in several ways, video editing simulates motion picture film editing, in theory and the use of [[linear video editing]] and [[video editing software]] on [[Non-linear editing system|non-linear editing systems]] (NLE). Using video, a director can communicate non-fictional and fictional events. The goal of editing is to manipulate these events to bring the communication closer to the original goal or target. It is a visual art.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.videouniversity.com/articles/the-art-of-film-and-video-editing-part-1/|title=The Art Of Film And Video Editing Part-1 \u00ab Video University|date=1 March 2012|accessdate=17 October 2017|url-status=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120301084719/http://www.videouniversity.com/articles/the-art-of-film-and-video-editing-part-1/|archivedate=1 March 2012}}</ref>\n\nEarly 1950s [[video tape recorder]]s (VTR) were so expensive, and the quality degradation caused by copying was so great, that a [[Quadruplex videotape|2-inch Quadruplex videotape]] was edited by visualizing the recorded track with [[ferrofluid]], cutting it with a [[razor|razor blade]] or [[guillotine]] cutter, and splicing with [[video tape]]. The two pieces of tape to be joined were painted with a solution of extremely fine iron filings suspended in [[carbon tetrachloride]], a toxic and carcinogenic compound. This \"developed\" the magnetic tracks, making them visible when viewed through a [[microscope]] so that they could be aligned in a splicer designed for this task.\n\nImprovements in quality and economy, and the invention of the [[Videocassette recorder#Flying erase heads|flying erase-head]], allowed new video and audio material to be recorded over the material already present on an existing [[magnetic tape]]. This was introduced into the [[linear editing]] technique. If a scene closer to the beginning of the video tape needed to be changed in length, all later scenes would need to be recorded onto the video tape again in [[sequence]]. In addition, sources could be played back simultaneously through a [[vision mixer]] (video switcher) to create more complex transitions between scenes. A popular 1970-80s system for creating these transitions was the U-matic equipment (named for the U-shaped tape path). That system used two tape players and one tape recorder, and edits were done by automatically having the machines back up, then speed up together simultaneously, so that the edit didn't roll or glitch. Later, in the 1980-90's came the smaller beta equipment (named for the B-shaped tape path), and more complex controllers, some of which did the synchronizing electronically.\n\n[[Image:editor in linear suite.png|thumb|right|Editor in linear VCR suite]]\nThere was a transitional analog period using multiple source [[Videocassette recorder|videocassette recorders]] (VCR) with the [[EditDroid]] using [[LaserDisc]] players, but modern NLE systems edit video digitally captured onto a [[Hard disk drive|hard drive]] from an [[analog video]] or [[digital video]] source. Content is ingested and recorded natively with the appropriate [[codec]] that the video editing software uses to process captured footage. [[High-definition video]] is becoming more popular and can be readily edited using the same video editing software along with related [[motion graphics]] programs. [[Video clips]] are arranged on a timeline, music tracks, titles, [[digital on-screen graphic]]s are added, [[Special effect|special effects]] can be created, and the finished program is \"[[rendering (computer graphics)|rendered]]\" into a finished video. The video may then be distributed in a variety of ways including [[DVD]], [[Streaming media|web streaming]], [[QuickTime]] Movies, iPod, [[CD-ROM]], or video tape.\n\n==Home video editing==\nLike some other technologies, the cost of video editing has declined over time. The original 2\" Quadruplex system cost so much that many television production facilities could only afford a single unit, and editing was a highly involved process that required special training. In contrast to this, nearly any home computer sold since the year 2000 has the speed and storage capacity to digitize and edit [[standard-definition television]] (SDTV). The two major retail operating systems include basic video editing software - [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[iMovie]] and [[Microsoft]]'s [[Windows Movie Maker]]. Additional options exist, usually as more advanced commercial products.

Automatic video editing products have also emerged, opening up video editing to a broader audience of amateurs and reducing the time it takes to edit videos.

As [[elevation]] increases, there is less overlying atmospheric mass, so that atmospheric pressure decreases with increasing elevation. Pressure measures force per unit area, with [[International System of Units|SI units]] of [[Pascal (unit)|Pascals]] (1 pascal = 1 [[newton (unit)|newton]] per square [[metre]], 1{{nbsp}}N/m<sup>2</sup>). On average, a column of air with a cross-sectional area of 1 square [[centimetre]] (cm<sup>2</sup>), measured from mean (average) [[sea level]] to the top of Earth's atmosphere, has a [[mass]] of about 1.03 [[kilogram]] and exerts a [[force]] or \"weight\" of about 10.1 [[newtons]], resulting in a pressure of 10.1 N/cm<sup>2</sup> or 101{{nbsp}}[[newton (unit)#Commonly seen as kilonewtons|kN]]/m<sup>2</sup> (101 kilopascals, kPa).

This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the [[Internet]]. When [[barometer]]s in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure adjusted to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe ''[[altimeter setting]]'' in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.\n\nAverage ''sea-level pressure'' is {{convert|1013.25|mbar|kPa inHg mmHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. In aviation, weather reports ([[METAR]]), [[QNH]] is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar), except in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Colombia]] where it is reported in [[inches of mercury]] (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report ''sea-level pressure'' SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.<ref>[http://www.flightplanning.navcanada.ca/cgi-bin/Fore-obs/metar.cgi?NoSession=NS_Inconnu&format=dcd&Langue=anglais&Region=can&Stations=CYVR&Location= Sample METAR of CYVR] Nav Canada</ref> However, in Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/weather/s0000635.html |title=Montreal Current Weather |publisher=CBC Montreal, Canada |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: {{convert|1013.2|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}}  is transmitted as 132; {{convert|1000.0|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}} is transmitted as 000; 998.7{{nbsp}}mbar is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest ''sea-level pressure'' on [[Earth]] occurs in [[Siberia]], where the [[Siberian High]] often attains a ''sea-level pressure'' above {{convert|1050|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}, with record highs close to {{convert|1085|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}.

The average pressure at mean sea-level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]) is 1013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (Atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury. \n\nPressure (P), mass (m), and the acceleration due to gravity (g), are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is surface area.

This is the atmospheric pressure normally given in weather reports on radio, television, and newspapers or on the [[Internet]]. When [[barometer]]s in the home are set to match the local weather reports, they measure pressure adjusted to sea level, not the actual local atmospheric pressure.\n\nThe ''[[altimeter setting]]'' in aviation is an atmospheric pressure adjustment.\n\nAverage ''sea-level pressure'' is {{convert|1013.25|mbar|kPa inHg mmHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}. In aviation, weather reports ([[METAR]]), [[QNH]] is transmitted around the world in millibars or hectopascals (1 hectopascal = 1 millibar), except in the [[United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Colombia]] where it is reported in [[inches of mercury]] (to two decimal places). The United States and Canada also report ''sea-level pressure'' SLP, which is adjusted to sea level by a different method, in the remarks section, not in the internationally transmitted part of the code, in hectopascals or millibars.<ref>[http://www.flightplanning.navcanada.ca/cgi-bin/Fore-obs/metar.cgi?NoSession=NS_Inconnu&format=dcd&Langue=anglais&Region=can&Stations=CYVR&Location= Sample METAR of CYVR] Nav Canada</ref> However, in Canada's public weather reports, sea level pressure is instead reported in kilopascals.<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.cbc.ca/montreal/weather/s0000635.html |title=Montreal Current Weather |publisher=CBC Montreal, Canada |accessdate=2014-03-30}}</ref>\n\nIn the US weather code remarks, three digits are all that are transmitted; decimal points and the one or two most significant digits are omitted: {{convert|1013.2|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}}  is transmitted as 132; {{convert|1000.0|mbar|kPa|abbr=on|comma=off}} is transmitted as 000; 998.7{{nbsp}}mbar is transmitted as 987; etc. The highest ''sea-level pressure'' on [[Earth]] occurs in [[Siberia]], where the [[Siberian High]] often attains a ''sea-level pressure'' above {{convert|1050|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}, with record highs close to {{convert|1085|mbar|kPa inHg|abbr=on|comma=off}}.

It is directly proportional to the [[mass]] of air over that location.\n\nFor numerical reasons, atmospheric models such as [[general circulation model]]s (GCMs) usually predict the nondimensional ''[[logarithm]] of surface pressure''.\n\nThe average value of surface pressure on Earth is 985 hPa.<ref name=\"jacobs\">Jacob, Daniel J.

Princeton University Press, 1999.</ref> This is in contrast to mean sea-level pressure, which involves the extrapolation of pressure to sea-level for locations above or below sea-level. The average pressure at mean sea-level ([[Sea Level|MSL]]) in the International Standard Atmosphere ([[International Standard Atmosphere|ISA]]) is 1013.25 hPa, or 1 atmosphere (Atm), or 29.92 inches of mercury. \n\nPressure (P), mass (m), and the acceleration due to gravity (g), are related by P = F/A = (m*g)/A, where A is surface area. Atmospheric pressure is thus proportional to the weight per unit area of the atmospheric mass above that location.\n\n== Altitude variation ==\n{{further|Barometric formula|Vertical pressure variation}}\n[[File:Storm over Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull.jpg|thumb|left|A very local storm above [[Sn\u00e6fellsj\u00f6kull]], showing clouds formed on the mountain by [[orographic lift]]]]\n[[File:Atmospheric Pressure vs. Altitude.png|thumb|300px|Variation in atmospheric pressure with altitude, computed for 15&nbsp;\u00b0C and 0% relative humidity.]]\n[[File:Plastic bottle at 14000 feet, 9000 feet and 1000 feet, sealed at 14000 feet.png|thumb|This plastic bottle was sealed at approximately {{convert|14000|ft|m}} altitude, and was crushed by the increase in atmospheric pressure, recorded at {{convert|9000|ft|m}} and {{convert|1000|ft|m}}, as it was brought down towards sea level.]]\n\nPressure on Earth varies with the altitude of the surface; so air pressure on mountains is usually lower than air pressure at sea level. Pressure varies smoothly from the Earth's surface to the top of the [[mesosphere]]. Although the pressure changes with the weather, NASA has averaged the conditions for all parts of the earth year-round. As altitude increases, atmospheric pressure decreases. One can calculate the atmospheric pressure at a given altitude.<ref>[http://archive.psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf A quick derivation relating altitude to air pressure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928003908/http://psas.pdx.edu/RocketScience/PressureAltitude_Derived.pdf |date=2011-09-28 }} by Portland State Aerospace Society, 2004, accessed 05032011</ref> Temperature and humidity also affect the atmospheric pressure, and it is necessary to know these to compute an accurate figure.

This method became and continues to be useful for survey work and map making.<ref>Hewitt, Rachel, ''Map of a Nation \u2013 a Biography of the Ordnance Survey'' {{ISBN|1-84708-098-7}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Underwater diving}}\n{{Div col}}\n* {{annotated link|Atmosphere (unit)}}\n* {{annotated link|Atmospheric density}}\n* {{annotated link|Atmosphere of Earth}}\n* {{annotated link|Barometric formula}}\n* {{annotated link|Barotrauma}} \u2013 physical damage to body tissues caused by a difference in pressure between an air space inside or beside the body and the surrounding gas or liquid.\n* {{annotated link|Cabin pressurization}}\n* {{annotated link|Effects of high altitude on humans}}\n* {{annotated link|High-pressure area}}\n* {{annotated link|International Standard Atmosphere}}, a tabulation of typical variation of principal thermodynamic variables of the atmosphere (pressure, density, temperature, etc.) with altitude, at middle latitudes.\n* {{annotated link|Low-pressure area}}\n* [[Meteorology]]\n* {{annotated link|NRLMSISE-00}}\n* {{annotated link|Plenum chamber}}\n* {{annotated link|Pressure}}\n* [[Pressure measurement]]\n* {{annotated link|Subtropical ridge}}\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20060513194709/http://modelweb.gsfc.nasa.gov/atmos/us_standard.html 1976 Standard Atmosphere] from [[NASA]]\n*[http://www.pdas.com/atmos.html Source code and equations for the 1976 Standard Atmosphere]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20070310223946/http://www.atmosculator.com/The%20Standard%20Atmosphere.html A mathematical model of the 1976 U.S. Standard Atmosphere]\n*[http://www.luizmonteiro.com/StdAtm.aspx Calculator using multiple units and properties for the 1976 Standard Atmosphere]\n*[http://www.csgnetwork.com/pressurealtcalc.html Calculator giving standard air pressure at a specified altitude, or altitude at which a pressure would be standard]\n*[https://earth.nullschool.net/#current/wind/surface/level/overlay=mean_sea_level_pressure/winkel3 Current map of global mean sea-level pressure]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090917043907/http://www.newbyte.co.il/calc.html Atmospheric calculator and Geometric to Pressure altitude converter]\n\n=== Experiments ===\n*[http://hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu/hbase/kinetic/patm.html#atm Movies on atmospheric pressure experiments from] [[Georgia State University]]'s [[QuickTime|HyperPhysics website&nbsp;\u2013 requires QuickTime]]\n*[http://www.teachertube.com/viewVideo.php?video_id=62613 Test showing a can being crushed after boiling water inside it, then moving it into a tub of ice cold water.]\n\n{{Meteorological variables}}\n{{Underwater diving}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:Atmosphere]]\n[[Category:Atmospheric thermodynamics]]\n[[Category:Pressure]]\n[[Category:Underwater diving physics]]\n", "name_user": "92.3.192.192", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(spelling changes)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmospheric_pressure"}
