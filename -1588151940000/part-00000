With a desire to play heavier music similar to that of [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] and [[Grand Funk Railroad]], the rest of the band parted with Galligan and founded Cirith Ungol in late 1971.\n\n===Early history===\nAfter forming in late 1971, the band played their first gig on January 1, 1972 at an anti-Vietnam war peace rally.\n\nIn 1980, they were signed by Liquid Flames Records, and released their first album, ''[[Frost and Fire (album)|Frost and Fire]]'', with Tim Baker on vocals and songs written by bassist and guitarist Greg Lindstrom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Cirith-Ungol-Frost-And-Fire/release/1332428 |website=Discogs.com|title=Frost and Fire}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[King of the Dead (album)|King of the Dead]]'' was released in on July 2, 1984 and contained lyrics primarily written by vocalist Tim Baker and drummer Robert Garven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darklyrics.com/c/cirithungol.html |website=Darklyrics.com|title=Cirith Ungol}}</ref> The album was then followed by ''[[One Foot in Hell]]'' on August 12, 1986, and ''[[Paradise Lost (Cirith Ungol album)|Paradise Lost]]'' on August 23, 1991.\n\n===Disbandment===\nThey played their last live show on December 13, 1991 and disbanded in 1992, following frustration with their record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.org/cirithungol/page.php?page_id=150 |website=Truemetal.org|title=Cirith Ungol Comeback}}</ref>\n\n===1992\u20132016===\nIn 2001, [[Metal Blade Records]] released in Germany ''Servants of Chaos'', a compilation album of unreleased demos and live songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhead.it/?p=2692 |website=Metalhead.it|title=Cirith Ungol}}</ref> With old tapes and assistance from Lindstrom and Garven, it was an attempt to give fans a wealth of archival and previously unheard material before the tapes deteriorated beyond retrieval.

He would always turn us on to the great writers who gave us inspiration for our music. We read all the books... [[Conan The Barbarian|Conan]], [[Bran Mak Morn]], etcetera, but the books that stood out in my mind are [[Michael Moorcock]]'s masterpieces: [[Elric]], [[Hawkmoon]], [[Corum Jhaelen Irsei|Corum]] among others. Greg Lindstrom and I met at an English Literature class where the teacher was reading Lord of the Rings... and Greg and I read it and it had an influence on our music and feelings. In retrospect I wish we had picked something easier to remember because a lot of our trouble has been over our name. People couldn't pronounce it or remember it, but we figured once they did they wouldn't forget it! We've humorously been called \"Sarah's Uncle\" and \"Serious Uncool,\" for example! I know other bands are using the Tolkien angle. Led Zeppelin even made references to it in their earlier songs.

With a desire to play heavier music similar to that of [[Mountain (band)|Mountain]] and [[Grand Funk Railroad]], the rest of the band parted with Galligan and founded Cirith Ungol in late 1971.\n\n===Early history===\nAfter forming in late 1971, the band played their first gig on January 1, 1972 at an anti-Vietnam war peace rally.\n\nIn 1980, they were signed by Liquid Flames Records, and released their first album, ''[[Frost and Fire (album)|Frost and Fire]]'', with Tim Baker on vocals and songs written by bassist and guitarist Greg Lindstrom.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/Cirith-Ungol-Frost-And-Fire/release/1332428 |website=Discogs.com|title=Frost and Fire}}</ref> Their second album, ''[[King of the Dead (album)|King of the Dead]]'' was released in on July 2, 1984 and contained lyrics primarily written by vocalist Tim Baker and drummer Robert Garven.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.darklyrics.com/c/cirithungol.html |website=Darklyrics.com|title=Cirith Ungol}}</ref> The album was then followed by ''[[One Foot in Hell]]'' on August 12, 1986, and ''[[Paradise Lost (Cirith Ungol album)|Paradise Lost]]'' on August 23, 1991.\n\n===Disbandment===\nThey played their last live show on December 13, 1991 and disbanded in 1992, following frustration with their record label.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.org/cirithungol/page.php?page_id=150 |website=Truemetal.org|title=Cirith Ungol Comeback}}</ref>\n\n===1992\u20132016===\nIn 2001, [[Metal Blade Records]] released in Germany ''Servants of Chaos'', a compilation album of unreleased demos and live songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metalhead.it/?p=2692 |website=Metalhead.it|title=Cirith Ungol}}</ref> With old tapes and assistance from Lindstrom and Garven, it was an attempt to give fans a wealth of archival and previously unheard material before the tapes deteriorated beyond retrieval. This double-CD was later re-released worldwide, with a rare 1984 live DVD recorded at [[Reseda Country Club|Wolf & Rissmiller's Country Club]] in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.truemetal.org/cirithungol/page.php?page_id=157 |website=Truemetal.org|title=Cirith Ungol}}</ref>\n\nLindstrom now plays with Falcon, who perform some Cirith Ungol songs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.falconband.net/falconbio.htm|title=Falcon Bio|website=Falconband.net|accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref>\n\nFounding guitarist Jerry Fogle died from liver failure on August 20, 1998.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.metal-archives.com/artists/Jerry_Fogle/10836 |website=Metal-archives.com|title=Jerry Fogle}}</ref>\n\n===Reunion===\nThe band was reformed by members Tim Baker, Robert Garven, Jim Barraza, and Greg Lindstrom on October 8, 2016 at the 2nd annual [[Frost and Fire Festival]] in [[Ventura, California]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://nightdemon.net/frost-and-fire |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-10-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101145418/http://nightdemon.net/frost-and-fire |archive-date=2015-11-01 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Throughout 2017, the band had set out to headline and co-headline several European and US festivals, including Keep It True (Germany), Up The Hammers (Greece), Defenders Of The Old (US), Chaos Descends (Germany), Psycho Las Vegas (US), Days Of Darkness (US) and Hammer of Doom (Germany).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/cirithungolofficial/|title=Cirith Ungol|website=Facebook.com|accessdate=28 September 2018}}</ref> In April 2018, Cirith Ungol performed at the Hell's Heroes Festival in Houston, Texas and at the NYDM Spring Bash in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. In August 2018, Cirith Ungol released the single \"Witch's Game\".\n\n==Name==\nThe band took their name from the mountain pass [[Cirith Ungol]] in [[J. R. R.

He would always turn us on to the great writers who gave us inspiration for our music. We read all the books... [[Conan The Barbarian|Conan]], [[Bran Mak Morn]], etcetera, but the books that stood out in my mind are [[Michael Moorcock]]'s masterpieces: [[Elric]], [[Hawkmoon]], [[Corum Jhaelen Irsei|Corum]] among others. Greg Lindstrom and I met at an English Literature class where the teacher was reading Lord of the Rings... and Greg and I read it and it had an influence on our music and feelings. In retrospect I wish we had picked something easier to remember because a lot of our trouble has been over our name. People couldn't pronounce it or remember it, but we figured once they did they wouldn't forget it! We've humorously been called \"Sarah's Uncle\" and \"Serious Uncool,\" for example! I know other bands are using the Tolkien angle. Led Zeppelin even made references to it in their earlier songs.

In the NBA, a suit or a [[sport coat]] is required for coaches,<ref name=ESPN /> as well as a [[necktie]].\n\n==Supporting arguments==\nThe league's image was in bad shape following the [[Pacers\u2013Pistons brawl]] in 2004.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=1927380 |title=Artest, Jackson charge Palace stands - NBA - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2004-11-21 |accessdate=2012-08-22}}</ref> Supporters also claim that most [[business]]es require their employees to adhere to a dress code of some kind so the NBA is not making any unusual demands. Moreover, the NBA was not requiring players to wear a suit and tie, as had been rumored initially. Further, many NBA teams already had dress codes, as dictated by coaches or general managers. Penalties for non-compliance usually involved fines such as having to pay for one's own airfare to wherever the team was going, rather than flying on the team charter.\n\n==Opposing arguments==\nCritics such as [[Allen Iverson]], [[Stephen Jackson]] and [[Paul Pierce]] claim that the dress code will not change a person's [[moral character|character]] regardless of what type of clothing they wear, and that associating hip-hop style of dress with [[crime]] or a bad image is [[Racism|racist]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nba/news/story?id=2198089 | title=Richardson says dress code targets black players | publisher=[[ESPN]].com | work=[[Associated Press]] | date=October 19, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url=http://seattletimes.com/html/sports/2002571873_nba20.html | title=NBA notebook: Dress code targets blacks, says Jackson | newspaper=[[Seattle Times]] | date=October 20, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014}}</ref> Iverson was also quoted to say, \"the dress code is not who I am and doesn't allow me to express myself.\"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/490598-allen-iverson-last-of-a-dying-breed | title=Allen Iverson: Last of a Dying Breed | website=[[Bleacher Report]] | date=October 13, 2010 | accessdate=February 1, 2014 | author=Sawyer, Jameel}}</ref>\n\nMany NBA and non-NBA sports figures also claim that it targets young black males and is a slap against [[hip-hop culture]].<ref>{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/10/22/AR2005102201386.html | title=Opinions on the NBA's Dress Code Are Far From Uniform | newspaper=[[Washington Post]] | date=October 23, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014 | author=Wise, Mike}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/phil_taylor/10/12/taylor1012/index.html | title=Balancing act | publisher=[[SI.com]] | date=October 12, 2005 | accessdate=February 1, 2014 | author=Taylor, Phil}}</ref> Most NBA players are sponsored by casual wear brands such as [[Nike Inc.|Nike]], [[Adidas]], [[Puma SE|Puma]] and [[Converse (shoe company)|Converse]].\n\n==Impact==\n\nWriting for ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', Zack Graham said that although players were initially critical of the dress code, \"Over the years, NBA players accepted, then embraced and eventually began to have fun with the new dress code, changing men's fashion in the process.\"<ref>{{cite magazine | url = https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/features/david-sterns-nba-dress-code-legacy-w448591 | title = How David Stern's NBA Dress Code Changed Men's Fashion | date= 4 November 2016 | accessdate = 7 November 2016 | magazine = Rolling Stone | author = Zack Graham}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.webcitation.org/610UC75Il?url=http://www.nba.com/home/index.html NBA Dress Code specifics at NBA.com]\n\n{{NBA}}\n\n[[Category:National Basketball Association controversies|Dress code]]\n[[Category:National Basketball Association labor relations|Dress code]]\n[[Category:Clothing controversies]]\n[[Category:African-American-related controversies]]\n[[Category:Workwear]]\n[[Category:Casual wear]]\n\n[[it:National Basketball Association#Codice di abbigliamento]]\n", "name_user": "Mrschimpf", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDetails of the dress code", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NBA_dress_code"}
