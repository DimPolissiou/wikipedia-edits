V-ATPases are multiprotein complexes composed of two functional domains, a V<small>0</small> domain, and a V<small>1</small> domain. The V<small>1</small> domain catalyzes the [[hydrolysis]] of ATP in order to power the pumping of protons through the V<small>0</small> channel, which spans the lipid bilayer of endosomal compartments.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\">Guillard, Mailys, et al. \"Vacuolar H+-ATPase meets glycosylation in patients with cutis laxa.\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Basis of Disease 1792.9 (2009): 903-914.</ref> Vacuolar ATPases are also localized within the plasma membrane of both renal cells and osteoclasts.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> In osteoclasts, V-ATPases are required for pumping protons onto the bone surface. The protons are then used for [[bone resorption]]. In renal cells, V-ATPases are used to pump protons into the urine. This facilitates bicarbonate reabsorption into the blood. The ''ATP6V0A2'' gene encodes the a2 [[isoform]] of the a-subunit (present in the V<small>0</small> domain).<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The a2 subunit anchors the V-ATPase to the membrane, and it is also directly involved with proton transport.<ref name=\"doi.org\">Morava, E., Guillard, M., Lefeber, D. J., & Wevers, R. A. (2009). Autosomal recessive cutis laxa syndrome revisited. European journal of human genetics: EJHG, 17(9), 1099\u20131110. https://doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2009.22</ref> ATP6V0A2 is encoded by the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene. The ATP6V0A2 pump is found in virtually all cells and is thought to play an important role in the process of vesicular fusion in the secretory pathway, including the secretion of [[extracellular matrix]] components.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/>\n\n=== The Function of the Golgi Apparatus in Protein Maturation ===\nThe most important subcellular structure in the context of wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS), is the [[Golgi apparatus]]. The Golgi apparatus is an important part of the endomembrane system because it processes proteins and lipids prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane and/or secretion into the extracellular environment. The Golgi is organized into a polarized series of membrane-bound stacks, called cisternae, through which proteins are trafficked in sequence once they leave the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), where the proteins and lipids are synthesized. Proteins destined for secretion or delivery to the plasma membrane arrive first at the cis-Golgi, before being trafficked through the medial and trans-Golgi.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\">Udono, Miyako, et al. \"Impaired ATP6V0A2 expression contributes to Golgi dispersion and glycosylation changes in senescent cells.\" Scientific Reports 5 (2015): 17342.</ref> In the Golgi, proteins undergo extensive [[post-translational modifications]] (PTMs). In the context of WSS, the most significant  PTM events are the [[glycosylation]] of proteins comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM) of epidermal cells. The two types of glycosylation events in the Golgi are [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]].<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\">Rosnoblet, C., Peanne, R., Legrand, D. et al. Glycosylation disorders of membrane trafficking. Glycoconj J 30, 23\u201331 (2013). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10719-012-9389-y</ref> Glycosylation of proteins destined for secretion occurs through the forward movement of proteins throughout the Golgi apparatus. The proteins destined for secretion are then trafficked to the plasma membrane in secretory vesicles. Retrograde (backward) transport in the Golgi apparatus is also important. In order to retain the enzymes responsible for protein glycosylation in the correct regions of the Golgi, there must be retrograde transport of these enzymes back into the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> In addition, retrograde transport serves a quality control function, by shuttling misfolded proteins back into the ER or retaining them within the Golgi itself until proper protein folding and maturation is completed.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> The activity of protein-modifying enzymes, like [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycosidases]], relies on the lumenal pH of the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> Cisternal pH becomes increasingly acidic (lower pH) with progression from cis- to trans- regions of the Golgi.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> Disruption of decreasing pH can impart significant effects on the efficiency and sequence of glycosylation events.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> Maintenance of the pH gradient across the Golgi is instrumental for proper post-translational modification of proteins prior to secretion. Retrograde transport and pH regulation are therefore vital to the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/>\n\n=== Genetic Causes of WSS ===\nPatients with both [[missense]] and/or [[nonsense]] mutations of the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene have been shown to phenotypically express wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS) or autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II (ARCL II) (another cutis laxa disorder).<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> Some consider WSS to be a milder variant of ARCL II, but the genetic causes of WSS are not yet known.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> A large number of patients with WSS and ARCL II show a loss-of-function in the a2-subunit.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> These mutations in ''ATP6V0A2'' are associated with defective glycan biosynthesis and defective Golgi apparatus structure.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\"/> However, the exact mechanism of how mutations in the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene lead to these effects is unclear.\n\n=== Aberrant Golgi Functioning and Clinical Symptoms of WSS ===\nWSS is characterized by defects in the elastic fiber system that comprises the extracellular matrix of epidermal cells.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The skin\u2019s elastic fiber system consists of [[elastin]] (which is normally non-glycosylated) and glycosylated proteins ([[fibulin]], [[fibronectin]], and [[collagen]]). It is speculated that either abnormal glycosylation and/or impaired secretion of proteins caused by ATP6V0A2 dysfunction lead to WSS.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The ATP6V0A2 pump is highly expressed within the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\"/> ATP6V0A2 is primarily found within the medial-Golgi and the trans-Golgi. ATP6V0A2 acidifies the medial- and trans-Golgi so that their resident enzymes (e.g. glycosidases and glycosyltransferases) function properly<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\"/>.. Therefore, mutations in the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene reduce the ability of ATP6V0A2 to produce the necessary pH gradient for these glycosylation enzymes, which results in abnormal N- and O-linked glycosylation. Because the physical properties of skin rely heavily on the structural proteins of the elastic fiber system of epidermal cells, abnormal glycosylation can lead to structural defects in the elastic fibers, and therefore lead to the inelastic skin seen in WSS. WSS patients may also have defective secretion of another ECM component of the skin called tropoelastin.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\">Hucthagowder V, Morava E, Kornak U, et al. Loss-of-function mutations in ATP6V0A2 impair vesicular trafficking, tropoelastin secretion and cell survival. Hum Mol Genet. 2009;18(12):2149\u20132165. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddp148</ref> The process of secreting tropoelastin from the cell is dependent on the acidic pH of vesicles.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> It is thought that increased pH levels (lower acidity) lead to the premature aggregation (coacervation) of tropoelastin inside the vesicle.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> The process of coacervation is thought to be essential for proper elastin assembly in the ECM.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> Coacervation must occur outside of the cell within the ECM ( the ECM has a more alkaline environment than the vesicle) for proper elastic fiber assembly.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> However, defective ATP6V0A2 pumps in the vesicle increase the lumenal pH of the vesicle, leading to premature coacervation and defective elastic fiber assembly.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> The abnormal assembly and glycosylation of proteins used to make elastic fibers explains the connective tissue phenotypes associated with ARCL2 and WSS but does not explain the neurodevelopmental disorders or growth defects of these patients (18). Elastin is not required for brain or bone growth.<ref>Hucthagowder V, Morava E, Kornak U, et al.

Hum Mol Genet. 2009;18(12):2149\u20132165. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddp148</ref> However, it is believed that abnormal/impaired secretion of the brain and bone-specific ECM proteins caused by dysregulation of Golgi acidification is what leads to the neural and skeletal defects in ARCL2.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/>\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAs of January 2020, only ~ 30 cases of Wrinkly Skin Syndrome have been reported.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Education_Home.php?lng=EN|title=Orphanet: Reports|website=www.orpha.net|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> The majority of reported cases have come from Middle Eastern regions such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Oman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omim.org/entry/278250|title=OMIM Entry - # 278250 - WRINKLY SKIN SYNDROME;

V-ATPases are multiprotein complexes composed of two functional domains, a V<small>0</small> domain, and a V<small>1</small> domain. The V<small>1</small> domain catalyzes the [[hydrolysis]] of ATP in order to power the pumping of protons through the V<small>0</small> channel, which spans the lipid bilayer of endosomal compartments.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\">Guillard, Mailys, et al. \"Vacuolar H+-ATPase meets glycosylation in patients with cutis laxa.\" Biochimica et Biophysica Acta (BBA)-Molecular Basis of Disease 1792.9 (2009): 903-914.</ref> Vacuolar ATPases are also localized within the plasma membrane of both renal cells and osteoclasts.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> In osteoclasts, V-ATPases are required for pumping protons onto the bone surface. The protons are then used for [[bone resorption]]. In renal cells, V-ATPases are used to pump protons into the urine. This facilitates bicarbonate reabsorption into the blood. The ''ATP6V0A2'' gene encodes the a2 [[isoform]] of the a-subunit (present in the V<small>0</small> domain).<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The a2 subunit anchors the V-ATPase to the membrane, and it is also directly involved with proton transport.<ref name=\"doi.org\">Morava, E., Guillard, M., Lefeber, D. J., & Wevers, R. A. (2009). Autosomal recessive cutis laxa syndrome revisited. European journal of human genetics: EJHG, 17(9), 1099\u20131110. https://doi.org/10.1038/ejhg.2009.22</ref> ATP6V0A2 is encoded by the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene. The ATP6V0A2 pump is found in virtually all cells and is thought to play an important role in the process of vesicular fusion in the secretory pathway, including the secretion of [[extracellular matrix]] components.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/>\n\n=== The Function of the Golgi Apparatus in Protein Maturation ===\nThe most important subcellular structure in the context of wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS), is the [[Golgi apparatus]]. The Golgi apparatus is an important part of the endomembrane system because it processes proteins and lipids prior to their delivery to the plasma membrane and/or secretion into the extracellular environment. The Golgi is organized into a polarized series of membrane-bound stacks, called cisternae, through which proteins are trafficked in sequence once they leave the [[endoplasmic reticulum]] (ER), where the proteins and lipids are synthesized. Proteins destined for secretion or delivery to the plasma membrane arrive first at the cis-Golgi, before being trafficked through the medial and trans-Golgi.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\">Udono, Miyako, et al. \"Impaired ATP6V0A2 expression contributes to Golgi dispersion and glycosylation changes in senescent cells.\" Scientific Reports 5 (2015): 17342.</ref> In the Golgi, proteins undergo extensive [[post-translational modifications]] (PTMs). In the context of WSS, the most significant  PTM events are the [[glycosylation]] of proteins comprising the extracellular matrix (ECM) of epidermal cells. The two types of glycosylation events in the Golgi are [[N-linked glycosylation]] and [[O-linked glycosylation]].<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\">Rosnoblet, C., Peanne, R., Legrand, D. et al. Glycosylation disorders of membrane trafficking. Glycoconj J 30, 23\u201331 (2013). https://doi.org/10.1007/s10719-012-9389-y</ref> Glycosylation of proteins destined for secretion occurs through the forward movement of proteins throughout the Golgi apparatus. The proteins destined for secretion are then trafficked to the plasma membrane in secretory vesicles. Retrograde (backward) transport in the Golgi apparatus is also important. In order to retain the enzymes responsible for protein glycosylation in the correct regions of the Golgi, there must be retrograde transport of these enzymes back into the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> In addition, retrograde transport serves a quality control function, by shuttling misfolded proteins back into the ER or retaining them within the Golgi itself until proper protein folding and maturation is completed.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> The activity of protein-modifying enzymes, like [[glycosyltransferases]] and [[glycosidases]], relies on the lumenal pH of the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> Cisternal pH becomes increasingly acidic (lower pH) with progression from cis- to trans- regions of the Golgi.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> Disruption of decreasing pH can impart significant effects on the efficiency and sequence of glycosylation events.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/> Maintenance of the pH gradient across the Golgi is instrumental for proper post-translational modification of proteins prior to secretion. Retrograde transport and pH regulation are therefore vital to the proper functioning of the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Rosnoblet, C. 2013\"/>\n\n=== Genetic Causes of WSS ===\nPatients with both [[missense]] and/or [[nonsense]] mutations of the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene have been shown to phenotypically express wrinkly skin syndrome (WSS) or autosomal recessive cutis laxa type II (ARCL II) (another cutis laxa disorder).<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> Some consider WSS to be a milder variant of ARCL II, but the genetic causes of WSS are not yet known.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> A large number of patients with WSS and ARCL II show a loss-of-function in the a2-subunit.<ref name=\"doi.org\"/> These mutations in ''ATP6V0A2'' are associated with defective glycan biosynthesis and defective Golgi apparatus structure.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\"/> However, the exact mechanism of how mutations in the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene lead to these effects is unclear.\n\n=== Aberrant Golgi Functioning and Clinical Symptoms of WSS ===\nWSS is characterized by defects in the elastic fiber system that comprises the extracellular matrix of epidermal cells.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The skin\u2019s elastic fiber system consists of [[elastin]] (which is normally non-glycosylated) and glycosylated proteins ([[fibulin]], [[fibronectin]], and [[collagen]]). It is speculated that either abnormal glycosylation and/or impaired secretion of proteins caused by ATP6V0A2 dysfunction lead to WSS.<ref name=\"Guillard, Mailys 1792\"/> The ATP6V0A2 pump is highly expressed within the Golgi apparatus.<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\"/> ATP6V0A2 is primarily found within the medial-Golgi and the trans-Golgi. ATP6V0A2 acidifies the medial- and trans-Golgi so that their resident enzymes (e.g. glycosidases and glycosyltransferases) function properly<ref name=\"Udono, Miyako 2015\"/>.. Therefore, mutations in the ''ATP6V0A2'' gene reduce the ability of ATP6V0A2 to produce the necessary pH gradient for these glycosylation enzymes, which results in abnormal N- and O-linked glycosylation. Because the physical properties of skin rely heavily on the structural proteins of the elastic fiber system of epidermal cells, abnormal glycosylation can lead to structural defects in the elastic fibers, and therefore lead to the inelastic skin seen in WSS. WSS patients may also have defective secretion of another ECM component of the skin called tropoelastin.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\">Hucthagowder V, Morava E, Kornak U, et al. Loss-of-function mutations in ATP6V0A2 impair vesicular trafficking, tropoelastin secretion and cell survival. Hum Mol Genet. 2009;18(12):2149\u20132165. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddp148</ref> The process of secreting tropoelastin from the cell is dependent on the acidic pH of vesicles.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> It is thought that increased pH levels (lower acidity) lead to the premature aggregation (coacervation) of tropoelastin inside the vesicle.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> The process of coacervation is thought to be essential for proper elastin assembly in the ECM.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> Coacervation must occur outside of the cell within the ECM ( the ECM has a more alkaline environment than the vesicle) for proper elastic fiber assembly.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> However, defective ATP6V0A2 pumps in the vesicle increase the lumenal pH of the vesicle, leading to premature coacervation and defective elastic fiber assembly.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/> The abnormal assembly and glycosylation of proteins used to make elastic fibers explains the connective tissue phenotypes associated with ARCL2 and WSS but does not explain the neurodevelopmental disorders or growth defects of these patients (18). Elastin is not required for brain or bone growth.<ref>Hucthagowder V, Morava E, Kornak U, et al. Loss-of-function mutations in ATP6V0A2 impair vesicular trafficking, tropoelastin secretion, and cell survival. Hum Mol Genet. 2009;18(12):2149\u20132165. doi:10.1093/hmg/ddp148</ref> However, it is believed that abnormal/impaired secretion of the brain and bone-specific ECM proteins caused by dysregulation of Golgi acidification is what leads to the neural and skeletal defects in ARCL2.<ref name=\"Hucthagowder V 2165. p148\"/>\n\n== Epidemiology ==\nAs of January 2020, only ~ 30 cases of Wrinkly Skin Syndrome have been reported.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.orpha.net/consor/cgi-bin/Education_Home.php?lng=EN|title=Orphanet: Reports|website=www.orpha.net|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> The majority of reported cases have come from Middle Eastern regions such as Iraq, Saudi Arabia, and Oman.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://omim.org/entry/278250|title=OMIM Entry - # 278250 - WRINKLY SKIN SYNDROME; WSS|website=omim.org|access-date=2020-04-24}}</ref> Both males and females of Middle Eastern descent have been reported to be affected.<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Steiner|first=Carlos Eduardo|last2=Cintra|first2=Maria Let\u00edcia|last3=Marques-de-Faria|first3=Antonia Paula|date=2005|title=Cutis laxa with growth and developmental delay, wrinkly skin syndrome and gerodermia osteodysplastica: a report of two unrelated patients and a literature review|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S1415-47572005000200001&lng=en&tlng=en|journal=Genetics and Molecular Biology|volume=28|issue=2|pages=181\u2013190|doi=10.1590/S1415-47572005000200001|issn=1415-4757}}</ref> Consanguineous (marriage of first-cousins) relationships are a prevalent feature of parents with children diagnosed with WSS.<ref name=\":3\" /> Such marriages and relationships are more common in Middle Eastern regions.<ref name=\":3\" /> Multiple children of the same parents have also been reported to be affected by WSS.<ref name=\":3\" /> There is currently insufficient epidemiological data to provide frequency of WSS occurrence in other ethnic groups.\n\n== Additional Resources ==\n\n# [https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/273/wrinkly-skin-syndrome NIH GARD (Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center)] \n# [https://monarchinitiative.org/disease/MONDO:0010208 Monarch Initiative]\n# [https://omim.org/entry/278250 Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man Database]\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Ehlers\u2013Danlos syndrome]]\n* [[List of cutaneous conditions]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== External links ==\n{{Medical resources\n| DiseasesDB      = \n| ICD10           = {{ICD10|M|35|8|m|35}}\n| ICD9            = \n| ICDO            = \n| OMIM            = 278250\n| MedlinePlus     = \n| eMedicineSubj   = \n| eMedicineTopic  = \n| MeshID          = C536750\n| SNOMED CT       = 238875009\n| Orphanet        = 2834\n}}\n\n[[Category:Abnormalities of dermal fibrous and elastic tissue]]\n[[Category:Syndromes]]\n", "name_user": "MLJE", "label": "safe", "comment": "changes to infobox with management", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrinkly_skin_syndrome"}
