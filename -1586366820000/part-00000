Most of the key REDD+ decisions were completed by 2013, with the final pieces of the rulebook finished in 2015.\n\nIn the last two decades, various studies estimate that land use change, including [[deforestation]] and [[forest degradation]], accounts for 12-29% of global greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name=\"Fearnside\">{{cite journal |journal= Climatic Change |year=2000 |pages=115\u2013158 |title= Global warming and tropical land-use change: Greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning, decomposition and soils in forest conversion, shifting cultivation and secondary vegetation |author= Philip Fearnside|volume= 46|doi=10.1023/a:1005569915357 }}</ref><ref name=\"Policies\">{{cite journal |journal= Resources Magazine |date=Dec 2007 |page=7 |title= Policies to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in Tropical Forests |author= Myers, Erin C. |url=http://www.rff.org/Publications/Pages/PublicationDetails.aspx?PublicationID=17519 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-11-24}}</ref><ref name=\"Werf\">{{cite journal |journal= Nature Geoscience|date=Nov 2009 |pages=737\u2013738 |title= CO2 emissions from forest loss|authors = G.R. van der Werf, D.

What remained on forestry was \"Afforestation and Reforestation\", sectoral scope 14 of the CDM. Under this sectoral scope areas of land that had no forest cover since 1990 could be replanted with commercial or indigenous tree species. In its first eight years of operation 52 projects had been registered under the \"Afforestation and Reforestation\" scope of the CDM.<ref>[http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html UNFCCC CDM project search page], accessed 2014-02-28</ref> The cumbersome administrative procedures and corresponding high transaction costs are often blamed for this slow uptake. Beyond the CDM, all developed countries that were parties to the Kyoto Protocol also committed to measuring and reporting on efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from forests. The United States also measures and reports on the net greenhouse gas sequestration in its forests.\n\nThe [[Coalition for Rainforest Nations]] (CfRN) created REDD+ mechanisms which encouraged positive incentives for the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases stemming from tropical deforestation and forest degradation as a climate change mitigation measure.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== REDD ===\n\nREDD was first discussed in 2005 by the UNFCCC at its [[2005 United Nations Climate Change Conference|11th session]] of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) at the request of Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea, on behalf of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, when they submitted the document \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries: Approaches to Stimulate Action\",<ref name=\"CfRN-request\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/cop11/eng/misc01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cpsc1.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> with a request to create an agenda item to discuss consideration of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in natural forests as a mitigation measure. COP 11 entered the request to consider the document as agenda item 6: ''Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action''.<ref name=\"COP-11\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/cop11/eng/05.pdf |title=UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2005/5 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== REDD+ ===\n\n==== Bali Action Plan ====\nREDD received substantial attention from the UNFCCC \u2013 and the attending community \u2013 at [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 13]], December 2007, where the first substantial decision on REDD+ was adopted, Decision 2/CP.13: \"Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action\",<ref name=\"COP-13\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2007/cop13/eng/06a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp6a1 reissued.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> calling for demonstration activities to be reported upon two years later and assessment of drivers of deforestation. REDD+ was also referenced in decision 1/CP.13, the \"Bali Action Plan\", with reference to all five eligible activities for REDD+ (with sustainable management of forests, conservation of forest carbon stocks and enhancement of forest carbon stocks constituting the \"+\" in REDD+).<ref name=\"COP-13\" />\n\nThe call for demonstration activities in decision 2/CP.13 led to a very large number of programs and projects, including the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) of the [[World Bank]], the [[UN-REDD Programme]], and a number of smaller projects financed by the Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among many others. All of these were based on substantive guidance from the UNFCCC. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://redd.unfccc.int/fact-sheets/unfccc-documents-relevant-for-redd.html|title=UNFCCC documents relevant for REDD+ - REDD+|website=redd.unfccc.int|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==== Definition of main elements ====\nIn 2009 at [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 15]], decision 4/CP.15: \"Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\"<ref name=\"COP-15\">/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp11add.1.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> provided more substantive information on requirements for REDD+. Specifically, the national forest monitoring system was introduced, with elements of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). Countries were encouraged to develop national strategies, develop domestic capacity, establish reference levels, and establish a participatory approach with \"full and effective engagement of indigenous peoples and local communities in (\u2026) monitoring and reporting\".<ref>https://thegef.org/sites/default/files/publications/GEF_IP_Part_1_Guidelines_r7.pdf</ref>\n\nA year later at [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 16]] decision 1/CP.16 was adopted.<ref name=\"COP-16\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp7a1.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> In section C: \"Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\" environmental and social safeguards were introduced, with a reiteration of requirements for the national forest monitoring system. These safeguards were introduced to ensure that implementation of REDD+ at the national level would not lead to detrimental effects for the environment or the local population. Countries are required to provide summaries of information on how these safeguards are implemented throughout the three \"phases\" of REDD+.\n\nIn 2011 decision 12/CP.17 was adopted at [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 17]]: \"Guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards are addressed and respected and modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels as referred to in decision 1/CP.16\".<ref name=\"COP-17\">http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a02.pdf</ref> Details are provided on preparation and submission of reference levels and guidance on providing information on safeguards.\n\n==== Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus ====\nIn December 2013, [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 19]] produced no fewer than seven decisions on REDD+, which are jointly known as the \"Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus\".<ref name=\"COP-19\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2013/cop19/eng/10a01.pdf |title=UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2013/10/Add.1 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> These decisions address a work program on results-based finance; coordination of support for implementation; modalities for national forest monitoring systems; presenting information on safeguards; technical assessment of reference (emission) levels; modalities for measuring, reporting and verifying (MRV); and information on addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Requirements to be eligible access to \"results-based finance\" have been specified: through submission of reports for which the contents have been specified; technical assessment through International Consultation and Analysis (ICA) for which procedures have been specified;. With these decisions the overall framework for REDD+ implementation appears to be complete, although many details still need to be provided.\n\nCOP 20 in December 2014 did not produce any new decisions on REDD+. A reference was made to REDD+ in decision 8/CP.20 \"Report of the Green Climate Fund to the Conference of the Parties and guidance to the Green Climate Fund\", where in paragraph 18 the COP \"''requests'' the Board of the Green Climate Fund (...) (b) to consider decisions relevant to REDD-plus\", referring back to earlier COP decisions on REDD+.<ref name=\"COP-20\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/cop20/eng/10a02.pdf |title=Report of the Conference of the Parties on its twentieth session, held in Lima from 1 to 14 December 2014 |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining outstanding decisions on REDD+ were completed at COP21 in 2015. With the conclusion of decisions on reporting on the safeguards, non-market approaches, and non-carbon benefits, the UNFCCC rulebook on REDD+ was completed. All countries were also encouraged to implement and support REDD+in Article 5 of the Paris Agreement. This was part of a broader Article that specified that all countries should take action to protect and enhance their greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs (stores of sequestered carbon).\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe approach detailed under the UNFCCC is commonly referred to as \"reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\", abbreviated as REDD+. This title and the acronyms, however, are not used by the COP itself.\n\nThe original submission by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, on behalf of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, dated 28 July 2005, was entitled \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries: Approaches to Stimulate Action\".<ref name=\"CfRN-request\" /> COP 11 entered the request to consider the document as agenda item 6: \"Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action\", again written here exactly as in the official text.<ref name=\"COP-11\" /> The name for the agenda item was also used at COP 13 in Bali, December 2007. By COP 15 in Copenhagen, December 2009, the scope of the agenda item was broadened to \"Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\",<ref name=\"COP-15\" /> moving to \"Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\" by COP 16.<ref name=\"COP-16\" /> At COP 17 the title of the decision simply referred back to an earlier decision: \"Guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards are addressed and respected and modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels as referred to in decision 1/CP.16\".<ref name=\"COP-17\" /> At COP 19 the titles of decisions 9 and 12 refer back to decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70 and appendix I respectively, while the other decisions only mention the topic under consideration.<ref name=\"COP-19\" />\n\nNone of these decisions use an acronym for the title of the agenda item or othe; the acronym is not coined by the COP of the UNFCCC. The set of decisions on REDD+ that were adopted at COP 19 in Warsaw, December 2013, was coined the '''Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus''' in a footnote to the title of each of the decisions<ref name=\"COP-19\" /> crating the acronyms:\n\n* '''REDD''' originally referred to \"reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries\" the title of the original document on REDD<ref name=\"COP-11\" /> It was superseded in the negotiations by REDD+\n* '''REDD+''' (or '''REDD-plus''') refers to \"reducing emissions from deforestation ''and forest degradation'' in developing countries, and the role of ''conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks'' in developing countries\" (emphasis added); the most recent, elaborated terminology used by the COP<ref name=\"COP-16\" />\n\n== Main elements of REDD+ ==\n\nAs an approach under the multi-lateral climate change agreement, REDD+ is essentially a vehicle to encourage developing countries to  reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases through a variety of forest management options, and to provide technical and financial support for these efforts. As with other approaches under the UNFCCC, there are few prescriptions that specifically mandate how to implement the mechanism at national level; the principles of national sovereignty and subsidiarity imply that the UNFCCC can only provide guidelines for implementation, and require that reports are submitted in a certain format and open for review by the Convention. There are certain aspects that go beyond this basic philosophy \u2013 such as the so-called safeguards, explained in more detail below \u2013 but in essence REDD+ is no more than a set of guidelines on how to report on forest resources and forest management strategies and their results in terms of reducing emissions and enhancing removals of greenhouse gases. However, a set of requirements has been elaborated to ensure that REDD+ programs contain key elements and that reports from Parties are consistent and comparable and that their content are open to review and in function of the objectives of the Convention.\n\nDecision 1/CP 16 requests all developing countries aiming to undertake REDD+ to develop the following elements<ref name=\"COP-16\" />:\n\n(a) A national strategy or action plan;\n\n(b) A national forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level or, if appropriate, as an interim measure, subnational forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels\n\n(c) A robust and transparent national forest monitoring system for the monitoring and reporting on REDD+ activities (see below), with, if appropriate, subnational monitoring and reporting as an interim measure\n\n(d) A system for providing information on how the social and environmental safeguards (included in an appendix to the decision) are being addressed and respected throughout the implementation of REDD+\n\nIt further requests developing countries, when developing and implementing their national REDD+ strategies or action plans, to address, among other issues, the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, land tenure issues, forest governance issues, gender considerations and the social and environmental safeguards, ensuring the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, inter alia indigenous peoples and local communities;\n\n=== Policies and measures ===\n\nIn the text of the Convention repeated reference is made to national \"policies and measures\", the set of legal, regulatory and administrative instruments that Parties develop and implement to achieve the objective of the Convention. These policies can be specific to climate change mitigation or adaptation, or of a more generic nature but with an impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the signatory parties to the UNFCCC have by now established climate change strategies and response measures.\n\nThe REDD+ approach has a similar, more focused set of policies and measures. Forest sector laws and procedures are typically in place in most countries. In addition, countries have to develop specific national strategies and/or action plans for REDD+.\n\nOf specific interest to REDD+ are the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. The UNFCCC decisions call on countries to make an assessment of these drivers and to base the policies and measures on this assessment, such that the policies and measures can be directed to where the impact is greatest. Some of the drivers will be generic \u2013 in the sense that they are prevalent in many countries, such as increasing population pressure \u2013 while others will be very specific to countries or regions within countries.\n\nCountries are encouraged to identify \"national circumstances\" that impact the drivers: specific conditions within the country that impact the forest resources. Hints for typical national circumstances can be found in preambles to various COP decisions, such as \"''Reaffirming'' that economic and social development and poverty eradication are global priorities\" in the Bali Action Plan,<ref name=\"COP-13\"  /> enabling developing countries to prioritize policies like poverty eradication through [[agricultural expansion]] or hydropower development over forest protection.\n\n=== Eligible activities ===\n\nThe decisions on REDD+ enumerate five \"eligible activities\" that developing countries may implement to reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases:\n:\"(a) Reducing emissions from deforestation.\n:(b) Reducing emissions from forest degradation.\n:(c) Conservation of forest carbon stocks.\n:(d) Sustainable management of forests.\n:(e) Enhancement of forest carbon stocks\".<ref name=\"COP-16\" />\n\nThe first two activities reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and they are the two activities listed in the original submission on REDD+ in 2005 by the Coalition for Rainforest Nations.<ref name=\"CfRN-request\" /> The three remaining activities constitute the \"+\" in REDD+. The last one enhances removals of greenhouse gases, while the effect of the other two on emissions or removals is indeterminate but expected to be minimal.\n\n=== Reference levels ===\n\nReference levels are a key component for any national REDD+ program. They serve as a baseline for measuring the success of REDD+ programs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from forests. They are available for examination by the international community to assess the reported emission reductions or enhanced removals. It establishes the confidence of the international community in the national REDD+ program. The results measured against these baselines may be eligible for results-based payments. Setting the reference levels too lax will erode the confidence in the national REDD+ program, while setting them too strict will erode the potential to earn the benefits with which to operate the national REDD+ program. Very careful consideration of all relevant information is therefore of crucial importance.<ref>https://redd.unfccc.int/uploads/2_94_redd_20150804_unredd_technical_considerations_frel_under_unfccc_en.pdf</ref>\n\nThe requirements and characteristics of reference levels are under the purview of the UNFCCC. Given the wide variety in ecological conditions and country-specific circumstances, these requirements are rather global and every country will have a range of options in its definition of reference levels within its territory.\n\nA reference level (RL) is expressed as an amount, derived by differencing a sequence of amounts over a period of time. For REDD+ purposes the amount is expressed in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e) (see article on [[global warming potential]]) of emissions or removals per year. If the amounts are emissions, the reference level becomes a reference emission level (REL); however these RELs are seen by some as incomplete as they do not take into account removals.  Reference levels are based on a scope \u2012 what is included? \u2012 a scale \u2012 the geographical area from which it is derived or to which it is applied \u2012 and a period over which the reference level is calculated. The scope, the scale and the period can be modified in reference to national circumstances: specific conditions in the country that would call for an adjustment of the basis from which the reference levels are constructed. A reference level can be based on observations or measurements of amounts in the past, in which case it is retrospective, or it can be an expectation or projection of amounts into the future, in which case it is prospective.<ref>[http://redd-oar.org/links/REED+RL.pdf Guidelines for REDD+ Reference Levels: Principles and Recommendations]</ref>\n\nReference levels have to eventually  have national coverage, but they may be composed from a number of sub-national reference levels. As an example, forest degradation may have a reference emission level for commercial selective logging and one for extraction of minor timber and firewood for subsistence use by rural communities. Effectively, every identified driver of deforestation or forest degradation has to be represented in one or more reference emission level(s). Similarly for reference levels for enhancement of carbon stocks, there may be a reference level for plantation timber species and one for natural regeneration, possibly stratified by ecological region or forest type.\n\nDetails on the reporting and technical assessment of reference levels is given in Decision 13/CP.19.<ref name=\"COP-19\" />\n\n=== Monitoring: measurement, reporting and verification ===\n\nIn Decision 2/CP.15 of the UNFCCC countries are requested to develop national forest monitoring systems (NFMS) that support the functions of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of actions and achievements of the implementation of REDD+ activities.<ref name=\"COP-15\" /> NFMS is the key component in the management of information for national REDD+ programs. A fully functional monitoring system can go beyond the requirements posted by the UNFCCC to include issues such as a registry of projects and participants, and evaluation of program achievements and policy effectiveness. It may be purpose-built, but it may also be integrated into existing forest monitoring tools.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMeasurements are suggested to be made using a combination of remote sensing and ground-based observations. [[Remote sensing]] is particularly suited to the assessment of areas of forest and stratification of different forest types. Ground-based observations involve forest surveys to measure the carbon pools used by the IPCC, as well as other parameters of interest such as those related to safeguards and eligible activity implementation.<ref>[http://gfoi.org/sites/default/files/MGD%20report_V1.pdf Integrating remote-sensing and ground-based observations for estimation of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305154228/http://gfoi.org/sites/default/files/MGD%20report_V1.pdf |date=5 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe reporting has to follow the guidance of the IPCC, in particular the \"Good Practice Guidance for [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]\",<ref>[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf.html Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry]</ref> which includes reporting templates to be included in National Communications of Parties to the UNFCCC. Included in the guidance are standard measurements protocols and analysis procedures which greatly impact the measurement systems that countries need to establish. The actual reporting of REDD+ results is not going through the National Communications, however, but through the Biennial Update Reports (BURs).<ref name=\"COP-17\"/>\n\nThe technical assessment of these results is an independent, external process that is managed by the Secretariat to the UNFCCC; countries need to facilitate the requirements of this assessment. The technical assessment is included within the broader process of International Consultation and Analysis (ICA), which is effectively a peer-review by a team composed of an expert from an Annex I Party and an expert from a non-Annex I Party which \"will be conducted in a manner that is nonintrusive, non-punitive and respectful of national sovereignty\".<ref name=\"COP-17\" /> This \"technical team of experts shall analyse the extent to which:\n\n:(a) There is consistency in methodologies, definitions, comprehensiveness and the information provided between the assessed reference level and the results of the implementation of the [REDD+] activities (...);\n:(b) The data and information provided in the technical annex is transparent, consistent, complete and accurate;\n:(c) The data and information provided in the technical annex is consistent with the [UNFCCC] guidelines (...);\n:(d) The results are accurate, to the extent possible.\"<ref name=\"COP-19\" />\n\nHowever, unlike a true verification the technical assessment cannot \"approve\" or \"reject\" the reference level, or the reported results measured against this reference level. It does provide clarity on potential areas for improvement.\n\nFinancing entities that seek to provide results-based payments (payments per tonne of mitigation achieved) typically seek a true verification of results by external experts, to provide assurance that the results for which they are paying are credible.\n\n=== Safeguards ===\n\nIn response to concerns over the potential for negative consequences resulting from the implementation of REDD+ the UNFCCC established a list of safeguards that countries need to \"address and respect\" and \"promote and support\" in order to guarantee the correct and lasting generation of results from the REDD+ mechanism. These safeguards are:\n:\"(a)\tThat actions complement or are consistent with the objectives of national forest programmes and relevant international conventions and agreements;\n:(b)\tTransparent and effective national forest governance structures, taking into account national legislation and sovereignty;\n:(c)\tRespect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, by taking into account relevant international obligations, national circumstances and laws, and noting that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;\n:(d)\tThe full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities;\n:(e)\tThat actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the actions are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits;\n:(f)\tActions to address the risks of reversals;\n:(g)\tActions to reduce displacement of emissions\".<ref name=\"COP-16\" />\n\nCountries have to regularly provide a summary of information on how these safeguards are addressed and respected. This could come in the form, for instance, of explaining the legal and regulatory environment with regards to the recognition, inclusion and engagement of Indigenous Peoples, and information on how these requirements have been implemented.\n\nDecision 12/CP.19 established that the \"summary of information\" on the safeguards will be provided in the National Communications to the UNFCCC, which for developing country Parties will be once every four years. Additionally, and on a voluntary basis, the summary of information may be posted on the UNFCCC REDD+ web platform.<ref name=\"COP-19\" /><ref>[http://unfccc.int/methods/redd/redd_web_platform/items/4531.php UNFCCC REDD+ web platform]</ref>\n\n=== Additional issues===\n\nThe REDD+ mechanism is currently still under discussion by the UNFCCC. All pertinent issues that comprise REDD+ are exclusively those that are included in the decisions of the COP, as indicated in the above sections. There is, however, a large variety of concepts and approaches that are labelled (as being part of) REDD+ by their proponents, either being a substitute for UNFCCC decisions or complementary to those decisions. Below follows a \u2013 no doubt incomplete \u2013 list of such concepts and approaches.\n\n* '''Project-based REDD+, voluntary market REDD+'''. As the concept of REDD+ was being defined, many organizations began to promote REDD+ projects at the scale of a forest area (e.g. large concession, National Park), analogous to AR-CDM projects under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], with reduction of emissions or enhancement of removals vetted by an external organization using a standard established by some party (e.g. CCBA, VCS) and with carbon credits traded on the international voluntary carbon market. However, under the UNFCCC REDD+ is defined as national (Decisions 4/CP.15 and 1/CP.16 consistently refer to national strategies and action plans and national monitoring, with sub-national coverage allowed as an interim measure only<ref name=\"COP-15\" /><ref name=\"COP-16\" />).\n* '''Benefit distribution'''. The UNFCCC decisions on REDD+ are silent on the issue of rewarding countries and participants for their verified net emission reductions or enhanced removals of greenhouse gases. It is not very likely that specific requirements for sub-national implementation of the distribution of benefits will be adopted, as this will be perceived to be an issue of national sovereignty. Generic guidance may be provided, using language similar to that of the safeguards, such as \"result-based finance has to accrue to local stakeholders\" without being specific on percentages retention for management, identification of stakeholders, type of benefit or means of distribution. Countries may decide to channel any benefits through an existing program on rural development, for instance, provide additional services (e.g. extension, better market access, training, seedlings) or pay local stakeholders directly. Many financial entities do have specific requirement on the design of a system to use funds received, and reporting on the use of these funds.\n* '''FPIC'''. [[Free, prior and informed consent]] is included in the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The REDD+ decisions under the UNFCCC do not have this as an explicit requirement;  however, although the safeguard on respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities ''notes'' \"that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]\" (UNDRIP).<ref name=\"COP-16\" /> Article 19 of UNDRIP requires that \"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them\". This article is interpreted by many organizations engaged in REDD+, for example in the UN-REDD \"Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent,\" to mean that every, or at least many, communities need to provide their consent before any REDD+ activities can take place.<ref name=\"UNREDD-FPIC\">[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=8717&Itemid=53 UN-REDD Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent]</ref>\n* '''Leakage'''. Leakage is a term that is often used in project-based REDD+. The term originates from Afforestation/Reforestation projects under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol where it is assessed to quantify effects of the project outside of the project area. Leakage is less of an issue when REDD+ is implemented at a national or subnational level, as there can be no domestic leakage once full national coverage is achieved. However, there can still be international leakage if activities are displaced across international borders, or  \"displacement of emissions\"  between sectors, such as replacing wood fires with kerosene stoves (AFOLU to energy) or construction with wood for construction with concrete, cement and bricks (AFOLU to industry). Many initiatives require leakage be taken into account in program design, so that potential leakage of emissions, including across borders, can be minimized.\n\n== REDD+ as a climate change mitigation measure ==\nDeforestation and forest degradation account for 17-29% of global greenhouse gas emissions,<ref name=\"Fearnside\"/><ref name=\"Policies\"/><ref name=\"Werf\"/> the reduction of which is estimated to be one of the most cost-efficient climate change mitigation strategies.<ref>[[Stern Review]]</ref><ref>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/9780108507632/9780108507632.pdf Eliasch Review]</ref> Regeneration of forest on degraded or deforested lands can remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere through the build-up of biomass, making forest lands a [[Greenhouse gas#Removal from the atmosphere (\"sinks\")|sink of greenhouse gases]]. The REDD+ mechanism addresses both issues of emission reduction and enhanced removal of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== Reducing emissions ===\nEmissions of greenhouse gases from forest land can be reduced by slowing down the rates of deforestation and forest degradation, covered by REDD+ ''eligible activities''. Another option would be some form of reduced impact logging in commercial logging, under the REDD+ ''eligible activity'' of sustainable management of forests. <ref name=\":0\">https://unfccc.int/files/land_use_and_climate_change/redd/application/pdf/compilation_redd_decision_booklet_v1.1.pdf</ref>\n\n=== Enhancing removals ===\nRemovals of greenhouse gases (specifically CO\u2082) from the atmosphere can be achieved through various forest management options, such as replanting degraded or deforested areas or enrichment planting, but also by letting forest land regenerate naturally. Care must be taken to differentiate between what is a purely ecological process of regrowth and what is induced or enhanced through some management intervention.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== REDD+ and the carbon market ===\nIn 2009, at COP-15 in Copenhagen, the Copenhagen Accord was reached, noting in section 6 the recognition of the crucial role of REDD and REDD+ and the need to provide positive incentives for such actions by enabling the mobilization of financial resources from developed countries. The Accord goes on to note in section 8 that the collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010 - 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title= Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009 |pages= |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf |accessdate= 2009-12-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Green Climate Fund]] (GCF) was established at COP-17 to function as the financial mechanism for the UNFCCC, so including for REDD+ finance. The Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus makes various references to the GCF, instructing developing country Parties to apply to the GCF for ''result-based finance''.<ref name=\"COP-19\"/> The GCF currently finances REDD+ programs in phase 1 (design of national strategies or action plans, capacity building) and phase 2 (implementation of national strategies or action plans, demonstration programs). It is currently finalizing an approach to REDD+ results-based payments.\n\nREDD+ is also eligible for inclusion under CORSIA, the International Civil Aviation Organization's market-based greenhouse gas offset mechanism <http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx>.\n\n== Implementing REDD+ ==\nDecision 1/CP.16, paragraph 73, suggests that national capacity for implementing REDD+ is built up in phases, \"beginning with the development of national strategies or action plans, policies and measures, and capacity-building, followed by the implementation of national policies and measures and national strategies or action plans that could involve further capacity-building, technology development and transfer and results-based demonstration activities, and evolving into results-based actions that should be fully measured, reported and verified\".<ref name=\"COP-16\"/> The initial phase of the development of national strategies and action plans and capacity building is typically referred to as the \"Readiness phase\" (a term like ''Reddiness'' is also encountered).\n\nThere is a very substantial number of REDD+ projects globally and this section lists only a selection. One of the more comprehensive online tools with up-to-date information on REDD+ projects is the [http://www.fao.org/forestry/vrd/en/ Voluntary REDD+ Database].\n\n=== Readiness activities ===\nMost REDD+ activities or projects implemented since the call for demonstration activities in Decision 2/CP.13 December 2007<ref name=\"COP-13\" /> are focused on readiness, which is not surprising given that REDD+ and its requirements were completely new to all developing countries.\n\n* '''UN-REDD Programme''' UNDP, UNEP and FAO jointly established the [[UN-REDD Programme]] in 2007, a partnership aimed at assisting developing countries in addressing certain measures needed in order to effectively participate in the REDD+ mechanism. These measures include capacity development, governance, engagement of Indigenous Peoples and technical needs. The initial set of supported countries were Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tanzania, Vietnam, and Zambia. By March 2014 the Programme counted 49 participants, 18 of which are receiving financial support to kick start or complement a variety of national REDD+ readiness activities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un-redd.org/Partner_Countries/tabid/102663/Default.aspx |title=UN-REDD Programme - Support to Partner Countries |publisher=Un-redd.org |accessdate=2014-03-02 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214223120/http://www.un-redd.org/Partner_Countries/tabid/102663/Default.aspx |archivedate=14 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The other 31 ''partner countries'' may receive ''targeted support'' and ''knowledge sharing'', be invited to attend meetings and training workshops, have ''observer status'' at the Policy Board meetings, and \"may be invited to submit a request to receive funding for a National Programme in the future, if selected through a set of criteria to prioritize funding for new countries approved by the Policy Board\".<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.un-redd.org/AboutUNREDDProgramme/NationalProgrammes/Partner_Countries/tabid/4648/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-09 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219205547/http://www.un-redd.org/AboutUNREDDProgramme/NationalProgrammes/Partner_Countries/tabid/4648/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archivedate=19 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The Programme operates in six work areas:<ref>[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=4598&Itemid=53 UN-REDD Programme Strategy 2011-2015]</ref>\n:# MRV and Monitoring (led by FAO)\n:# National REDD+ Governance (UNDP)\n:# Engagement of Indigenous Peoples, Local Communities and Other Relevant Stakeholders (UNDP)\n:# Ensuring multiple benefits of forests and REDD+ (UNEP)\n:# Transparent, Equitable and Accountable Management of REDD+ Payments (UNDP)\n:# REDD+ as a Catalyst for Transformations to a Green Economy (UNEP)\n* '''Forest Carbon Partnership Facility''' The World Bank plays an important role in the development of REDD+ activities since its inception. The [[Forest Carbon Partnership Facility]] (FCPF) was presented to the international community at COP-13 in Bali, December 2007. Recipient countries can apply $3.6 million towards: the development of national strategies; stakeholder consultation; capacity building; development of reference levels; development of a national forest monitoring system; and social and environmental safeguards analysis.<ref>[https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/fcp/sites/forestcarbonpartnership.org/files/Documents/PDF/Apr2012/FCPF%20UNREDD%20R-PP%20Template%20Version%206%20-%20April%2020%2C%202012-FINAL.docx FCPF] template to apply for funding.</ref> Those countries that successfully achieve a state of readiness can apply to the related Carbon Fund, for support towards national implementation of REDD+.<ref>[http://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/carbon-fund FCPF Carbon Fund] As the first country to apply for funding under the FCPF Carbon Fund, Costa Rica submitted its revised ''ER-PIN'' on 15 February 2013.

For example, the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility has 19 countries in the pipeline of the Carbon Fund, which will provide payments to these countries based on verified REDD+ emissions reductions achieved under national or subnational programs. The first countries will begin to negotiate contracts for these payments, and begin implementation of their programs, in 2017.\n\n=== Results-based actions ===\nFollowing the Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus,  the first country had submitted a Biennial Update Report with a Technical Annex containing the details on emission reductions from REDD+ eligible activities. Brazil submitted its first Biennial Update Report on 31 December 2014.<ref>http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/brbur1.pdf</ref> The Technical Annex covers the [[Amazon biome]] within Brazil's territory, a little under half of the national territory, reporting emission reductions against Brazil's previously submitted reference emission level of 2,971.02 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e from a reduction in deforestation. This Technical Annex was reviewed through the International Consultation and Analysis process and on 22 September 2015 a technical report was issued by the UNFCCC which states that \"the LULUCF experts consider that the data and information provided in the technical annex are transparent, consistent, complete and accurate\" (paragraph 38).<ref>http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/tatr/eng/bra.pdf</ref> Considering that Brazil is only reporting on emission reductions from deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, the technical review identified several areas of improvement (paragraph 34):\n\n<blockquote>(a) Continuation in updating and improving the carbon density map, including through the use of improved ground data from Brazil\u2019s first national forest inventory, possibly prioritizing geographic areas where deforestation is more likely to occur;\n\n(b) Expansion of the coverage of carbon pools, including improving the understanding of soil carbon dynamics after the conversion of forests to non-forests;\n\n(c) Consideration of the treatment of non-CO2 gases to maintain consistency with the GHG inventory;\n\n(d) Continuation of the improvements related to monitoring of forest degradation;\n\n(e) Expansion of the forest monitoring system to cover additional biomes.</blockquote>\n\nSeveral additional countries have followed closely behind Brazil.\n\n== Concerns ==\nSince the first discussion on REDD+ in 2005, and particularly at COP-13 in 2007 and COP-15 in 2009, many concerns have been voiced on aspects of the REDD+ programme. Though it is widely understood that the REDD+ programme will need to undergo full-scale implementation in the near-future, many challenges need resolving before this can happen.\n\nOne of the largest issues is how reduced emissions and the removal of greenhouse gases will be monitored consistently on a large scale, across a number of countries, each with separate environmental agencies and laws. Other issues relate to the conflict between the REDD+ approach and existing national development strategies, the participation of forest communities and indigenous peoples in the design and maintenance of REDD+, the programme's funding, and the consistent monitoring of said funding to ensure equitable distribution across programme members.\n\nIn response to concerns, the COP has responded by establishing REDD+ safeguards, though these themselves face criticism for being overly generic, non-enforcable, and failing to establish a specific set of requirements for participation in the REDD+ programme.\n\n=== Natural forests vs. high-density plantations ===\n''Safeguard (e): That actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the [REDD+] actions \u2026 are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits. Footnote to this safeguard: Taking into account the need for sustainable livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local communities and their interdependence on forests in most countries, reflected in the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], as well as the International [[Pachamama|Mother Earth]] Day.''\n\nThe UNFCCC does not define what constitutes a forest; it only requires that Parties communicate to the UNFCCC on how they define a forest.  The UNFCCC does suggest using a definition in terms of minimal area, minimal crown coverage and minimal height at maturity of perennial vegetation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhile there is a safeguard against the conversion of natural forest, developing country Parties are free to include plantations of commercial tree species (including exotics like [[Eucalyptus]] spp., [[Pinus]] spp., [[Acacia]] spp.), agricultural tree crops (e.g. [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]], [[mango]], [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]], [[citrus]]), or even non-tree species such as palms ([[Elaeis guineensis|oil palm]], [[coconut]], [[Date palm|dates]]) and [[bamboo]] (a grass){{citation needed|date=September 2019}}.

In the absence of guidance from the COP, two options were debated by the international community at large:\n# a market-based approach;\n# a fund-based approach where Annex I countries would deposit substantial amounts of money into a fund administered by some multi-lateral entity.\n\nUnder the market-based approach, REDD+ would act as an \"offset scheme\" in which verified results-based actions translate into some form of carbon credits, more-or-less analogous to the market for [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CER) under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol. Such carbon credits could then offset emissions in the country or company of the buyer of the carbon credits. This would require Annex I countries to agree to deeper cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases in order to create a market for the carbon credits from REDD+, which is unlikely to happen soon given the current state of negotiations in the COP, but even then there is the fear that the market will be flooded with carbon credits, depressing the price to levels where REDD+ is no longer an economically viable option.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0305-carbon.html |title=Why Europe Torpedoed the REDD Forest-For-Carbon Credits Initiative |author=Butler, Rhett |date=Mar 5, 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713130047/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0305-carbon.html |archivedate=13 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Karsenty |first= Alain |title= What the (carbon) market cannot do... |publisher= CIRAD |date= Nov 2009 |url= http://www.rightsandresources.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=1374 |accessdate= 2012-02-15 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121028122728/http://www.rightsandresources.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=1374 |archivedate= 28 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Some developing countries, such as Brazil and China, maintain that developed countries must commit to real emissions reductions, independent of any offset mechanism.<ref>{{Citation | last = von der Goltz | first = Jan | title = High Stakes in a Complex Game: A Snapshot of the Climate Change Negotiating Positions of Major Developing Country Emitters | publisher = [[Center for Global Development]]| date = August 10, 2009 | url = http://www.cgdev.org/files/1422602_file_High_Stakes_FINAL081009.pdf | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nSince COP-17, however, it has become clear that the REDD+ may be financed by a variety of sources, market and non-market.

For example, the World Bank and the UN-REDD Programme, the two largest sources of funding and technical assistance for readiness activities and therefore unavoidable for most developing countries, place requirements upon recipient countries that are arguably not mandated or required by the COP decisions. A body of research suggests that, at least as of 2016, REDD+ as a global architecture has only had a limited effect on local political realities, as pre-existing entrenched power dynamics and incentives that promote deforestation are not easily changed by the relatively small sums of money that REDD+ has delivered to date. In addition, issues like land tenure that fundamentally determine who makes decisions about land use and deforestation have not been adequately addressed by REDD+, and there is no clear consensus on how complex political issues like land tenure can be easily resolved to favor standing forests over cleared forests through a relatively top-down mechanism like REDD+.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.18352/ijc.593|title = Multilevel governance challenges in transitioning towards a national approach for REDD+: Evidence from 23 subnational REDD+ initiatives| journal=International Journal of the Commons| volume=9| issue=2| pages=909|year = 2015|last1 = Ravikumar|first1 = Ashwin| last2=Larson| first2=Anne M.| last3=Duchelle| first3=Amy E.| last4=Myers| first4=Rodd| last5=Gonzales Tovar| first5=Jazmin}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.11.008 | volume=21 | issue=2 | title=Forest tenure reform in the age of climate change: Lessons for REDD+ | journal=Global Environmental Change | pages=540\u2013549| year=2011 | last1=Larson | first1=Anne M. }}</ref><ref>http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/BAngelsen120105.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.013 | volume=55 | title=How are REDD+ Proponents Addressing Tenure Problems?

What remained on forestry was \"Afforestation and Reforestation\", sectoral scope 14 of the CDM.

COP 11 entered the request to consider the document as agenda item 6: ''Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action''.<ref name=\"COP-11\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/cop11/eng/05.pdf |title=UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2005/5 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref>\n\n=== REDD+ ===\n\n==== Bali Action Plan ====\nREDD received substantial attention from the UNFCCC \u2013 and the attending community \u2013 at [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 13]], December 2007, where the first substantial decision on REDD+ was adopted, Decision 2/CP.13: \"Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action\",<ref name=\"COP-13\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2007/cop13/eng/06a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp6a1 reissued.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> calling for demonstration activities to be reported upon two years later and assessment of drivers of deforestation. REDD+ was also referenced in decision 1/CP.13, the \"Bali Action Plan\", with reference to all five eligible activities for REDD+ (with sustainable management of forests, conservation of forest carbon stocks and enhancement of forest carbon stocks constituting the \"+\" in REDD+).<ref name=\"COP-13\" />\n\nThe call for demonstration activities in decision 2/CP.13 led to a very large number of programs and projects, including the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) of the [[World Bank]], the [[UN-REDD Programme]], and a number of smaller projects financed by the Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among many others. All of these were based on substantive guidance from the UNFCCC. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://redd.unfccc.int/fact-sheets/unfccc-documents-relevant-for-redd.html|title=UNFCCC documents relevant for REDD+ - REDD+|website=redd.unfccc.int|access-date=2020-04-08}}</ref>\n\n==== Definition of main elements ====\nIn 2009 at [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 15]], decision 4/CP.15: \"Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\"<ref name=\"COP-15\">/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp11add.1.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> provided more substantive information on requirements for REDD+. Specifically, the national forest monitoring system was introduced, with elements of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). Countries were encouraged to develop national strategies, develop domestic capacity, establish reference levels, and establish a participatory approach with \"full and effective engagement of indigenous peoples and local communities in (\u2026) monitoring and reporting\".<ref>https://thegef.org/sites/default/files/publications/GEF_IP_Part_1_Guidelines_r7.pdf</ref>\n\nA year later at [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 16]] decision 1/CP.16 was adopted.<ref name=\"COP-16\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp7a1.doc |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> In section C: \"Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\" environmental and social safeguards were introduced, with a reiteration of requirements for the national forest monitoring system. These safeguards were introduced to ensure that implementation of REDD+ at the national level would not lead to detrimental effects for the environment or the local population. Countries are required to provide summaries of information on how these safeguards are implemented throughout the three \"phases\" of REDD+.\n\nIn 2011 decision 12/CP.17 was adopted at [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 17]]: \"Guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards are addressed and respected and modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels as referred to in decision 1/CP.16\".<ref name=\"COP-17\">http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a02.pdf</ref> Details are provided on preparation and submission of reference levels and guidance on providing information on safeguards.\n\n==== Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus ====\nIn December 2013, [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 19]] produced no fewer than seven decisions on REDD+, which are jointly known as the \"Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus\".<ref name=\"COP-19\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2013/cop19/eng/10a01.pdf |title=UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2013/10/Add.1 |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}</ref> These decisions address a work program on results-based finance; coordination of support for implementation; modalities for national forest monitoring systems; presenting information on safeguards; technical assessment of reference (emission) levels; modalities for measuring, reporting and verifying (MRV); and information on addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Requirements to be eligible access to \"results-based finance\" have been specified: through submission of reports for which the contents have been specified; technical assessment through International Consultation and Analysis (ICA) for which procedures have been specified;. With these decisions the overall framework for REDD+ implementation appears to be complete, although many details still need to be provided.\n\nCOP 20 in December 2014 did not produce any new decisions on REDD+. A reference was made to REDD+ in decision 8/CP.20 \"Report of the Green Climate Fund to the Conference of the Parties and guidance to the Green Climate Fund\", where in paragraph 18 the COP \"''requests'' the Board of the Green Climate Fund (...) (b) to consider decisions relevant to REDD-plus\", referring back to earlier COP decisions on REDD+.<ref name=\"COP-20\">{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/cop20/eng/10a02.pdf |title=Report of the Conference of the Parties on its twentieth session, held in Lima from 1 to 14 December 2014 |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}</ref>\n\nThe remaining outstanding decisions on REDD+ were completed at COP21 in 2015. With the conclusion of decisions on reporting on the safeguards, non-market approaches, and non-carbon benefits, the UNFCCC rulebook on REDD+ was completed. All countries were also encouraged to implement and support REDD+in Article 5 of the Paris Agreement. This was part of a broader Article that specified that all countries should take action to protect and enhance their greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs (stores of sequestered carbon).\n\n== Terminology ==\n\nThe approach detailed under the UNFCCC is commonly referred to as \"reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation\", abbreviated as REDD+. This title and the acronyms, however, are not used by the COP itself.\n\nThe original submission by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, on behalf of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, dated 28 July 2005, was entitled \"Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries: Approaches to Stimulate Action\".<ref name=\"CfRN-request\" /> COP 11 entered the request to consider the document as agenda item 6: \"Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action\", again written here exactly as in the official text.<ref name=\"COP-11\" /> The name for the agenda item was also used at COP 13 in Bali, December 2007. By COP 15 in Copenhagen, December 2009, the scope of the agenda item was broadened to \"Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\",<ref name=\"COP-15\" /> moving to \"Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries\" by COP 16.<ref name=\"COP-16\" /> At COP 17 the title of the decision simply referred back to an earlier decision: \"Guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards are addressed and respected and modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels as referred to in decision 1/CP.16\".<ref name=\"COP-17\" /> At COP 19 the titles of decisions 9 and 12 refer back to decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70 and appendix I respectively, while the other decisions only mention the topic under consideration.<ref name=\"COP-19\" />\n\nNone of these decisions use an acronym for the title of the agenda item or othe; the acronym is not coined by the COP of the UNFCCC. The set of decisions on REDD+ that were adopted at COP 19 in Warsaw, December 2013, was coined the '''Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus''' in a footnote to the title of each of the decisions<ref name=\"COP-19\" /> crating the acronyms:\n\n* '''REDD''' originally referred to \"reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries\" the title of the original document on REDD<ref name=\"COP-11\" /> It was superseded in the negotiations by REDD+\n* '''REDD+''' (or '''REDD-plus''') refers to \"reducing emissions from deforestation ''and forest degradation'' in developing countries, and the role of ''conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks'' in developing countries\" (emphasis added); the most recent, elaborated terminology used by the COP<ref name=\"COP-16\" />\n\n== Main elements of REDD+ ==\n\nAs an approach under the multi-lateral climate change agreement, REDD+ is essentially a vehicle to encourage developing countries to  reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases through a variety of forest management options, and to provide technical and financial support for these efforts. As with other approaches under the UNFCCC, there are few prescriptions that specifically mandate how to implement the mechanism at national level; the principles of national sovereignty and subsidiarity imply that the UNFCCC can only provide guidelines for implementation, and require that reports are submitted in a certain format and open for review by the Convention. There are certain aspects that go beyond this basic philosophy \u2013 such as the so-called safeguards, explained in more detail below \u2013 but in essence REDD+ is no more than a set of guidelines on how to report on forest resources and forest management strategies and their results in terms of reducing emissions and enhancing removals of greenhouse gases. However, a set of requirements has been elaborated to ensure that REDD+ programs contain key elements and that reports from Parties are consistent and comparable and that their content are open to review and in function of the objectives of the Convention.\n\nDecision 1/CP 16 requests all developing countries aiming to undertake REDD+ to develop the following elements<ref name=\"COP-16\" />:\n\n(a) A national strategy or action plan;\n\n(b) A national forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level or, if appropriate, as an interim measure, subnational forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels\n\n(c) A robust and transparent national forest monitoring system for the monitoring and reporting on REDD+ activities (see below), with, if appropriate, subnational monitoring and reporting as an interim measure\n\n(d) A system for providing information on how the social and environmental safeguards (included in an appendix to the decision) are being addressed and respected throughout the implementation of REDD+\n\nIt further requests developing countries, when developing and implementing their national REDD+ strategies or action plans, to address, among other issues, the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, land tenure issues, forest governance issues, gender considerations and the social and environmental safeguards, ensuring the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, inter alia indigenous peoples and local communities;\n\n=== Policies and measures ===\n\nIn the text of the Convention repeated reference is made to national \"policies and measures\", the set of legal, regulatory and administrative instruments that Parties develop and implement to achieve the objective of the Convention. These policies can be specific to climate change mitigation or adaptation, or of a more generic nature but with an impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the signatory parties to the UNFCCC have by now established climate change strategies and response measures.\n\nThe REDD+ approach has a similar, more focused set of policies and measures. Forest sector laws and procedures are typically in place in most countries. In addition, countries have to develop specific national strategies and/or action plans for REDD+.\n\nOf specific interest to REDD+ are the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. The UNFCCC decisions call on countries to make an assessment of these drivers and to base the policies and measures on this assessment, such that the policies and measures can be directed to where the impact is greatest. Some of the drivers will be generic \u2013 in the sense that they are prevalent in many countries, such as increasing population pressure \u2013 while others will be very specific to countries or regions within countries.\n\nCountries are encouraged to identify \"national circumstances\" that impact the drivers: specific conditions within the country that impact the forest resources. Hints for typical national circumstances can be found in preambles to various COP decisions, such as \"''Reaffirming'' that economic and social development and poverty eradication are global priorities\" in the Bali Action Plan,<ref name=\"COP-13\"  /> enabling developing countries to prioritize policies like poverty eradication through [[agricultural expansion]] or hydropower development over forest protection.\n\n=== Eligible activities ===\n\nThe decisions on REDD+ enumerate five \"eligible activities\" that developing countries may implement to reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases:\n:\"(a) Reducing emissions from deforestation.\n:(b) Reducing emissions from forest degradation.\n:(c) Conservation of forest carbon stocks.\n:(d) Sustainable management of forests.\n:(e) Enhancement of forest carbon stocks\".<ref name=\"COP-16\" />\n\nThe first two activities reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and they are the two activities listed in the original submission on REDD+ in 2005 by the Coalition for Rainforest Nations.<ref name=\"CfRN-request\" /> The three remaining activities constitute the \"+\" in REDD+. The last one enhances removals of greenhouse gases, while the effect of the other two on emissions or removals is indeterminate but expected to be minimal.\n\n=== Reference levels ===\n\nReference levels are a key component for any national REDD+ program. They serve as a baseline for measuring the success of REDD+ programs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from forests. They are available for examination by the international community to assess the reported emission reductions or enhanced removals. It establishes the confidence of the international community in the national REDD+ program. The results measured against these baselines may be eligible for results-based payments. Setting the reference levels too lax will erode the confidence in the national REDD+ program, while setting them too strict will erode the potential to earn the benefits with which to operate the national REDD+ program. Very careful consideration of all relevant information is therefore of crucial importance.<ref>https://redd.unfccc.int/uploads/2_94_redd_20150804_unredd_technical_considerations_frel_under_unfccc_en.pdf</ref>\n\nThe requirements and characteristics of reference levels are under the purview of the UNFCCC. Given the wide variety in ecological conditions and country-specific circumstances, these requirements are rather global and every country will have a range of options in its definition of reference levels within its territory.\n\nA reference level (RL) is expressed as an amount, derived by differencing a sequence of amounts over a period of time. For REDD+ purposes the amount is expressed in CO<sub>2</sub>-equivalents (CO<sub>2</sub>e) (see article on [[global warming potential]]) of emissions or removals per year. If the amounts are emissions, the reference level becomes a reference emission level (REL); however these RELs are seen by some as incomplete as they do not take into account removals.  Reference levels are based on a scope \u2012 what is included? \u2012 a scale \u2012 the geographical area from which it is derived or to which it is applied \u2012 and a period over which the reference level is calculated. The scope, the scale and the period can be modified in reference to national circumstances: specific conditions in the country that would call for an adjustment of the basis from which the reference levels are constructed. A reference level can be based on observations or measurements of amounts in the past, in which case it is retrospective, or it can be an expectation or projection of amounts into the future, in which case it is prospective.<ref>[http://redd-oar.org/links/REED+RL.pdf Guidelines for REDD+ Reference Levels: Principles and Recommendations]</ref>\n\nReference levels have to eventually  have national coverage, but they may be composed from a number of sub-national reference levels. As an example, forest degradation may have a reference emission level for commercial selective logging and one for extraction of minor timber and firewood for subsistence use by rural communities. Effectively, every identified driver of deforestation or forest degradation has to be represented in one or more reference emission level(s). Similarly for reference levels for enhancement of carbon stocks, there may be a reference level for plantation timber species and one for natural regeneration, possibly stratified by ecological region or forest type.\n\nDetails on the reporting and technical assessment of reference levels is given in Decision 13/CP.19.<ref name=\"COP-19\" />\n\n=== Monitoring: measurement, reporting and verification ===\n\nIn Decision 2/CP.15 of the UNFCCC countries are requested to develop national forest monitoring systems (NFMS) that support the functions of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of actions and achievements of the implementation of REDD+ activities.<ref name=\"COP-15\" /> NFMS is the key component in the management of information for national REDD+ programs. A fully functional monitoring system can go beyond the requirements posted by the UNFCCC to include issues such as a registry of projects and participants, and evaluation of program achievements and policy effectiveness. It may be purpose-built, but it may also be integrated into existing forest monitoring tools.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nMeasurements are suggested to be made using a combination of remote sensing and ground-based observations. [[Remote sensing]] is particularly suited to the assessment of areas of forest and stratification of different forest types. Ground-based observations involve forest surveys to measure the carbon pools used by the IPCC, as well as other parameters of interest such as those related to safeguards and eligible activity implementation.<ref>[http://gfoi.org/sites/default/files/MGD%20report_V1.pdf Integrating remote-sensing and ground-based observations for estimation of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305154228/http://gfoi.org/sites/default/files/MGD%20report_V1.pdf |date=5 March 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe reporting has to follow the guidance of the IPCC, in particular the \"Good Practice Guidance for [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]\",<ref>[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf.html Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry]</ref> which includes reporting templates to be included in National Communications of Parties to the UNFCCC. Included in the guidance are standard measurements protocols and analysis procedures which greatly impact the measurement systems that countries need to establish. The actual reporting of REDD+ results is not going through the National Communications, however, but through the Biennial Update Reports (BURs).<ref name=\"COP-17\"/>\n\nThe technical assessment of these results is an independent, external process that is managed by the Secretariat to the UNFCCC; countries need to facilitate the requirements of this assessment. The technical assessment is included within the broader process of International Consultation and Analysis (ICA), which is effectively a peer-review by a team composed of an expert from an Annex I Party and an expert from a non-Annex I Party which \"will be conducted in a manner that is nonintrusive, non-punitive and respectful of national sovereignty\".<ref name=\"COP-17\" /> This \"technical team of experts shall analyse the extent to which:\n\n:(a) There is consistency in methodologies, definitions, comprehensiveness and the information provided between the assessed reference level and the results of the implementation of the [REDD+] activities (...);\n:(b) The data and information provided in the technical annex is transparent, consistent, complete and accurate;\n:(c) The data and information provided in the technical annex is consistent with the [UNFCCC] guidelines (...);\n:(d) The results are accurate, to the extent possible.\"<ref name=\"COP-19\" />\n\nHowever, unlike a true verification the technical assessment cannot \"approve\" or \"reject\" the reference level, or the reported results measured against this reference level. It does provide clarity on potential areas for improvement.\n\nFinancing entities that seek to provide results-based payments (payments per tonne of mitigation achieved) typically seek a true verification of results by external experts, to provide assurance that the results for which they are paying are credible.\n\n=== Safeguards ===\n\nIn response to concerns over the potential for negative consequences resulting from the implementation of REDD+ the UNFCCC established a list of safeguards that countries need to \"address and respect\" and \"promote and support\" in order to guarantee the correct and lasting generation of results from the REDD+ mechanism. These safeguards are:\n:\"(a)\tThat actions complement or are consistent with the objectives of national forest programmes and relevant international conventions and agreements;\n:(b)\tTransparent and effective national forest governance structures, taking into account national legislation and sovereignty;\n:(c)\tRespect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, by taking into account relevant international obligations, national circumstances and laws, and noting that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;\n:(d)\tThe full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities;\n:(e)\tThat actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the actions are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits;\n:(f)\tActions to address the risks of reversals;\n:(g)\tActions to reduce displacement of emissions\".<ref name=\"COP-16\" />\n\nCountries have to regularly provide a summary of information on how these safeguards are addressed and respected. This could come in the form, for instance, of explaining the legal and regulatory environment with regards to the recognition, inclusion and engagement of Indigenous Peoples, and information on how these requirements have been implemented.\n\nDecision 12/CP.19 established that the \"summary of information\" on the safeguards will be provided in the National Communications to the UNFCCC, which for developing country Parties will be once every four years. Additionally, and on a voluntary basis, the summary of information may be posted on the UNFCCC REDD+ web platform.<ref name=\"COP-19\" /><ref>[http://unfccc.int/methods/redd/redd_web_platform/items/4531.php UNFCCC REDD+ web platform]</ref>\n\n=== Additional issues===\n\nThe REDD+ mechanism is currently still under discussion by the UNFCCC. All pertinent issues that comprise REDD+ are exclusively those that are included in the decisions of the COP, as indicated in the above sections. There is, however, a large variety of concepts and approaches that are labelled (as being part of) REDD+ by their proponents, either being a substitute for UNFCCC decisions or complementary to those decisions. Below follows a \u2013 no doubt incomplete \u2013 list of such concepts and approaches.\n\n* '''Project-based REDD+, voluntary market REDD+'''. As the concept of REDD+ was being defined, many organizations began to promote REDD+ projects at the scale of a forest area (e.g. large concession, National Park), analogous to AR-CDM projects under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], with reduction of emissions or enhancement of removals vetted by an external organization using a standard established by some party (e.g. CCBA, VCS) and with carbon credits traded on the international voluntary carbon market. However, under the UNFCCC REDD+ is defined as national (Decisions 4/CP.15 and 1/CP.16 consistently refer to national strategies and action plans and national monitoring, with sub-national coverage allowed as an interim measure only<ref name=\"COP-15\" /><ref name=\"COP-16\" />).\n* '''Benefit distribution'''. The UNFCCC decisions on REDD+ are silent on the issue of rewarding countries and participants for their verified net emission reductions or enhanced removals of greenhouse gases. It is not very likely that specific requirements for sub-national implementation of the distribution of benefits will be adopted, as this will be perceived to be an issue of national sovereignty. Generic guidance may be provided, using language similar to that of the safeguards, such as \"result-based finance has to accrue to local stakeholders\" without being specific on percentages retention for management, identification of stakeholders, type of benefit or means of distribution. Countries may decide to channel any benefits through an existing program on rural development, for instance, provide additional services (e.g. extension, better market access, training, seedlings) or pay local stakeholders directly. Many financial entities do have specific requirement on the design of a system to use funds received, and reporting on the use of these funds.\n* '''FPIC'''. [[Free, prior and informed consent]] is included in the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The REDD+ decisions under the UNFCCC do not have this as an explicit requirement;  however, although the safeguard on respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities ''notes'' \"that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]\" (UNDRIP).<ref name=\"COP-16\" /> Article 19 of UNDRIP requires that \"States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them\". This article is interpreted by many organizations engaged in REDD+, for example in the UN-REDD \"Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent,\" to mean that every, or at least many, communities need to provide their consent before any REDD+ activities can take place.<ref name=\"UNREDD-FPIC\">[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&task=doc_download&gid=8717&Itemid=53 UN-REDD Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent]</ref>\n* '''Leakage'''. Leakage is a term that is often used in project-based REDD+. The term originates from Afforestation/Reforestation projects under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol where it is assessed to quantify effects of the project outside of the project area. Leakage is less of an issue when REDD+ is implemented at a national or subnational level, as there can be no domestic leakage once full national coverage is achieved. However, there can still be international leakage if activities are displaced across international borders, or  \"displacement of emissions\"  between sectors, such as replacing wood fires with kerosene stoves (AFOLU to energy) or construction with wood for construction with concrete, cement and bricks (AFOLU to industry). Many initiatives require leakage be taken into account in program design, so that potential leakage of emissions, including across borders, can be minimized.\n\n== REDD+ as a climate change mitigation measure ==\nDeforestation and forest degradation account for 17-29% of global greenhouse gas emissions,<ref name=\"Fearnside\"/><ref name=\"Policies\"/><ref name=\"Werf\"/> the reduction of which is estimated to be one of the most cost-efficient climate change mitigation strategies.<ref>[[Stern Review]]</ref><ref>[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/9780108507632/9780108507632.pdf Eliasch Review]</ref> Regeneration of forest on degraded or deforested lands can remove CO\u2082 from the atmosphere through the build-up of biomass, making forest lands a [[Greenhouse gas#Removal from the atmosphere (\"sinks\")|sink of greenhouse gases]]. The REDD+ mechanism addresses both issues of emission reduction and enhanced removal of greenhouse gases.\n\n=== Reducing emissions ===\nEmissions of greenhouse gases from forest land can be reduced by slowing down the rates of deforestation and forest degradation, obviously covered by the first two of the REDD+ ''eligible activities''. Another option would be some form of reduced impact logging in commercial logging, under the REDD+ ''eligible activity'' of sustainable management of forests.\n\n=== Enhancing removals ===\nRemovals of greenhouse gases (specifically CO\u2082) from the atmosphere can be achieved through various forest management options, such as replanting degraded or deforested areas or enrichment planting, but also by letting forest land regenerate naturally. Care must be taken to differentiate between what is a purely ecological process of regrowth and what is induced or enhanced through some management intervention.\n\n=== REDD+ and the carbon market ===\nIn 2009, at COP-15 in Copenhagen, the Copenhagen Accord was reached, noting in section 6 the recognition of the crucial role of REDD and REDD+ and the need to provide positive incentives for such actions by enabling the mobilization of financial resources from developed countries. The Accord goes on to note in section 8 that the collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010 - 2012.<ref>{{cite news |title= Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009 |pages= |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf |accessdate= 2009-12-28}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Green Climate Fund]] (GCF) was established at COP-17 to function as the financial mechanism for the UNFCCC, so including for REDD+ finance. The Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus makes various references to the GCF, instructing developing country Parties to apply to the GCF for ''result-based finance''.<ref name=\"COP-19\"/> The GCF currently finances REDD+ programs in phase 1 (design of national strategies or action plans, capacity building) and phase 2 (implementation of national strategies or action plans, demonstration programs). It is currently finalizing an approach to REDD+ results-based payments.\n\nREDD+ is also eligible for inclusion under CORSIA, the International Civil Aviation Organization's market-based greenhouse gas offset mechanism <http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx>.\n\n== Implementing REDD+ ==\nDecision 1/CP.16, paragraph 73, suggests that national capacity for implementing REDD+ is built up in phases, \"beginning with the development of national strategies or action plans, policies and measures, and capacity-building, followed by the implementation of national policies and measures and national strategies or action plans that could involve further capacity-building, technology development and transfer and results-based demonstration activities, and evolving into results-based actions that should be fully measured, reported and verified\".<ref name=\"COP-16\"/> The initial phase of the development of national strategies and action plans and capacity building is typically referred to as the \"Readiness phase\" (a term like ''Reddiness'' is also encountered).\n\nThere is a very substantial number of REDD+ projects globally and this section lists only a selection. One of the more comprehensive online tools with up-to-date information on REDD+ projects is the [http://www.fao.org/forestry/vrd/en/ Voluntary REDD+ Database].\n\n=== Readiness activities ===\nMost REDD+ activities or projects implemented since the call for demonstration activities in Decision 2/CP.13 December 2007<ref name=\"COP-13\" /> are focused on readiness, which is not surprising given that REDD+ and its requirements were completely new to all developing countries.\n\n* '''UN-REDD Programme''' UNDP, UNEP and FAO jointly established the [[UN-REDD Programme]] in 2007, a partnership aimed at assisting developing countries in addressing certain measures needed in order to effectively participate in the REDD+ mechanism.

The first countries will begin to negotiate contracts for these payments, and begin implementation of their programs, in 2017.\n\n=== Results-based actions ===\nFollowing the Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus,  the first country had submitted a Biennial Update Report with a Technical Annex containing the details on emission reductions from REDD+ eligible activities. Brazil submitted its first Biennial Update Report on 31 December 2014.<ref>http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/brbur1.pdf</ref> The Technical Annex covers the [[Amazon biome]] within Brazil's territory, a little under half of the national territory, reporting emission reductions against Brazil's previously submitted reference emission level of 2,971.02 MtCO<sub>2</sub>e from a reduction in deforestation. This Technical Annex was reviewed through the International Consultation and Analysis process and on 22 September 2015 a technical report was issued by the UNFCCC which states that \"the LULUCF experts consider that the data and information provided in the technical annex are transparent, consistent, complete and accurate\" (paragraph 38).<ref>http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/tatr/eng/bra.pdf</ref> Considering that Brazil is only reporting on emission reductions from deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, the technical review identified several areas of improvement (paragraph 34):\n\n<blockquote>(a) Continuation in updating and improving the carbon density map, including through the use of improved ground data from Brazil\u2019s first national forest inventory, possibly prioritizing geographic areas where deforestation is more likely to occur;\n\n(b) Expansion of the coverage of carbon pools, including improving the understanding of soil carbon dynamics after the conversion of forests to non-forests;\n\n(c) Consideration of the treatment of non-CO2 gases to maintain consistency with the GHG inventory;\n\n(d) Continuation of the improvements related to monitoring of forest degradation;\n\n(e) Expansion of the forest monitoring system to cover additional biomes.</blockquote>\n\nSeveral additional countries have followed closely behind Brazil.\n\n== Concerns ==\nSince the first discussion on REDD+ in 2005, and particularly at COP-13 in 2007 and COP-15 in 2009, many concerns have been voiced on aspects of the REDD+ programme. Though it is widely understood that the REDD+ programme will need to undergo full-scale implementation in the near-future, many challenges need resolving before this can happen.\n\nOne of the largest issues is how reduced emissions and the removal of greenhouse gases will be monitored consistently on a large scale, across a number of countries, each with separate environmental agencies and laws. Other issues relate to the conflict between the REDD+ approach and existing national development strategies, the participation of forest communities and indigenous peoples in the design and maintenance of REDD+, the programme's funding, and the consistent monitoring of said funding to ensure equitable distribution across programme members.\n\nIn response to concerns, the COP has responded by establishing REDD+ safeguards, though these themselves face criticism for being overly generic, non-enforcable, and failing to establish a specific set of requirements for participation in the REDD+ programme.\n\n=== Natural forests vs. high-density plantations ===\n''Safeguard (e): That actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the [REDD+] actions \u2026 are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits. Footnote to this safeguard: Taking into account the need for sustainable livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local communities and their interdependence on forests in most countries, reflected in the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], as well as the International [[Pachamama|Mother Earth]] Day.''\n\nThe UNFCCC does not define what constitutes a forest; it only requires that Parties communicate to the UNFCCC on how they define a forest.  The UNFCCC does suggest using a definition in terms of minimal area, minimal crown coverage and minimal height at maturity of perennial vegetation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\nWhile there is a safeguard against the conversion of natural forest, developing country Parties are free to include plantations of commercial tree species (including exotics like [[Eucalyptus]] spp., [[Pinus]] spp., [[Acacia]] spp.), agricultural tree crops (e.g. [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]], [[mango]], [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]], [[citrus]]), or even non-tree species such as palms ([[Elaeis guineensis|oil palm]], [[coconut]], [[Date palm|dates]]) and [[bamboo]] (a grass){{citation needed|date=September 2019}}.

In the absence of guidance from the COP, two options were debated by the international community at large:\n# a market-based approach;\n# a fund-based approach where Annex I countries would deposit substantial amounts of money into a fund administered by some multi-lateral entity.\n\nUnder the market-based approach, REDD+ would act as an \"offset scheme\" in which verified results-based actions translate into some form of carbon credits, more-or-less analogous to the market for [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CER) under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol. Such carbon credits could then offset emissions in the country or company of the buyer of the carbon credits. This would require Annex I countries to agree to deeper cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases in order to create a market for the carbon credits from REDD+, which is unlikely to happen soon given the current state of negotiations in the COP, but even then there is the fear that the market will be flooded with carbon credits, depressing the price to levels where REDD+ is no longer an economically viable option.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0305-carbon.html |title=Why Europe Torpedoed the REDD Forest-For-Carbon Credits Initiative |author=Butler, Rhett |date=Mar 5, 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-23 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713130047/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0305-carbon.html |archivedate=13 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last= Karsenty |first= Alain |title= What the (carbon) market cannot do... |publisher= CIRAD |date= Nov 2009 |url= http://www.rightsandresources.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=1374 |accessdate= 2012-02-15 |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121028122728/http://www.rightsandresources.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=1374 |archivedate= 28 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}</ref> Some developing countries, such as Brazil and China, maintain that developed countries must commit to real emissions reductions, independent of any offset mechanism.<ref>{{Citation | last = von der Goltz | first = Jan | title = High Stakes in a Complex Game: A Snapshot of the Climate Change Negotiating Positions of Major Developing Country Emitters | publisher = [[Center for Global Development]]| date = August 10, 2009 | url = http://www.cgdev.org/files/1422602_file_High_Stakes_FINAL081009.pdf | accessdate = }}</ref>\n\nSince COP-17, however, it has become clear that the REDD+ may be financed by a variety of sources, market and non-market.

For example, the World Bank and the UN-REDD Programme, the two largest sources of funding and technical assistance for readiness activities and therefore unavoidable for most developing countries, place requirements upon recipient countries that are arguably not mandated or required by the COP decisions. A body of research suggests that, at least as of 2016, REDD+ as a global architecture has only had a limited effect on local political realities, as pre-existing entrenched power dynamics and incentives that promote deforestation are not easily changed by the relatively small sums of money that REDD+ has delivered to date. In addition, issues like land tenure that fundamentally determine who makes decisions about land use and deforestation have not been adequately addressed by REDD+, and there is no clear consensus on how complex political issues like land tenure can be easily resolved to favor standing forests over cleared forests through a relatively top-down mechanism like REDD+.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi=10.18352/ijc.593|title = Multilevel governance challenges in transitioning towards a national approach for REDD+: Evidence from 23 subnational REDD+ initiatives| journal=International Journal of the Commons| volume=9| issue=2| pages=909|year = 2015|last1 = Ravikumar|first1 = Ashwin| last2=Larson| first2=Anne M.| last3=Duchelle| first3=Amy E.| last4=Myers| first4=Rodd| last5=Gonzales Tovar| first5=Jazmin}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.11.008 | volume=21 | issue=2 | title=Forest tenure reform in the age of climate change: Lessons for REDD+ | journal=Global Environmental Change | pages=540\u2013549| year=2011 | last1=Larson | first1=Anne M. }}</ref><ref>http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/BAngelsen120105.pdf</ref><ref>{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.013 | volume=55 | title=How are REDD+ Proponents Addressing Tenure Problems?

They are the customer tests that demonstrate the business intent of a system. Component tests are technical acceptance tests developed by an architect that specify the behavior of large modules.  Unit tests are created by the developer to drive easy-to-maintain code.<ref>[Test-driven_development]</ref> They are often derived from acceptance tests and unit tests.  Cross-functional testing includes usability testing,<ref>Meszaros, Gerard, and Janice Aston.

Addison-Wesley.</ref>\n\n== Acceptance criteria and tests ==\n\nAcceptance criteria are a description of what would be checked by a test. Given a requirement such as \"As a user, I want to check out a book from the library\", an acceptance criterion might be, \"verify the book is marked as checked out\". An acceptance test for this requirement gives the details so that the test can be run with the same effect each time.\n\n=== Test format ===\n\nAcceptance tests usually follow this form:<ref name=\"Pugh11\" />\n\n'''Given (setup)'''\n\n: A specified state of a system\n\n'''When (trigger)'''\n\n: An action or event occurs\n\n'''Then (verification)'''\n\n: The state of the system has changed or an output has been produced\n\nAlso, it is possible to add Statements that start with '''AND''' in any of the sections below (Given, When, Then).\n\nFor the example requirement, the steps could be listed as:<syntaxhighlight lang=\"cucumber\">\nGiven Book that has not been checked out\nAnd User who is registered on the system\nWhen User checks out a book\nThen Book is marked as checked out\n</syntaxhighlight>\n\n=== Complete test ===\n\nThe previous steps do not include any specific example data, so that is added to complete the test:\n\n'''Given:'''\n\n: Book that has not been checked out\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Books\n|\n|-\n| Title || Checked out\n|-\n| Great book || No\n|}\n\n: User who is registered on the system\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Users\n|-\n| Name || Sam\n|}\n\n'''When:'''\n\n: User checks out a book\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Checkout action\n|-\n| User || Sam || Checks out || Great book\n|}\n\n'''Then:'''\n\n: Book is marked as checked out\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Books\n|-\n| Title || Checked out || User\n|-\n| Great book || Yes || Sam\n|}\n\n=== Test examination ===\n\nExamination of the test with specific data usually leads to many questions. For the sample, these might be:\n\n* What if the book is already checked out?\n* What if the book does not exist?\n* What if the user is not registered on the system?\n* Is there a date that the book is due to be checked-in?\n* How many books can a user check out?\n\nThese questions help illuminate missing or ambiguous requirements.  Additional details such as a due-date can be added to the expected result.  Other acceptance tests can check that conditions such as attempting to check out a book that is already checked out produces the expected error.\n\n=== Another test example ===\n\nSuppose the business customer wanted a business rule that a user could only check out one book at a time.  The following test would demonstrate that:\n\n'''Scenario:'''\nCheck that checkout business rule is enforced\n\n'''Given:'''\n\n: Book that has been checked out\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Error occurred\n|-\n| Description\n|-\n| Violation of checkout business rule\n|}\n\n=== Project acceptance tests ===\n\nIn addition to acceptance tests for requirements, acceptance tests can be used on a project as a whole.<ref name=\"Pugh11\" /> For example, if this requirement was part of a library book checkout project, there could be acceptance tests for the whole project. These are often termed [[SMART criteria|SMART objectives]].

The leader of the group is dating a girl who seems sympathetic for the boy, but is not brave enough to stand up for him. There are numerous shots of the band playing in a moonlit forest. Throughout the video, the jock repeatedly attacks the boy, including spraying warm showers on him in the locker room and dumping a Strawberry shake on him in class, tripping him, pushing him into walls, smacking him with a towel, splashing bathroom water on his face, etc. Meanwhile, the teenager crosses off dates on a calendar in his locker. He circles the last date, the 28th, which is labeled, \"Full Moon\".  That night, he watches the jocks' leader who bullied him, waiting by the forest for his girlfriend who lured him to the forest by asking to meet him there so that the teenage boy could get revenge on him. The teenager throws a balloon filled with cottage cheese at the jock's car to provoke him to chase him deeper into the forest. The song prepares for the solo as the jock chases the boy through the forest.  As the guitar solo starts, the teenager falls down on his knees and the full moon comes out of the clouds, turning him into a werewolf. The bully approaches the now changed boy. Once the jock sees the teenage victim's face, the jock is horrified and tries to run, and is presumably killed by the werewolf. Blood drips from the werewolf's mouth and hands, and the next day at school, there is a new sign displaying the original bully as missing. Now another jock tries to show his anger towards the victim and tries to harass him a little bit. The girl from the old bully runs up and hugs him, hinting that now she's going out with him after news that the leader went missing. As the other jock walks off with the girl, she looks at the teenager, giving him a look of \"I'm on your side\" and he sees her eyes glow red (revealing that she also is a werewolf like himself). He smiles knowing that her new \"boyfriend\" will be the next victim, and crosses out the first day of the next month waiting for the full moon to come again, implying that the new jock won't be able to harass him so easily.\n\n==Track listing==\n;iTunes Single <ref>{{cite web|title = iTunes Store: Waking The Demon - Single|url = https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/waking-the-demon-single/id278685568 | publisher = [[Apple Inc.]] |date = 26 April 2008 | accessdate = 16 March 2010 }}</ref>\n# \"Waking the Demon\" \u2013 4:07\n# \"Say Goodnight\" (acoustic version) \u2013 3:14\n\n==Personnel==\n'''Bullet for My Valentine'''\n*Matthew \"Matt\" Tuck{{snd}}lead vocals, rhythm guitar\n*Jason \"Jay\" James{{snd}}bass guitar, backing vocals\n*Michael \"Padge\" Paget{{snd}}lead guitar\n*Michael \"Moose\" Thomas{{snd}}drums, percussion\n\n'''Production'''\n*Produced by [[Colin Richardson]]\n*Music video directed by Max Nicols\n\n==Release history==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The city itself was founded as the capital of [[Mughal Empire]] in 1571 by [[Mughal Emperor|Emperor]] [[Akbar]], serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and was later completely abandoned in 1610.<ref name=\"Routlegde\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9A-EAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82#v=onepage&f=false|title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture|author=Andrew Petersen|publisher=Routlegde|page=82|isbn=9781134613656|date=11 March 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the city is derived from the village called ''Sikri'' which occupied the spot before. An [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) excavation from 1999-2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by [[Sunga]]s following their expansion. In 12th century, it was briefly controlled by [[Sakarwar|Sikarwar]] Rajputs.\n\nThe ''[[khanqah]]'' of [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]] [[Salim Chisti|Salim]] existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] was born at the village of Sikri in 1569 and that year Akbar began construction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to be known as ''Fatehpur Sikri'', the \"City of Victory\", after Akbar's [[Akbar's conquest of Gujarat|victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573]].\n\nAfter occupying [[Agra]] in 1803, the English established an administrative center here and it remained so until 1850. In 1815, the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Marquess of Hastings]] ordered repair of monuments at Sikri.\n\n==History==\nArchaeological evidence points to settlement of the region since the [[Painted Grey Ware culture|Painted Grey Ware period]]. According to historian Syed Ali Nadeem Rezavi, region flourished under [[Sunga]] rule and then under [[Sakarwar|Sikarwar]] Rajputs, who built a fortress when they controlled the area briefly in the 12th century.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Rezavi |first1=Syed Ali Nadeem |title=Sikri before Akbar |date=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-908256-8 |url=https://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780198084037.001.0001/acprof-9780198084037-chapter-2 |accessdate=13 January 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Safvi |first1=Rana |title=The secrets about Fatehpur Sikri |url=https://www.thehindu.com/opinion/columns/the-secrets-about-fatehpur-sikri/article21381895.ece |accessdate=13 January 2020 |work=The Hindu |date=10 December 2017 |language=en-IN}}</ref> \n\nBasing his arguments on the excavations by the [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) in 1999\u20132000 at the Chabeli Tila, senior [[Agra]] journalist Bhanu Pratap Singh said the antique pieces, statues, and structures all point to a lost \"culture and religious site,\" more than 1,000 years ago. \"The excavations yielded a rich crop of [[Jainism|Jain]] statues, hundreds of them, including the foundation stone of a temple with the date.

In the center of the nearby lake, he built a large platform. A [[baoli]] exists at the base of a rock scarp about a kilometer from the [[Hiran Minar]]. This was probably the original site of a well-known [[Epigraphy|epigraph]] commemorating his victory.<ref name=Asher/>\n\n[[Abul Fazl]] records Akbar's reasons for the foundation of the city in ''[[Akbarnama]]'': \"Inasmuch as his exalted sons [Salim and [[Murad Mirza|Murad]]] had been born at Sikri, and the God-knowing spirit of Shaikh Salim had taken possession thereof, his holy heart desired to give outward splendour to this spot which possessed spiritual grandeur.

After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace probably to test his son's stamina.

It was named after the Sikri village which had existed on the spot before. It was abandoned by Akbar in 1585 when he went to fight a campaign in Punjab. It was later completely abandoned by 1610.

The gate was added around five years after the completion of the mosque c. 1576-1577 as a victory arch, to commemorate [[Akbar]]'s successful Gujarat campaign. It carries two inscriptions in the archway, one of which reads: \"Isa, Son of Mariam said: The world is a bridge, pass over it, but build no houses on it. He who hopes for an hour may hope for eternity. The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen\". <br/> The central portico comprises three arched entrances, with the largest one, in the centre, is known locally as the Horseshoe Gate, after the custom of nailing horseshoes to its large wooden doors for luck. Outside the giant steps of the Buland Darwaza to the left is a deep well.\n* [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri|Jama Masjid]]: It is a ''[[Jama Mosque]]'' meaning the congregational mosque and was perhaps one of the first buildings to be constructed in the complex, as its epigraph gives [[Hijri year|AH]] 979 (A.D. 1571-72) as the date of its completion, with a massive entrance to the courtyard, the Buland-Darwaza added some five years later. It was built in the manner of Indian mosques, with iwans around a central courtyard. A distinguishing feature is the row of [[chhatri]] over the sanctuary. There are three [[mihrab]]s in each of the seven bays, while the large central mihrab is covered by a dome, it is decorated with white marble [[inlay]], in geometric patterns.\n* [[Tomb of Salim Chishti]]: A white marble encased tomb of the [[Sufi]] saint, [[Salim Chisti]] (1478\u20131572), within the Jama Masjid's ''[[sahn]]'', courtyard. The single-storey structure is built around a central square chamber, within which is the grave of the saint, under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with [[mother-of-pearl]] mosaic. Surrounding it is a covered passageway for [[circumambulation]], with carved ''[[Jali]]s'', stone pierced screens all around with intricate geometric design and an entrance to the south. The tomb is influenced by earlier mausolea of the early 15th century [[Gujarat Sultanate]] period. Other striking features of the tomb are white marble serpentine [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s, which support sloping [[eave]]s around the [[parapet]]. <br/> On the left of the tomb, to the east, stands a red sandstone tomb of [[Islam Khan I]], son of Shaikh Badruddin Chisti and grandson of Shaikh Salim Chishti, who became a general in the Mughal army in the reign of [[Jahangir]]. The tomb is topped by a dome and thirty-six small domed ''[[chattri]]s'' and contains a number of graves, some unnamed, all male descendants of Shaikh Salim Chisti.\n* Diwan-i-Aam: ''Diwan-i-Aam'' or Hall of Public Audience, is a building typology found in many cities where the ruler meets the general public. In this case, it is a pavilion-like multi-bayed rectangular structure fronting a large open space. South west of the Diwan-i-Am and next to the Turkic Sultana's House stand Turkic Baths.\n* Diwan-i-Khas: the ''Diwan-i-Khas'' or Hall of Private Audience, is a plain square building with four ''chhatris'' on the roof. However it is famous for its central pillar, which has a square base and an octagonal shaft, both carved with bands of geometric and floral designs, further its thirty-six serpentine [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s support a circular platform for Akbar, which is connected to each corner of the building on the first floor, by four stone walkways. It is here that Akbar had representatives of different religions discuss their faiths and gave private audience.\n* [[Ibadat Khana]]: (House of Worship) was a meeting house built in 1575 CE by the Mughal Emperor Akbar, where the foundations of a new [[Syncretistic]] faith, ''[[Din-e-Ilahi]]'' were laid by Akbar.\n* Anup Talao: Anup Talao was built by Raja Anup Singh Sikarwar A ornamental pool with a central platform and four bridges leading up to it. Some of the important buildings of the royal enclave are surround by it including, ''Khwabgah'' (House of Dreams) Akbar's residence, ''Panch Mahal'', a five-storey palace, ''Diwan-i-Khas''(Hall of Private Audience), ''Ankh Michauli'' and the Astrologer's Seat, in the south-west corner of the Pachisi Court.\n* Hujra-i-Anup Talao: Said to be the residence of Akbar's Muslim wife, although this is disputed due to its small size.\n* [[Mariam-uz-Zamani]]'s Palace: The building of Akbar's Rajput wives, including [[Mariam-uz-Zamani]], shows Gujarati influence and is built around a courtyard, with special care being taken to ensure privacy.\n* [[Naubat Khana]]: Also known as [[Naqqar Khana]] meaning a ''drum house'', where musician used drums to announce the arrival of the Emperor. It is situated ahead of the ''Hathi Pol Gate'' or the Elephant Gate, the south entrance to the complex, suggesting that it was the imperial entrance.\n* Pachisi Court: A square marked out as a large board game, the precursor to modern day [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]] game where people served as the playing pieces.\n* [[Panch Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri|Panch Mahal]]: A five-storied palatial structure, with the tiers gradually diminishing in size, till the final one, which is a single large-domed [[chhatri]]. Originally pierced stone screens faced the facade and probably sub-divided the interior as well, suggesting it was built for the ladies of the court. The floors are supported by intricately carved columns on each level, totalling to 176 columns in all.\n* [[Birbal]]'s House: The house of Akbar's favourite minister, who was a Hindu. Notable features of the building are the horizontal sloping sunshades or ''chajjas'' and the brackets which support them.\n* Hiran Minar: The Hiran Minar, or Elephant Tower, is a circular tower covered with stone projections in the form of elephant tusks. Traditionally it was thought to have been erected as a memorial to the Emperor Akbar's favourite elephant. However, it was probably a used as a starting point for subsequent mileposts.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/apac/photocoll/g/019pho000001003u00568000.html|title=General view of the Hiran Minar, Fatehpur Sikri|first=Colin|last=Wright|website=www.bl.uk|accessdate=13 December 2019}}</ref>\n\nOther buildings included ''Taksal'' (mint), ''Daftar Khana'' (Records Office), ''Karkhana'' (royal workshop), ''Khazana'' (Treasury), ''Hammam'' (Turkic Baths), ''Darogha's'' Quarters, stables, Caravan sarai, [[Hakim (title)|Hakim]]'s quarters, etc.\n\n==Demographics==\nAs of [[2011 Indian Census]], Fatehpur Sikri had a total population of 32,905, of which 17,392 were males and 15,513 were females.

[[India]]. The city itself was founded as the capital of [[Mughal Empire]] in 1571 by [[Mughal Emperor|Emperor]] [[Akbar]], serving this role from 1571 to 1585, when Akbar abandoned it due to a campaign in [[Punjab (region)|Punjab]] and was later completely abandoned in 1610.<ref name=\"Routlegde\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9A-EAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA82#v=onepage&f=false|title=Dictionary of Islamic Architecture|author=Andrew Petersen|publisher=Routlegde|page=82|isbn=9781134613656|date=11 March 2002}}</ref>\n\nThe name of the city is derived from the village called ''Sikri'' which occupied the spot before. An [[Archaeological Survey of India]] (ASI) excavation from 1999-2000 indicated that there was a habitation, temples and commercial centres here before Akbar built his capital. The region was settled by [[Sunga]]s following their expansion. In 12th century, it was briefly controlled by [[Sakarwar|Sikarwar]] Rajputs.\n\nThe ''[[khanqah]]'' of [[Sheikh (Sufism)|Sheikh]] [[Salim Chisti|Salim]] existed earlier at this place. Akbar's son [[Jahangir]] was born at the village of Sikri in 1569 and that year Akbar began construction of a religious compound to commemorate the Sheikh who had predicted the birth. After Jahangir's second birthday, he began the construction of a walled city and imperial palace here. The city came to be known as ''Fatehpur Sikri'', the \"City of Victory\", after Akbar's [[Akbar's conquest of Gujarat|victorious Gujarat campaign in 1573]].\n\nAfter occupying [[Agra]] in 1803, the English established an administrative center here and it remained so until 1850. In 1815, the [[Francis Rawdon-Hastings, 1st Marquess of Hastings|Marquess of Hastings]] ordered repair of monuments at Sikri.\n\n==History==\nArchaeological evidence points to settlement of the region since the [[Painted Grey Ware culture|Painted Grey Ware period]].

The gate was added around five years after the completion of the mosque c. 1576-1577 as a victory arch, to commemorate [[Akbar]]'s successful Gujarat campaign. It carries two inscriptions in the archway, one of which reads: \"Isa, Son of Mariam said: The world is a bridge, pass over it, but build no houses on it. He who hopes for an hour may hope for eternity. The world endures but an hour. Spend it in prayer, for the rest is unseen\". <br/> The central portico comprises three arched entrances, with the largest one, in the centre, is known locally as the Horseshoe Gate, after the custom of nailing horseshoes to its large wooden doors for luck. Outside the giant steps of the Buland Darwaza to the left is a deep well.\n* [[Jama Masjid, Fatehpur Sikri|Jama Masjid]]: It is a ''[[Jama Mosque]]'' meaning the congregational mosque and was perhaps one of the first buildings to be constructed in the complex, as its epigraph gives [[Hijri year|AH]] 979 (A.D. 1571-72) as the date of its completion, with a massive entrance to the courtyard, the Buland-Darwaza added some five years later. It was built in the manner of Indian mosques, with iwans around a central courtyard. A distinguishing feature is the row of [[chhatri]] over the sanctuary. There are three [[mihrab]]s in each of the seven bays, while the large central mihrab is covered by a dome, it is decorated with white marble [[inlay]], in geometric patterns.\n* [[Tomb of Salim Chishti]]: A white marble encased tomb of the [[Sufi]] saint, [[Salim Chisti]] (1478\u20131572), within the Jama Masjid's ''[[sahn]]'', courtyard. The single-storey structure is built around a central square chamber, within which is the grave of the saint, under an ornate wooden canopy encrusted with [[mother-of-pearl]] mosaic. Surrounding it is a covered passageway for [[circumambulation]], with carved ''[[Jali]]s'', stone pierced screens all around with intricate geometric design and an entrance to the south. The tomb is influenced by earlier mausolea of the early 15th century [[Gujarat Sultanate]] period. Other striking features of the tomb are white marble serpentine [[Bracket (architecture)|bracket]]s, which support sloping [[eave]]s around the [[parapet]]. <br/> On the left of the tomb, to the east, stands a red sandstone tomb of [[Islam Khan I]], son of Shaikh Badruddin Chisti and grandson of Shaikh Salim Chishti, who became a general in the Mughal army in the reign of [[Jahangir]].

It is situated ahead of the ''Hathi Pol Gate'' or the Elephant Gate, the south entrance to the complex, suggesting that it was the imperial entrance.\n* Pachisi Court: A square marked out as a large board game, the precursor to modern day [[Ludo (board game)|Ludo]] game where people served as the playing pieces.\n* [[Panch Mahal, Fatehpur Sikri|Panch Mahal]]: A five-storied palatial structure, with the tiers gradually diminishing in size, till the final one, which is a single large-domed [[chhatri]]. Originally pierced stone screens faced the facade and probably sub-divided the interior as well, suggesting it was built for the ladies of the court. The floors are supported by intricately carved columns on each level, totalling to 176 columns in all.\n* [[Birbal]]'s House: The house of Akbar's favourite minister, who was a Hindu. Notable features of the building are the horizontal sloping sunshades or ''chajjas'' and the brackets which support them.\n* Hiran Minar: The Hiran Minar, or Elephant Tower, is a circular tower covered with stone projections in the form of elephant tusks. Traditionally it was thought to have been erected as a memorial to the Emperor Akbar's favourite elephant.

She leaned her arms upon the warm parapet and slowly twirled her parasol. She twirled it because she was slightly ill at ease.
