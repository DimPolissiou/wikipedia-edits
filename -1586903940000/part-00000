It was first published in 1973 as part of Walker's short story collection ''In Love and Trouble''.\n\nThe short story is told in  [[first-person narrative|first person]] by \"Mama\", an African-American woman living in the [[Deep South]] with one of her two daughters. The story follows the differences between Mrs. Johnson and her shy younger daughter Maggie, who both still adhere to traditional black culture in the rural South, and her educated, successful daughter Dee, or \"Wangero\" as she prefers to be called, who takes a different route to reclaiming her cultural identity.\n\nA film version was released in 2005.\n\n==<span lang=\"fa\" dir=\"rtl\">Plot</span>==\nThe story opens on Mama waiting in the yard for her oldest daughter, Dee\u2019s, visit.  She reflects on the differences between Dee and Maggie, her youngest daughter, and knows that Maggie will be anxious and self-conscious around Dee. Maggie was burned in a house fire that happened more than a decade ago. Mama carried her out in her arms, as Dee watched the house burn. Dee was seemingly happy and excited about the fire, due to her extreme dislike for the house. The narrator continues to paint a picture of Maggie as helpless and rather awkward, whereas Dee is beautiful and seems to have had an easier time in life.\n\nDee left home to pursue an education in Augusta, afforded to her by Mama and the community\u2019s fund raising efforts. Mama never attended school past second grade, and Maggie has a very limited reading ability, so Dee\u2019s education is a stark difference and Mama seems to feel that starkness, commenting, \u201clike dimwits, we seemed about to understand\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" />  Mama discusses the physical differences between the three: her own manly looks, Maggie\u2019s timid disposition, and Dee\u2019s own nice hair, full figure, and stylish way of dress.\n\nWhen Dee finally arrives, she is accompanied by a man, whom Mama refers to as Hakim-a-barber. Mama and Maggie are a little taken aback by Dee's wild-looking outfit and her African greeting to them. Dee takes photos of Mama and Maggie in front of the house, and the greetings are stiff and unfamiliar. Dee informs her mother that she has now changed her name to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo in order to protest the oppression and cultural white washing Black Americans faced. Mama rejects this, telling Dee she was named after her Aunt Dicie, who in turn was named after Grandma Dee, and that the name went on through the generations. Dee gives Mama the option of not using her new name, and Mama concludes that Hakim-a-barber must be related to a family of Muslims down the road. Hakim-a-barber says he accepts some of the doctrines of his beef-raising family, but is not interested in farming or herding as a profession.\n\nMama does not know whether Hakim-a-barber and Dee are married, nor does she ask. Hakim-a-barber has a restricted diet to follow, but Dee digs into the food Mama made. She begins asking for things around the house, like the top of a butter churn, and eventually she asks for two quilts as well.  This quilt in particular is one that Mama had promised to Maggie, and Dee\u2019s persistence frustrates Mama which develops into an argument between Mama and Dee. Dee argues that by using the quilt as a normal item, in \u201ceveryday use\u201d, the quilt will be ruined, and the cultural importance will be lost. Mama would rather the item be used practically by her family and be ruined than have it sit on a shelf or be hung on a wall as a piece of art, and as Dee readies to leave, she tells Mama that Mama doesn\u2019t understand her own heritage.  She adds that Mama should try and improve, and that there is a new path for Black Americans to follow. Maggie and Mama sit in the yard after watching them drive off, until bedtime.\n\n==Characters==\n* '''Dee''' \u2013 She is an educated African-American woman and the eldest daughter of Mama. She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship with their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

She seeks to embrace her cultural identity through changing her name from Dee to Wangero Leewanika Kemanjo (an African name), marrying a Muslim man, and acquiring artifacts from Mama's house to put on display, an approach that puts her at odds with Mama and Maggie.  She is physically beautiful and is described as having a great sense of style.\n* '''Mama''' \u2013 She is described as a \"large, big-boned woman with rough, man-working hands.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  She enjoys her lifestyle (especially milking cows) and did not receive an education past second grade.\n* '''Maggie''' \u2013 Described by Mama as dull and unattractive, the youngest daughter Maggie has burn scars and marks from the burning down of their prior home, and is very nervous and self-conscious because of it. She leads a simple and traditional life with her mother in the South while her elder sister, Dee, is away at school.  She has very limited reading ability, unlike her sister Dee.\n* '''Hakim-a-barber''' \u2013 Dee\u2019s partner, he is referred to as \"Asalamalakim\", which is a Muslim greeting, throughout the story because he is Muslim.  Eventually he tells Mama to call him \"Hakim-a-barber\" due to Mama being unable to pronounce his real name.\n\n\n== Themes ==\nOne of the primary themes that the story revolves around is the idea of a person's relationship to their heritage.<ref name=\":2\">{{Citation|last=Walker, Alice, 1944-|title=Everyday use|date=2004|publisher=Recording for the Blind & Dyslexic|oclc=55770645}}</ref> In the story, Dee's mother remained close to immediate family traditions, while Dee herself chose to search more deeply into her African roots. Because of her different mindset, she does not have the same ideals as Mama and Maggie, particularly in regard to cultural preservation and the best way to go about it. Dee (Wangero) only wants the family heirlooms to display in her home for their \"artistic value\" whereas Maggie and her mother cherish these items because they \"remind them of their loved ones.\"<ref name=\":2\" /> In Mama\u2019s mind, Maggie learning to make her own quilt and putting it to \"everyday use\" is preserving the culture. She believes it should be used and if they \"end up in rags,\" more quilts can simply be made. <ref name=\":1\" /> On the other hand, Dee believes the proper way to preserve her culture is to display the quilt in her home and preserve the quilt itself.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.enotes.com/topics/everyday-use/themes|title=Everyday Use Themes - eNotes.com|website=eNotes|access-date=2016-11-03}}</ref> \n\n== Point of view ==\nBecause this story is told in [[first-person narrative|first-person]] the readers \"watch\" the story unfold through the eyes and opinions of Mama.  As Maggie and Mama wait for Dee to arrive for a visit Mama's mind wanders with various thoughts and memories of Dee, giving the audience an impartial view of Dee as being self-centered and uncaring.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Farrell|first=Susan|title=Fight vs. Flight: a re-evaluation of Dee in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Literature Resource Center|volume= 35|issue= 2|via=}}</ref> Due to the fact that readers are getting only one view point it is uncertain if Dee truly does exhibit these characteristics or if it is only Mama's opinion of the eldest daughter that is being forced upon us.  It is thought by some that Mama does not judge Dee, nor Maggie, accurately due to Mama's own insecurities.<ref name=\":0\" />   This is evidenced during Mama's daydream of Dee and herself on an imaginary popular talk show under the context of children who have \"made it\".<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://intensiveenglish1.weebly.com/uploads/1/3/0/4/13041485/everyday_use_full-text.pdf|title=Everyday Use|website=weebly.com}}</ref> Mama notes being over-weight and rough around the edges and eludes to the fact that Dee is ashamed of Mama's appearance.<ref name=\":1\" />  As Mama continues to narrate the story the audience continues to get a sense of Dee's snobbish personality, along with moments of doubt as readers see glimpses of Mamas own short comings.  As the story concludes the audience is left with the vision of Mama and Maggie remaining alone, once again, on the front lawn; happy to be rid of Dee and the exhausting perfection as they bask in the simplicity of each other and the straight forward life that has been built.\n\n===Interpretations===\nIn the essay \"'Everyday Use' and the Black Power Movement\" by [[Barbara Christian|Barbara T. Christian]], the story is discussed in reference to slavery and the black power movement. The characters in the story focus a lot on African culture and heritage. Traditional African clothing is described throughout the story, and this is a symbol of the family's heritage. The mentioning of changing names relates back to slavery as well; the characters were trying to forget about their slave names, and think of more traditional names to remember their culture and \"[affirm] their African roots.\" Christian brings to light the difference in attitudes and perspectives about a shared culture. Christian points out that to Maggie and her mother, honoring their culture meant honoring the personal past of their family, by carrying on their names or putting the quilt to use, while to Dee, that meant honoring aesthetic and ancient traditions, such as traditional African names or hanging the quilt to be seen but not utilized. It is this very realization that leads to their mother choosing to give Maggie the quilts. <ref>{{Cite book|title=\"everyday use\" and the black power movement|last=Christian|first=Barbara|publisher=Pearson|year=1994|isbn=0-13-458638-7|location=|pages=492\u2013494}}</ref>\n\nOn the other hand, in the essay \"'Everyday Use' as a Portrait of the Artist\" by Mary Helen Washington, the story is looked at from a more artistic and cultural perspective. The essay describes Dee as an artist who \"returns home...in order to collect the material,\" which indicates that Dee comes home for a deeper understanding of her African culture. Although she changes her name from Dee to a more Native African name and wears African clothing, she lacks real knowledge of her culture. Because of this, Mama chooses Maggie over Dee to take the quilts, because Maggie shows more appreciation and knowledge of their culture and as she said in the story was involved in the making of those quilts whereas Dee had no part in.\n\nIn the essay \u201cStylish vs. Sacred in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d written by Houston A. Baker and Charlotte Pierce-Baker Dee or Wangero is called a \u201cgoddess\u201d. After highlighting a few passages from the story, it is mentioned that Dee/ Wangero has joined the black nationalists of the 1960s and 1970s and she shows it by changing both her name and her style. The essay doesn\u2019t see Dee/ Wangero as an activist of that cause but as someone being \u201cmanipulated by the style-makers\u201d as illustrated by the scene in which she described the quilt, for which she passionately fought for later in the story, as \u201cold-fashioned and out of style\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Baker |first1=Houston A. |last2=Pierce-Baker |first2=Charlotte |title=Patches: Quilts and Community in Alice Walker's\" Everyday Use\" |journal=The Southern Review |date=1985 |volume=21 |issue=3}}</ref>\n\n===Symbolism===\n{{Original research|section|date=August 2015}}\nOne symbol found in this short story is the quilt. The quilt itself is a very meaningful item in the sense that it has history in it. It includes clothes that Dee's great grandma used to wear and pieces of uniforms that Dee's great grandpa wore during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\":1\" />  However, it also symbolizes value in [[African-Americans|Negro-American]] experience.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cash|first=Floris Barnett|date=2012-02-22|title=Kinship and Quilting: An Examination of an African-American Tradition|url=https://faculty.risd.edu/bcampbel/cash-quilting.pdf|journal=The Journal of Negro History|volume=80|pages=30\u201341|doi=10.2307/2717705|jstor=2717705|via=}}</ref> The quilt additionally adds to the idea of creative activities women came up with to pass down history from generation to generation as a part of their heritage.\n\nAnother symbol found in \u201cEveryday Use\u201d is the yard. The yard plays an important role in the story and is described as \u201can extended living room\u201d. Mama and Maggie have both tidied up the yard in preparation of Dee\u2019s visit, and sit out in the yard for hours, even after Dee\u2019s departure. The yard seems to be a place to think for Mama, where she can imagine herself being someone more conventionally attractive than she actually is, but also remember just how much she has done for her family.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.sparknotes.com/short-stories/everyday-use/themes.html|title=SparkNotes: Everyday Use: Themes, Motifs, and Symbols|website=www.sparknotes.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-05}}</ref>\n\n===Quilting===\nIn the African-American community, women have engaged in the tradition of quilting since they were brought to America as slaves. Quilting requires sewing pieces of cloth together to create a coverlet that functions as both a piece of art and a household item. African-American women, often regarded as voiceless \u2018mule(s) of the world\u2019, inherited such creative legacies from maternal ancestors and their quilts have come to represent black heritage.<ref>{{Cite journal|title=In Search of Our Mothers' Gardens|journal=Within the Circle: An Anthology of African American Literary Criticism from the Harlem Renaissance to the Present|first=Alice|last=Walker|publisher=(Durham and London: Duke University Press, 1994)|page=402}}</ref> The voices of African-American women have been stitched into their quilts, providing an account of their cultural past. As Sam Whitsitt observes, the quilt reflects the experiences of African-American women: the quilt is a symbol reflective of \u2018herstory, history, and tradition\u2019.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Sam|last=Whitsitt| title=In Spite of It All: A Reading of Alice Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=African American Review|volume=34|date=2000|issue=3|pages=443\u2013459 (445)|doi=10.2307/2901383|jstor=2901383}}</ref> The self-expression involved in quilt-making allowed women to take control of their lives through the only medium society permitted them to use. The communal nature of quilting strengthened the bonds of sisterhood and helped to move marginalized women from enslavement to empowerment. Quilting allowed these women to assert control over the colonial practice of slavery as enforced by white hegemony. Historically, products such as cotton and indigo dye were acquired as a result of black oppression. By sewing cotton into their quilts, African-American slaves formed a bond with nature, which replaced the hegemonic relationship enforced by slavery.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Jennifer|last=Martin|title=The Quilt Threads Together Sisterhood, Empowerment and Nature in Alice Walker's ''The Colour Purple'' and \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Journal of Intercultural Disciplines|volume=14|date=2014|pages=27\u201343 (38)}}</ref>\n\nBlack slaves often attended communal Quilting Bees, which offered these oppressed women the opportunity to create social bonds unsupervised. Thus, quilting became a symbol of sisterly solidarity for African-American slaves. Additionally, quilting functioned as a response to cultural and political change, allowing opportunity for political debate. Black women used quilting as a source of activism: their quilts often depicted anti-slavery slogans. However, quilting also came to represent the hegemony of patriarchal society. Women were often forced to learn to quilt, which became a substitute for the more \u2018masculine\u2019 activity of reading and writing.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Elaine|last=Hedges|title=Quilts and Women's Culture|journal=The Radical Teacher|volume=4|date=1977|pages=7\u201310 (10)}}</ref>\n\nQuilting features in \u2018Everyday Use\u2019 as a symbol of black heritage. Mama Johnson\u2019s quilts symbolizes cross-generational female bonding: they were sewn together by Grandma Dee, passed down to and then quilted by Mama and her sister, Big Dee. One quilt even features a piece of the war uniform worn by their Great Grandpa Ezra during the Civil War. These quilts represent the creativity of the sisterhood that created them; however, Mama\u2019s daughters, Maggie and Dee, view them very differently. Dee visits her family, intending to collect the artifacts of her family\u2019s past; she wants to display them in her home with museum-like accuracy. As David Cowart notes, \u2018The visitor [Dee] rightly recognizes the quilts as part of a fragile heritage, but she fails to see the extent to which she herself has traduced that heritage.\u2019<ref>{{Cite journal|first=David|last=Cowart|title=Heritage and Deracination in Walker's \"Everyday Use\"|journal=Studies in Short Fiction|volume=33|date=1996|pages=171\u2013183 (172)}}</ref> The story\u2019s climax, which sees Mama give the quilts to Maggie, rather than Dee, is viewed as representative of the quilts\u2019 functionality. Dee views the quilts as worthy of museum display (\"Maggie can't appreciate these quilts!...She'd probably be backward enough to put them to everyday use.\"), whilst Maggie treats them as household items (\"I been saving 'em for long enough with nobody using 'em. I hope [ Maggie puts them to \u2018everyday use\u2019]!\u201d).<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Walker|title=Everyday Use|journal=In Love and Trouble|publisher=New York: Harvest Books, 1974)|pages= 314\u2013321 (p. 320)}}</ref> Both Mama and Maggie recognise that the quilt is meant for \u2018everyday use\u2019, as practiced by their ancestors.\n\n==Reception==\nIn critical readings of this article, the largest trend regarding this story has been to criticize Dee and the way she goes about her personal cultural reclamation.  However, Matthew Mullins argues in his essay, ''Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker\u2019s \u201cEveryday Use\u201d'', that this perspective isn\u2019t necessarily fair.  He found in reading and teaching the text, Dee was universally a disliked character, saying that in an epiphany he found in his defense of Dee rather a pitying attitude and concluding that \u201cit was impossible to see how anyone could truly \u2018like\u2019 Dee\u201d.  This, however, he goes on to point out as not being a direct result of Dee\u2019s actions alone, but rather the framing of her actions in the story.  He argues that the text itself is what antagonizes the reader to grow this dislike of Dee: \u201cThe first-person narrative voice, the fact that Mrs. Johnson [Mama] is both narrator and character, has an immediate and forceful effect upon our perception of Dee.\u201d  Mullins backs this up by quoting another scholar, Wayne Booth, who said in his work The Rhetoric of Fiction, \u201cNo narrator [\u2026] is simply convincing: he is convincingly decent or mean, brilliant or stupid, informed, intelligent, or muddled. [\u2026] we usually find our emotional and intellectual reactions to him as a character affects our reactions to the events he relates.\u201d  Mullins points out that if Dee herself, or even Maggie, were the narrators of the story, we would come away with a completely different perspective on probably all of the characters.  \u201cThe text actively prevents us from identifying with Dee,\u201d and this perspective has shaped the scholarly resources on this text since it came out.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mullins|first1=Matthew|title=Antagonized by the Text, Or, It Takes Two to Read Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Journal of the Southern Comparative Literature Association|date=May 2013|volume=37|pages=37\u201353|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2013392796&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\nJoe Sarnowski, in his article ''Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker\u2019s \u2018Everyday Use\u2019'', also points out this discrepancy but taking it one step further, arguing that even though it would be naive to claim Dee doesn\u2019t have faults, she, \u201cmore than any other character in the story, identifies and pursues corrective measures against the oppression of African-American society and culture.\u201d  Her fault, Sarnowski says, is in not realizing how idealism and pragmatism are \u201cintertwined\u201d and how \u201cprivileging one undermines both\u201d.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Sarnowski|first1=Joe|title=Destroying to Save: Idealism and Pragmatism in Alice Walker's 'Everyday Use'|journal=Papers on Language and Literature: A Journal for Scholars and Critics of Language and Literature|date=2012|volume=48|issue=3|pages=269\u2013286|url=https://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&db=mzh&AN=2012582914&site=ehost-live|accessdate=November 28, 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* Walker, Alice. \"Everyday Use.\" ''The Story and Its Writer''.

Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification|late 80s-early 90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[NOFX]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012 respectively. The trilogy did not perform as well as expected commercially in comparison to their previous albums largely due to lack of promotion and lead singer and guitarist [[Billie Joe Armstrong]] going into rehab. Their twelfth studio album, ''[[Revolution Radio]]'', was released in October 2016 and became their third to debut at No. 1 on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]]. The band's thirteenth studio album, ''[[Father of All Motherfuckers]]'', was released on February 7, 2020.\n\nGreen Day has sold more than 75 million records worldwide, making them one of the [[List of best-selling music artists|best-selling music artists]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2014/10/09/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-nominees-green-day-nine-inch-nails-lou-reed/16852249/|title=Green Day, Nine Inch Nails among Rock Hall nominees|work=[[USA Today]]|date=October 9, 2014|accessdate=February 15, 2020}}</ref> The group has been nominated for 20 Grammy awards and has won five of them with [[Best Alternative Music Album|Best Alternative Album]] for ''[[Dookie]]'', [[Best Rock Album]] for ''[[American Idiot]]'' and ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', [[Record of the Year]] for \"[[Boulevard of Broken Dreams (Green Day song)|Boulevard of Broken Dreams]]\", and [[Best Musical Show Album]] for ''[[American Idiot: The Original Broadway Cast Recording]]''.\n\nIn 2010, a [[American Idiot (musical)|stage adaptation of ''American Idiot'']] debuted on Broadway.

For much of the band's career, they have been a trio with drummer [[Tr\u00e9 Cool]], who replaced [[John Kiffmeyer]] in 1990 prior to the recording of the band's second studio album, ''[[Kerplunk (album)|Kerplunk]]'' (1991). Touring guitarist [[Jason White (musician)|Jason White]] became a full-time member in 2012, but returned to his role as a touring member in 2016.\n\nGreen Day was originally part of the [[Punk rock#1979\u20131984: Schism and diversification|late 80s-early 90s punk scene]] at the DIY [[924 Gilman Street]] club in [[Berkeley, California]]. The band's early releases were with the independent record label [[Lookout! Records]]. In 1994, their major label debut ''[[Dookie]]'', released through [[Reprise Records]], became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands [[NOFX]], [[Sublime (band)|Sublime]], [[Bad Religion]], [[the Offspring]], and [[Rancid (band)|Rancid]] with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the U.S.\n\nThough the albums ''[[Insomniac (Green Day album)|Insomniac]]'' (1995), ''[[Nimrod (album)|Nimrod]]'' (1997), and ''[[Warning (Green Day album)|Warning]]'' (2000) did not match the success of ''Dookie'', they were still successful with the former two reaching triple platinum status while the latter achieved gold. Green Day's seventh album, a [[rock opera]] called ''[[American Idiot]]'' (2004), found popularity with a younger generation, selling six million copies in the U.S. Their next album, ''[[21st Century Breakdown]]'', was released in 2009 and achieved the band's best chart performance. It was followed by a trilogy of albums, ''[[\u00a1Uno!]]'', ''[[\u00a1Dos!]]'', and ''[[\u00a1Tr\u00e9!]]'', released in September, November, and December 2012 respectively.

Rockefeller Republicans were most common in the Northeast and the West Coast with their larger liberal constituencies while they were rare in the South and Midwest.<ref>Reiter (1981)</ref> They often saw themselves as champions of \"good government\", contrasting themselves to the often corrupt [[Political machine|machine politics]] of the Democratic Party, particularly in large cities.\n\nRockefeller Republicanism has been described as the last phase of the \"'''Eastern Establishment'''\" of the GOP which had been led by New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The group's powerful role in the GOP came under heavy attack during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1964|1964 primary campaign]] between Rockefeller and [[Barry Goldwater]]. At a discouraging point before the California primary, political operative [[Stuart Spencer (political consultant)|Stuart Spencer]] called on Rockefeller to \"summon that fabled nexus of money, influence, and condescension  known as the Eastern Establishment.\" Rockefeller replied, \"You are looking at it, buddy, I am all that is left\".{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=xxi}}\n\n[[Michael Lind]] contends that the ascendancy of the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Fusionism|fusionist-wing]] of the Republican Party,{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=53-54}} beginning in the 1960s with Goldwater and culminating in the [[Reagan Revolution]] in 1980, prevented the establishment of a [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraelian]] [[one-nation conservatism]] in the United States.{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=45-46}}{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=55}} In its current usage, the term refers to \"[a] member of the Republican Party holding views likened to those of Nelson Rockefeller; a moderate or liberal Republican\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rockefeller_republican|title=Rockefeller Republican {{!}} Definition of Rockefeller Republican in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"Rockefeller Republican\" has come to be used in a pejorative sense by [[Movement conservatism|modern conservatives]], who use it to deride those in the Republican Party that are perceived to have views which are too liberal, especially on major social issues.{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=63}} The term was adopted mostly because of Nelson Rockefeller's vocal support of civil rights and lavish spending policies.{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=63}} However, historian Justin P. Coffey has stated that Rockefeller's liberalism is a myth,{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=64}} with former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] pointing out that the reality was quite different, stating that: \"A lot of people considered Rockefeller very liberal and very dovish on foreign policy, but he was not. He was harder than Nixon, and a lot more hawkish about the mission of America in the world\".{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=64}}\n\n== Political positions ==\nIn domestic policy, Rockefeller Republicans were typically moderate to [[center-right]] economically,{{sfn|Libby|2013|p=77}} vehemently rejected [[American conservatism|conservatives]] like [[Barry Goldwater]], and held beliefs in social policies that were often [[Cultural liberalism|culturally liberal]]. They espoused government and private investments in [[environmentalism]], [[healthcare]], and [[higher education]] as necessities for a better society and economic growth in the tradition of Rockefeller. They were strong supporters of state colleges and universities, low tuition and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements such as highway projects.\n\nIn general, Rockefeller Republicans opposed [[socialism]] and [[government ownership]], though they supported some regulation of business. They typically favored [[New Deal]] programs and a [[social safety net]] and sought to run these programs more efficiently than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Baldi|2012|p=51}} They were strong supporters of [[big business]] and [[Wall Street]]. Many Rockefeller Republicans were major figures in business, such as auto executive [[George W. Romney]] and investment banker [[C. Douglas Dillon]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019|reason=Need source for claims Romney and Dillon identified as Rockefeller Republicans}} In fiscal policy, they favored balanced budgets and were not averse to raising taxes in order to achieve them. Connecticut Senator [[Prescott Bush]] once called for Congress to \"raise the required revenues by approving whatever levels of taxation may be necessary\".{{sfn|Micklethwait|Woolridge|2005|page=29}} A critical element was their support for [[labor union]]s and especially the [[building trades]] appreciated the heavy spending on [[infrastructure]]. In turn, the unions gave these politicians enough support to overcome the [[anti-union]] rural element in the Republican Party. As the unions weakened after the 1970s, so too did the need for Republicans to cooperate with them. This transformation played into the hands of the more [[Timeline of modern American conservatism|conservative]] Republicans, who did not want to collaborate with labor unions in the first place and now no longer needed to do so to carry statewide elections.<ref>Rae. ''Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, they tended to be [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]], espousing [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] policies, supporting the [[United Nations]] and promoting American business interests abroad. Most wanted to use American power in cooperation with allies to fight against the spread of [[Soviet communism]] and help American business expand abroad. [[Richard Nixon]], a moderate [[political establishment|establishment]] Republican within the party's contemporary ideological framework, was influenced by this tradition.\n\n== History ==\n[[Thomas E. Dewey]], the [[Governor of New York]] from 1942 to 1954 and the Republican presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948, was the leader of the moderate-wing of the Republican Party in the 1940s and early 1950s, battling conservative Republicans from the Midwest led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio, known as \"Mr. Republican\". With the help of Dewey, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] defeated Taft for the 1952 presidential nomination and became the leader of the moderates. Eisenhower coined the phrase \"Modern Republicanism\" to describe his moderate vision of Republicanism. After Eisenhower, [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the Governor of New York, emerged as the leader of the moderate-wing of the Republican Party, running for President in 1960, 1964 and 1968. Rockefeller Republicans suffered a crushing defeat in 1964 when conservatives captured control of the Republican Party and nominated Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona for president.\n\nOther prominent figures in the GOP's Rockefeller-wing included Connecticut Senator [[Prescott Bush]], Pennsylvania Governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]], Pennsylvania Senator [[Hugh Scott]], Illinois Senator [[Charles H. Percy]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], Maine Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]], New York Senator [[Jacob Javits]], and Arkansas Governor [[Winthrop Rockefeller]], Nelson's younger brother (who was somewhat of an aberration in the [[Conservative Democrat|conservative, heavily Democratic]] South). Some also include President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>[[Halberstam, David]] (1993). ''[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]''. The Random House Publishing Group.

That set the stage for a conservative resurgence, based in the South and West in opposition to the Northeast Rockefeller wing. However, the moderate contingent recaptured control of the party and nominated Richard Nixon in 1968. Easily reelected in 1972, after his resignation Nixon was replaced as President by the moderately conservative Republican [[Gerald Ford]]. After Vice President Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called \"moderate Republicans\" or Nixonians in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to [[Ronald Reagan]]. Four years after nearly toppling the incumbent Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries, conservative [[Ronald Reagan]] won the party's presidential nomination at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] and served two terms in the White House.\n\nBy 1988, the Republicans had chosen [[Prescott Bush]]'s son [[George H. W. Bush]] as its presidential candidate on a conservative platform. Bush's [[1988 Republican National Convention|national convention]] pledge to stave off new taxation were he elected president ([[Read my lips: no new taxes|\"Read my lips: no new taxes!\"]]) marked the candidate's full conversion to the conservative movement and perhaps the political death knell for Rockefeller Republicanism as a prevailing force within party politics.\n\nEthnic changes{{clarify|date=May 2017}} in the Northeast may have led to the demise of the Rockefeller Republican.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Many Republican leaders associated with this title were [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s like [[Charles Mathias]] of [[Maryland]]. Liberal New York Republican Senator [[Jacob Javits]], who had an [[Americans for Democratic Action]] rating above 90% and an [[American Conservative Union]] rating below 10%, was Jewish. As time went on, the local Republican parties in the Northeast tended to nominate [[Catholic]] candidates who appealed to [[middle class]] social values-laden concerns, such as [[George Pataki]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Al D'Amato]], [[Rick Lazio]], [[Tom Ridge]], [[Chris Christie]] and others, who in many cases represented the party's diversity more on the basis of religion and were often otherwise like their Protestant conservative counterparts.\n\nWith their power decreasing in the final decades of the 20th century, many moderate Republicans were replaced by conservative and moderate Democrats, such as those from the [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog]] or [[New Democrat Coalition|New Democrat]] coalitions. [[Michael Lind]] contends that by the mid-90s the liberalism of President [[Bill Clinton]] and the [[New Democrats]] were in many ways to the right of [[Dwight D.

Rockefeller Republicans were most common in the Northeast and the West Coast with their larger liberal constituencies while they were rare in the South and Midwest.<ref>Reiter (1981)</ref> They often saw themselves as champions of \"good government\", contrasting themselves to the often corrupt [[Political machine|machine politics]] of the Democratic Party, particularly in large cities.\n\nRockefeller Republicanism has been described as the last phase of the \"'''Eastern Establishment'''\" of the GOP which had been led by New York governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]]. The group's powerful role in the GOP came under heavy attack during the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 1964|1964 primary campaign]] between Rockefeller and [[Barry Goldwater]]. At a discouraging point before the California primary, political operative [[Stuart Spencer (political consultant)|Stuart Spencer]] called on Rockefeller to \"summon that fabled nexus of money, influence, and condescension  known as the Eastern Establishment.\" Rockefeller replied, \"You are looking at it, buddy, I am all that is left\".{{sfn|Smith|2014|p=xxi}}\n\n[[Michael Lind]] contends that the ascendancy of the more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Fusionism|fusionist-wing]] of the Republican Party,{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=53-54}} beginning in the 1960s with Goldwater and culminating in the [[Reagan Revolution]] in 1980, prevented the establishment of a [[Benjamin Disraeli|Disraelian]] [[one-nation conservatism]] in the United States.{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=45-46}}{{sfn|Lind|1997|pp=55}} In its current usage, the term refers to \"[a] member of the Republican Party holding views likened to those of Nelson Rockefeller; a moderate or liberal Republican\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rockefeller_republican|title=Rockefeller Republican {{!}} Definition of Rockefeller Republican in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2017-10-31}}</ref>\n\nThe phrase \"Rockefeller Republican\" has come to be used in a pejorative sense by [[Movement conservatism|modern conservatives]], who use it to deride those in the Republican Party that are perceived to have views which are too liberal, especially on major social issues.{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=63}} The term was adopted mostly because of Nelson Rockefeller's vocal support of civil rights and lavish spending policies.{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=63}} However, historian Justin P. Coffey has stated that Rockefeller's liberalism is a myth,{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=64}} with former Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]] pointing out that the reality was quite different, stating that: \"A lot of people considered Rockefeller very liberal and very dovish on foreign policy, but he was not. He was harder than Nixon, and a lot more hawkish about the mission of America in the world\".{{sfn|Coffey|2015|p=64}}\n\n== Political positions ==\nIn domestic policy, Rockefeller Republicans were typically moderate to [[center-right]] economically,{{sfn|Libby|2013|p=77}} vehemently rejected [[American conservatism|conservatives]] like [[Barry Goldwater]], and held beliefs in social policies that were often [[Cultural liberalism|culturally liberal]]. They espoused government and private investments in [[environmentalism]], [[healthcare]], and [[higher education]] as necessities for a better society and economic growth in the tradition of Rockefeller. They were strong supporters of state colleges and universities, low tuition and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements such as highway projects.\n\nIn general, Rockefeller Republicans opposed [[socialism]] and [[government ownership]], though they supported some regulation of business. They typically favored [[New Deal]] programs and a [[social safety net]] and sought to run these programs more efficiently than the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].{{sfn|Baldi|2012|p=51}} They were strong supporters of [[big business]] and [[Wall Street]]. Many Rockefeller Republicans were major figures in business, such as auto executive [[George W. Romney]] and investment banker [[C. Douglas Dillon]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2019|reason=Need source for claims Romney and Dillon identified as Rockefeller Republicans}} In fiscal policy, they favored balanced budgets and were not averse to raising taxes in order to achieve them. Connecticut Senator [[Prescott Bush]] once called for Congress to \"raise the required revenues by approving whatever levels of taxation may be necessary\".{{sfn|Micklethwait|Woolridge|2005|page=29}} A critical element was their support for [[labor union]]s and especially the [[building trades]] appreciated the heavy spending on [[infrastructure]]. In turn, the unions gave these politicians enough support to overcome the [[anti-union]] rural element in the Republican Party. As the unions weakened after the 1970s, so too did the need for Republicans to cooperate with them. This transformation played into the hands of the more [[Timeline of modern American conservatism|conservative]] Republicans, who did not want to collaborate with labor unions in the first place and now no longer needed to do so to carry statewide elections.<ref>Rae. ''Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: 1952 to the Present'' (1989)</ref>\n\nIn foreign policy, they tended to be [[Alexander Hamilton|Hamiltonian]], espousing [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] and [[Realism (international relations)|realist]] policies, supporting the [[United Nations]] and promoting American business interests abroad. Most wanted to use American power in cooperation with allies to fight against the spread of [[Soviet communism]] and help American business expand abroad. [[Richard Nixon]], a moderate [[political establishment|establishment]] Republican within the party's contemporary ideological framework, was influenced by this tradition.\n\n== History ==\n[[Thomas E. Dewey]], the [[Governor of New York]] from 1942 to 1954 and the Republican presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948, was the leader of the moderate-wing of the Republican Party in the 1940s and early 1950s, battling conservative Republicans from the Midwest led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio, known as \"Mr. Republican\". With the help of Dewey, General [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] defeated Taft for the 1952 presidential nomination and became the leader of the moderates. Eisenhower coined the phrase \"Modern Republicanism\" to describe his moderate vision of Republicanism. After Eisenhower, [[Nelson Rockefeller]], the Governor of New York, emerged as the leader of the moderate-wing of the Republican Party, running for President in 1960, 1964 and 1968. Rockefeller Republicans suffered a crushing defeat in 1964 when conservatives captured control of the Republican Party and nominated Senator [[Barry Goldwater]] of Arizona for President.\n\nOther prominent figures in the GOP's Rockefeller-wing included Connecticut Senator [[Prescott Bush]], Pennsylvania Governor [[Raymond P. Shafer]], Pennsylvania Senator [[Hugh Scott]], Illinois Senator [[Charles H. Percy]], Oregon Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], Maine Senator [[Margaret Chase Smith]], New York Senator [[Jacob Javits]], and Arkansas Governor [[Winthrop Rockefeller]], Nelson's younger brother (who was somewhat of an aberration in the [[Conservative Democrat|conservative, heavily Democratic]] South). Some also include President [[Richard Nixon]].<ref>[[Halberstam, David]] (1993). ''[[The Fifties (book)|The Fifties]]''. The Random House Publishing Group.

That set the stage for a conservative resurgence, based in the South and West in opposition to the Northeast Rockefeller wing. However, the moderate contingent recaptured control of the party and nominated Richard Nixon in 1968. Easily reelected in 1972, after his resignation Nixon was replaced as President by the moderately conservative Republican [[Gerald Ford]]. After Vice President Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called \"moderate Republicans\" or Nixonians in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to [[Ronald Reagan]]. Four years after nearly toppling the incumbent Ford in the 1976 presidential primaries, conservative [[Ronald Reagan]] won the party's presidential nomination at the [[1980 Republican National Convention]] and served two terms in the White House.\n\nBy 1988, the Republicans had chosen [[Prescott Bush]]'s son [[George H. W. Bush]] as its presidential candidate on a conservative platform. Bush's [[1988 Republican National Convention|national convention]] pledge to stave off new taxation were he elected president ([[Read my lips: no new taxes|\"Read my lips: no new taxes!\"]]) marked the candidate's full conversion to the conservative movement and perhaps the political death knell for Rockefeller Republicanism as a prevailing force within party politics.\n\nEthnic changes{{clarify|date=May 2017}} in the Northeast may have led to the demise of the Rockefeller Republican.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Many Republican leaders associated with this title were [[White Anglo-Saxon Protestant]]s like [[Charles Mathias]] of [[Maryland]]. Liberal New York Republican Senator [[Jacob Javits]], who had an [[Americans for Democratic Action]] rating above 90% and an [[American Conservative Union]] rating below 10%, was Jewish. As time went on, the local Republican parties in the Northeast tended to nominate [[Catholic]] candidates who appealed to [[middle class]] social values-laden concerns, such as [[George Pataki]], [[Rudy Giuliani]], [[Al D'Amato]], [[Rick Lazio]], [[Tom Ridge]], [[Chris Christie]] and others, who in many cases represented the party's diversity more on the basis of religion and were often otherwise like their Protestant conservative counterparts.\n\nWith their power decreasing in the final decades of the 20th century, many moderate Republicans were replaced by conservative and moderate Democrats, such as those from the [[Blue Dog Coalition|Blue Dog]] or [[New Democrat Coalition|New Democrat]] coalitions. [[Michael Lind]] contends that by the mid-90s the liberalism of President [[Bill Clinton]] and the [[New Democrats]] were in many ways to the right of [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]], Rockefeller, and [[John Lindsay]], the Republican mayor of New York City in the late 1960s.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Up From Conservatives|last=Lind|first=Michael|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=263}}</ref> In 2009, [[CNN]] published an analysis describing how liberal and moderate Republicans had declined by the start of the 21st century.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/05/06/liberal.republicans/|title=Analysis: An autopsy of liberal Republicans|last=Silverleib|first=Alan|website=cnn.com|access-date=2018-07-08}}</ref> In 2010, [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] was elected to the Senate to fill the seat once held by Democratic Senator Edward Kennedy.

It ran for 168 episodes (six seasons) from September 17, 1965, to April 4, 1971, on the [[CBS]] network, the longest broadcast run for an American television series inspired by that war.\n\n[[Bob Crane]] starred as Colonel Robert E. Hogan, coordinating an international crew of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prisoners running a [[Special forces|special operations]] group from the camp. [[Werner Klemperer]] played Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the gullible commandant of the camp, and [[John Banner]] played the blundering but lovable sergeant-of-the-guard, Sergeant Hans Schultz.\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main|List of Hogan's Heroes episodes}}\n''Hogan's Heroes'' centers on [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] Colonel Robert Hogan and his staff of experts who are prisoners of war (POW) in 1942. The plot occurs in the fictional Stalag 13, located in an unspecified place in [[Nazi Germany]], where the [[winter]] season is permanent.  One episode, \"Anchors Aweigh, Men of Stalag 13\" mentions the camp being located 60 miles from the North Sea. Although the nearby town of Hammelburg shares a name with a city in Bavaria, this is coincidental.  The group secretly use the camp to conduct Allied [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]] and to help escaped Allied POWs from other prison camps via a secret network of [[escape tunnel|tunnels]] that operate under the ineptitude of [[Commandant (rank)|commandant]] Colonel Klink and his main [[Sergeant#Germany|Sergeant]] Schultz. The prisoners cooperate with [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] groups (collectively called \"the Underground\"), defectors, spies, counterspies, and disloyal officers to accomplish this. They devise schemes such as having Sergeant Andrew Carter visit the camp disguised as [[Adolf Hitler]] as a distraction, or rescuing a [[French Underground Resistance|French Underground]] agent from [[Gestapo]] headquarters in [[Paris]].\n\nKlink technically has a perfect operational record as camp commandant as no prisoners have successfully escaped during his tenure; Hogan and his men assist in maintaining this record so they can continue with their covert operations. Because of Klink's record, and the fact that the Allies would never bomb a POW camp, Stalag 13 appears to be a very secure location. As a result, the Germans often use the camp for high level meetings, to hide important persons and develop secret projects. Klink frequently has many other important visitors and is temporarily put in charge of special prisoners. This brings the prisoners in contact with many important VIPs, scientists, spies, high-ranking officers, and some of Germany's most sophisticated and secret weapons projects such as the [[Wunderwaffe]] and the [[German nuclear weapons program]], of which the prisoners take advantage in their efforts to hinder the German war effort.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n!

The setting is the fictional ''[[Stalag|Luft Stalag]]''&nbsp;13, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] for captured [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen.  Like the historical [[Stalag XIII-C]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uncommon-travel-germany.com/stalag_13.html | title=Stalag 13 History: What Really Happened There?}}</ref> it is located just outside of a town called [[Hammelburg]], though it is inconsistently placed throughout the series. In the second-season episode \"Killer Klink\", Sergeant Schultz states that the camp is {{convert|106.7|km|mi}} away from his home in [[Heidelberg]] by direct flight; this is well reflective of Heidelberg's direct distance from the actual [[Hammelburg]]. The show is a combination of several writing styles that were popular in the 60s: the \"wartime\" show, the \"spy\" show, and \"camp comedy\".\n\nAlthough in reality Hammelburg is well inland in [[Franconia]], several first-season episodes place the camp closer to the [[North Sea]] (perhaps to make successful escapes to England more plausible).  In \"Anchors Aweigh, Men of Stalag 13\", Colonel Klink specifies that the camp is {{convert|60|mi|km}} from the North Sea; three episodes earlier (\"Hogan's Hofbrau\"), he had stated that the coast was a mere {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=in}} away. To complicate matters even further, it is mentioned in several episodes (e.g. \"The Safecracker Suite\") that the nearest major city to the camp is [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], which is also fairly far inland and by air is about {{convert|157|mi|km}} from the actual Hammelburg.\n\nThe camp has 103 Allied [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) during the first season, but becomes larger by the end of the series.\n\nIn Stalag 13 it is always a snowy winter. Beyond recreating an extreme or adverse setting, this was to prevent problems with continuity and to allow the episodes to be shown in any order. The result is a cold place \"where time has stopped\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Hogan's Heroes characters}}\n[[File:Hogan's Heroes main cast 1965.jpg|thumb|The cast of the show.

Klemperer remarked, \"I had one qualification when I took the job: if they ever wrote a segment whereby Colonel Klink would come out the hero, I would leave the show.\"<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/08/arts/werner-klemperer-klink-in-hogan-s-heroes-dies-at-80.html |title=Werner Klemperer, Klink in 'Hogan's Heroes,' Dies at 80|work=[[The New York Times]]|last=Weinraub|first=Bernard|date=December 8, 2000|accessdate=13 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[John Banner]] as Sergeant Hans Schultz, the camp's Sergeant at Arms.

Indoor sets were housed at [[Desilu Studios]], later renamed as Paramount Studios for Season Four and then Cinema General Studios for Seasons Five and Six. Outdoor scenes were filmed on the [[RKO Forty Acres|40 Acres]] [[Backlot]]. Both studios were in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]].<ref name=\"Royce\"/> Undoubtedly, one of the most original and curious aspects was to create the effect that there was always a snowy winter, something unusual in warm [[Southern California]], but normal in the German winter. The actors had to wear warm clothes and frequently look like they were cold, even though it was warm much of the year and frequently hot during summer. \n\nAlthough technically it was never snowing on the [[film set]] and the weather was apparently sunny, there was snow on the ground and building roofs, and frost on the windows.  The set designers created the illusion of snow two ways: the snow during the first several seasons was made out of [[salt]].  By the fourth season the show\u2019s producers found a more permanent solution and lower cost, using white paint to give the illusion of snow.  By the sixth and final season  &ndash; with a smaller budget &ndash; most of the snow shown on the set was made out of paint.\n\nAfter the series ended in 1971, the [[Stalag 13 (film set)|set]] remained standing until it was destroyed in 1974 while the final scene of ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]'' was filmed.<ref>{{cite book |title=Monsters in the Mirror: Representations of Nazism in Post-war Popular Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2baV57lS1QC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq |editors=Sara Buttsworth and Maartje Abbenhuis |page=105 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |accessdate=May 9, 2014|isbn=9780313382161 |year=2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Theme music ===\nThe theme music was composed by [[Jerry Fielding]], who added lyrics to the theme for ''Hogan's Heroes Sing The Best of World War II'' \u2013 an album featuring Dixon, Clary, Dawson, and Hovis singing World War II songs.

Furthermore, Klemperer, Banner, Askin, and Robert Clary (LeBeau) were Jews who had fled the Nazis during World War II. Clary says in the recorded commentary on the DVD version of episode \"Art for Hogan's Sake\" that he spent three years in a [[concentration camp]], that his parents and other family members were killed there, and that he has an identity tattoo from the camp on his arm (\"A-5714\"). Likewise, John Banner had been held in a (pre-war) [[concentration camp]] and his family was killed during the war. Leon Askin was also in pre-war France [[internment camp]] and his parents were killed at [[Treblinka]]. [[Howard Caine]], who was also Jewish (his birth name was Cohen), was American, and Jewish actors [[Harold Gould]] and [[Harold J. Stone]] made multiple appearances playing German generals. As a teenager, Klemperer fled Hitler's Germany with his family in 1933. During the show's production, he insisted that Hogan always win against his Nazi captors, or else he would not take the part of Klink. He defended his playing a Luftwaffe officer by claiming, \"I am an actor. If I can play Richard III, I can play a Nazi.\" Banner attempted to sum up the paradox of his role by saying, \"Who can play Nazis better than us Jews?\" Klemperer, Banner, Caine, Gould, and Askin play stereotypical World War II Germans, and all had served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II\u2014Banner<ref name=axis>{{cite web |title=John Banner aka \"Sergeant Schultz\" query\n|url=http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?p=1156096&sid=c707f6eafa5d7e79d3c9ff8cde7a55b8 |date=December 20, 2007 |publisher=Axis History Forum |accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> and Askin in the U.S. Army Air Corps, Caine in the U.S. Navy, Gould with the U.S. Army, and Klemperer in a [[Special Services (entertainment)|U.S. Army Entertainment Unit]]. [[Werner Klemperer]] had in 1961 starred as the title character in the serious drama ''[[Operation Eichmann (1961 film)|Operation Eichmann]]'', which also featured [[John Banner]] in a supporting role as a committed Nazi. [[Ruta Lee]], [[Theodore Marcuse]], and [[Oscar Beregi, Jr.]] also appeared in the film, each went on to make several guest appearances on ''Hogan\u2019s Heroes''.\n\n=== German release: ''Ein K\u00e4fig voller Helden'' ===\nDespite being an open [[parody]] of the Nazis and to its international success, the series was unknown on German television for decades due to the [[language barrier]]. One of the most notable inconsistencies of the show was that none of their characters spoke [[German language|German]] except for some single words, although the [[scenario]] was created in an imaginary Germany. This aspect was simply ignored to facilitate dialogue in English.\n\nGerman film distributor [[KirchGruppe]] acquired broadcasting rights to the show but initially did not air it out of fear that it would offend viewers. In 1992, episodes were shown on German television for the first time, but the program failed to connect with viewers due to issues with [[lip sync]]ing.<ref name=\"WSJ Article\" /> However, after the dialogue was rewritten to make the characters look even more foolish (which ensured that the viewers understood the characters were caricatures), the show became successful. \n\nThe show was first aired with a title that translates roughly as 'Barbed Wire and Heels'. Soon it was renamed, somewhat more whimsically in German to '[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_K%C3%A4fig_voller_Helden Ein K\u00e4fig voller Helden]' (\"A cage full of Heroes\"), to make it closer to the German viewer. Klink and Schultz's characters were given broad [[High German languages|Saxon]] and [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialects, playing on regional stereotypes to underline the notion that they are comic figures. An unseen original character -- \"Kalinke\"\u2014was introduced as Klink's cleaning lady and a perennial mistress who he described as performing most of her cleaning duties in the nude.<ref name=\"WSJ Article\">{{cite news |last=Steinmetz |first=Greg |title=In Germany Now, Col.

It ran for 168 episodes (six seasons) from September 17, 1965, to April 4, 1971, on the [[CBS]] network, the longest broadcast run for an American television series inspired by that war.\n\n[[Bob Crane]] starred as Colonel Robert E. Hogan, coordinating an international crew of [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] prisoners running a [[Special forces|special operations]] group from the camp. [[Werner Klemperer]] played Colonel Wilhelm Klink, the gullible commandant of the camp, and [[John Banner]] played the blundering but lovable sergeant-of-the-guard, Sergeant Hans Schultz.\n\n==Overview==\n{{Main|List of Hogan's Heroes episodes}}\n''Hogan's Heroes'' centers on [[U.S. Army Air Forces]] Colonel Robert Hogan and his staff of experts who are prisoners of war (POW) in 1942. The plot occurs in the fictional Stalag 13, located in an unspecified place in [[Nazi Germany]], where the [[winter]] season is permanent.  One episode, \"Anchors Aweigh, Men of Stalag 13\" mentions the camp being located 60 miles from the North Sea. Although the nearby town of Hammelburg shares a name with a city in Bavaria, this is coincidental.  The group secretly use the camp to conduct Allied [[espionage]] and [[sabotage]] and to help escaped Allied POWs from other prison camps via a secret network of [[escape tunnel|tunnels]] that operate under the ineptitude of [[Commandant (rank)|commandant]] Colonel Klink and his main [[Sergeant#Germany|Sergeant]] Schultz. The prisoners cooperate with [[Resistance during World War II|resistance]] groups (collectively called \"the Underground\"), defectors, spies, counterspies, and disloyal officers to accomplish this. They devise schemes such as having Sergeant Andrew Carter visit the camp disguised as [[Adolf Hitler]] as a distraction, or rescuing a [[French Underground Resistance|French Underground]] agent from [[Gestapo]] headquarters in [[Paris]].\n\nKlink technically has a perfect operational record as camp commandant as no prisoners have successfully escaped during his tenure; Hogan and his men assist in maintaining this record so they can continue with their covert operations. Because of Klink's record, and the fact that the Allies would never bomb a POW camp, Stalag 13 appears to be a very secure location. As a result, the Germans often use the camp for high level meetings, to hide important persons and develop secret projects. Klink frequently has many other important visitors and is temporarily put in charge of special prisoners. This brings the prisoners in contact with many important VIPs, scientists, spies, high-ranking officers, and some of Germany's most sophisticated and secret weapons projects such as the [[Wunderwaffe]] and the [[German nuclear weapons program]], of which the prisoners take advantage in their efforts to hinder the German war effort.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" rowspan=\"2\" |Season\n! rowspan=\"2\" |Episodes\n! colspan=\"2\" |Originally aired\n|-\n!

The setting is the fictional ''[[Stalag|Luft Stalag]]''&nbsp;13, a [[prisoner-of-war camp]] for captured [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] airmen.  Like the historical [[Stalag XIII-C]],<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.uncommon-travel-germany.com/stalag_13.html | title=Stalag 13 History: What Really Happened There?}}</ref> it is located just outside of a town called [[Hammelburg]], though it is inconsistently placed throughout the series. In the second-season episode \"Killer Klink\", Sergeant Schultz states that the camp is {{convert|106.7|km|mi}} away from his home in [[Heidelberg]] by direct flight; this is well reflective of Heidelberg's direct distance from the actual [[Hammelburg]]. The show is a combination of several writing styles that were popular in the 60s: the \"wartime\" show, the \"spy\" show, and \"camp comedy\".\n\nAlthough in reality Hammelburg is well inland in [[Franconia]], several first-season episodes place the camp closer to the [[North Sea]] (perhaps to make successful escapes to England more plausible).  In \"Anchors Aweigh, Men of Stalag 13\", Colonel Klink specifies that the camp is {{convert|60|mi|km}} from the North Sea; three episodes earlier (\"Hogan's Hofbrau\"), he had stated that the coast was a mere {{convert|5|mi|km|sigfig=1|spell=in}} away. To complicate matters even further, it is mentioned in several episodes (e.g. \"The Safecracker Suite\") that the nearest major city to the camp is [[D\u00fcsseldorf]], which is also fairly far inland and by air is about {{convert|157|mi|km}} from the actual Hammelburg.\n\nThe camp has 103 Allied [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] (POWs) during the first season, but becomes larger by the end of the series.\n\nIn Stalag 13 it is always a snowy winter. Beyond recreating an extreme or adverse setting, this was to prevent problems with continuity and to allow the episodes to be shown in any order. The result is a cold place \"where time has stopped\".\n\n==Cast==\n{{main|List of Hogan's Heroes characters}}\n[[File:Hogan's Heroes main cast 1965.jpg|thumb|The cast of the show.

Indoor sets were housed at [[Desilu Studios]], later renamed as Paramount Studios for Season Four and then Cinema General Studios for Seasons Five and Six. Outdoor scenes were filmed on the [[RKO Forty Acres|40 Acres]] [[Backlot]]. Both studios were in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], in the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]].<ref name=\"Royce\"/> Undoubtedly, one of the most original and curious aspects was to create the effect that there was always a snowy winter, something unusual in warm [[Southern California]], but normal in the German winter. The actors had to wear warm clothes and frequently look like they were cold, even though it was warm much of the year and frequently hot during summer. \n\nAlthough technically it was never snowing on the [[film set]] and the weather was apparently sunny, there was snow on the ground and building roofs, and frost on the windows.  The set designers created the illusion of snow two ways: the snow during the first several seasons was made out of [[salt]].  By the fourth season the show\u2019s producers found a more permanent solution and lower cost, using white paint to give the illusion of snow.  By the sixth and final season  &ndash; with a smaller budget &ndash; most of the snow shown on the set was made out of paint.\n\nAfter the series ended in 1971, the [[Stalag 13 (film set)|set]] remained standing until it was destroyed in 1974 while the final scene of ''[[Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS]]'' was filmed.<ref>{{cite book |title=Monsters in the Mirror: Representations of Nazism in Post-war Popular Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L2baV57lS1QC&pg=PA105&lpg=PA105&dq |editors=Sara Buttsworth and Maartje Abbenhuis |page=105 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |accessdate=May 9, 2014|isbn=9780313382161 |year=2010 }}</ref>\n\n=== Theme music ===\nThe theme music was composed by [[Jerry Fielding]], who added lyrics to the theme for ''Hogan's Heroes Sing The Best of World War II'' \u2013 an album featuring Dixon, Clary, Dawson, and Hovis singing World War II songs.

Furthermore, Klemperer, Banner, Askin, and Robert Clary (LeBeau) were Jews who had fled the Nazis during World War II. Clary says in the recorded commentary on the DVD version of episode \"Art for Hogan's Sake\" that he spent three years in a [[concentration camp]], that his parents and other family members were killed there, and that he has an identity tattoo from the camp on his arm (\"A-5714\"). Likewise, John Banner had been held in a (pre-war) [[concentration camp]] and his family was killed during the war. Leon Askin was also in pre-war France [[internment camp]] and his parents were killed at [[Treblinka]]. [[Howard Caine]], who was also Jewish (his birth name was Cohen), was American, and Jewish actors [[Harold Gould]] and [[Harold J. Stone]] made multiple appearances playing German generals. As a teenager, Klemperer fled Hitler's Germany with his family in 1933. During the show's production, he insisted that Hogan always win against his Nazi captors, or else he would not take the part of Klink. He defended his playing a Luftwaffe officer by claiming, \"I am an actor. If I can play Richard III, I can play a Nazi.\" Banner attempted to sum up the paradox of his role by saying, \"Who can play Nazis better than us Jews?\" Klemperer, Banner, Caine, Gould, and Askin play stereotypical World War II Germans, and all had served in the U.S. Armed Forces during World War II\u2014Banner<ref name=axis>{{cite web |title=John Banner aka \"Sergeant Schultz\" query\n|url=http://forum.axishistory.com/viewtopic.php?p=1156096&sid=c707f6eafa5d7e79d3c9ff8cde7a55b8 |date=December 20, 2007 |publisher=Axis History Forum |accessdate=2014-03-28}}</ref> and Askin in the U.S. Army Air Corps, Caine in the U.S. Navy, Gould with the U.S. Army, and Klemperer in a [[Special Services (entertainment)|U.S. Army Entertainment Unit]]. [[Werner Klemperer]] had in 1961 starred as the title character in the serious drama ''[[Operation Eichmann (1961 film)|Operation Eichmann]]'', which also featured [[John Banner]] in a supporting role as a committed Nazi. [[Ruta Lee]], [[Theodore Marcuse]], and [[Oscar Beregi, Jr.]] also appeared in the film, each went on to make several guest appearances on ''Hogan\u2019s Heroes''.\n\n=== German release: ''Ein K\u00e4fig voller Helden'' ===\nDespite being an open [[parody]] of the Nazis and to its international success, the series was unknown on German television for decades due to the [[language barrier]]. One of the most notable inconsistencies of the show was that none of their characters spoke [[German language|German]] except for some single words, although the [[scenario]] was created in an imaginary Germany. This aspect was simply ignored to facilitate dialogue in English.\n\nGerman film distributor [[KirchGruppe]] acquired broadcasting rights to the show but initially did not air it out of fear that it would offend viewers. In 1992, episodes were shown on German television for the first time, but the program failed to connect with viewers due to issues with [[lip sync]]ing.<ref name=\"WSJ Article\" /> However, after the dialogue was rewritten to make the characters look even more foolish (which ensured that the viewers understood the characters were caricatures), the show became successful. \n\nThe show was first aired with a title that translates roughly as 'Barbed Wire and Heels'. Soon it was renamed, somewhat more whimsically in German to '[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ein_K%C3%A4fig_voller_Helden Ein K\u00e4fig voller Helden]' (\"A cage full of Heroes\"), to make it closer to the German viewer. Klink and Schultz's characters were given broad [[High German languages|Saxon]] and [[Bavarian language|Bavarian]] dialects, playing on regional stereotypes to underline the notion that they are comic figures. An unseen original character -- \"Kalinke\"\u2014was introduced as Klink's cleaning lady and a perennial mistress who he described as performing most of her cleaning duties in the nude.<ref name=\"WSJ Article\">{{cite news |last=Steinmetz |first=Greg |title=In Germany Now, Col.
