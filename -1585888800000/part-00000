They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\n'''Susan Heffley''' (known as '''Ann Heffley''' in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\n'''Manny Heffley''' is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table.

It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin.

When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway.

Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins.

Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle.

It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids.

This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould.

He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him.

He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\nCredit to whoever made the chirag gupta article on fandom. \n\n\n\n\"Brech\" Gupta (/\u0251\u02d0lb\u0251\u02d0\u0261\u02c8d\u0251\u02d0di/; Arabic: \u0623\u0628\u0648 \u0628\u0643\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u063a\u062f\u0627\u062f\u064a\u200e; born Ibrahim Awad Ibrahim Ali al-Badri al-Samarrai .

Osama was later framed for crimes framklin had commited and was executed. Chirag would then go on to found the Gupta Empire in India before the tyrant Manny Heffley invaded India in an attempt to avenge the Nazi party.\n\nCurrent Timeline(2006 - 2010)\n\nChirag and Heffley and peppa pig were able to go to Russia and successfully contactnfjemlkff Joseph Stalin after tributing Rowley Jefferson, a suicidal meth dealer, to the 3rd Hell realm, Rowley later comes back to life with the dragon balls and kills Fregley Heffley, a pornstar who wished to bring him back to life just to have sex with him. Stalin asked Chirag to kill Heffley to show his honor for the motherland, but Chirag was hesitant. After calling a demon from the 6th realm, he put a spell on Stalin that wouldn't take him to the 9th hell, but the demon realm, to be eternally trapped unless through ritual of 3 lives. Greg and Chirag decide to make the world communist by force.\n\nWorld War 6, the battle for communist land (2010 - 2022)\n\nAfter Greg and Chirag bomb over 30 countries and force them into communism, they set their eyes on Germany. After many battles and wars, Greg and Chirag get caught by German policeman. They are sent to a ritual where they are about to be banished to the demon realm. Chirag thinks quickly, and uses one of the guards in a ritual to summon Hitler from the 9th hell. The guards were also quick, grabbing Hitler and escaping while one man in a dark red robe appears before them. He takes off his hood, by Greg's suprise, it is Rodrick Heffley. After faking his execution in 1980 for charges of underage rape, Rodrick turned to Germany to lay low. Rodrick releases his mengekyo sharingan, in complete sorrow as he opens his eyes to see Greg, he tries to look away but it's too late, Greg is forever trapped. Chirag opens one of his bombs and strapped it too his chest, running in extreme force, killing himself and Rodrick in the process. In his final breath, he utter's his last words, \"I will be there to see you,to see everyone, when you are rotting in hell, causing a bomb, masterbaiting, I will see you in the 9th hell, watching you. Hail the motherland\". Greg is in complete aw. Many don't know of what happened after, but guards who came back to the scene reported that Greg was very intimate with Chirag's dead body, and only stopped after finishing in Chirag's mouth 3 whole times before stopping again to have a go with Rodrick.\n\nAlternate Timeline(1970-3125)\n\nAfter banishing Stalin to the demon realm, an alternate timeline was opened where Manny Heffley, a death row inmate who was executed by hanging after killing his entire kindergarden class and raping his teacher with a butter knife, never existed, this led Greg to never meet Chirag, because they met after Manny got executed with a black dick.Greg and Chirag did meet later on, but this time Greg was fighting to create anarchy within the world while Chirag was becoming a communist. They battled out until Chirag used his Nine-tales spirit to obliterate Greg. Chirag later cremated the body while worshipping Russia. He died in 3125 after wishing to kill himself with the super dragon balls.\n\nDepression Timeline Origin(2022-2022)\n\nOnce hitler was released back to life, the council of angels conducted a meeting where they would kill Hitler themselves, to prevent him from ever getting control again. This backfired, as the angels did not have enough ritual power to send Hitler back. Their only hope was Chirag, who was sent straight to the 9th hell. Chirag was a master in rituals, and the council of angels was getting desperate, a new army of nazi's were being made. Chirag was sent to the angel council, and for sending Hitler to the 9th hell they would send Chirag back to life. The angels were too trustworthy, and Chirag used a ritual that would sacrifice the entire council of angels, who each had a ritual level of 10 while a normal human would have a ritual level of 3, to get one wish that the dragon balls could not do, he wished to make the entire world communist, and this opened a timeline, Chirag entered while worshipping the motherland, but it was not how Chirag Imagined.\n\nDepression Timeline(2023-4000)\n\nAs Chirag entered the timeline, he realised that Osama Bin Laden was the leader, and he was a #1 target. eAfter Osama escaped his execution, he torchered Greg for framing him. Greg was now immortal, but would be eternally feeling pain. Chirag ran from many guards, and realised that he had nothing on him. He was able to get in contact with Rowley Jefferson. He apologized for using him in a ritual, but Rowley was not accepting. He challenged Chirag to a duel. Chirag believed in the heart of the cards, and was able to summon Exodia on the 3rd turn. Rowley was banished to the shadow realm while Chirag was able to take his stuff. Rowley had 4 of the 7 dragon balls, 3 swords, and a ton of meth. Chirag fought hard, and was able to kill 60 men in the process. After 58 years of non stop battle, Chirag finally confronted Osama Bin Laden. Chirag used the full power of his nine-tails while Osama went into the 2nd state. And all out battle insued, and Chirag was victorious. He freed Greg, but it was not all over. Manny Heffley looked over, Chirag realised that in this timeline Manny must have been ressurected, and Manny was ready to defeat Chirag. He sent a 60 tonne army of suicide bombers, but Chirag was quick due to his feather boots. Bomb's were launched, and almost 1/2 of Earth was already destroyed. Chirag ran with Greg on his side, it looked like they were about to win when the last army men came through. It was none other than Rodrick Heffley. Rodrick used his ultimate nerf gun and destroyed Chirag. Greg layed by his side, Chirag told him Rodrick had a clear shot but he didn't listen, and Rodrick was standing there, petrified. He couldn't kill his brother. Greg used one of Chirag's bombs, strapped it to his chest and ran to Rodrick. Rodrick stood there, knowing his demise, he uttered his last words, \"I love you, brother.\" Greg was sent to the 9th hell, While Rodrick was sent to the 3rd hell. It all seemed like it ended until Rowley returned. Looking at his lost comrades, he smiled, not because of the deaths they ensued, but because it happened. He contacted them all for a few minutes by ritual by tributing Hitler himself, who was bondaged after many Porn Propoganda's that happened within Germany. He looked at them all, and said \"I used to do meth because I never had any friends, you guys really helped me. In this sad world we live in, its nice to have someone to look for, and be happy with.\" They all gave him a hug before they were sent back to the 9th hell. Rowley looked at the black sun in the sky. He sat down, and saw his friends. He laughed, realising that maybe the world isn't so bad. He took a drink while realising that someone has a lot of time on their hands reading a fanfic where Greg has sex with Chirag's dead body and Manny Fucks his teacher using a butter knife, but he admires the dedication.\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{in-universe |date= April 2012}}\n{{primary sources|date=July 2015}}\n}}\n{{Use American English|date=August 2015}}\n\nThis is a list of characters in [[Jeff Kinney (author)|Jeff Kinney]]'s ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]'' graphic novel series, as well as in the film adaptations of the [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film)|first]],<ref name=\"MDN\">{{cite news|url=http://www.milforddailynews.com/news/x2118273676/Nothing-Wimpy-about-local-authors-success |title=Nothing 'Wimpy' about local author's success |last=McCarron |first=Heather |date=October 12, 2009 |publisher=[[Milford Daily News]] |accessdate=October 20, 2009}}</ref> [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules (film)|second]],<ref name=\"Moviefone\">[http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 'Diary of a Wimpy Kid' Sequel to Bow Next March] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120325214154/http://blog.moviefone.com/2010/05/12/diary-of-a-wimpy-kid-rodrick-rules-release-date-march-25-2011 |date=2012-03-25 }}.

They cause too much confusion.-->\n==Greg Heffley==\n{{Main article|Greg Heffley}}\n\n'''Gregory \"Greg\" Heffley''' is 12 years old in the first novel. Greg's actions can be antagonistic at times, including terrorizing kids, trying to steal money from a church collection basket,  lying in confession, picking on other students, playing pranks on his best friend, selling falsely advertised \"fitness water,\" and praying for bad stuff to happen to others.He also is a very bad friend. However, he also demonstrates a degree of kindness in some of his actions. He helps his brother with his homework, gets his friend a date for a dance, and forgives his friends. Greg is portrayed by [[Zachary Gordon]] in the first three films, and [[Jason Drucker]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Rowley Jefferson==\n'''Rowley Jefferson''' is Greg's best friend. In the first book, Rowley is an antagonist in Greg's point of view while technically in a [[third-person view]], Greg is the antagonist and Rowley is the protagonist. At the end of ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Third Wheel]]'', Rowley begins dating Abigail Brown, a girl who was originally Greg's date for the [[Valentine's Day]] dance. This plot continues in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Hard Luck]]'', where he ditches Greg for his new girlfriend Abigail. At the end of the book, the couple break up and he becomes friends with Greg again.\n\nRowley has what Greg considers strange interests for his age and gender, such as liking a singer for \"six-year-old girls\" named Joshie and action figures Greg believes are for younger kids. Rowley is also the owner of the [[comic strip]] ''Zoo Wee Mama.''<ref name=\"first book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first= Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|series= ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]''\n|publisher= [[Amulet Books]]\n|year= 2007\n|isbn= 0-8109-9313-9}}</ref>\nRowley claims that Greg had nothing to do with the comic strip in the first book, a rare antagonistic move from him. In the movie series, Rowley is portrayed by [[Robert Capron]] (the first 3 movies) and Owen Asztalos (The Long Haul).\n\n==Frank Heffley==\n'''Frank Heffley''' is Greg's overreactive but well-meaning father. He is interested in U.S. history, and his replica of a [[American Civil War|Civil War]] battlefield is a plot point in the series.<ref name=\"second book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2008\n|isbn=\n}}</ref> Frank is edgy around Rowley,<ref name=\"second book\" /> does not appreciate Greg's skill at [[video games]], loathes [[heavy metal music|heavy metal]],<ref name=\"first book\"/> and [[adolescent]]s.<ref name=\"third book\">{{cite book\n|last=Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]\n|series=[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year=2009\n|isbn= 0-8109-7068-6\n}}</ref> He tries to toughen Greg up and threatens to send him to a [[military academy]] in ''The Last Straw'', although ultimately this does not come to fruition, much to Greg's relief.<ref name=\"third book\" /> However, Greg and Frank grow together in ''Dog Days'', despite a brief period when Frank does not speak to Greg after almost getting arrested.\n\nFrank is addicted to junk food; in ''The Last Straw'', he makes a New Year's Resolution to go on a strict diet, but Greg later catches him in the garage eating brownies.\n\nFrank is portrayed by [[Steve Zahn]] in the first three films of the ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (film series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid film series]]''. In ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', he is played by [[Tom Everett Scott]].\n\n==Susan Heffley==\n'''Susan Heffley''' (known as '''Ann Heffley''' in the online version) is the mother of Manny, Gregory, and Rodrick. She is known for being overprotective and spoiling Manny. Gregory is embarrassed often because of her\nIn the first three films, Susan is portrayed by [[Rachael Harris]] and [[Alicia Silverstone]] in the fourth film.\n\n==Manny Heffley==\n'''Manny Heffley''' is Greg's and Rodrick's younger brother, and the youngest of the Heffley family.\nHe is a spoiled kindergardener who is constantly doted on by his mother being than he is early childhood. He makes a great number of demands and throws huge temper tandrums if they are not fulfilled. Among Manny's most well known characteristics are his refusal to be toilet trained and his complete inability to remain in [[Preschool|nursery school]]. He frequently damages Greg's property and uses his age as an excuse for doing so. Whenever they go on vacations, Manny ends up ruining and gets away with it. The excesive coddling he receives from his parents infuriates Greg. He also takes advantage of his overindulgence. It is often implied that his father, Frank is frustrated with babying Manny, especially when it comes to potty training and making his son give up his pacifier. It is revealed in the Third Wheel that Manny has imaginary friends, whom he blames for hus misbehavior. Despite being just a kindergardener and just spoiled attitude,Manny shows signs of actually possessing more intelligence than he appears to have. He surprises his family by his ability to speak Spanish in \"The Long Haul\", but plays this to his advantage by persuading a group of Spanish-Speakers to retrieve their pet pig. He is his grandmother's favorite grandchild, although she denies this. In the three movies based on the first four books, Manny is portrayed by Connor and Owen Fielding. In the movie, \"[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]], Manny also gets a pet pig in \"Diary of a Wimpy Kid:The Long Haul\". He is portrayed by Wyatt and Dylan Walters.  \n\n==Rodrick Heffley==\n'''Rodrick Heffley''' is Greg's lazy and aggressive older brother. He is the drummer in a garage band called \"L\u00f6ded Diper\" (loaded diaper), noted for their substandard [[Heavy metal music|heavy metal]] concerts and limited musical abilities. Rodrick is not an exception to Frank's notorious distrust of all teenagers. \n\nRodrick is infamous for his stereotypical rebellious nature, feigning illness in ''Rodrick Rules'' so as to be allowed to remain at home to throw a chaotic house party during his parents' absence, only for the evidence to appear in newly developed photographs that are quickly discovered by the boys' parents. He bullies Greg a lot and pulls awful pranks that ruins Greg's and his family's life. Rodrick also possesses incompetent tendencies, as his school assignments are notoriously crude and inadequate. Rodrick also makes numerous idiotic mistakes, such as believing a mini-safe is a microwave and cinnamon bun dough which had exploded all over the car was his brains. His spelling abilities are also poor, and he devotes a lot of time to tormenting Greg. In the books, Rodrick owns and drives a white [[van]], which sports his band's name written in large black letters, on either side of it and lacks any back seats, the reason being that Rodrick needs room for his band equipment. In the movie series, the van is revealed to be a 1996 [[Chevrolet Astro]] [[All-wheel drive|AWD]] van, which also sports a diaper's pin drawn on the rear doors. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Greg is haunted by the fact that Rodrick knows about his most mortifying experience during the summertime. This haunts him when he returns to school. However, his fears are quickly eased after the story becomes distorted to Greg's advantage due to it being passed around by so many people, temporarily boosting his popularity. By the end of the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, he is much closer to Greg, and his actions to him becomes much less aggressive. This is also shown in the film adaptation of Dog Days when Rodrick thanks Greg for getting him a gig at Heather Hills' Sweet 16. In the first three films in the film series based on the books, Rodrick is played by [[Devon Bostick]]. In the fourth film, ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul]]'', Rodrick is played by Charlie Wright.\n\n==Greg's extended family ==\n\n===Gramma===\nGramma is Susan's mother and Greg's maternal grandmother. Gramma is known to drive a car like the Heffleys'. Greg often calls her to his home as a way to avoid his dad's scoldings, since his dad will not do this when she is around. Her favorite grandchild is Manny, although she denies and lies about this.\n\n===  Grandpa Heffley===\nGrandpa is Greg's unpredictable paternal grandfather, who is asked to babysit Rodrick and his brother in ''Rodrick Rules''. He lives in a retirement home called Leisure Towers and enjoys playing games such as \"Gutbusters\" and \"Rummy\", which the two boys find boring. He never watches any real shows on the television; instead he constantly has his television tuned to the [[CCTV]] in the retirement home lobby, which he spends his time watching. In ''Old School'', he moves out of Leisure Towers because the rent is too high and moves in with the Heffleys. Grandpa has a girlfriend named Darlene in the ''Hard Luck'' and broke up with her in ''Old School.'' Grandpa dates online. Grandpa eventually accumulates a large number of girlfriends online, culminating in him accidentally inviting all of them over and throwing a party with them. Greg is his favorite. Grandpa is known for preparing what he calls \"Watercress Salad\", a disgusting dish consisting of cold green beans and cucumbers floating in vinegar. Greg hates Watercress Salad, and Rodrick is aware of this, so he pretends that Greg loves it and puts a large helping onto his plate. It's stated that Grandpa never spent much time with Frank when he was a boy, and they seem to have a poor relationship. Grandpa once accidentally ran over Frank's [[dog]] with his [[car]] and lied to him about it before telling him, expecting a laugh, and constantly criticizes Frank during his stay at the Heffleys' house. He has not been seen since ''Double Down,'' implying that he possibly moved out.\n\n===Joe Heffley===\nJoe Heffley is Frank's brother and Greg's uncle. Frank has a sibling rivalry with Joe due to his actions. When Manny started potty training, Uncle Joe told him to watch out for the \"potty monster\", causing him to fear using the bathroom, forcing Frank to change his diapers for a longer time. Uncle Joe's children call their uncle \"Aunt Fwank\", which Frank swears he told them to do on purpose. Susan thinks it's cute, though. In ''Dog Days'', Greg mentions that he tried to make Uncle Joe convince Frank to get a dog, but that did not work out. He also mentions that Joe's dog, Killer ate most of his birthday cake.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Wife===\nJoe Heffley's wife is a dark-haired woman and Greg's aunt. She appears rarely in the books.\n\n===Joe Heffley's Children===\nJoe Heffley has at least 3 children, who all appear to be a bit older than Manny, and are Greg's cousins. They all call Frank \"Aunt Fwank.\"\n\n===Great-Uncle Charlie===\nCharlie is Nana's brother and Greg's great uncle. He is also Greg's \"secret weapon\" at Christmas, as he asks him to buy him presents that his parents have forbidden him from receiving. However, this backfires as he is usually given the wrong thing. Charlie is a [[bachelor]] and spends his spare money well. Greg says he wants to follow in his footsteps. In ''The Last Straw'', Charlie got Greg a laundry hoop, hinting that he is tired of being Greg's secret weapon at Christmas, as the events that transpired meant that Greg effectively got a chore for Christmas.\n\n===Uncle Cecil===\nCecil is the boys' Step-Cousin Once Removed but is only 3 or 4 years old. He sits at the grown-ups table at family gatherings because Greg's Great Aunt Marcie adopted him and since he's her son, he's allowed to sit at the grown-ups' table. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Loretta (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nLoretta is Greg's great-aunt and the sister of Grandpa, Arthur and Reba. She got a thank you note for some pants she gave Greg at Christmas. She appeared mainly in ''Rodrick Rules'' at the [[Thanksgiving]] dinner. She also appeared a couple of times in the ''Do It Yourself Book'' and ''The Ugly Truth.'' It is implied that Greg and Rodrick dislike her, as they fight over who has to greet her first when she visits.\n\n===Aunt Veronica===\nAunt Veronica is Greg's aunt and Susan's sister. Greg states that she has never been seen in person since he was 3 or 4 years old, probably because being with the family in person really stresses her out, but calls her family members on video chat. When Greg was sitting on the toilet playing games on his new phone (which was actually a hand-me-down from his mother), she accidentally started a video chat with him. This startled him, leading to him dropping the phone into the toilet.. She appears in ''Hard Luck'' multiple times \u2013 often in person \u2013 but on other occasions by video conference on a tablet and the used phone that Susan gave to Greg.\n\n===Terrence===\nTerrence is Frank's second cousin. It is implied that Greg thinks he is stupid. This was suggested when he was explaining that when Terrence was his age, he looked exactly like him, which is true.<ref name=\"fifth book\">{{cite book\n|last= Kinney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Ugly Truth]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2010\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Gammie Heffley===\nGammie is Greg's great-grandmother, and the unofficial head of the Heffley family. She only appears in ''The Ugly Truth'', as a minor character. She also has [[Lego]] building bricks that Susan bought so that her kids had something to do at her house. Gammie is a trickster and knows a lot because of \"experience\". When someone in the family is about 12 or 13 years old she gives them ''The Talk'', which is about how kids should not be hurrying to grow up.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\nGammie loves having visitors for dinner. One day she bought a scratch ticket, and matched up two pictures and told all her family members that she had won a lot of money. Everyone was in a big rush to visit her. When they all arrived Frank told Gammie that to win, she had to match up three pictures. When she found this out, she did not really care. She pulled a roast right out of the oven, and Greg figures she got what she really wanted anyway. Gammie is the mother of Grandpa, Arthur, Reba, and Loretta Heffley.\n\nGammie is briefly mentioned by Greg in ''Cabin Fever'' when he says she gave a miniature carousel that held spoons from all over the world to Greg's family five or six years before.\n\n===Reba (n\u00e9e Heffley)===\nReba was Greg's great-aunt. Gammie forgot to give her an invitation at Christmas, but she came anyway. She only appeared in ''The Ugly Truth''. She is stubborn. She and Loretta are identical twins. Reba was the sister of Grandpa, Loretta, and Arthur Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> In ''Wrecking Ball,'' it was revealed that she died in her sleep, and Greg's family attended someone else's funeral instead of hers by mistake. Greg forgot about Reba at first, until Susan reminded him that she used to send him angry letters for forgetting to send her thank-you notes for his birthday money.\n\n===Gary Heffley===\nGarrison \"Gary\" Heffley is Greg's uncle and has been married four times. In ''The Ugly Truth'' it is revealed that all of his wives divorced him as soon as they found out about his financial situation and job. In ''The Third Wheel'' he comes to live with Greg's family after he discovers his job selling shirts in Boston was a ripoff. Later in the book he is chosen to be the DJ at Greg's [[Valentine's Day]] dance.\n\n====First wife: Linda====\nReason for divorce: Job unappealing for her (Gary was working as a mascot at children's parties).\n\n====Second wife: Charlene====\nReason for divorce: Financial miscommunication (He had $45 in his bank account instead of $45,000, and she didn't find out until their wedding, when it was time to pay the band.)\n\n====Third wife: Lydia====\nReason for divorce: Unknown, possibly because of a tattoo that used to read \"Lydia\" (and was later modified to read \"I am not in love with Lydia anymore\").\n\n====Fourth wife: Sonja====\nLikely reason for divorce: He was only engaged to her by accident when a plane with a banner saying \"MARRY ME SONJA\" flew over the baseball game where he was going to break up with her because he wanted to start dating her sister. Apparently, there was another Sonja at the baseball stadium. Before Gary could say anything, Sonja turned around and said \"YES, YES!\" When they divorced, it was after their wedding when Gary's friend included the story in his speech.<ref name=\"fifth book\" />\n\n===Aunt Dorothy===\nDorothy is Greg's great aunt who always kisses him on the lips. Greg's mom, Susan, says it is rude to wipe off the kisses Dorothy gives him. She is overweight and sometimes passes gas loudly.\n\nShe appears on the \"Have You Ever\" page in the ''Do-It-Yourself Book'' when Greg asks: \"Have you ever been kissed full on the lips by a relative who's older than seventy?\" This probably means she is older than 70 years old, and that she is actually his great-aunt.\n\n===Arthur Heffley===\nArthur Heffley is Greg's great-uncle. He only speaks in grunts or makes random sounds. He never has an actual conversation with anybody, but sometimes Greg tries to respond to him just in case he is trying to communicate. Arthur is the brother of Reba, Grandpa, and Loretta Heffley.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/>\n\n===Great Uncle Bruce===\nGreat Uncle Bruce is Greg's deceased great-uncle. He is a character who is mentioned in ''Cabin Fever'' and ''The Third Wheel.'' Greg is presented with a rather luxurious [[blanket]] as a Christmas gift, only to be repelled by it upon learning that it had formerly belonged to Great Uncle Bruce before his death. In ''The Third Wheel'', Greg uses Great Uncle Bruce's old cologne on Valentine's Day, which ends up attracting some old ladies.\n\n===Byron Heffley===\nByron is Frank's cousin whom Greg is not excited to see<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> because at Gammie's last family meeting, he was sent out to get milk, but hit a pothole halfway home, and got a flat tire. Greg had to get him. He needed supplies, so Greg returned to Gammie's. Because of his muddy shoes, the ladies needed to warn him because he was about to track mud into the house. Unfortunately, he forgot about Byron's tire, and he was not happy when he got to Gammie's.\n\nHe only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Nana Heffley===\nNot much is known about Nana. She is Greg, Rodrick, and Manny's paternal grandmother, mother to Frank, Joe and Gary, and Mother-in-law to Susan. She is Grandpa's wife. It is revealed in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Double Down|Double Down]]'' that she died when Greg was younger and it makes him uncomfortable to think she is \"watching\" him from heaven.\n\nHer first appearance was in ''Double Down'' (and possibly her only appearance).<ref>{{cite book\n\n|last= Kenney\n|first=Jeff\n|title= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Cabin Fever]]\n|series= [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid (book series)|Diary of a Wimpy Kid]]\n|year= 2011\n|isbn=\n}}</ref>\n\n===Aunt Cakey===\nAunt Cakey is Susan's oldest sister and does not like kids. She used to have a dog. Susan never trusts her to babysit Greg.\n\nShe only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Aunt Audra===\nAunt Audra is one of Susan's sisters. She believes in crystal balls and took Greg along with her to see her fortuneteller a few times. Susan thinks Audra is wasting her money. The fortuneteller also told Audra that Meemaw's ring was inside a photo album. It turned out the fortuneteller did not mean it literally.\n\n===Aunt Gretchen===\nAunt Gretchen is Susan's youngest sister. She has two out-of-control twin sons, Malvin and Malcolm. Aunt Gretchen has at least thirty pets. In ''Hard Luck'', her rabbit (which everyone thought was a male but was actually female) has a litter of bunnies, angering Frank. \n\n===Malvin and Malcolm===\nMalvin and Malcolm are Gretchen's two sons. They are out-of-control kids. Once, they played throw and catch with a strong sharp piece of concrete. Malvin had to go to the emergency room to get stitches in his forehead. Malcolm is the wilder. He once got hold of Frank's shaving kit and shaved himself. He also called the police to report Greg's family for running out of ketchup. This results in Frank angrily making them leave.\n\n===Meemaw and Peepaw===\nMeemaw and Peepaw are the parents of Gramma and her two sisters and are the  maternal grandparents of Susan. Their first appearance was in ''Hard Luck''. Peepaw is portrayed as old and batty. Meemaw is dead, while Peepaw is still alive. Meemaw was in charge of putting prizes in the Easter eggs and wore a diamond ring, which was extremely valuable because it had been in her family for three generations. Before she died, she accidentally put her ring in an Easter egg that was found by Greg at the end of the book.\n\nMeemaw appears in [[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul (film)|the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'']] played by Mimi Gould. Meemaw's birthday results in Susan's \"great Heffley road trip\".\n\n===Gramma's sisters===\nGramma's sisters are the great-aunts of Rodrick, Greg, and Manny. They are the aunt's of Susan Heffley and her sisters.\n\n===Lawrence===\nLawrence is Greg's first cousin once removed who is always traveling, and therefore is unable to make it to family events. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Chester \"Remus\" Heffley===\nChester Heffley was Greg's great-grandfather and Gammie Heffley's husband. It was revealed that he died in ''The Ugly Truth''. Greg referred to him as Remus in ''The Do it Yourself Book''.\n\n===Georgia===\nGeorgia is Greg's second cousin who has an extremely loose tooth that she does not want to pull out. She only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Benjy===\nBenjy is Greg's third cousin. He can read chapter books and speak in full sentences. However, he still isn't potty trained. He only appears in ''The Ugly Truth''.\n\n===Tony and Patricia===\nTony is Greg's second cousin once removed and Patricia is his wife. They are the parents of Benjy.\n\n===Uncle Larry===\nUncle Larry is supposedly Greg's uncle. Greg is not sure if he is an actual relative, and he thinks someone invited him to a family gathering at some point and that he has been coming ever since. When Audra's fortune teller told her Meemaw's ring was in a photo album, Larry helped realize that the ring was in a plastic egg. This was proved to be true, as it was found in a plastic egg by Greg later on.\n\n===Martina===\nMartina is Susan's cousin who smashed her collarbone at a buffet in Las Vegas, and ended up suing the hotel.\n\n===Gerald===\nGerald is Susan's cousin who lives in California. He lived with Greg's family a few months after Greg was born.\n\n==Rowley's family==\n\n===Robert Jefferson===\n<!--His first name is revealed to be Robert in Dog Days, but since Mrs. Jefferson's first name has not been revealed yet, we should currently keep this as \"Mr. Jefferson\" to keep the balance.-->\nMr. Jefferson is Rowley's father, and is far more shrill than Mr. Heffley. He is extremely rude and paranoid, and does not accept any criticism from anyone of himself or his property. He is the strictest father in the series so far. He will not let Rowley play any video game with the slightest bit of violence or fighting in it, as he thinks doing this could change Rowley into a different person. Mr. Jefferson dislikes Greg, whom he thinks is a \"bad influence\" on his son. It is also shown that Mr. Jefferson had a close bond with Rowley.\n\nHe shows little interest in sports until ''Dog Days'', where he is found playing [[tennis]] with Rowley and [[golf]] with a caddy.\n\nIn ''Dog Days'', it is revealed that Mr. Jefferson's first name is Robert. When Susan emailed him because of the note Greg sent her, it had Mr. Jefferson's first name on it.\n\nIn \"Old School\", he is stuck chaperoning the group of extra kids (which includes Rowley and Greg), much to Greg's dismay. Later, Rowley adds poison ivy to a fire started by him and he has problems breathing on the next morning, which means he and Rowley (Who had spots on his body) would be going back home.\n\nIn the film series, Mr. Jefferson has not spoken until the third film, implying that he is a man of a few words.\n\n===Linda Jefferson===\nMrs. Jefferson is Rowley's mother. She often seems to be concerned about Rowley such as the time he broke his big toe after Greg put one of his dad's dumbbells under a pillow that Rowley kept kicking at Greg's sleepover.<ref name=\"first book\"/> She also had Greg apologize to her for what he did to Rowley. Despite this, Mrs. Jefferson always enjoys Greg's company with Rowley. Although Mrs. Jefferson loves Greg, she does not let him come over because her husband dislikes him. In day 24 of the online version, it is revealed that her first name is Linda from Greg's ''The Boy Whose Family Thinks He's a DOG'' comic.\n\nIn the first film, Rowley's mother is portrayed by [[Kaye Capron]]. In ''Dog Days'', she is portrayed by Bronwen Smith.\n\n===Rowley's Grandpa===\nRowley's 90-year-old maternal grandfather only appears in ''Rodrick Rules''. It is his birthday and he asks for a chocolate cake for his next birthday.\n\n===Bampy Jefferson===\nBampy is Rowley's Paternal Grandfather who first appears in Diary Of an Awesome Friendly Kid and is revealed to be deceased. He owned a log cabin which is now owned by his son.\n===Rowley's uncle===\nRowley's Uncle who lives in China.\n===Rowley's cousins===\nRowley's Cousin's who Rowley brings to his birthday parties.\n\n==Other characters==\n\n===Fregley===\nFregley is Greg's firm and impeccably graspable acquaintance and neighbor noted for his unexplained lot of odd or disgusting eccentricities. He has been known to perplex others with his behavior, and does not have any known friends. Greg has been forced to hang around with Fregley on several occasions, to his chagrin or aggravation. It has been mentioned that Fregley is prohibited from eating [[sugar]] by his parents, and the consumption of it in large quantities will send him into hysterical, uncontrollable frenzies. In the film adaptations of the books, Fregley is played by [[Grayson Russell]].\n\n===Preston Mudd===\nPreston Mudd is one of Greg's classmates. He is said to have been the best player in the basketball unit of gym class during sixth grade at Westmore Middle School. Unfortunately, when his name was displayed as \"P. Mudd\", this led to his classmates making fun of him, calling him \"Pee Mud\".\n\n===Christopher Brownfield===\nChristopher Brownfield is one of Greg's friends and is shown to have been a great mosquito magnet while hanging out with Greg in the summer. However, Greg does not see him as a close friend because he is \"not a school-year friend\". Later in \"The Ugly Truth\", he is on Greg's team for a game and hides behind a soda machine after the teachers threaten to call all of their parents.\n\n===Tyson Sanders===\nTyson Sanders is a friend of Greg who appears in \"The Ugly Truth\". He is mentioned at the beginning along with Christopher when Greg is considering new best friends, and mentions that although Tyson is nice and into the same video games as Greg, he is turned off by the fact Tyson pulls his pants all the way down when using the urinal. When they play a game of \"[[Guess Who?]]\", the team take a picture of Tyson's bent arm, which gets them disqualified as the chaperones think the picture is of his buttocks. However, the misunderstanding is later cleared up after a mole near Tyson's elbow is matched to one shown in the picture.\n\n===Holly Hills===\nHolly Hills is one of Greg's classmates; an older girl who primarily serves as Greg's unrequited romantic interest and also Heather Hills' younger sister. She is the youngest daughter of Mr. Hills and Mrs. Hills. A minor character, she earns a prominent role in ''The Last Straw'' as the object of Greg's most recent infatuation. He is continuously motivated to impress her to no avail. Virtually oblivious to Greg's existence or identity (Greg stops trying to impress her after she mistakes him for Fregley), she appears to take an interest in Rowley's sweetness, judging by an enthusiastic message which she had signed in his yearbook (as opposed to the note that she had written for the envious Greg). She seldom appears afterwards. Greg's interest in her is seemingly damaged by events such as this and he starts showing an interest in other girls, including Holly's older sister Heather.\n\nWhereas her personality is hardly explored in the books, Holly's role was increased in film adaptions, debuting in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' as a newcomer to Greg's school with whom he is instantly besotted. She is depicted as being friendly and good-natured. The relationship she shares with Greg and Rowley is emphasized and exaggerated in the film portrayals, to the extent it can be assumed that the feelings Greg has for her may be mutual. She reappears in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.''\n\nHolly seems to enjoy the boys' companionship, and shows gratitude for Rodrick Heffley's unintentional blunders that wind up destroying the undeserving Heather's birthday party. The party ends with Holly slipping her hand into Greg's, implying that she likes him as well, and she, Greg and Rowley had a pool party not long after.\n\nHolly is portrayed by [[Peyton List (actress, born 1998)|Peyton R. List]].\n\n===Chirag Gupta===\nChirag Gupta is one of Greg's schoolmates and a minor character in the books. He is characterized by his short stature. Although he and Greg are well-acquainted and generally amiable to one another, Greg started the \"Invisible Chirag\" prank in ''Rodrick Rules''. During the summer the Gupta family were to move away but an unexplained alteration in their plans changed this. As a result, Chirag's classmates teasingly ignore his existence or presence for days on end, which aggravates and shocks him. Though Chirag has apparently forgiven Greg and his fellow schoolmates for concocting the prank, it is mentioned in one book that he takes advantage of his family's non-observance of the Christmas holiday, and no obligation to behave for [[Santa Claus]], to pick on Greg.\n\nIn the movie adaptions, Chirag's role is enhanced and he is a close friend of Greg and Rowley. He also plays a considerably more prominent role in these films, appearing in adaptions of books in which he is absent or hardly mentioned. He is depicted as being Indian-American. He is portrayed by [[Karan Brar]].\n\n===Patty Farrell===\n'''Patty Farrell''' is a minor character who shares an intense rivalry with Greg, which is showcased on a few occasions. It is implied she is a hardworking but sanctimonious and domineering student. She earns Greg's animosity after she suggests a map of the United States displayed in the classroom be covered during a geography quiz. Greg had planned to cheat using the map and this causes great difficulties for him, and makes him agitated. Motivated by his lust for revenge, he volunteers to play a tree in the school's upcoming production of \"[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz|The Wizard of Oz]]\"after viewing the movie adaption for the first time. He believes the role entails having to bombard the character of Dorothy Gale (whom Patty would be portraying in the play) with [[apple]]s, only to learn that this scene was deleted for the school production. He winds up re-enacting this scene, despite the script, sending his parents into a rage. She has yet to play quite as significant a role in the book series again. She has become something of a minor recurring character whose appearances are rare.\n\nIn the film adaptions of the books, Patty's role is enhanced slightly. She is depicted as being monstrously demanding. Her parents are involved with the school board in this portrayal. The motivation given for her hatred of Greg is his recital of an offensive playground chant poking fun at her that sent her bursting into tears in elementary school. She appears in the film adaptations of all three films ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid; Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days''. Alterations made to the books include her talent for both wrestling and playing [[tennis]]. She snatches any opportunity to assault Greg somehow while engaged in either sport with him. She is played by [[Laine MacNeil]].\n\n===Heather  Hills===\nHeather Hills is the attractive elder sister of Holly Hills, with whom Rodrick is infatuated. A minor character in the books, but the main antagonist in the third film, Heather is only featured in several books as the object of Greg's unrequited infatuation. However, she seems oblivious to this. A student attending Westmore High School with Rodrick, she has had several minor occupations throughout the course of the books, during each of which Rodrick fecklessly attempts to grab her attention or to impress her.\n\nLittle insight into her personality is provided in the book series. Similar to her younger sister, Holly, Heather's personality and role is further enhanced in the only film adaption in which she has appeared, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days.'' In a modification of the events of the books, she is depicted as the oldest daughter of the Hills family. She is spoiled, obnoxious, rude, ignorant, selfish, conceited, ungrateful, unforgiving, cold-hearted, demanding, mistreating her family and acquaintances. Lovelorn, Rodrick Heffley and his band are hired to perform at Heather's ostentatious upcoming [[sweet sixteen (birthday)|sixteenth birthday party]], and, in an attempt to earn her admiration, Rodrick winds up messing up the celebration and decorations during a boisterous, and substandard performance of [[Justin Bieber]]'s \"[[Baby (Justin Bieber song)|Baby]]\", which makes Heather very upset and the party ends in disaster. She is portrayed by [[Melissa Roxburgh]].\n\n===Albert Sandy===\nAlbert Sandy is a minor character, who talks often about rumors he has heard. The validity of his statements are unconfirmed. One of the statements which was not confirmed by Greg was when Albert told him that \"it was medically impossible for a girl to fart\". Some make no sense, for example, he said a man got decapitated when he sneezed.\n\nAlbert has appeared in ''The Last Straw,'' ''The Ugly Truth,'' ''Old School,'' ''Double Down,'' ''The Meltdown,'' and ''Wrecking Ball.''\n\n===Mr. Ira===\nOnly appearing in ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'', Mr. Ira is a teacher at Greg's school who is on the school newspaper staff, and enlists a replacement comic strip for the newspaper. He was made fun of in a comic strip entitled Dumb Teachers, and later bowdlerised Greg's Creighton the Cretin comic. He does not do the same with Rowley's Zoo-Wee Mama strip, much to Greg's chagrin.\n\n===The Snellas===\nFirst appearing in ''The Last Straw'', The Snellas are a family that lives in the Heffleys' neighborhood. They have a lot of children, all of whom are male, with names beginning with the letter S. Five of the children's names are revealed, and they are (from oldest to youngest): Shawn, Shane, Sam, Scott, and Seth. In ''The Last Straw'', it is revealed that each Snella child has a half birthday party at which the adults perform funny stunts, to attempt to make the babies laugh. According to Greg, however, no baby has laughed once.\n\nMr. Snella then sends the videos to ''America's Funniest Families'', a spoof and parody of ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'', and has never won anything (though after Greg is filmed wearing ''Wonder Woman'' underwear hanging off a tree with his trousers below his ankles at the end of ''The Last Straw'', the footage is sent, and it is never explained if Mr. Snella won with it).\n\nTheir most recent appearance was in ''The Ugly Truth'', when they move to another house because of a strange smell they cannot get rid of in their home. The smell was [[deviled eggs]], which Greg hates and threw into one of their plant pots when he was having dinner at their house. Despite trying to find the cause of the smell, the Snellas cannot figure it out and eventually just move. Greg feels guilty when he sees that they are taking the plant pot with them, but he resolves to try to find a way to sneak deviled eggs into Fregley's house.\n\n===Scotty Douglas===\nScotty is a first grader from Rowley's karate class. In ''Rodrick Rules'', Scotty was going to do a magic act in the Talent Show with Rowley as his assistant. But after Greg breaks Rowley's big toe, he has to fill in for Rowley. Greg complains about being a magician's assistant to Scotty, but Susan tells Scotty's mother that Greg would be happy to replace Rowley.\n\nScotty has a remarkably similar appearance to Greg's comic character, Creighton The Cretin, except Creighton's eyes are wide open and Scotty's eyes are beady just like all the other characters that do not wear glasses. In ''The Ugly Truth'', he becomes the new Peachy Breeze kid, yet cannot say the slogan right.<ref name=\"fifth book\"/> Between ''Rodrick Rules'' and ''The Ugly Truth'' it appears that Scotty has two siblings - an unnamed baby sister and an older brother. In ''The Third Wheel,'' when Greg and Rowley become private investigators Greg looks through the window at his house to find him playing one of Greg's video games with Rowley.\n\nHe appeared in the film adaptation of Rodrick Rules, with only a few lines. He is portrayed by Jakob Davies.\n\n===Mr. Underwood ===\nMr. Underwood is Greg's Phys Ed coach. In the film series, he is named Coach Malone. He is portrayed by [[Andrew McNee]].\n\n===Bill Walter===\nBill Walter is a 35-year-old high school drop out, guitarist and professional singer, who has a rude attitude towards everyone he meets. Rodrick idolizes him and his lifestyle. In the novel ''Rodrick Rules'', he was voted \"Most Likely to Be a Rock Star\" which influenced Rodrick to persuade him to join the band. Frank Heffley strongly dislikes Bill because he disapproves of his lifestyle, and is afraid Rodrick will follow in his footsteps. In the movie version of ''Rodrick Rules'' he is portrayed by [[Fran Kranz]] and is an antagonist. He agrees to join Rodrick's rock band ''Loded Diper'' and later attempts to kick him out for an unknown reason. After performing the song ''Exploded Diper'', Rodrick retaliates and kicks him out. In the book Greg describes him as unemployed and still living with his parents. Also, in ''Rodrick Rules'' Bill appears to be a slob, as he \"slorks\" pot roast.\n\n===Dr. Salazar Kagan===\nDr. Kagan, Frank's dentist, makes his debut in ''The Ugly Truth''. Frank takes Greg to Dr. Kagan instead of his usual dentist, a pretty woman named Rachel on whom Greg has a crush. Greg bites Dr. Kagan's finger when his teeth are being checked. In what Greg believes to be an act of revenge, Dr. Kagan tells Frank that Greg needs headgear to correct his overbite. Greg says Dr. Kagan is scary and evil and that he never fools around. He has sharp metal tools and never smiles. The billboards for Dr. Kagan's dental practice make Greg freak out every time he sees one of them on the highway.\n\nDr. Kagan later makes a cameo in Double Down, in a scene where Greg describes how a Spineticklers book has made going to the dentist an even more frightening experience for him.\n\n===Lenwood Heath===\nLenwood Heath only appears in ''The Last Straw''. He is a rebellious teenager, who was Greg's father's arch-enemy for about three months before he was sent to military academy. This resulted in him becoming a fine young man who works at the movie theater. In the ''Dog Days'' film, he is portrayed by Tom Stevens, and is seen working as a lifeguard at the community pool the Heffleys go to.\n\n===Taylor Pringle===\nTaylor Pringle is a minor character who only appears in the films, ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Rodrick Rules'' and ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid: Dog Days'' and does not appear in the books. She is a very rude little girl, and is first seen at the end of the opening scene in ''Rodrick Rules'' in which during her [[birthday party]] at the [[roller rink]], Rodrick embarrasses Greg, prompting Greg to try and tackle him, but he misses and lands in Taylor's [[birthday cake]], destroying it. As a result of this, Taylor gets angry and she and her friends begin beating up Greg as the intro begins. Later in the film, during church, when Rodrick intentionally pulls down the sweater around Greg's waist to reveal the chocolate stain on Greg's pants, Taylor points it out to everyone, mistaking it for poop. Then, in ''Dog Days'', when Greg attempts to impress Holly by jumping off the [[high diving|high]] [[diving platform|diving board]], he becomes nervous, due to it being very high above the water. Taylor then comes up behind Greg and states that he is talking to himself, due to being scared. When Greg gives Taylor a brush-off that he is not scared and that she would not understand since she is \"just a little kid\", she pressures him to jump. When Greg jumps, he loses his [[swimsuit]] on the board, and Taylor chucks it onto a nearby fence to get back at Greg for brushing her off. As a result, Greg is forced to borrow a girl's swimsuit that reads ''Holly'' on it until he goes to the fence to retrieve his own swimsuit, and as he does so, he gets taunted by Patty. Taylor is portrayed by [[Dalila Bela]].\n\n===Jordan Jury===\nOnly appearing in ''The Ugly Truth'', Jordan Jury is the popular boy in the grade above Greg, who's known for always throwing huge parties that have little to no adult supervision. Greg is amazed when he discovers that he has been given a textbook that used to belong to him. Jordan invites Greg and Rowley to his latest party, but Greg cannot not go because of his Uncle Gary's fourth wedding. But at the end of the book, Greg discovers that it's actually a good thing he didn't go to the party as it would seem. The only reason Jordan invited the kids in Greg and Rowley's grade to his party was to basically use them as servants.\n\n===Angie Steadman===\nAngie Steadman only appears as an additional character in the ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' film. She is in seventh grade, has a pink streak of hair, works for the school newspaper, and hates middle school. In the film, Greg and Rowley meet her under the bleachers during a game of \"Gladiator\". She gets along with Rowley, but starts a rocky relationship with Greg after he egotistically declines her offer to join the school newspaper. Greg later tells the whole school he ate the cheese instead of Rowley and she compliments and accepts him when she sees that Greg is learning the errors of his ways. In the film, she is portrayed by [[Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz]].\n\n===Pete Hosey===\nPete Hosey is the leader of the teenagers who attacked Greg and Rowley on [[Halloween]]. He is an antagonist in the first film. He is unnamed in the first book and he is replaced by Herbie Reamer in the online version. After hassling Greg and Rowley on Halloween, Greg yells that he will call the cops, and they chase him to Greg's grandmother's house. In the book, Greg and Rowley sneak back home, but in the movie, they try to intimidate Pete and his friends with a weed hacker, before Pete scratches his car and they are chased into the woods. In both the book and the movie, the teens hold a vendetta against Greg and Rowley. Near the end they corner them on the school field and decide to force them to eat the moldy cheese. Rowley is forced to eat the cheese, but Greg avoids it by saying he's lactose intolerant. In the movie they are chased off by the coach.\n\n===The Warrens===\nAlthough his family is vaguely referenced in the books, the Warren's are what got Frank thinking of making Greg more manly. In the books, Mr. Warren is Frank's boss. Frank is deeply jealous of the Warrens. In stark contrast to Greg, the Warrens' children are shown to be athletic and sporty. In the third film, Stan, the father of the family, is shown to be a neighbor of the Heffleys. He had a minor childhood rivalry with Frank, that they appear to have gotten over as adults. In the movie, Mr. Warren is the troop master of the Wilderness Explorers, and invites everyone over for an Independence Day party. They only appear in ''[[Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Last Straw]]''.\n\n===The Beardos===\nOnly appearing in ''The Long Haul'', the Beardos are the main antagonists of the book. They are a couple with three sons. The Heffleys indirectly met them during their road trip, though only Greg knows who they are. Their first encounter is at a motel, where Greg angrily berates one of the Beardo children, who then tells his father on him, causing Greg to fear running into them again. Greg and his family are convinced that the Beardos have stolen their luggage and belongings at a place they both attended called \"Soak Central.\" They try to track them down though it was revealed at the end that Greg actually had the key to their locker in Soak Central, and that he got the number in the lottery . Their belongings were actually there. The family's real surname is unknown, as Greg himself does not who they are. It is likely he dubbed them this because of the patriarch's noticeably long beard.\n\nIn the film adaption of ''The Long Haul'', Mr. and Mrs. Beardo are portrayed by [[Chris Coppola]] and Kimberli Lincoln, and have a daughter named Brandi and two sons named Brandon and Brent. The Beardos are depicted as much more malicious, with Mr. Beardo chasing Greg around through the carnival to get revenge.\n\n===Chris=== \nChris is a friend of Rodrick and the [[bassist]] in Loded Diper.\n\n===Joshie===\nJoshie is a singer who is famous in Europe and is Rowley's favorite singer and idol. Greg believes that Joshie is for six-year-old girls, but Rowley ignores him, saying that Greg is jealous because he was the one who \"discovered\" Joshie. However, despite Rowley's opinion, Joshie appears to be a singer that is mainly idolized by females.\n\n===Maddox Selsam===\nMaddox Selsam is a boy who lives in the middle of the woods. He is not allowed to have any screen time, and does not have a TV at his house. He enjoys playing with his Legos and practicing his violin. He met Greg in ''Double Down'' when he found Greg's balloon for the Balloon Brigade at his school.\n==Pets==\n\n===Dogs===\n====Sweetie====\nSweetie is a dog that first appeared in ''Dog Days''. Greg's dad buys him after discovering that his father lied about accidentally killing his childhood dog, Nutty. Sweetie wreaks havoc in the Heffley household and is given to Gramma at the end of the book. Sweetie undergoes drastic weight gain at Gramma's house because he is fed lots of table scraps. Eventually Gramma dresses him up like a little human. Greg and Rodrick like playing with him by going up behind him and making flatulence sounds. He will then sniff his rear end until he goes to sleep.\n\n====Nutty====\nNutty is Frank's old dog which he had when he was around Greg's age. Grandpa accidentally ran over and killed Nutty with his station wagon when he backed out of the driveway. Grandpa covered the truth by saying that Nutty ran away to a butterfly farm. Frank is very angry when he finds out the truth during a Father's Day brunch.\n\n====Killer====\nKiller is Joe Heffley's [[Rottweiler]]-type pet dog. In ''Dog Days'', he wreaks havoc by eating most of Greg's birthday cake, leaving Greg not wanting to eat it.\n\n====Rudy====\nRudy was Aunt Cakey's dog. He was usually oblivious to what was going on around him, opting to stare straight ahead doing nothing. It is not known how Rudy died.\n\n====Henry====\nHenry is Gramma's dog who died around the time of the dog days of summer.\n\n====Rebel====\nRebel is a [[Rottweiler]] that used to chase Greg and Rowley on their way to school before his owner installed an electric fence around the front yard. He only appears in ''Hard Luck''.\n\n===Fish===\n====Greg's Fish====\nIn ''Dog Days'', Greg buys an angel fish from a pet store. He also buys a journal to log the actions of his fish but later realizes he can not put much in it. Greg's fish was later made to share a tank with Rodrick's fish, who ate it while Greg and his family were at the water park on [[Father's Day]].\n\n====Rodrick's Fish====\nRodrick's fish is a [[piranha]]-type fish that was picked out the fish at a pet store in ''Dog Days,'' because it was described as aggressive. Due to Rodrick's neglect at cleaning the tank it was made to share a tank with Greg's fish, which it ate. The fish has not appeared since ''Dog Days,'' with no further mention of its eventual fate.\n\n===Other Pets===\n====Aunt Gretchen's pets====\nAunt Gretchen has about thirty pets that the Heffleys pet-sit in ''Hard Luck'', while she is on vacation. Her pets include three dogs, two cats, a mouse, a parakeet, a turtle, a snake, a lizard, and a litter of bunnies that her rabbit gave birth to while Gretchen was away (despite the fact that the rabbit was actually male).\n\n====Squirm====\nSquirm was an inchworm Greg found and took care of when he was nine. It was stood on and squashed by Manny when he began learning how to walk.\n\n====The Pig====\nThe Heffleys\u2019 pet pig has appeared in all books except ''The Getaway'' since ''The Long Haul'', in which Manny Heffley won it at a country fair for correctly guessing the weight of a hog. To the annoyance of Greg, the pig exhibits extraordinary intelligence and gains human characteristics. One running gag is that despite not having opposable thumbs, the pig opens objects such as soda cans. In ''The Meltdown'' the Pig throws a tantrum for being excluded from the trip to Isla de Corales in ''The Getaway''. Frank sends it to obedience school, only for the Pig to escape on its second day there. The Pig is never found by the Heffleys despite numerous missing posters, and the pig's fate is left unclear.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:List of ''Diary of a Wimpy Kid'' characters}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Diary of a Wimpy Kid}}\n[[Category:Lists of literary characters]]\n[[Category:Diary of a Wimpy Kid (series)]]\n", "name_user": "Muhammad sammad ali bangledesh allah", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(I basically just moved an article to here)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Diary_of_a_Wimpy_Kid_characters"}

Union leaders claimed they were harassed online by Sanders supporters in response to these fliers. Sanders responded by condemning any harassment and defending the union's right to bargain for its membership, although he also pointed out that such conflicts are inevitable due to [[Anonymous post|anonymous posting]], and also mentioned the frequent sexist and racist attacks made by supporters of other candidates on members of his own team.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Edelman|first1=Adam|url=https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/2020-election/sanders-seeks-smooth-nevada-union-tensions-rivals-pounce-n1136451|title=Sanders seeks to smooth Nevada union tensions as rivals pounce|date=February 13, 2020|work=[[NBC News]]|publisher=[[NBCUniversal]]|location=New York City|accessdate=18 February 2020|last2=Timm|first2=Jane|language=en}}</ref>\n\nSeveral primary rivals criticized Sanders' campaign for the behavior of some of his supporters.

Memorable entrances included Alayah giving Peter a letter from her grandmother; Eunice entering with wings attached to the back of her dress; Madison arriving in a huge paper airplane; Lexi driving a classic 1962 [[Chevrolet Corvette (C1)|Chevrolet Corvette]]; Jasmine speaking [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] to Peter; Jenna presenting her \"emotional support cow\" named Ashley P.; Savannah blindfolding Peter and sharing the first kiss with him; and Kelley admitting she met Peter at a hotel prior to filming. [[Hannah Brown]] appeared, to return the pilot wings he gave her on the first night of [[The Bachelorette (season 15)|her season]].\n\nAfter giving a toast to all the women, Peter and Alayah read the letter her grandmother wrote; Sydney played mini-golf with him; Hannah Ann showed him a painting of her hometown overlooking the [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]], and Mykenna told him about her grandparents' 60+ year marriage. Peter kissed multiple women, including Hannah Ann, Tammy, and Mykenna. Hannah Ann ended up receiving the first impression rose. Avonlea, Eunice, Jade, Jenna, Katrina, Kylie, Maurissa, and Megan were eliminated.\n-----\nThe first group date consisted of Hannah Ann, Kelley, Deandra, Tammy, Victoria P., Courtney, Shiann, Jasmine, and Victoria F. at Sun Air Jet Hangar in [[Camarillo Airport]]. [[United States Marine Corps]] pilots Katie Cook and Alisa Johnson hosted a lesson for them. The women competed in an obstacle course; the final round came down to Tammy and Kelley. Kelley ended up winning a sunset flight with Peter after cheating in the final round, upsetting Tammy. The dinner portion was held at the [[Four Seasons Hotels and Resorts|Four Seasons]] hotel, where Peter and Kelley first met prior to filming. Peter gave the group date rose to Kelley, upsetting the other women who believed she had an unfair advantage.\n\nMadison received the 1-on-1 date, where she and Peter drive to his parents' house for their 31st wedding anniversary. Madison got to meet Peter's family members and friends at the house. His parents renewed their vows, with Peter as the ordained minister. During the night portion, Madison opens up about her family and received the rose. Afterward, Peter surprised her with a private [[Tenille Arts]] concert.\n\nThe second group date for the week consisted of Lauren, Sydney, Payton, Kelsey, Natasha, Alexa, Mykenna, Alayah and Savannah at the [[Avalon Hollywood]]. The women were dismayed to see Hannah Brown hosting the group date, which was supposed to be each woman telling a sex story to an audience. Hannah admitted to Peter backstage that she was struggling seeing him as the Bachelor, and was questioning whether she should've chosen him during her own season. Peter asked if she would consider joining the house. The episode ended with a cliffhanger.\n| LineColor       = 141921\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Bachelor (season 24)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 241\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Week 2\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|13}}\n| ProdCode        = 2402\n| Viewers         = 5.37<ref name=\"24.02\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-jan-13-2020/|title='America's Got Talent: The Champions' adjusts up: Monday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=January 14, 2020|accessdate=January 14, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200114215700/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-jan-13-2020/|archive-date=January 14, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Aux4            = 1.6/7<ref name=\"24.02\"/>\n| ShortSummary    = Continuing from the previous episode, Peter and Hannah Brown continued their discussion about their relationship; ultimately, they decided it would be best to part ways. Peter told the women the daytime portion was canceled and went straight to the night portion. The women were frustrated at the amount of time Peter had spent with Hannah, and he spent the night apologizing. Sydney ended up receiving the group date rose.\n\nAt the cocktail party, Kelsey was excited to share an expensive bottle of [[Dom P\u00e9rignon]], which she had received as a birthday present, with Peter. However, Hannah Ann unknowingly opened the bottle of champagne with Peter, which caused a fight between the two women. At the rose ceremony, an emotional Kelsey received the last rose. Courtney, Lauren, and Payton were eliminated.\n\n-----\n\nAlexa, Mykenna, Natasha, Deandra, Lexi, Victoria F., Kelsey, and Hannah Ann were selected on this group date at [[Melrose Avenue]] for a Revolve fashion show in front of an audience, which was judged by Peter, [[Carson Kressley]], [[Janice Dickinson]] and Revolve's chief brand officer Raissa Gerona.

[[Hannah Brown]] appeared, to return the pilot wings he gave her on the first night of [[The Bachelorette (season 15)|her season]].\n\nAfter giving a toast to all the women, Peter and Alayah read the letter her grandmother wrote; Sydney played mini-golf with him; Hannah Ann showed him a painting of her hometown overlooking the [[Great Smoky Mountains|Smoky Mountains]], and Mykenna told him about her grandparents' 60+ year marriage.

Peter told the women the daytime portion was canceled and went straight to the night portion. The women were frustrated at the amount of time Peter had spent with Hannah, and he spent the night apologizing. Sydney ended up receiving the group date rose.\n\nAt the cocktail party, Kelsey was excited to share an expensive bottle of [[Dom P\u00e9rignon]], which she had received as a birthday present, with Peter. However, Hannah Ann unknowingly opened the bottle of champagne with Peter, which caused a fight between the two women. At the rose ceremony, an emotional Kelsey received the last rose. Courtney, Lauren, and Payton were eliminated.\n\n-----\n\nAlexa, Mykenna, Natasha, Deandra, Lexi, Victoria F., Kelsey, and Hannah Ann were selected on this group date at [[Melrose Avenue]] for a Revolve fashion show in front of an audience, which was judged by Peter, [[Carson Kressley]], [[Janice Dickinson]] and Revolve's chief brand officer Raissa Gerona. Hannah Ann, who is a model, wins the fashion show and a brand new wardrobe, courtesy of Revolve.\n\nAt the night portion of the date, Victoria F. was upset as she was out of her comfort zone and felt like Peter didn\u2019t notice her. Peter reassured her that he liked her and wanted her to be there. Hannah Ann told Peter that she felt bullied by Kelsey after \"champagne-gate\".\n\nPeter gave the group date rose to Victoria F., and the episode ended on a cliffhanger, as he pulled Kelsey aside to question her about Hannah Ann's accusations.   \n| LineColor       = 141921\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Bachelor (season 24)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 242\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 3\n| Title           = Week 3\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|20}}\n| ProdCode        = 2403\n| Viewers         = 6.26<ref name=\"24.03\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-jan-20-2020/|title='The Neighborhood' and '9-1-1: Lone Star' adjust up: Monday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=January 22, 2020|accessdate=January 22, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200123065756/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-jan-20-2020/|archive-date=January 23, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Aux4            = 1.9/8<ref name=\"24.03\"/>\n| ShortSummary    = Continuing from the previous episode with \"champagne-gate,\" Hannah Ann and Kelsey sat down to talk but made no headway in their argument.

Victoria P. received the rose.\n\nAlayah showed her \"wild side\" at the mansion which rubbed the other girls the wrong way. Kiarra, Sarah, Tammy, Kelley, Shiann, Savannah, Sydney, and Alayah went on the second group date of the week, hosted by [[Demi Burnett]] from [[The Bachelor (season 23)|the twenty-third season of ''The Bachelor'']].

The women arrived at a saloon where they participated in \"Demi's Extreme Pillow Fight Club.\" Chris Harrison announced, alongside recurring guest announcer [[Fred Willard]]. Alayah was crowned champion, to the dismay of the other women.\n\nThe night portion commenced, and Alayah revealed her abandonment issues to Peter, who was pleased to see her open up. Sydney questioned Alayah's authenticity, and expresseD those concerns to Peter. Though Alayah tried to defend herself, Peter decided to give Sydney the group date rose for being honest with him and putting him first.\n\nThe following day, the cocktail party was canceled and was replaced by a pool party. Sydney gave Peter the choice of whom to believe, but multiple other women expressed to Peter that they thought Alayah was fake, \u201cturning it on\u201d for the cameras, and wasn\u2019t there for him.\n\nVictoria P. told Peter that Alayah asked her to lie to producers about their knowing each other, as they competed together at [[Miss USA 2019]]. She claimed that they weren't friends and only spent three hours together in total during their time at Miss USA. Peter confronted Alayah about this, and she justified it as not wanting them to be disqualified for knowing each other, and that she was there for him. Peter refuted the point by saying that her intentions were not genuine. He abruptly left, effectively ending the pool party.\n\nAt the rose ceremony, Peter decided to remove one rose and send an extra person home, meaning Alayah, Alexa, Jasmine, and Sarah were eliminated.\n| LineColor       = 141921\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|The Bachelor (season 24)\n| EpisodeNumber   = 243\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 4\n| Title           = Week 4\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2020|1|27}}\n| ProdCode        = 2404\n| Viewers         = 5.99<ref name=\"24.04\">{{cite web|url=https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-jan-27-2020/|title='The Bachelor,' '9-1-1: Lone Star,' everything else unchanged: Monday final ratings|last=Welch|first=Alex|website=[[TV by the Numbers]]|date=January 28, 2020|accessdate=January 28, 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200128220902/https://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/daily-ratings/monday-final-ratings-jan-27-2020/|archive-date=January 28, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n| Aux4            = 1.6/8<ref name=\"24.04\"/>\n| ShortSummary    = Chris Harrison drops by the mansion and reveals that the women will be meeting Peter in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]].

During the night portion at Nautica Queen Cruise Ship on [[Cuyahoga River]], Kelsey opens up to Peter about her parents' divorce and how she didn't see her father for 12 years after he left. Peter gives Kelsey the rose and they enjoy a fireworks show. At the hotel, Victoria F. discovers that Alayah found out about her dating Chase Rice while she was at home and had internet access, and told all the women when she returned. Victoria F. confronts Alayah and says she'll tell Peter that Alayah is manipulative and a pot-stirrer.\n\nAt the cocktail party, multiple women call Peter out for not appreciating them and giving Alayah the rose when she wasn't on the group date. Peter begins to question if some of the women will leave. Despite the women's frustration at how much time he has spent on the Alayah drama, Peter pulls Victoria P., Alayah, and Victoria F. aside to talk about it further.

Gray]], 1869</small>\n}}\n\nThe '''yellow-faced honeyeater''' (''Caligavis chrysops'') is a small to medium-sized bird in the [[honeyeater]] [[family (biology)|family]], Meliphagidae. It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]].

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies. The yellow-faced honeyeater averages {{convert|15|-|17.5|cm|in}} in length, with a wingspan of {{convert|21.5|-|26|cm|in|abbr=on}}, and a weight of {{convert|12.5|-|20.5|g|oz}}, with an average of {{convert|17|g|oz|abbr=on}}).{{sfn|Higgins|Christidis|Ford|2008|p=597}}{{sfn|Higgins|Peter|Steele|2001|p=724}}\n\n===Vocalizations===\nOne of the first birds heard in the morning, the yellow-faced honeyeater utters calls that are full and loud, and extremely varied.

It takes its common and scientific names from the distinctive yellow stripes on the sides of its head. Its loud, clear call often begins twenty or thirty minutes before dawn. It is widespread across eastern and southeastern Australia, in open [[sclerophyll]] forests from coastal dunes to high-altitude [[subalpine area]]s, and [[woodland]]s along creeks and rivers. Comparatively short-billed for a honeyeater, it is thought to have adapted to a diet of flies, spiders, and beetles, as well as nectar and pollen from the flowers of plants, such as ''[[Banksia]]'' and ''[[Grevillea]]'', and soft fruits. It catches insects in flight as well as [[Gleaning (birds)|gleaning]] them from the foliage of trees and shrubs.\n\nSome yellow-faced honeyeaters are sedentary, but hundreds of thousands [[bird migration|migrate]] northwards between March and May to spend the winter in southern [[Queensland]], and return in July and August to breed in southern [[New South Wales]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. They form [[Monogamy in animals|socially monogamous]] pairs and lay two or three eggs in a delicate [[cup nest|cup-shaped nest]]. The success rate can be low, and the pairs nest several times during the breeding season.\n\nHoneyeaters' preferred woodland habitat is vulnerable to the effects of land-clearing, grazing, and weeds. As it is common and widespread, the yellow-faced honeyeater is considered by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) to be of [[least concern]] for conservation. It is considered a pest in orchards in some areas.\n\n==Taxonomy==\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was first [[species description|described]], and placed in the genus ''[[Typical warbler|Sylvia]]'', by ornithologist, [[John Latham (ornithologist)|John Latham]], in his 1801 work, ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici, sive Systematis Ornithologiae''.<ref name=latham01>{{cite book | last=Latham | first=John | author-link=John Latham (ornithologist) | year=1801 | title=Supplementum indicis ornithologici sive systematis ornithologiae | place=London | publisher=Leigh & Sotheby | language=Latin | page=liv | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/33261428 }}</ref><ref name=Latham>{{cite journal | last = Schodde| first = Richard | authorlink = Richard Schodde |author2=Dickinson, Edward C. |author3=Steinheimer, Frank D. |author4=Bock, Walter J.  | title = The date of Latham's ''Supplementum Indicis Ornithologici'': 1801 or 1802? | journal = South Australian Ornithologist | volume = 35| issue = 8 | pages = 231\u2013235 | year = 2010| url=http://www.birdssa.asn.au/images/saopdfs/Volume35/2010V35P231.pdf }}</ref> French ornithologist, [[Louis Jean Pierre Vieillot]], described it as ''Melithreptus gilvicapillus'' in 1817, and English zoologist, [[George Robert Gray]], as ''Ptilotis trivirgata'' in 1869.<ref name=\"AFD\">{{cite web|url=https://biodiversity.org.au/afd/taxa/f27e5973-dc69-40d0-af23-ae1c49d6e0b3|title=Subspecies ''Caligavis chrysops chrysops'' (Latham, 1801)|author=Australian Biological Resources Study|date=13 October 2014|work=Australian Faunal Directory|publisher=Department of the Environment, Water, Heritage and the Arts, Australian Government|accessdate=7 January 2017|location=Canberra, Australian Capital Territory}}</ref> The specific name ''chrysops'' is derived from the [[Ancient Greek]] words ''chrysos'' meaning 'gold' and ''prosopo'' meaning 'face', in reference to the stripe of yellow feathers.<ref name=fraser13>{{cite book|last1=Gray|first1=Jeannie|last2=Fraser|first2=Ian|title=Australian Bird Names: A Complete Guide|url=https://books.google.com/?id=W1TCqHVWQp0C&pg=PT199#v=onepage&q=Yellow-faced%20honeyeater%20&f=false|year=2013|publisher=Csiro Publishing|location=Collingwood, Victoria | isbn=978-0-643-10471-6|page=199}}</ref>\n\nThe yellow-faced honeyeater was classified in the genera ''[[Meliphaga]]'' and then ''[[Lichenostomus]]'' until 2011.<ref name=\"AFD\"/> Delineating the latter genus had been systematically contentious, and evaluations of relationships among honeyeaters in the genus, using dense [[taxon]] and [[nucleotide]] sampling, confirmed previous findings that ''Lichenostomus'' is not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]].<ref name =Gardener>{{cite journal| last = Gardner | first = J.L.  | last2 = Trueman |first2=J.W.H. |last3=Ebert|first3=D. |last4=Joseph |first4=L. |last5=Magrath|first5=R.D. | title = Phylogeny and evolution of the ''Meliphagoidea'', the largest radiation of Australian songbirds  | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 55 | issue =  3| pages = 1087\u20131102 | year = 2010 | issn = 1055-7903  | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2010.02.005\n| pmid = 20152917}}</ref> Five species have previously been described as comprising the ''Caligavis'' subgroup, but studies, using the [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial]] DNA, identified the yellow-faced honeyeater as most closely related to the [[black-throated honeyeater]] (''C. subfrenatus'') and the [[obscure honeyeater]] (''C. obscurus'') of New Guinea; they were, therefore, grouped into the genus ''[[Caligavis]]''.

Above the yellow stripe is a black eye stripe which is broken by a small yellow to off-white patch behind the eye, and below is another distinct black stripe running the length of the yellow line. The chin, throat, and breast are a pale greyish-brown, streaked with slightly darker grey, and the abdomen is light grey. The upper body is a dark greyish-brown to olive-brown. Olive-green outer edges on the [[Flight feather|remiges]] combine to form an olive panel on the folded wing. The bill is black and slightly down-curved, and the gape is cream. The legs and feet are grey-brown. The [[Iris (anatomy)|iris]] is a dusky blue in adult birds, and brown in juveniles. The juvenile is very similar to the adult, with slightly less streaking on the breast, an orange-brown tip on the bill, and a yellower gape; male and female birds are also similar, with the male being slightly larger (on average, {{convert|0.8|g|oz|abbr=on}} heavier); and in the field there are no visible differences between the subspecies.

It has been recorded in coastal [[heath]] when banksias are blooming, and among flowering [[mangrove]]s. It occupies areas infested with weeds, such as Scotch broom (''[[Cytisus scoparius]]'') and [[Blackberry|blackberries]], and in developed areas including orchards, parks and gardens, where it feeds on cultivated fruit and flowers.

However, the yellow-faced honeyeater tends to nest away from the edge of forest remnants; experiments with natural and artificial nests at varying distances from the open areas showed no increase in the number of avian predators at the forest edge. The results of the field experiment did not support the \"[[ecological trap]]\" and \"predator influx\" theories, and contribute to a belief that [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmented habitats]] may not be as problematic as previously thought.<ref>{{cite journal | title=Do yellow-faced honeyeater (''Lichenostomus chrysops'') nests experience higher predation at forest edges? |last1=Boulton | first1=R.L. | last2=Clarke | first2=M.F. | journal =Wildlife Research | year= 2003 |volume=30| issue=2| pages=119\u2013125 | doi=10.1071/WR02055}}</ref><!-- cites prev 3 sentences --> In some areas, the species is considered a pest because of its intrusion into orchards and urban gardens, where it damages fruit.{{sfn|Officer|1965|p=50}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* {{cite book |last=Beruldsen |first=Gordon |authorlink=Gordon Beruldsen |year=1980 |title=A Field Guide to Nests and Eggs of Australian Birds |location=Adelaide, S.A. |publisher=Rigby |isbn=978-0-7270-1202-9 |ref=harv}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Higgins |first=Peter |first2=J.

She first appeared in the [[Casualty (series 22)|series twenty-two]] episode \"Take a Cup of Kindness\", broadcast on 29 December 2007. The character was a [[Consultant (medicine)|consultant]] in [[emergency medicine]] at [[Holby City Hospital]]'s emergency department. Sarker chose to take a temporary break from the show in 2014 and Zoe departed from the show in the [[Casualty (series 28)|series 28]] episode \"A Life Less Lived\", broadcast on 23 August 2014. She returned in the [[Casualty (series 29)|series 29]] episode \"Return to Sender\", broadcast on 25 October 2014. Sarker later decided to leave the series indefinitely, but producers asked that she did not announce her departure in order to surprise viewers. After over 9 years on-screen, Zoe departed the series in the [[Casualty (series 30)|series 30]] episode \"[[Hello, I Must Be Going (Casualty)|Hello, I Must Be Going]]\", broadcast on 7 May 2016. It was confirmed in September 2017 that Zoe would return for a single episode. She appeared in the [[Episode 1068|nineteenth episode]] of [[Casualty (series 32)|series 32]], broadcast on 13 January 2018.\n\nZoe was described as a \"maverick rebel-with-a-cause\" and a \"good doctor\" who \"knew what she was talking about\" by Sarker. Sarker had portrayed nurses in previous roles who were billed as loveable, sweet girls and preferred playing a fiesty character. Zoe enjoys being a doctor and prefers saving lives than working on paperwork, which influenced her decision to step down as clinical lead in 2014. Zoe's personal life is featured frequently in the series and Sarker described Zoe as \"kooky\" outside of work, but focused upon entering resus.\n\nZoe's storylines upon her introduction included an affair with married man Sean Anderson ([[Richard Dillane]]), being blackmailed for her affair with a fifteen-year-old while unaware of his age and being appointed the emergency department's clinical lead. Zoe later resigned from the post when she began struggling with the demands it involved. In 2008, Zoe became embroiled in helping Abby Evans ([[Amy Manson]]), who was being abused and when Abby was killed, Zoe fostered and planned to adopt her daughter Sharice Brooks ([[Adrianna Bertola]]). She later began a relationship with her colleague [[Nick Jordan (character)|Nick Jordan]] ([[Michael French]]), which dissolved when she lied about being pregnant with his child. They continued a friendship and when Nick refused surgery for a brain tumour, Zoe forged his signature.\n\nA long-running storyline for Zoe was her discovery that she was [[infertile]], something which affected her relationship with Matt Strong ([[Raymond Coulthard]]). Zoe developed close friendships with [[Dylan Keogh]] ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]) and [[Tess Bateman]] ([[Suzanne Packer]]) during her time in the ED. Zoe was appointed acting clinical lead in 2012, a role which she began permanently in early 2013. She clashed with her deputy [[Connie Beauchamp]] ([[Amanda Mealing]]) over her management of the emergency department and passed over the role to her in mid-2014. Show producers created a [[May\u2013December romance]] for Zoe in early 2014 with porter [[Max Walker (Casualty)|Max Walker]] ([[Jamie Davis]]). The relationship was well-received by viewers and was labelled \"Zax\" by fans. They married in 2015 which was followed by an explosive wedding reception that endangered various lives.\n\n==Casting==\nActress Sunetra Sarker was cast in the role of Zoe Hanna in 2007, joining the show during the [[Casualty (series 22)|twenty-second series]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/episode/tc9m/casualty--series-22---18-take-a-cup-of-kindness|title=Series 22 \u2013 18.

Not long after her arrival, Zoe had an affair with [[Orthopedic surgery|Orthopedic]] [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] Sean Anderson ([[Richard Dillane]]), unaware he is the husband of her colleague and friend, staff nurse [[Jessica Harrison (Casualty)|Jessica Harrison]] ([[Gillian Kearney]]). In [[Casualty (series 22)#ep618|series 22 episode 29]], Zoe goes head to head with [[Maggie Coldwell]] ([[Susan Cookson]]) for Harry's position, following his departure and successfully wins the post. When Maggie later appears at a tribunal for negligence, the hospital manager Marilyn Fox ([[Caroline Langrishe]]) asks Zoe to lie in court, condemning Maggie. Marilyn blackmails Zoe, threatening to reveal her affair with Sean to Jessica. Zoe disregards her threat, clears Maggie's name and admits her affair to everyone. Zoe then bids farewell to Maggie, who has decided to leave Holby to travel abroad.\n\nZoe is left upset when she discovers she cannot naturally conceive. Zoe later becomes close to Abby Evans ([[Amy Manson]]), a patient she has treated who is being abused by her husband and his father. After Abby manages to escape from them with her daughter, Sharice ([[Adrianna Bertola]]), Zoe lets them stay with her. Abby is extremely kind to Zoe and thankfully that she let them stay. When Abby and her husband are both killed in a fight, Zoe takes in Sharice permanently and begins fostering her. She begins taking steps to adopting Sharice, however, once Zoe realizes that she is struggling to balance her career and Sharice, she allows her to live with Abby's parents.\n\nZoe later begins a relationship with [[Nick Jordan (character)|Nick Jordan]] ([[Michael French]]), which Nick ends when he leaves the ED at the [[Casualty (series 23)#ep685|end of series 23]]. At the [[Casualty (series 24)#ep686|beginning of series 24]], Nick's clinical lead replacement, [[Adam Trueman]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), assigns Zoe three of the new junior doctors \u2013 [[May Phelps]] ([[Laura Aikman]]), [[Lenny Lyons]] ([[Steven Miller (actor)|Steven Miller]]) and [[Yuki Reid]] ([[Will Sharpe]]) \u2013 to her to show them the ropes of the ED and Zoe reassigns May to [[Ruth Winters]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) and Yuki to [[Jeff Collier (Casualty)|Jeff Collier]] and [[Polly Emmerson]] ([[Matt Bardock]] and [[Sophia Di Martino]]), while she keeps Lenny under her wing. Zoe later discovers that Nick left because he has a brain tumor and wanted to die alone. Zoe then lies to save his life against his will by forging his signature on documents allowing him treatment. Much remains unsaid in the relationship as he originally didn't appreciate the actions she made. As time goes on, Nick begins to assume she signed the papers saving his life because Zoe is pregnant, prompting her to begin failed cycles of fertility treatments. Nick never realized that she was not pregnant, but after she tells him that she isn't pregnant, Nick ends the relationship again. Nick and Zoe, however, continue to be great friends and close colleagues.\n\nZoe then begins a relationship with Joel (Max Deacon), unaware he is only fifteen and still in school. She discovers this and Joel steals her memory stick containing her work on, to ensure that Zoe would see him again. Zoe tracks him to a school trip to the zoo he is on with Nick and he attempts to swallow it causing him to be brought into the ED as a patient. In [[Casualty (series 25)|series twenty-five]], Zoe is shown to have developed a friendship new staff nurse, [[Madiha Durrani|Mads Durrani]] (Hasina Haque) and encouraged her to get more involved with the team outside of the ED, like going to the pub \u2013 despite her religion. A new consultant, [[Dylan Keogh]] ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]), arrives in the ED and makes quite an impression on Zoe and the rest of the team, but after spotting his light side, Zoe begins to warm to him. This is later seen again when Zoe discovers that Dylan helps out paramedics, Jeff and [[Dixie Dixon]] ([[Jane Hazlegrove]]) voluntarily. In [[Casualty (series 26)#ep786|series 26 episode 6]], Zoe receives an unexpected promotion from Nick. Her relationship with Dylan hits the rocks when she discovers he has a past with new doctor, [[Sam Nicholls]] ([[Charlotte Salt]]), but Dylan and Sam deny this. Zoe and Dylan are left trapped in resus when the hospital is set alight by a huge fire. They are saved by fire crew and both make a full recovery, but the relationship is once again left hit when it is revealed that Sam and Dylan are married.\n\nWhile on a night out with staff nurse, [[Linda Andrews (Casualty)|Linda Andrews]] ([[Christine Tremarco]]), Zoe discovers a desperate teenage in need of some serious medical attention, causing their night to be cut short. Zoe later helps Linda again when she tries making her niece, Britney (Devon Beigan) see that living with Linda, while her mother, Denise Andrews (Kate McEvoy) is imprisoned, won't be bad. Sam is later delivered some bad news by Zoe as she tells Sam that she has been called to testify against her in her upcoming court case, but when the court day arrives, Zoe tells the court some serious information that changes everything. Zoe later helps Sam when she realizes that Sam actually wants to divorce Dylan and Zoe persuades her to send the papers to Dylan.\n\nWhen Nick's girlfriend, DCI Yvonne Rippon ([[Rachel Shelley]]) was stabbed during the Holby Riots, Nick took extended leave to look after her and Director of Surgery, [[Henrik Hanssen]] ([[Guy Henry (actor)|Guy Henry]]) promoted Zoe to acting clinical lead. Zoe is left disappointed when Dylan decides to leave Holby after realizing that he hasn't got over Sam and never will.

Sarker had portrayed nurses in previous roles who were billed as loveable, sweet girls and preferred playing a fiesty character. Zoe enjoys being a doctor and prefers saving lives than working on paperwork, which influenced her decision to step down as clinical lead in 2014. Zoe's personal life is featured frequently in the series and Sarker described Zoe as \"kooky\" outside of work, but focused upon entering resus.\n\nZoe's storylines upon her introduction included an affair with married man Sean Anderson ([[Richard Dillane]]), being blackmailed for her affair with a fifteen-year-old while unaware of his age and being appointed the emergency department's clinical lead.

They continued a friendship and when Nick refused surgery for a brain tumour, Zoe forged his signature.\n\nA long-running storyline for Zoe was her discovery that she was [[infertile]], something which affected her relationship with Matt Strong ([[Raymond Coulthard]]). Zoe developed close friendships with [[Dylan Keogh]] ([[William Beck (actor)|William Beck]]) and [[Tess Bateman]] ([[Suzanne Packer]]) during her time in the ED. Zoe was appointed acting clinical lead in 2012, a role which she began permanently in early 2013. She clashed with her deputy [[Connie Beauchamp]] ([[Amanda Mealing]]) over her management of the emergency department and passed over the role to her in mid-2014. Show producers created a [[May\u2013December romance]] for Zoe in early 2014 with porter [[Max Walker (Casualty)|Max Walker]] ([[Jamie Davis]]).
