Hinkle", "text_new": "{{short description|American Jungian psychiatrist}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=April 2014}}\n[[File:Beatrice M Hinkle 1911 sitting.jpg|thumb|Ca. 1911]]\n'''Beatrice Moses Hinkle''' (1874\u20131953) was a pioneering American [[feminist]], [[psychoanalyst]], writer, and translator.\n\n==Early life and marriage==\nHinkle was born in [[San Francisco, California]], to physician B. Frederick Moses and Elizabeth Benchley Van Geisen.  In 1892 she married Walter Scott Hinkle, an [[assistant district attorney]].  Hinkle had considered studying law, but after being discouraged by her husband \"with a good hardy laugh\", she entered [[Cooper Medical College]] (now part of [[Stanford University]]) in 1895.\n\n==Writing==\nIn 1905 Hinkle became the first woman physician in the country to hold a public health position (McHenry, 1980). She was appointed as San Francisco's city physician. This particular fact was very important in her career because this was the very first time a female doctor was given such a responsibility.  In 1908 she moved East to New York City and (along with Dr. Charles R. Dana) founded the country's first therapeutic clinic in the United States in 1908 at Cornell Medical School (McHenry 1980). In 1909 she decided to study with Freud and left for Vienna. While she admired Freud's contributions to psychoanalysis, she later broke with his teachings finding herself at odds with the rigid sexual hypotheses of the strictly Freudian analysts (Karier, 1986). Freud's lack of recognition to women's psychological autonomy led her to change her mind about Freud's understanding of the human psyche. Thus Freud's thinking pushed her to align herself with the psychoanalytic group that supported Carl Jung's theories. Tired of hearing Freud's assertion that female psyche was a derivation of the male's, Dr. Hinkle returned to New York in 1915 determined to spread Jung's words in America.\n\nOne of Dr. Beatrice Moses Hinkle's major distinction is that she was the first to present [[Carl Jung]]'s writing to the English-speaking world. Jung's consideration of the female psyche as independent from males, attracted the admiration of Dr. Hinkle in such degree that she became the official translator of his work in America. In 1916 she translated ''Psychology of the Unconscious: A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido''. She was a fundamental part of the book since her own ideas were included in this work. She renewed these theories and remained a constant contributor. Dr. Hinkle added several theories of her own that were constructed through her personal experience with both Freud and Jung. She broadened the context of terms such as \"complex\" and \"repression.\" She explained that \" This important group of ideas or impressions, those that come out from the patient's mind while being psychoanalyzed, with the feelings and emotions clustered around them which are betrayed through this painful process, was called by Jung a complex\" (Hinkle, 1916, p.&nbsp;14).\n\nDr. Hinkle thought that one of the most attractive parts of Jung's theories was referred to the relief for those in revolt against the repressive character of the patriarchal society that under girded Freud's worldview (Karier, 1986). In this aspect, Jung proposed that the mother is the real dominant figure in the child's life and not the father as proposed by Freud. This also allowed for a break with the masculine dominance of Freudian psychology without blurring the traditional distinctions between masculine and feminine psychosexual roles. About this particular Jung's assertion, Dr. Hinkle expressed: \"Jung's development of this point of view shows very clearly that, just as the problem of the father is the great fact of Freud's psychology, the problem of the mother is the essence of Jung's, with the struggle carried on between the two great forces of love and power\" (Karier, 1986, p.&nbsp;291). Thus Jung's consideration of the female psyche as independent from males, attracted the admiration of Dr. Hinkle in such degree that she became the official translator of his work in America.\n\nHinkle was a member of the [[Greenwich Village]] based feminist network, the [[Heterodoxy Club]], lending credence to the group by being the only professionally trained and practicing psychoanalyst.  It was as a member of this group that she began writing, including occasional contributions to [[Progressive Education Survey]] and [[Harper's Magazine]].  Her themes included [[women's rights]], [[women's suffrage]], and issues of divorce, [[individualism]], and [[legal status]].  She wrote often of the need for women to liberate themselves from what she called the \"psychic bondage\" of women to men.\n\nHer book, ''The Re-Creating of the Individual: A Study of Psychological Types and Their Relation to Psychoanalysis'', was favorably reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1923.  In addition to her own writing and Jung translations, she also contributed to the books ''The Book of Marriage'' by [[Hermann von Keyserling]], and ''Our Changing Morality'' by [[Freda Kirchwey]].\n\nHer autobiographical essay was published in 2003 in ''These Modern Women: Autobiographical Essays from the Twenties'', edited by [[Elaine Showalter]].\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n===Books===\n*''The Re-Creating of the Individual: A Study of Psychological Types and Their Relation to Psychoanalysis'' ([[George Allen & Unwin]], London, 1923).\n*[[Carl Jung]], [[Psychology of the Unconscious|''Psychology of the Unconscious : A Study of the Transformations and Symbolisms of the Libido'']], (translated 1916).\n\n===Partial list of articles===\n*''The Chaos of Modern Marriage'', December 1925 (Harper's Magazine)\n*''Woman's Subjective Dependence Upon Man'', January 1932 (Harper's Magazine)\n\n==Further reading==\n*Showalter, Elaine, ed.

He was born in [[Willingham by Stow]], near [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]], and died in [[Edinburgh]]. He appeared in 633 [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], including five [[Test cricket|Test matches]], as a righthanded [[batting (cricket)|batsman]], scoring 16,749 [[run (cricket)|runs]] with a highest score of 166 and held 209 catches. He scored 13 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] and 69 half-centuries.<ref name=\"caprofile\">{{cite web  |url-access=subscription |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/189/189.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Lord Hawke profile |accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince an 1870 inheritance of his father, Hawke was styled {{abbr|Hon.|the Honourable}}; he inherited the barony on 5 December 1887 on the death of his father, {{abbr|Rev.|the Reverend}} {{abbr|Rt. Hon.|the Right Honourable}} '''Edward Henry Julius Hawke''', [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of Willingham 1854\u20131875, after which the family returned to its seat (main home held for a generation or more), Wighill House and Park, near [[Tadcaster]], [[Yorkshire]]. [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Admiral Hawke, the first Baron]], was among the few Admirals elevated for his roles during the [[Seven Years' War]]: at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]], off [[Nantes]], France, and promoting the [[Western Squadron]] blockade of France.\n\nHawke was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where he was a member of the school cricket eleven in 1878 and 1879. As he had been a moderate scholar, his father decided he should receive private tuition at home for two years. In October 1881, Hawke went up to [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where he was a member of the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club]] team from 1882 to 1885. He won a [[Blue (university sport)|Cambridge blue]] three times: in 1882, 1883 and 1885. He was [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of the Cambridge team in the [[1885 English cricket season|1885 season]].\n\nAfter Hawke left Eton in July 1879 and began his two years of private tuition, he was invited by the [[Edmund Carter (cricketer, born 1845)|Reverend Edmund Carter]] to play for the Yorkshire Gentlemen's Cricket Club, which was based at the [[Wigginton Road Cricket Ground|Yorkshire Gentlemen Cricket Club Ground]] in [[York]]. Living at Wighill Park since 1875 had given Hawke a residential qualification to play for the county club and, in September 1881, Carter invited him to the [[Scarborough Festival]] where he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). Hawke went to Cambridge a month later and played for the university team from May to July 1882 before returning to Yorkshire. At this time, Hawke was usually the only amateur in the Yorkshire team. He refused the captaincy at first, saying he wanted to learn the job by playing under the professional captain, Test [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] [[Tom Emmett]]. Hawke was formally appointed club captain for the 1883 season, though he was still at Cambridge, and held the post until 1910. He remains the most successful county captain ever, Yorkshire winning the [[County Championship]] a record eight times during his tenure.\n\nAs a captain, Hawke was noted for taking a strong, and some would say paternalistic, interest in the welfare of his professional players. Certain aspects of this policy caused resentment but he was on the whole respected for it. Even so, he was strict on discipline and expelled the England bowler [[Bobby Peel]] from first-class cricket after he went out to play in a drunken state.\n\nDuring his playing career, Hawke became an influential figure in cricket administration. He was elected Yorkshire club president in 1898, while still captaining the team, and held the post until his death. He had a missionary-like zeal to develop cricket overseas and undertook nine tours as a player between 1887\u201388 and 1911\u201312, leading teams to Australia, India (twice), North America (twice), South Africa (twice), the West Indies and Argentina. All five of Hawke's Test appearances were made in South Africa. He captained the England team four times and was always on the winning side.\n\nAfter he retired from playing, Hawke became a major figure at MCC as well as at Yorkshire. He was appointed President of MCC for 1914 and retained the post, which is normally an annual appointment, through the First World War. He was appointed Honorary Treasurer of MCC from 1932 to 1937. As an administrator, he held considerable influence but came under some criticism. He was accused of inactivity at the time of the ''[[Bodyline]]'' controversy. Most famously, he was disparaged for his oft-quoted and oft-misquoted statement: \"Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England\". Hawke's biographer noted that \"his blunders on numerous public forums were to blight his declining years\".\n\nHawke married in 1916 but he and his wife had no children. After 1924, when the lease on Wighill Park expired, the couple lived in [[North Berwick]]. His wife died in 1936 and Hawke himself died in hospital following a collapse at his home. He was succeeded as Baron Hawke by his younger brother.\n\n==Personal and family life==\nMartin Bladen Hawke was born on 16 August 1860 at Willingham Rectory, [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]]. He was the sixth child, and eldest surviving son, of Edward Henry Julius Hawke, 6th [[Baron Hawke]] of [[Towton]], and Baroness Hawke (n\u00e9e Jane Dowker).

James Coldham quoted Hawke as saying to Emmett that he wanted to \"pick up a few wrinkles first\".<ref>Coldham, p. 38.</ref> Hawke and Emmett got along very well, despite their social differences, and Hawke played to the end of August under Emmett's leadership, often being the only amateur in the team.<ref name=\"Coldham40\">Coldham, p. 40.</ref> There had been few [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]] cricketers in the Yorkshire team before Hawke and there had been complaints from the cricket establishment that the Yorkshire Committee preferred to play professionals.<ref name=H42>Hodgson, p. 42.</ref> This had much to do with the clash between the county club and Carter's Yorkshire Gentlemen but there was in fact a shortage of suitably talented amateurs too.<ref name=H42/> Hawke assumed the captaincy for the two Scarborough Festival matches against MCC and I Zingari.<ref name=\"Coldham40\"/> At the end of the 1882 season, though he had just turned 22, Hawke was appointed Yorkshire club captain, the first amateur to hold the position. He remained in charge for 28 seasons until 1910, during which time the team won eight [[County Championship]]s, still a record for one captain in county cricket.<ref name=\"caprofile\" />\n\nIn a tribute to Hawke, the editor of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\".<ref name=\"wistrib\"/> [[Derek Birley]] commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".<ref name=Birley134>Birley, pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> The odd man out was [[Louis Hall]], a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an [[opening batsman]] and was reputedly the first [[teetotalism|teetotaller]] ever to play for them.<ref name=Birley134/> Their best players included Emmett, [[Ephraim Lockwood]], [[George Ulyett]], [[Ted Peate]], [[Billy Bates]] and [[Allen Hill]], while [[Bobby Peel]] made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\".<ref name=Birley134/>\n\nHawke's task was not only to eradicate the drink problem but also, in Birley's view, \"to unite the club's geographical and social factions\" and try to produce a winning team.<ref name=Birley134/> Yorkshire had evolved from the old [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and it had been the case since its foundation in 1863 that all fourteen members of the County Committee were elected by [[Sheffield]] districts; and all fourteen of these committee men plus the Secretary Joseph Wostinholm were loyal to the President and Treasurer, Michael Ellison. As a result, to the chagrin and vociferous opposition of the rest of the county, Ellison and Sheffield effectively controlled Yorkshire cricket. Edmund Carter was one of Ellison's main critics and opponents. At the end of the 1882 season, in addition to appointing Hawke as captain, the committee agreed to reorganise itself for the first time since the club's foundation. Admitting that it should represent the views of Yorkshire as a whole, the committee enlarged itself from 14 to 21 by inviting seven new members: one each from [[Bradford]], [[Dewsbury]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Huddersfield]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]] and [[York]] in addition to the existing 14 from Sheffield. So, although the other districts now had a voice, the Sheffield contingent retained complete control. However, York's representative was Edmund Carter and, although there was now reduced friction in Yorkshire's affairs, the issue of representation had only been deferred.<ref>Coldham, pp. 35\u201340.</ref>\n\nHawke at this time had minimal influence and Coldham wrote that he cannot be seen as anything more than an \"instrument of change\", though his appointment did represent a \"watershed\" in the club's history.<ref name=\"Coldham40\"/> Whatever the extent of Hawke's involvement in the 1882 machinations, ten years would pass before Yorkshire was fully reorganised and, coincidentally, it was in 1893 that Hawke's team won Yorkshire's first official County Championship.<ref name=\"Coldham40\"/> Birley wrote that Yorkshire, \"restored to feudalism\", was now \"ready to play the establishment game\".<ref name=Birley134/>\n\n[[File:Bobby Peel c1895.jpg|thumb|right|Bobby Peel]]\nHawke enjoyed a personal success in the second match of the 1883 season when he scored his maiden first-class century with 141 for Cambridge against [[Charles Thornton (cricketer)|C I Thornton's XI]] at [[Fenner's]].

In a history of Yorkshire cricket to the end of the 19th century, the author commented that the Yorkshire team was \"terribly slack in the field\" and their reputation, which became a joke among county players, was such that they were believed to be too polite to run anyone out.<ref name=\"C57\">Coldham, p. 57.</ref> For example, [[W.

Hawke scored 241 runs at 15.06 with two half-centuries.<ref name=fcbat/> With the title won by a team built on his principles and under his direction, Hawke established himself the ''de facto'' supremo of Yorkshire cricket. His captaincy had changed the character of cricket in the county and, for himself, he enjoyed cricket both as a pastime and in terms of his own growing influence upon it.<ref name=\"Kilburn, p.25\"/> In Kilburn's view, Hawke \"accepted authority and the responsibilities of authority; he assumed the responsibilities of leadership and exercised them with determination to lead\".<ref name=\"Kilburn, p.25\"/>\n\nThe combination of Hawke's methods and the professional approach of his players (including amateurs like Jackson) produced consistency and Yorkshire developed a \"playing to win\" philosophy that persisted into the latter half of the 20th century, the improvement in fielding being its most significant aspect.<ref>Kilburn, p. 28.</ref> The consistency is evident in a glance at the championship standings from 1893 to 1909, effectively the rest of Hawke's captaincy, when the team had one fourth-place finish (1897) and were otherwise always in the top three with titles in 1893, 1896, 1898, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1905 and 1908.<ref name=H252/>\n\nHawke had a better season in 1894 when he played 25 matches and scored 725 runs at 20.13 with a highest score of 157, his personal best to date, which he made for [[A.

He began the season in great style after his return from a winter tour of South Africa, scoring a career-high 166 for Yorkshire against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] as Yorkshire amassed a record 887 with Hawke and Peel sharing a partnership of 292 for the 8th wicket.<ref>{{cite web  |url-access=subscription |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4496.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire in 1896 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref> Three weeks later he scored 110 not out for Yorkshire against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]].<ref name=figures/> Both these centuries were scored in May but Hawke did not maintain his fine start to the season and finished with a total of 708 runs at 24.41.<ref name=fcbat/>\n\n===1897 to 1902===\n[[File:Lord Hawke c1900.jpg|thumb|Lord Hawke c. 1900]]\nOne of Hawke's qualities as a leader was his willingness to impose discipline when necessary and a famous instance of this occurred in 1897 when he was forced to dismiss Bobby Peel from Yorkshire's service for drunkenness.<ref>Birley, p. 156.</ref> However, Peel's replacement was [[Wilfred Rhodes]] who became arguably the club's greatest-ever player.<ref>Kilburn, p. 27.</ref> Yorkshire won a third title in 1898, the same year that Hawke was elected Yorkshire President in succession to Michael Ellison, and he again scored two centuries in the season. He just missed his thousand runs, scoring 950 at 30.64 including scores of 107 not out for Yorkshire against Kent and 134 for Yorkshire against Warwickshire.

They were \"essentially a complete team\" with the batting of Tunnicliffe, Brown and [[David Denton (cricketer)|David Denton]]; the powerful all-round play of Hirst, Rhodes and [[Schofield Haigh]]; and, crucially given [[Test cricket|Test]] calls, \"plentiful reserves of high quality\".<ref name=S24>Swanton, p. 24.</ref> According to Kilburn, Hawke came to the \"fulfilment of his cricketing ambitions\" with the three successive titles which were \"a logical culmination to ten years of cultivation\".<ref>Kilburn, p. 26.</ref> Hawke's own batting was variable during these three seasons.

In 1901, Hirst and Rhodes were invited to join a team organised by [[Archie MacLaren]] to tour Australia and Hawke refused to authorise their selection, preferring instead to have the Yorkshire Committee pay them compensation. Hawke was driven by principle as he strongly supported a demand for official sponsorship of England Tests at home and tours abroad. He believed that MCC should accept this responsibility and, when a year later they did, Hawke was more than willing to release his players to assist England. Hawke's concern was that any Yorkshire players on tour should be given the same care and consideration that they received from the county club and he believed that only MCC would share Yorkshire's sense of responsibility.<ref>Kilburn, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===1903 to 1911===\n[[File:Lord Hawke c1905.jpg|thumb|Lord Hawke c. 1905]]\nJoseph Wolstinholm retired as Club Secretary after the 1902 season and was succeeded by [[Frederick Toone]] who had previously been the secretary at [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]].

Hawke praised Toone for increasing the membership from 3,000 in 1903 to over 7,000 ten years later.<ref>Hawke, ''Fifty years of Yorkshire county''.</ref> They worked together to further improve the terms and conditions of the professional players' contracts. To 1914, they were paid \u00a35 for a home match and \u00a36 for an away match with a \u00a31 win bonus. Players who had received their county cap were obliged to join the Cricketers' Friendly Society and were paid the winter wage of \u00a32 a week.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1898, Hawke publicly criticised the England team selection system which was done by the appropriate ground authority ahead of the next Test match. Hawke advocated creation of a central selection committee and, soon afterwards, the MCC Committee agreed with his proposal. Hawke himself was appointed chairman of the inaugural selection panel in 1899, although he was still playing for Yorkshire. He held the post until he retired in 1909, incorporating five Test series.<ref name=\"Hodgson, p.48\">Hodgson, p. 48.</ref> He was reappointed in 1933 and served for one year.<ref name=\"P&D\">Pope & Dyson, pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Hawke was appointed president of MCC, normally an annual position, but he was asked to remain in the post till the end of the First World War.<ref name=\"P&D\"/> As a result, Hawke was MCC president for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler [[Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster|Henry Forster]], who shortly afterwards succeeded to the title of Lord Forster of Lepe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww1talk.co.uk/showthread.php?1543-Southend-John-and-Alfred-Forster-WW1-War-Memorial |publisher=World War I Talk |title=Southend \u2013 John and Alfred Forster WW1 War Memorial |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in ''Wisden's'' view, Hawke was \"the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution\".<ref name=\"wistrib\"/>\n\nAt the Yorkshire club's Annual General Meeting in 1925: Hawke made a famous statement that has often been both quoted and misquoted:<ref>Gibson, p. 154.</ref>\n<blockquote>''Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England. I love and admire them all, but we have always had an amateur skipper and when the day comes when we shall have no more amateurs captaining England it will be a thousand pities''.</blockquote>\n\nThis outburst was in response to an article in the ''[[Sunday Dispatch|Weekly Dispatch]]'' newspaper by Lancashire off-spinner [[Cec Parkin]], described by establishment figures as a \"cricketing Bolshevik\", in which Parkin argued that the professional [[Jack Hobbs]] should captain England instead of the establishment amateur [[Arthur Gilligan]].<ref>Birley, pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> It was an embarrassing incident which [[Pelham Warner]], as editor of ''[[The Cricketer]]'', did his best to explain away.<ref>Birley, p. 220.</ref> Coldham maintains that what Hawke really meant to say was that it would be a pity if there was no amateur good enough to play for England.<ref>Coldham, p. 184.</ref> He excuses Hawke by asserting that he was accident-prone with \"a talent for tripping himself up\" by speaking too impulsively; and so \"could behave like a complete ass in public\".<ref>Coldham, p. 183.</ref>\n\nIn fact, Hawke was incorrect when he said England had \"always had an amateur skipper\". The convention of having an amateur captain effectively began with himself in the 1890s but, before that, England had been captained by [[James Lillywhite]], [[Alfred Shaw]] and Arthur Shrewsbury: all professionals, but only on overseas tours, so it is possible that Hawke was referring to the captaincy in home Tests.<ref>See [[List of England cricket captains]].</ref> Hawke did not live to see [[Len Hutton]] become the next professional England captain but he did see [[Wally Hammond]], a former professional, turn amateur so that he could captain England, and Hawke reportedly supported Hammond's appointment.<ref name=\"wistrib\"/>\n\nYet Hawke had a different view about the captaincy of Yorkshire as, in 1927, he advocated the appointment of the professional batsman [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] to the post. A controversy arose and Sutcliffe declined the offer with the result that [[William Worsley]], another amateur, was appointed instead.<ref>See [[Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927]].</ref> Controversy was not Sutcliffe's only reason as he could see that a professional captain would not be given the freedom to lead the team as he wished.<ref>Coldham, p. 185.</ref> Sutcliffe had been very disappointed a few years earlier when Jack Hobbs had refused the England captaincy and he subsequently told [[Bill Bowes]] that \"Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there\", raising his hand from knee to shoulder height, \"the professional cricketers lifted it to there\", raising his hand above his head, \"and even Lord Hawke always wanted it back again\". Sutcliffe concluded by saying that Hobbs should have accepted the England captaincy for the sake of professional cricket.<ref>Bowes, p. 152.</ref>\n\nHawke succeeded [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]] as MCC Treasurer in 1932 and remained in both this post and the presidency of Yorkshire until his death in 1938.<ref name=\"obit\"/> He soon faced criticism for his lack of response to calls from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]] about the \"[[bodyline]]\" controversy in the 1932\u201333 tour. Swanton said that Hawke, along with his right-hand man Sir Stanley Jackson, needed \"a lot of convincing that the English tactics constituted a menace to the game which demanded action\".<ref>Swanton, p. 50.</ref> In Swanton's view (1986), \"Hawke's place in cricket history derives more from... (Yorkshire cricket and touring activities) ...than from any outstanding service to MCC as such\".<ref>Swanton, p. 51.</ref> But Hawke as an administrator had considerable influence on events and Swanton also wrote that, though he was never among the great players, Hawke \"must stand with [[Thomas Lord]], [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]] and W. G. Grace among influences on the development of the game\".<ref>Swanton, p. 468.</ref> A contemporary view of Hawke's position in the game was expressed by Grace in his ''Reminiscences'' (1899) when he wrote that \"Hawke still influences what I call the ''politics'' of the game\".<ref>Grace, p. 349.</ref>\n\nIn one of its tributes to Hawke, ''Wisden'' said:<ref name=\"wistrib\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151836.html |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1939 |title=The late Lord Hawke |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n<blockquote>''Besides being a great cricketer in the highest sense of the word, (Hawke) was an administrator who not only aimed at the general welfare of the game, but sought to preserve in it an untarnished ethical code. To him cricket was more {{sic|that}} a game. It was a philosophy that coloured his dealings with people and things''.</blockquote>\n\nIn those dealings, Hawke was never comfortable as a public speaker and is said to have loathed making speeches. Coldham wrote that \"his blunders on numerous public forums were to blight his declining years\". The converse of this was that Hawke had personal charm and tact which were assets to him in small groups or with individuals.<ref>Coldham, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Style and personality==\nHawke was a middle order batsman of reasonable quality who was generally considered good enough to play for the Gentlemen and may have under-achieved as a batsman, perhaps owing to the pressures of captaincy.<ref name=S189/> He was noted for his on-side drive, which was his favourite stroke.<ref name=R440/>\nHis highest career score was the 166 which he scored for Yorkshire against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1896 when Yorkshire totalled a record 887 and he shared with Peel a record eighth wicket partnership of 292.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 66, 289.</ref> Hawke took part in another record partnership in 1898 when he and David Hunter put on 148 for the tenth wicket against Kent.<ref>Kilburn, p. 31.</ref> He played in 633 first-class matches and had 936 innings, including 105 in which he was not out, scoring 16,749 runs at an average of 20.15. He completed 13 centuries and 69 half-centuries.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/>\n\nAs a fielder, Hawke generally took up position in the midfield or deep areas.<ref name=\"Hodgson, p.48\"/> ''Wisden'' editor [[Hubert Preston]] recalled Hawke's \"speed and sure picking up\" when fielding.<ref name=\"tributes\"/> Hawke held 209 catches in his first-class career.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/> He was never a bowler and, in his entire first-class career, bowled just 5 four-ball overs, conceding 0\u201316 at nearly a run a ball.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/>\n\nWriting during Hawke's career, [[Ranjitsinhji|K. S. Ranjitsinhji]] in his ''Jubilee Book of Cricket'' (1897) describes Hawke as \"a capital leader of men\".<ref name=R440>Ranjitsinhji, p. 440.</ref> The measure of his success as a captain was that Yorkshire under his leadership won the [[County Championship]] title 8 times.<ref name=S189/> Hawke was an archetypal amateur gentleman playing at a time when professionals were generally viewed as [[second-class citizen]]s but Hawke, who had great admiration for the professional cricketers in his charge was determined to improve their status and give them respectability.<ref name=\"CIpro\"/> He insisted on discipline and neatness from his professionals and, in return, he gave them a financial stability they had formerly lacked. He instituted winter pay after the 1896 season, initially \u00a32 per week, and established a merit system which resulted in payment of bonuses.<ref>Hodgson, p. 69.</ref> In the longer term, he persuaded the club committee to retain and invest for the player two-thirds of his benefit money instead of handing him the whole amount to spend freely. Above all, wrote Swanton, he \"deserves to be remembered for what he did for the pros\".<ref name=S189/> Hawke's financial policies were a great success at Yorkshire and his legacy was a general improvement in the finances and status of professional players everywhere as other counties followed his lead.<ref name=\"P&D\"/> W. G. Grace in his ''Reminiscences'' (1899) commented that Hawke \"succeeded in introducing an ''esprit de corps'' and a standard of discipline, from the absence of which the county had been suffering\".<ref name=G350/> Grace added that Hawke \"is a splendid captain, inspiring his men by the example he gives them of pluck and resource\".<ref name=G350/>\n\nIn a tribute to Hawke's captaincy policy, Stanley Jackson wrote:<ref name=\"tributes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151846.html |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1939 |title=Tributes to Lord Hawke by Sir Stanley Jackson, Sir Francis Lacey & Hubert Preston |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n<blockquote>''A personal interest in each individual player and his welfare, which was then begun and lasted to the end, gained for \"His Lordship\" a respect and loyalty from every member of the team which I think must have been unique''.</blockquote>\n\nJackson recalled that when Hawke began his career, Yorkshire had a \"completely professional side including players whose names became famous in cricket history\". Hawke soon realised that \"such a team of fine natural cricketers, under sympathetic management and firm leadership, would develop into a most formidable and attractive county side\". Jackson points out that:<ref name=\"tributes\"/>\n<blockquote>''This happened: public interest and support throughout Yorkshire followed and continued to increase until today the Yorkshire County Cricket Club with its fine county side, receives probably, the most generous and loyal support of any in the country. Hawke's initiative, with the co-operation of an enthusiastic and competent committee, laid the foundation of Yorkshire County Cricket upon which the present position has been built''.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough he was benevolent in his care of his players, Hawke would not tolerate any action that brought the game into disrepute or was perceived to be outside its \"spirit\". When Bobby Peel went out to play under the effects of too much alcohol, Hawke escorted him off the field and, as Peel himself sarcastically noted: \"Lord Hawke put his arm round me and helped me off the ground \u2013 and out of first-class cricket.

He was born in [[Willingham by Stow]], near [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]], and died in [[Edinburgh]]. He appeared in 633 [[first-class cricket|first-class matches]], including five [[Test cricket|Test matches]], as a righthanded [[batting (cricket)|batsman]], scoring 16,749 [[run (cricket)|runs]] with a highest score of 166 and held 209 catches. He scored 13 [[century (cricket)|centuries]] and 69 half-centuries.<ref name=\"caprofile\">{{cite web  |url-access=subscription |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/0/189/189.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Lord Hawke profile |accessdate=18 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nSince an 1870 inheritance of his father, Hawke was styled {{abbr|Hon.|the Honourable}}; he inherited the barony on 5 December 1887 on the death of his father, {{abbr|Rev.|the Reverend}} {{abbr|Rt. Hon.|the Right Honourable}} '''Edward Henry Julius Hawke''', [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|Rector]] of Willingham 1854\u20131875, after which the family returned to its seat (main home held for a generation or more), Wighill House and Park, near [[Tadcaster]], [[Yorkshire]]. [[Edward Hawke, 1st Baron Hawke|Admiral Hawke, the first Baron]], was among the few Admirals elevated for his roles during the [[Seven Years' War]]: at the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]], off [[Nantes]], France, and promoting the [[Western Squadron]] blockade of France.\n\nHawke was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]], where he was a member of the school cricket eleven in 1878 and 1879. As he had been a moderate scholar, his father decided he should receive private tuition at home for two years. In October 1881, Hawke went up to [[Magdalene College, Cambridge]], where he was a member of the [[Cambridge University Cricket Club]] team from 1882 to 1885. He won a [[Blue (university sport)|Cambridge blue]] three times: in 1882, 1883 and 1885. He was [[captain (cricket)|captain]] of the Cambridge team in the [[1885 English cricket season|1885 season]].\n\nAfter Hawke left Eton in July 1879 and began his two years of private tuition, he was invited by the [[Edmund Carter (cricketer, born 1845)|Reverend Edmund Carter]] to play for the Yorkshire Gentlemen's Cricket Club, which was based at the [[Wigginton Road Cricket Ground|Yorkshire Gentlemen Cricket Club Ground]] in [[York]]. Living at Wighill Park since 1875 had given Hawke a residential qualification to play for the county club and, in September 1881, Carter invited him to the [[Scarborough Festival]] where he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against [[Marylebone Cricket Club]] (MCC). Hawke went to Cambridge a month later and played for the university team from May to July 1882 before returning to Yorkshire. At this time, Hawke was usually the only amateur in the Yorkshire team. He refused the captaincy at first, saying he wanted to learn the job by playing under the professional captain, Test [[bowling (cricket)|bowler]] [[Tom Emmett]]. Hawke was formally appointed club captain for the 1883 season, though he was still at Cambridge, and held the post until 1910. He remains the most successful county captain ever, Yorkshire winning the [[County Championship]] a record eight times during his tenure.\n\nAs a captain, Hawke was noted for taking a strong, and some would say paternalistic, interest in the welfare of his professional players. Certain aspects of this policy caused resentment but he was on the whole respected for it. Even so, he was strict on discipline and expelled the England bowler [[Bobby Peel]] from first-class cricket after he went out to play in a drunken state.\n\nDuring his playing career, Hawke became an influential figure in cricket administration. He was elected Yorkshire club president in 1898, while still captaining the team, and held the post until his death. He had a missionary-like zeal to develop cricket overseas and undertook nine tours as a player between 1887\u201388 and 1911\u201312, leading teams to Australia, India (twice), North America (twice), South Africa (twice), the West Indies and Argentina. All five of Hawke's Test appearances were made in South Africa. He captained the England team four times and was always on the winning side.\n\nAfter he retired from playing, Hawke became a major figure at MCC as well as at Yorkshire. He was appointed President of MCC for 1914 and retained the post, which is normally an annual appointment, through the First World War. He was appointed Honorary Treasurer of MCC from 1932 to 1937. As an administrator, he held considerable influence but came under some criticism. He was accused of inactivity at the time of the ''[[Bodyline]]'' controversy. Most famously, he was disparaged for his oft-quoted and oft-misquoted statement: \"Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England\". Hawke's biographer noted that \"his blunders on numerous public forums were to blight his declining years\".\n\nHawke married in 1916 but he and his wife had no children. After 1924, when the lease on Wighill Park expired, the couple lived in [[North Berwick]]. His wife died in 1936 and Hawke himself died in hospital following a collapse at his home. He was succeeded as Baron Hawke by his younger brother.\n\n==Personal and family life==\nMartin Bladen Hawke was born on 16 August 1860 at Willingham Rectory, [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]]. He was the sixth child, and eldest surviving son, of Edward Henry Julius Hawke, 6th [[Baron Hawke]] of [[Towton]], and Baroness Hawke (n\u00e9e Jane Dowker).

James Coldham quoted Hawke as saying to Emmett that he wanted to \"pick up a few wrinkles first\".<ref>Coldham, p. 38.</ref> Hawke and Emmett got along very well, despite their social differences, and Hawke played to the end of August under Emmett's leadership, often being the only amateur in the team.<ref name=\"Coldham40\">Coldham, p. 40.</ref> There had been few [[Amateur status in first-class cricket|amateur]] cricketers in the Yorkshire team before Hawke and there had been complaints from the cricket establishment that the Yorkshire Committee preferred to play professionals.<ref name=H42>Hodgson, p. 42.</ref> This had much to do with the clash between the county club and Carter's Yorkshire Gentlemen but there was in fact a shortage of suitably talented amateurs too.<ref name=H42/> Hawke assumed the captaincy for the two Scarborough Festival matches against MCC and I Zingari.<ref name=\"Coldham40\"/> At the end of the 1882 season, though he had just turned 22, Hawke was appointed Yorkshire club captain, the first amateur to hold the position. He remained in charge for 28 seasons until 1910, during which time the team won eight [[County Championship]]s, still a record for one captain in county cricket.<ref name=\"caprofile\" />\n\nIn a tribute to Hawke, the editor of ''[[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]]'' related that Hawke's \"strength of the character was tested\" when, as a young man on leaving Cambridge, he undertook the responsibility of captaining the Yorkshire side, composed at that time of \"elements that were not entirely harmonious\". Owing to Hawke's \"tact, judgment and integrity\", he moulded the Eleven into \"the best, and probably the most united county cricket team in England\".<ref name=\"wistrib\"/> [[Derek Birley]] commented on the Yorkshire team to 1883 as \"gifted but scarcely house-trained professionals\" who were often described as \"ten drunks and a parson\".<ref name=Birley134>Birley, pp. 134\u2013135.</ref> The odd man out was [[Louis Hall]], a [[Nonconformist (Protestantism)|Nonconformist]] lay preacher who had joined Yorkshire in 1873 as an [[opening batsman]] and was reputedly the first [[teetotalism|teetotaller]] ever to play for them.<ref name=Birley134/> Their best players included Emmett, [[Ephraim Lockwood]], [[George Ulyett]], [[Ted Peate]], [[Billy Bates]] and [[Allen Hill]], while [[Bobby Peel]] made his first-class debut for Yorkshire in July 1882. Birley added that their performances and \"rough-hewn image\" had become an embarrassment to the gentlemanly wing of the club and the decision was taken to appoint a captain who would \"instill discipline and sobriety into this wayward team\".<ref name=Birley134/>\n\nHawke's task was not only to eradicate the drink problem but also, in Birley's view, \"to unite the club's geographical and social factions\" and try to produce a winning team.<ref name=Birley134/> Yorkshire had evolved from the old [[Sheffield Cricket Club]] and it had been the case since its foundation in 1863 that all fourteen members of the County Committee were elected by [[Sheffield]] districts; and all fourteen of these committee men plus the Secretary Joseph Wostinholm were loyal to the President and Treasurer, Michael Ellison. As a result, to the chagrin and vociferous opposition of the rest of the county, Ellison and Sheffield effectively controlled Yorkshire cricket. Edmund Carter was one of Ellison's main critics and opponents. At the end of the 1882 season, in addition to appointing Hawke as captain, the committee agreed to reorganise itself for the first time since the club's foundation. Admitting that it should represent the views of Yorkshire as a whole, the committee enlarged itself from 14 to 21 by inviting seven new members: one each from [[Bradford]], [[Dewsbury]], [[Halifax, West Yorkshire|Halifax]], [[Huddersfield]], [[Kingston upon Hull|Hull]], [[Leeds]] and [[York]] in addition to the existing 14 from Sheffield. So, although the other districts now had a voice, the Sheffield contingent retained complete control.

In a history of Yorkshire cricket to the end of the 19th century, the author commented that the Yorkshire team was \"terribly slack in the field\" and their reputation, which became a joke among county players, was such that they were believed to be too polite to run anyone out.<ref name=\"C57\">Coldham, p. 57.</ref> For example, [[W.

Hawke himself had an indifferent season, averaging only 17.75, but his response was to dispense with the services of several players who were not up to standard.

It was achieved by what Hodgson called \"a cumulative effort\", although the standout players were [[Ted Wainwright]], Hirst and Peel; and was the \"first confirmation of Hawke's striving for teamwork and discipline\".<ref>Hodgson, p. 59.</ref> Hawke himself played in only 11 matches that season and George Ulyett deputised for him as team captain. Hawke scored 241 runs at 15.06 with two half-centuries.<ref name=fcbat/> With the title won by a team built on his principles and under his direction, Hawke established himself the ''de facto'' supremo of Yorkshire cricket. His captaincy had changed the character of cricket in the county and, for himself, he enjoyed cricket both as a pastime and in terms of his own growing influence upon it.<ref name=\"Kilburn, p.25\"/> In Kilburn's view, Hawke \"accepted authority and the responsibilities of authority; he assumed the responsibilities of leadership and exercised them with determination to lead\".<ref name=\"Kilburn, p.25\"/>\n\nThe combination of Hawke's methods and the professional approach of his players (including amateurs like Jackson) produced consistency and Yorkshire developed a \"playing to win\" philosophy that persisted into the latter half of the 20th century, the improvement in fielding being its most significant aspect.<ref>Kilburn, p. 28.</ref> The consistency is evident in a glance at the championship standings from 1893 to 1909, effectively the rest of Hawke's captaincy, when the team had one fourth-place finish (1897) and were otherwise always in the top three with titles in 1893, 1896, 1898, 1900, 1901, 1902, 1905 and 1908.<ref name=H252/>\n\nHawke had a better season in 1894 when he played 25 matches and scored 725 runs at 20.13 with a highest score of 157, his personal best to date, which he made for [[A.

He began the season in great style after his return from a winter tour of South Africa, scoring a career-high 166 for Yorkshire against [[Warwickshire County Cricket Club|Warwickshire]] at [[Edgbaston Cricket Ground|Edgbaston]] as Yorkshire amassed a record 887 with Hawke and Peel sharing a partnership of 292 for the 8th wicket.<ref>{{cite web  |url-access=subscription |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/4/4496.html |publisher=CricketArchive |title=Warwickshire v Yorkshire in 1896 |accessdate=5 August 2011}}</ref> Three weeks later he scored 110 not out for Yorkshire against [[Kent County Cricket Club|Kent]].<ref name=figures/> Both these centuries were scored in May but Hawke did not maintain his fine start to the season and finished with a total of 708 runs at 24.41.<ref name=fcbat/>\n\n===1897 to 1902===\n[[File:Lord Hawke c1900.jpg|thumb|Lord Hawke c. 1900]]\nOne of Hawke's qualities as a leader was his willingness to impose discipline when necessary and a famous instance of this occurred in 1897 when he was forced to dismiss Bobby Peel from Yorkshire's service for drunkenness.<ref>Birley, p. 156.</ref> However, Peel's replacement was [[Wilfred Rhodes]] who became arguably the club's greatest-ever player.<ref>Kilburn, p. 27.</ref> Yorkshire won a third title in 1898, the same year that Hawke was elected Yorkshire President in succession to Michael Ellison, and he again scored two centuries in the season. He just missed his thousand runs, scoring 950 at 30.64 including scores of 107 not out for Yorkshire against Kent and 134 for Yorkshire against Warwickshire. In 1899, he scored 923 runs at 26.37 with a highest score of 127 for Yorkshire against Hampshire.<ref name=figures/><ref name=fcbat/>\n\nSwanton wrote that, by 1900, Hawke had \"moulded Yorkshire into the finest side in the country\" and they won the County Championship three years in succession from 1900 to 1902. They were \"essentially a complete team\" with the batting of Tunnicliffe, Brown and [[David Denton (cricketer)|David Denton]]; the powerful all-round play of Hirst, Rhodes and [[Schofield Haigh]]; and, crucially given [[Test cricket|Test]] calls, \"plentiful reserves of high quality\".<ref name=S24>Swanton, p. 24.</ref> According to Kilburn, Hawke came to the \"fulfilment of his cricketing ambitions\" with the three successive titles which were \"a logical culmination to ten years of cultivation\".<ref>Kilburn, p. 26.</ref> Hawke's own batting was variable during these three seasons. He had little success in 1900 but scored 902 runs and 7 half-centuries in 1901; and then 565 runs with 2 centuries and no half-centuries in 1902.<ref name=fcbat/> His 1902 centuries were 107 not out for MCC against Oxford University and 126 for Yorkshire against [[Surrey County Cricket Club|Surrey]].<ref name=figures/>\n\nHawke's loyalty to Yorkshire was such that he would put county before country if an issue arose. In 1901, Hirst and Rhodes were invited to join a team organised by [[Archie MacLaren]] to tour Australia and Hawke refused to authorise their selection, preferring instead to have the Yorkshire Committee pay them compensation. Hawke was driven by principle as he strongly supported a demand for official sponsorship of England Tests at home and tours abroad. He believed that MCC should accept this responsibility and, when a year later they did, Hawke was more than willing to release his players to assist England. Hawke's concern was that any Yorkshire players on tour should be given the same care and consideration that they received from the county club and he believed that only MCC would share Yorkshire's sense of responsibility.<ref>Kilburn, pp. 45\u201346.</ref>\n\n===1903 to 1911===\n[[File:Lord Hawke c1905.jpg|thumb|Lord Hawke c. 1905]]\nJoseph Wolstinholm retired as Club Secretary after the 1902 season and was succeeded by [[Frederick Toone]] who had previously been the secretary at [[Leicestershire County Cricket Club|Leicestershire]].

Hawke played in all four first-class matches on the tour, including the three Tests, but he totalled only 46 runs in his six innings with a highest score of 30; he held three catches.\n\nHawke toured South Africa again in 1898\u201399. This time, the team played five first-class matches, including two Tests which England won. The players included [[Johnny Tyldesley]], [[Schofield Haigh]], [[Albert Trott]] and [[Pelham Warner]]. Although Hawke was successful as a winning captain, his batting was poor with only 69 runs in eight innings, his top score being 31[[not out|*]].\n\n===West Indies: 1896\u201397===\nHawke toured the West Indies in 1896\u201397. He appeared in seven first-class matches but failed badly with the bat, totalling only 113 runs in nine innings with a top score of 26; he held three catches.

He scored only 55 runs in eight innings at an average of just 7.85 with a highest score of 30; and he held 3 catches.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/>\n\n==Administrative career==\n[[File:Lord Hawke - Vanity Fair-alt-edit-2-cropped.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Caricature of Lord Hawke by ''[[Leslie Ward|Spy]]'', first published in ''[[Vanity Fair (UK magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' on 24 September 1892 with the caption \"Yorkshire Cricket\".]]\nHawke's administrative career began in 1898 when, following the death of Michael Ellison, he was elected to succeed him as Yorkshire President and remained in office for forty years, in the first twelve of which he was also the Yorkshire team captain.<ref name=\"Kilburn, p.25\"/> He formed a successful liaison with Frederick Toone, who was club secretary from 1902 until his death in June 1930. Hawke praised Toone for increasing the membership from 3,000 in 1903 to over 7,000 ten years later.<ref>Hawke, ''Fifty years of Yorkshire county''.</ref> They worked together to further improve the terms and conditions of the professional players' contracts. To 1914, they were paid \u00a35 for a home match and \u00a36 for an away match with a \u00a31 win bonus. Players who had received their county cap were obliged to join the Cricketers' Friendly Society and were paid the winter wage of \u00a32 a week.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 87\u201388.</ref>\n\nIn 1898, Hawke publicly criticised the England team selection system which was done by the appropriate ground authority ahead of the next Test match. Hawke advocated creation of a central selection committee and, soon afterwards, the MCC Committee agreed with his proposal. Hawke himself was appointed chairman of the inaugural selection panel in 1899, although he was still playing for Yorkshire. He held the post until he retired in 1909, incorporating five Test series.<ref name=\"Hodgson, p.48\">Hodgson, p. 48.</ref> He was reappointed in 1933 and served for one year.<ref name=\"P&D\">Pope & Dyson, pp. 50\u201351.</ref>\n\nIn 1914, Hawke was appointed president of MCC, normally an annual position, but he was asked to remain in the post till the end of the First World War.<ref name=\"P&D\"/> As a result, Hawke was MCC president for five years from 1914 to 1918 inclusive and was succeeded in 1919 by the former Hampshire slow left-arm bowler [[Henry Forster, 1st Baron Forster|Henry Forster]], who shortly afterwards succeeded to the title of Lord Forster of Lepe.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ww1talk.co.uk/showthread.php?1543-Southend-John-and-Alfred-Forster-WW1-War-Memorial |publisher=World War I Talk |title=Southend \u2013 John and Alfred Forster WW1 War Memorial |accessdate=24 July 2010}}</ref> Throughout the war, Lord's was used for military purposes, including training and recreation. Problems frequently arose but, in ''Wisden's'' view, Hawke was \"the greatest help in giving wise counsel towards their solution\".<ref name=\"wistrib\"/>\n\nAt the Yorkshire club's Annual General Meeting in 1925: Hawke made a famous statement that has often been both quoted and misquoted:<ref>Gibson, p. 154.</ref>\n<blockquote>''Pray God, no professional shall ever captain England. I love and admire them all, but we have always had an amateur skipper and when the day comes when we shall have no more amateurs captaining England it will be a thousand pities''.</blockquote>\n\nThis outburst was in response to an article in the ''[[Sunday Dispatch|Weekly Dispatch]]'' newspaper by Lancashire off-spinner [[Cec Parkin]], described by establishment figures as a \"cricketing Bolshevik\", in which Parkin argued that the professional [[Jack Hobbs]] should captain England instead of the establishment amateur [[Arthur Gilligan]].<ref>Birley, pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> It was an embarrassing incident which [[Pelham Warner]], as editor of ''[[The Cricketer]]'', did his best to explain away.<ref>Birley, p. 220.</ref> Coldham maintains that what Hawke really meant to say was that it would be a pity if there was no amateur good enough to play for England.<ref>Coldham, p. 184.</ref> He excuses Hawke by asserting that he was accident-prone with \"a talent for tripping himself up\" by speaking too impulsively; and so \"could behave like a complete ass in public\".<ref>Coldham, p. 183.</ref>\n\nIn fact, Hawke was incorrect when he said England had \"always had an amateur skipper\". The convention of having an amateur captain effectively began with himself in the 1890s but, before that, England had been captained by [[James Lillywhite]], [[Alfred Shaw]] and Arthur Shrewsbury: all professionals, but only on overseas tours, so it is possible that Hawke was referring to the captaincy in home Tests.<ref>See [[List of England cricket captains]].</ref> Hawke did not live to see [[Len Hutton]] become the next professional England captain but he did see [[Wally Hammond]], a former professional, turn amateur so that he could captain England, and Hawke reportedly supported Hammond's appointment.<ref name=\"wistrib\"/>\n\nYet Hawke had a different view about the captaincy of Yorkshire as, in 1927, he advocated the appointment of the professional batsman [[Herbert Sutcliffe]] to the post. A controversy arose and Sutcliffe declined the offer with the result that [[William Worsley]], another amateur, was appointed instead.<ref>See [[Yorkshire captaincy affair of 1927]].</ref> Controversy was not Sutcliffe's only reason as he could see that a professional captain would not be given the freedom to lead the team as he wished.<ref>Coldham, p. 185.</ref> Sutcliffe had been very disappointed a few years earlier when Jack Hobbs had refused the England captaincy and he subsequently told [[Bill Bowes]] that \"Lord Hawke lifted professional cricket from there to there\", raising his hand from knee to shoulder height, \"the professional cricketers lifted it to there\", raising his hand above his head, \"and even Lord Hawke always wanted it back again\". Sutcliffe concluded by saying that Hobbs should have accepted the England captaincy for the sake of professional cricket.<ref>Bowes, p. 152.</ref>\n\nHawke succeeded [[George Harris, 4th Baron Harris|Lord Harris]] as MCC Treasurer in 1932 and remained in both this post and the presidency of Yorkshire until his death in 1938.<ref name=\"obit\"/> He soon faced criticism for his lack of response to calls from the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Board of Control]] about the \"[[bodyline]]\" controversy in the 1932\u201333 tour. Swanton said that Hawke, along with his right-hand man Sir Stanley Jackson, needed \"a lot of convincing that the English tactics constituted a menace to the game which demanded action\".<ref>Swanton, p. 50.</ref> In Swanton's view (1986), \"Hawke's place in cricket history derives more from... (Yorkshire cricket and touring activities) ...than from any outstanding service to MCC as such\".<ref>Swanton, p. 51.</ref> But Hawke as an administrator had considerable influence on events and Swanton also wrote that, though he was never among the great players, Hawke \"must stand with [[Thomas Lord]], [[William Clarke (cricketer)|William Clarke]] and W. G. Grace among influences on the development of the game\".<ref>Swanton, p. 468.</ref> A contemporary view of Hawke's position in the game was expressed by Grace in his ''Reminiscences'' (1899) when he wrote that \"Hawke still influences what I call the ''politics'' of the game\".<ref>Grace, p. 349.</ref>\n\nIn one of its tributes to Hawke, ''Wisden'' said:<ref name=\"wistrib\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151836.html |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1939 |title=The late Lord Hawke |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n<blockquote>''Besides being a great cricketer in the highest sense of the word, (Hawke) was an administrator who not only aimed at the general welfare of the game, but sought to preserve in it an untarnished ethical code. To him cricket was more {{sic|that}} a game. It was a philosophy that coloured his dealings with people and things''.</blockquote>\n\nIn those dealings, Hawke was never comfortable as a public speaker and is said to have loathed making speeches. Coldham wrote that \"his blunders on numerous public forums were to blight his declining years\". The converse of this was that Hawke had personal charm and tact which were assets to him in small groups or with individuals.<ref>Coldham, p. 63.</ref>\n\n==Style and personality==\nHawke was a middle order batsman of reasonable quality who was generally considered good enough to play for the Gentlemen and may have under-achieved as a batsman, perhaps owing to the pressures of captaincy.<ref name=S189/> He was noted for his on-side drive, which was his favourite stroke.<ref name=R440/>\nHis highest career score was the 166 which he scored for Yorkshire against Warwickshire at Edgbaston in 1896 when Yorkshire totalled a record 887 and he shared with Peel a record eighth wicket partnership of 292.<ref>Hodgson, pp. 66, 289.</ref> Hawke took part in another record partnership in 1898 when he and David Hunter put on 148 for the tenth wicket against Kent.<ref>Kilburn, p. 31.</ref> He played in 633 first-class matches and had 936 innings, including 105 in which he was not out, scoring 16,749 runs at an average of 20.15. He completed 13 centuries and 69 half-centuries.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/>\n\nAs a fielder, Hawke generally took up position in the midfield or deep areas.<ref name=\"Hodgson, p.48\"/> ''Wisden'' editor [[Hubert Preston]] recalled Hawke's \"speed and sure picking up\" when fielding.<ref name=\"tributes\"/> Hawke held 209 catches in his first-class career.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/> He was never a bowler and, in his entire first-class career, bowled just 5 four-ball overs, conceding 0\u201316 at nearly a run a ball.<ref name=\"caprofile\"/>\n\nWriting during Hawke's career, [[Ranjitsinhji|K. S. Ranjitsinhji]] in his ''Jubilee Book of Cricket'' (1897) describes Hawke as \"a capital leader of men\".<ref name=R440>Ranjitsinhji, p. 440.</ref> The measure of his success as a captain was that Yorkshire under his leadership won the [[County Championship]] title 8 times.<ref name=S189/> Hawke was an archetypal amateur gentleman playing at a time when professionals were generally viewed as [[second-class citizen]]s but Hawke, who had great admiration for the professional cricketers in his charge was determined to improve their status and give them respectability.<ref name=\"CIpro\"/> He insisted on discipline and neatness from his professionals and, in return, he gave them a financial stability they had formerly lacked. He instituted winter pay after the 1896 season, initially \u00a32 per week, and established a merit system which resulted in payment of bonuses.<ref>Hodgson, p. 69.</ref> In the longer term, he persuaded the club committee to retain and invest for the player two-thirds of his benefit money instead of handing him the whole amount to spend freely. Above all, wrote Swanton, he \"deserves to be remembered for what he did for the pros\".<ref name=S189/> Hawke's financial policies were a great success at Yorkshire and his legacy was a general improvement in the finances and status of professional players everywhere as other counties followed his lead.<ref name=\"P&D\"/> W. G. Grace in his ''Reminiscences'' (1899) commented that Hawke \"succeeded in introducing an ''esprit de corps'' and a standard of discipline, from the absence of which the county had been suffering\".<ref name=G350/> Grace added that Hawke \"is a splendid captain, inspiring his men by the example he gives them of pluck and resource\".<ref name=G350/>\n\nIn a tribute to Hawke's captaincy policy, Stanley Jackson wrote:<ref name=\"tributes\">{{cite web |url=http://www.cricinfo.com/wisdenalmanack/content/story/151846.html |work=Wisden Cricketers' Almanack |year=1939 |title=Tributes to Lord Hawke by Sir Stanley Jackson, Sir Francis Lacey & Hubert Preston |accessdate=21 August 2010}}</ref>\n<blockquote>''A personal interest in each individual player and his welfare, which was then begun and lasted to the end, gained for \"His Lordship\" a respect and loyalty from every member of the team which I think must have been unique''.</blockquote>\n\nJackson recalled that when Hawke began his career, Yorkshire had a \"completely professional side including players whose names became famous in cricket history\". Hawke soon realised that \"such a team of fine natural cricketers, under sympathetic management and firm leadership, would develop into a most formidable and attractive county side\". Jackson points out that:<ref name=\"tributes\"/>\n<blockquote>''This happened: public interest and support throughout Yorkshire followed and continued to increase until today the Yorkshire County Cricket Club with its fine county side, receives probably, the most generous and loyal support of any in the country. Hawke's initiative, with the co-operation of an enthusiastic and competent committee, laid the foundation of Yorkshire County Cricket upon which the present position has been built''.</blockquote>\n\nAlthough he was benevolent in his care of his players, Hawke would not tolerate any action that brought the game into disrepute or was perceived to be outside its \"spirit\". When Bobby Peel went out to play under the effects of too much alcohol, Hawke escorted him off the field and, as Peel himself sarcastically noted: \"Lord Hawke put his arm round me and helped me off the ground \u2013 and out of first-class cricket. What a gentleman!\"<ref name=\"CIpro\"/> Hawke always carried himself as he thought a gentleman should and Bill Bowes, who first met him in 1928, recalled his \"mannerism of pulling his shoulders back as he spoke, like a [[sergeant major]] in the [[Grenadier Guards|Guards]]\".<ref>Bowes, p. 27.</ref>\n\nIt has been said that cricket was Lord Hawke's life whereas to the more talented Jackson, for example, cricket was only his sport.<ref name=\"CIpro\">{{cite web |url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/content/player/14101.html |publisher=ESPNCricInfo |title=Lord Hawke profile |accessdate=2 October 2010}}</ref><ref>Coldham, p. 138.</ref> In Birley's view, when Hawke joined Yorkshire as an Etonian who had come down from Cambridge, he was \"prepared to make cricket the most serious thing \u2013 almost the only thing \u2013 he did with the rest of his life\".<ref name=Birley134/> Birley criticised Hawke as an \"autocratic, opinionated, utterly self-confident sprig of the aristocracy\" and as \"a disciple\" of his friend Lord Harris.<ref name=Birley134/> In a later passage, Birley states that Hawke was \"not as bright as his idol, Lord Harris, and so less skilful in concealing his ineffable self-satisfaction\".<ref name=Birley157>Birley, p. 157.</ref> In Hawke's autobiography, written in 1924, are comments like: \"I believe I have done more than anyone else to raise the standard and self-respect of the splendid paid section of first-class cricketers\" and Birley's view of the book is that it \"must be one of the least modest works ever compiled\".<ref name=Birley157/>\n\nHawke had the reputation of being both a strict disciplinarian and a staunch traditionalist but, though he had his faults, he did care passionately about cricket and about the welfare of Yorkshire's professional players.<ref name=\"CIpro\"/> \"Cricket,\" he once wrote, \"is a moral lesson in itself, and the classroom is God's air and sunshine. Foster it, my brothers, protect it from anything that will sully it, so that it will be in favour with all men\".<ref name=\"CIpro\"/> ''Wisden'' said that Hawke \"always played to win\", but whatever the game, he was \"a generous opponent\" and \"never harbored resentment\".<ref name=\"wistrib\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Altham|first=H.

He managed [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in the  2017\u201318 season, before his contract was terminated on 30 April 2018.\n\nDavies originally made his name as a vital part of the Chesterfield team which reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 1997. He left Chesterfield at the end of that season, having made 148 appearances for the club and joined [[Premier League]] club Southampton in May 1997. He only spent one season at Southampton, making 30 appearances, before he joined Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in a club-record \u00a37.5&nbsp;million deal. Once again, he spent a single season at the club, making 29 appearances, before rejoining Southampton in 1999. In his second spell at the club, he made 95 appearances, also spending part of 2002 on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Millwall, where he made nine appearances. Released by Southampton at the end of the [[2002\u201303 Southampton F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]], he joined Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer. He was made Bolton [[captain (association football)|team captain]] in January 2009, but began to fall out of favour at Bolton towards the end of the [[2012\u201313 Bolton Wanderers F.C. season|2012\u201313 season]], and the club decided against renewing his contract. Davies made 407 appearances for Bolton, scoring 85 goals, then played two seasons at Preston North End before retiring.\n\nHe made three appearances for the [[England national under-21 football team|England under-21 team]] between 1997 and 2000.

He managed [[Southport F.C.|Southport]] in the  2017\u201318 season, before his contract was terminated on 30 April 2018.\n\nDavies originally made his name as a vital part of the Chesterfield team which reached the semi-finals of the [[FA Cup]] in 1997. He left Chesterfield at the end of that season, having made 148 appearances for the club and joined [[Premier League]] club Southampton in May 1997. He only spent one season at Southampton, making 30 appearances, before he joined Premier League club Blackburn Rovers in a club-record \u00a37.5&nbsp;million deal. Once again, he spent a single season at the club, making 29 appearances, before rejoining Southampton in 1999. In his second spell at the club, he made 95 appearances, also spending part of 2002 on [[Loan (sports)|loan]] to [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club Millwall, where he made nine appearances. Released by Southampton at the end of the [[2002\u201303 Southampton F.C. season|2002\u201303 season]], he joined Premier League club Bolton Wanderers on a free transfer.

DNA was extracted and dated. The skeleton was found to be 13,000 years old, and it is considered the oldest genetically intact human skeleton ever found in the Americas.

Although the exact pre-colonization population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Indigenous populations diminished by between 80% and 90% within the first centuries of European colonization. The majority of these losses are attributed to the introduction of Afro-Eurasian diseases into the Americas. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which the early colonists brought from Europe.\n\nThe spread of infectious diseases was slow initially,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} as most Europeans were not actively or visibly infected, due to inherited immunity from generations of exposure to these diseases in Europe. This changed when the Europeans began the [[human trafficking]] of massive numbers of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Western and Central African people]] to the Americas.

Many of the European diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [[yellow fever]], that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult.

Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] began to wane.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1\u20134|publisher= Mesoweb Reports & News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Maya script|Maya writing system]] was a combination of [[phonetic]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s\u2014that is, it was a [[logosyllabic]] writing system. It is the only pre-Columbian writing system known to represent completely the [[spoken language]] of its community. In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D. |authorlink=Michael D.

There are only a few extant inscriptions, making study of this writing system difficult.\n\n[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.<ref>Elizabeth Hill Boone, \"Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico\". p. 158.</ref> The colonial era codices contain not only [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), Spanish, and occasionally [[Latin]].\n\nSpanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there are a large number of local-level documents in [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Nahuatl Literacy\", in George A. Collier et al, eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York: Academic Press 1982, pp. 395\u2013417.</ref> The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [[New Philology]] to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].\n\nAboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American music}}\n\n[[File:Apache violin, made by Chesley Wilson, 1989 - National Museum of American History - DSC00053.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Apache fiddle]] made by [[Chesley Goseyun Wilson]] ([[San Carlos Apache]])]]\n[[File:JuPi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Textile art by Julia Pingushat ([[Inuk]], [[Arviat]], Nunavut, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995]]\n[[File:Gorget, Peru, north coast, Chimu style, c. 1350-1450 AD, feathers, reeds, copper bars, silver, metal overlaid with skin - Textile Museum, George Washington University - DSC09898.JPG|thumb|[[Chimu culture]] feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350\u20131450 CE]]\n\n[[Native American music]] can vary between cultures, however there are significant commonalities. Traditional music often centers around [[drum]]ming and singing. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, [[clapper stick]]s, and rasps are also popular percussive instruments, both historically and in contemporary cultures. [[Flute]]s are made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The [[Apache]] have a type of [[Apache fiddle|fiddle]], and [[fiddle]]s are also found among a number of [[First Nations]] and [[M\u00e9tis]] cultures.\n\nThe music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America, like that of the North American cultures, tend to be spiritual ceremonies. It traditionally includes a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea shells (used as trumpets) and \"rain\" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600\u2013900 CE); this jar was decorated with imagery depicting a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420123834/http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|date=2004-04-17|archivedate=2015-04-20|accessdate=2016-06-22|title=Music from the Land of the Jaguar|publisher=The Princeton Art Museum}} (Includes sound sample.) {{Dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas]] comprise a major category in the world [[Collection (museum)|art collection]].

The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala. After many other attacks with an army reinforced with Guatemalan Indian allies, the Spanish were able to conquer Cuzcatlan. After further attacks, the Spanish also conquered the Lenca people. Eventually, the Spaniards intermarried with Pipil and Lenca women, resulting in the Mestizo population which would become the majority of the Salvadoran people.

But those who identify as indigenous, from being raised in those cultures, make up only around 2% of the total population. The indigenous peoples speak around 29 different languages and many more dialects. As some of the ethnic groups are very small, their native languages are in danger of becoming extinct in the next decades. The most important indigenous groups are the [[Ye'kuana]], the [[Wayuu]], the [[Pemon]] and the [[Warao people|Warao]]. The most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who lived mainly in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.\n\nThe 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives the indigenous [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [[primary education]] in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.\n\n=== Other parts of the Americas ===\n[[File:Kulusuk, Inuit couple (6822265499).jpg|thumb|[[Tunumiit]] [[Inuit]] couple from [[Kulusuk]], [[Greenland]]]]\nIndigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charr\u00faa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.<ref name=\"enha_asc\"/> Some governments recognize some of the major Native American languages as official languages: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]].\n\n==Native American name controversy==\n{{Main|Native American name controversy}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe Native American name controversy relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship. Many English [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [[endonyms]] from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples.\n\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term \"[[Native American name controversy|Native American]],\" to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans or American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples. They prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations.\n\n==Rise of indigenous movements==\n{{Indigenous rights}}\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and preservation of their cultures. Organizations such as the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations, for instance those across the [[Amazon Basin]]. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].\n\nThere has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [[United Nations]] voted to adopt the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.\n\nIn Colombia, various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221046/http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=27 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Legal prerogative===\n[[File:Presidentes del Per\u00fa y Bolivia inauguran Encuentro Presidencial y III Gabinete Binacional Per\u00fa-Bolivia (36962597345) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), former [[President of Bolivia]]]]\n\nThe first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in Latin America was [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] Mexican; he was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Evo Morales]] (Aymara people) was the first indigenous candidate elected as [[president of Bolivia]] and the first in South America.

The implication is that there was an early divergence between North American indigenous peoples and those of Central and South America.  Ruled out were hypotheses which posit that invasions subsequent to the Clovis culture overwhelmed or assimilated previous migrants into the Americas.<ref name=\"Rasmussen2014\"/> After study, the remains were returned to Montana for burial by Native Americans.\n\nSimilarly, the skeleton of a teenage girl (named '[[Naia (skeleton)|Naia]]' after a water nymph from Greek mythology) was found in 2007 in the underwater caves called ''[[sistema Sac Actun]]'' in [[Mexico]]'s eastern [[Yucat\u00e1n Peninsula]].

Although the exact pre-colonization population-count of the Americas is unknown, scholars estimate that Indigenous populations diminished by between 80% and 90% within the first centuries of European colonization. The majority of these losses are attributed to the introduction of Afro-Eurasian diseases into the Americas. Epidemics ravaged the Americas with diseases such as [[smallpox]], [[measles]], and [[cholera]], which the early colonists brought from Europe.\n\nThe spread of infectious diseases was slow initially,{{citation needed|date=September 2019}} as most Europeans were not actively or visibly infected, due to inherited immunity from generations of exposure to these diseases in Europe. This changed when the Europeans began the [[human trafficking]] of massive numbers of [[Atlantic slave trade|enslaved Western and Central African people]] to the Americas. Like the Native Americans, these African people, newly exposed to the European diseases, lacked any inherited resistances to the diseases of Europe. In 1520 an African who had been infected with smallpox had arrived in Yucat\u00e1n. By 1558, the disease had spread throughout South America and had arrived at the Plata basin.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Curtin|first=Philip D.|date=1993|title=Disease Exchange Across the Tropical Atlantic|journal=History and Philosophy of the Life Sciences|volume=15|issue=3|pages=329\u2013356|jstor=23331729}}</ref> Colonist violence towards Indigenous peoples accelerated the loss of lives.

Many European diseases, like cow pox, are acquired from domesticated animals that are not indigenous to the Americas. European populations had adapted to these diseases, and built up resistance, over many generations. Many of the European diseases that were brought over to the Americas were diseases, like [[yellow fever]], that were relatively manageable if infected as a child, but were deadly if infected as an adult. Children could often survive the disease, resulting in immunity to the disease for the rest of their life.

An example of such a [[cultural area]] is [[Mesoamerica]], where millennia of coexistence and shared development among the peoples of the region produced a fairly homogeneous culture with complex agricultural and social patterns. Another well-known example is the North American plains where until the 19th century several peoples shared the traits of [[nomad]]ic hunter-gatherers based primarily on buffalo hunting.\n\n=== Languages ===\n{{Main|Indigenous languages of the Americas}}\nThe languages of the North American Indians have been classified into 56 groups or stock tongues, in which the spoken languages of the tribes may be said to centre. In connection with speech, reference may be made to gesture language which was highly developed in parts of this area.\nOf equal interest is the picture writing especially well developed among the [[Ojibwe language|Chippewas]] and [[Lenape|Delawares]].<ref>Hammerton, J.A., Peoples Of All Nations, Volume 7, London: Educational Book Co., Limited, 17, New Bridge Street, E.C</ref>\n\n===Writing systems===\n{{see also|Canadian Aboriginal syllabics|Cherokee syllabary|Quipu}}\n[[File:Palenque glyphs-edit1.jpg|thumb|[[Maya script|Maya glyphs]] in stucco at the ''Museo de sitio'' in [[Palenque]], [[Mexico]]]]\nThe development of [[writing]] is counted among the many achievements and innovations of pre-Columbian American cultures. Independent from the development of writing in other areas of the world, the [[Mesoamerica]]n region produced several [[Mesoamerican writing systems|indigenous writing systems]] beginning in the 1st millennium BCE. What may be the earliest-known example in the Americas of an extensive text thought to be writing is by the [[Cascajal Block]]. The [[Olmec]] hieroglyphs tablet has been indirectly dated from ceramic shards found in the same context to approximately 900 BCE, around the time that Olmec occupation of [[San Lorenzo Tenochtitl\u00e1n]] began to wane.<ref>{{cite web |last=Skidmore|first=Joel|title= The Cascajal Block: The Earliest Precolumbian Writing|url=http://www.mesoweb.com/reports/Cascajal.pdf|year= 2006|pages= 1\u20134|publisher= Mesoweb Reports & News|accessdate=14 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Maya script|Maya writing system]] was a combination of [[phonetic]] [[syllabary|syllabic]] symbols and [[logogram]]s\u2014that is, it was a [[logosyllabic]] writing system.

In total, the script has more than one thousand different [[glyph]]s, although a few are variations of the same sign or meaning, and many appear only rarely or are confined to particular localities. At any one time, no more than about five hundred glyphs were in use, some two hundred of which (including variations) had a phonetic or syllabic interpretation.<ref>{{cite book |author=Coe, Michael D. |authorlink=Michael D.

There are only a few extant inscriptions, making study of this writing system difficult.\n\n[[Aztec codices]] (singular ''[[codex]]'') are books written by pre-Columbian and colonial-era [[Aztec]]s. These codices provide some of the best [[primary sources]] for [[Aztec society|Aztec culture]]. The pre-Columbian codices differ from European codices in that they are largely pictorial; they were not meant to symbolize spoken or written narratives.<ref>Elizabeth Hill Boone, \"Pictorial Documents and Visual Thinking in Postconquest Mexico\". p. 158.</ref> The colonial era codices contain not only [[Aztec writing|Aztec pictograms]], but also [[Classical Nahuatl]] (in the [[Latin alphabet]]), Spanish, and occasionally [[Latin]].\n\nSpanish mendicants in the sixteenth century taught indigenous scribes in their communities to write their languages in Latin letters, and there are a large number of local-level documents in [[Nahuatl]], [[Zapotecan languages|Zapotec]], [[Mixtec]], and Yucatec [[Mayan languages|Maya]] from the colonial era, many of which were part of lawsuits and other legal matters. Although Spaniards initially taught indigenous scribes alphabetic writing, the tradition became self-perpetuating at the local level.<ref>Frances Karttunen, \"Nahuatl Literacy\", in George A. Collier et al, eds. ''The Inca and Aztec States'', New York: Academic Press 1982, pp. 395\u2013417.</ref> The Spanish crown gathered such documentation, and contemporary Spanish translations were made for legal cases. Scholars have translated and analyzed these documents in what is called the [[New Philology]] to write histories of indigenous peoples from indigenous viewpoints.<ref>James Lockhart, ''The Nahuas After the Conquest'', Stanford: Stanford University Press 1992.</ref>\n\nThe [[Wiigwaasabak]], [[birch bark]] scrolls on which the [[Ojibwa]] ([[Anishinaabe]]) people wrote complex geometrical patterns and shapes, can also be considered a form of writing, as can [[Mi'kmaq hieroglyphic writing|Mi'kmaq hieroglyphics]].\n\nAboriginal syllabic writing, or simply '''syllabics''', is a family of [[abugida]]s used to write some Aboriginal Canadian languages of the [[Algonquian languages|Algonquian]], [[Eskimo\u2013Aleut languages|Inuit]], and [[Athabaskan languages|Athabaskan]] language families.\n\n===Music and art===\n{{Main|Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American music}}\n\n[[File:Apache violin, made by Chesley Wilson, 1989 - National Museum of American History - DSC00053.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Apache fiddle]] made by [[Chesley Goseyun Wilson]] ([[San Carlos Apache]])]]\n[[File:JuPi 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Textile art by Julia Pingushat ([[Inuk]], [[Arviat]], Nunavut, Canada), wool, embroidery floss, 1995]]\n[[File:Gorget, Peru, north coast, Chimu style, c. 1350-1450 AD, feathers, reeds, copper bars, silver, metal overlaid with skin - Textile Museum, George Washington University - DSC09898.JPG|thumb|[[Chimu culture]] feather pectoral, feathers, reed, copper, silver, hide, cordage, ca. 1350\u20131450 CE]]\n\n[[Native American music]] can vary between cultures, however there are significant commonalities. Traditional music often centers around [[drum]]ming and singing. [[Rattle (percussion instrument)|Rattle]]s, [[clapper stick]]s, and rasps are also popular percussive instruments, both historically and in contemporary cultures. [[Flute]]s are made of rivercane, cedar, and other woods. The [[Apache]] have a type of [[Apache fiddle|fiddle]], and [[fiddle]]s are also found among a number of [[First Nations]] and [[M\u00e9tis]] cultures.\n\nThe music of the indigenous peoples of Central Mexico and Central America, like that of the North American cultures, tend to be spiritual ceremonies. It traditionally includes a large variety of percussion and [[wind instrument]]s such as drums, flutes, sea shells (used as trumpets) and \"rain\" tubes. No remnants of pre-Columbian stringed instruments were found until archaeologists discovered a jar in Guatemala, attributed to the Maya of the Late Classic Era (600\u2013900 CE); this jar was decorated with imagery depicting a stringed musical instrument which has since been reproduced. This instrument is one of the very few stringed instruments known in the Americas prior to the introduction of European [[musical instrument]]s; when played, it produces a sound that mimics a jaguar's growl.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150420123834/http://mcis2.princeton.edu/jaguar/jaguar.html|date=2004-04-17|archivedate=2015-04-20|accessdate=2016-06-22|title=Music from the Land of the Jaguar|publisher=The Princeton Art Museum}} (Includes sound sample.) {{Dead link|date=May 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[Visual arts by indigenous peoples of the Americas]] comprise a major category in the world [[Collection (museum)|art collection]].

The Pipil lived in western [[El Salvador]], spoke [[Nahuat|Nawat]], and had many settlements there, most noticeably [[Cuzcatlan]]. The Pipil had no precious mineral resources, but they did have rich and [[fertile soil|fertile land]] that was good for farming. The Spaniards were disappointed not to find gold or jewels in [[El Salvador]] as they had in other lands like [[Guatemala]] or [[Mexico]], but upon learning of the fertile land in El Salvador, they attempted to conquer it. Noted Meso-American indigenous warriors to rise militarily against the Spanish included Princes Atonal and Atlacatl of the Pipil people in central El Salvador and Princess Antu Silan Ulap of the Lenca people in eastern El Salvador, who saw the Spanish not as gods but as barbaric invaders. After fierce battles, the Pipil successfully fought off the Spanish army led by [[Pedro de Alvarado]] along with their Mexican Indian allies (the Tlaxcalas), sending them back to Guatemala.

The most advanced native people to have lived within the boundaries of present-day Venezuela is thought to have been the [[Timoto-cuicas]], who lived mainly in the Venezuelan Andes. Historians estimate that there were between 350 thousand and 500 thousand indigenous inhabitants at the time of Spanish colonization. The most densely populated area was the Andean region (Timoto-cuicas), thanks to their advanced agricultural techniques and ability to produce a surplus of food.\n\nThe 1999 [[constitution of Venezuela]] gives the indigenous [[special rights]], although the vast majority of them still live in very critical conditions of poverty. The government provides [[primary education]] in their languages in public schools to some of the largest groups, in efforts to continue the languages.\n\n=== Other parts of the Americas ===\n[[File:Kulusuk, Inuit couple (6822265499).jpg|thumb|[[Tunumiit]] [[Inuit]] couple from [[Kulusuk]], [[Greenland]]]]\nIndigenous peoples make up the majority of the population in [[Bolivia]] and [[Peru]], and are a significant element in most other former Spanish colonies. Exceptions to this include [[Uruguay]] ([[Charrua|Native Charr\u00faa]]). According to the 2011 Census, 2.4% of Uruguayans reported having indigenous ancestry.<ref name=\"enha_asc\"/> Some governments recognize some of the major Native American languages as official languages: [[Quechua language|Quechua]] in Peru and Bolivia; [[Aymara language|Aymara]] also in Peru and [[Bolivia]], [[Guarani language|Guarani]] in [[Paraguay]], and [[Greenlandic language|Greenlandic]] in [[Greenland]].\n\n==Native American name controversy==\n{{Main|Native American name controversy}}\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2019}}\nThe Native American name controversy relates to the dispute over acceptable ways to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas and to broad subsets thereof, such as those living in a specific country or sharing certain cultural attributes. Early settlers often adopted terms that some tribes used for each other, not realizing these were derogatory terms used by enemies. When discussing broader subsets of peoples, naming may be based on shared language, region, or historical relationship. Many English [[exonyms]] have been used to refer to the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Some of these names were based on foreign-language terms used by earlier explorers and colonists, while others resulted from the colonists' attempts to translate or transliterate [[endonyms]] from the native languages. Other terms arose during periods of conflict between the colonizers and indigenous peoples.\n\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have been more vocal about how they want to be addressed, pushing to suppress use of terms widely considered to be obsolete, inaccurate, or [[racism|racist]]. During the latter half of the 20th century and the rise of the [[Indian rights movement]], the [[United States government]] responded by proposing the use of the term \"[[Native American name controversy|Native American]],\" to recognize the primacy of indigenous peoples' tenure in the nation. As may be expected among people of different cultures, not all Native Americans or American Indians agree on its use. No single group naming convention has been accepted by all indigenous peoples. They prefer to be addressed as people of their tribe or nations.\n\n==Rise of indigenous movements==\n{{Indigenous rights}}\nSince the late 20th century, indigenous peoples in the Americas have become more politically active in asserting their treaty rights and expanding their influence. Some have organized in order to achieve some sort of [[self-determination]] and preservation of their cultures. Organizations such as the [[Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin]] and the Indian Council of South America are examples of movements that are overcoming national borders to reunited indigenous populations, for instance those across the [[Amazon Basin]]. Similar movements for indigenous rights can also be seen in Canada and the United States, with movements like the [[International Indian Treaty Council]] and the accession of native Indian group into the [[Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization]].\n\nThere has been a recognition of indigenous movements on an international scale. The membership of the [[United Nations]] voted to adopt the [[Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], despite dissent from some of the stronger countries of the Americas.\n\nIn Colombia, various indigenous groups have protested the denial of their rights. People organized a march in [[Cali]] in October 2008 to demand the government live up to promises to protect indigenous lands, defend the indigenous against violence, and reconsider the [[free trade]] pact with the United States.<ref>[http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html Africa.euters.com] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081027221046/http://africa.reuters.com/world/news/usnTRE49M10G.html |date=27 October 2008 }}</ref>\n\n===Legal prerogative===\n[[File:Presidentes del Per\u00fa y Bolivia inauguran Encuentro Presidencial y III Gabinete Binacional Per\u00fa-Bolivia (36962597345) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Evo Morales]] ([[Aymara people|Aymara]]), former [[President of Bolivia]]]]\n\nThe first indigenous candidate to be democratically elected as head of a country in Latin America was [[Benito Ju\u00e1rez]], a [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] Mexican; he was elected President of Mexico in 1858.<ref>{{cite book|last=Harten|first=Sven|title=The Rise of Evo Morales|year=2011|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=978-1-84813-523-9}}</ref>\n\n[[Evo Morales]] (Aymara people) was the first indigenous candidate elected as [[president of Bolivia]] and the first in South America.

His election encouraged the indigenous movement across Latin America.\n\nRepresentatives from indigenous and rural organizations from major South American countries, including Bolivia, Ecuador, Colombia, Chile and Brazil, started a forum in support of Morales' legal process of change. The meeting condemned plans by the European \"foreign [[power elite]]\" to destabilize the country. The forum also expressed solidarity with Morales and his economic and social changes in the interest of historically marginalized majorities. It questioned US interference through diplomats and NGOs. The forum was suspicious of plots against Bolivia and other countries that elected leftist leaders, including Cuba, Venezuela, Ecuador, Paraguay and [[Nicaragua]].<ref name=\"plenglish\">[http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D)&language=EN Plenglish.com]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409050852/http://www.plenglish.com/article.asp?ID=%7B59DF5FFB-B4C1-4E06-B315-BA3A23C1F081%7D%29&language=EN |date=9 April 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe forum rejected the supposed violent method used by regional civic leaders from the called \"Crescent departments\" in Bolivia to impose autonomous statutes, applauded the decision to expel the US ambassador to Bolivia, and reaffirmed the sovereignty and independence of the presidency.

It is an [[organic material]]{{snd}}a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,<ref>{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.|date=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and [[nutrient]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]], other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.\n\nWood has been used for thousands of years for [[fuel]], as a [[construction material]], for making [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] and [[paper]]. More recently it emerged as a feedstock for the production of purified cellulose and its derivatives, such as [[cellophane]] and [[cellulose acetate#production|cellulose acetate]].\n\nAs of 2005, the growing stock of [[forest]]s worldwide was about 434 billion cubic meters, 47% of which was commercial.<ref>{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/008/A0400E/A0400E06.pdf|title=Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005/Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}</ref> As an abundant, [[carbon-neutral]] renewable resource, woody materials have been of intense interest as a source of renewable energy.

A new layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and [[root]]s, to form a [[growth ring]].]]\n\n===Growth rings===\n{{main|Growth rings}}\n\nWood, in the strict sense, is yielded by [[tree]]s, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as [[secondary growth]]; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].\n\nWhere the differences between the four seasons are distinct, e.g. [[New Zealand]], growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. [[Singapore]]), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.\n\nIf there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.<ref>[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212121121/http://farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html |date=December 12, 2009 }} www.farmforestline.com.au</ref> However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).\nIf a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.\n\n===Knots===\n<!--[[Wood knot]] and [[Knot (wood)]] redirect directly here.-->\n[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|left|A knot on a tree trunk]]\n\nAs a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base, and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular \"solid\" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood \"flows\" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.\n\nIn the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.\n\nIn grading [[lumber]] and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.\n\n[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|upright|Wood knot in vertical section]]\n{{quote|''Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than when under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.''|Samuel J. Record|The Mechanical Properties of Wood<ref name=Record>{{cite book\n |last = Record\n |first = Samuel J\n |title = The Mechanical Properties of Wood\n |publisher = J.

Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.\n\nIn some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution ([[knotting (wood treatment)|knotting]]), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.\n\n===Heartwood and sapwood===<!-- [[Sapwood (wood)]] redirects here -->\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|thumb|right|A section of a [[Taxus|Yew]] branch showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood, dark heartwood, and [[pith]] (center dark spot).

This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed.

Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[hickory]], [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalprope02recogoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/mechanicalprope02recogoog/page/n70 51]|quote=The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree as a tree can thrive with heart completely decayed.|title=The Mechanical Properties of Wood: Including a Discussion of the Factors Affecting the Mechanical Properties, and Methods of Timber Testing|last=Record|first=Samuel James|date=1914|publisher=J.

However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.\n\nIt is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\n\n'''Sapwood''' (or alburnum<ref name=\"eb-alburnum\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum|volume=1|page=516|short=y}}</ref>) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,<ref>Capon, Brian (2005), Botany for Gardeners (2nd ed.), Portland, OR: Timber Publishing, p. 65 {{ISBN|0-88192-655-8}}</ref> and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.\n[[File:Cross-section of an Oak Log Showing Growth Rings.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of an Oak Log Showing Growth Rings]]\n\nNo definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.\n\nWhen a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.\n\nDifferent pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.\n\n===Color===\n[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] is distinctively red.]]\nIn species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.\n\nSome experiments on very resinous [[longleaf pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called \"fat lighter\". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.\n\nSince the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.\n\nAbnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.\n\n===Water content===\nWater occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:\n* in the [[cell wall]]s,\n* in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[cell (biology)|cells]]\n* as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem\n\nIn heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8\u201316% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.\n\nThe general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\n\nDrying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.\n\nThe greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.<ref name=Record>{{cite book\n |last = Record\n |first = Samuel J\n |title = The Mechanical Properties of Wood\n |publisher = J.

These fibers are the elements which give strength and toughness to wood, while the vessels are a source of weakness.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}\n\nIn diffuse-porous woods the pores are evenly sized so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the growth ring instead of being collected in a band or row.

The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.\n\nIf a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pines]] there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\n\nIt is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.\n\nNo satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.\n\n====In ring-porous woods====\n[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''; tangential view, wide growth rings]]\nIn ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.\n\nIn the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.\n\nIn ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.\n\nWide-ringed wood is often called \"second-growth\", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such \"second-growth\" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.<ref name=Record/>\n\nThe results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:\n:\"The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7\u20131.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5\u20130.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3\u20131.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3\u20135 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough.\"<ref name=USforest>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory.

General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.</ref>\n\nThe effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:\n\n:\"When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter.\"<ref name=USforest/>\n\n====In diffuse-porous woods====\nIn the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.\n\nIn diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.\n\n===Monocot wood===\n[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|Trunks of the [[coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]\nStructural material that resembles ordinary, \"dicot\" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.\n\n===Specific gravity===\nThe single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986),<ref name=\"tim\">Timell, T.E. 1986. Compression wood in gymnosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 2150 p.</ref> as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm<sup>3</sup> or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as ''basic specific gravity'' (Timell 1986).<ref name=\"tim\" />\n\n===Wood density===\n\n{{See also|Janka hardness test}}\n\nWood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into \u201cone fairly easily measured wood characteristic\u201d (Elliott 1970).<ref name=\"ell\">Elliott, G.K. 1970. Wood density in conifers. Commonwealth For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Commun. 8. 44 p.</ref>\n\nAge, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, [[silviculture|silvicultural]] treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986).<ref name=\"tim\" /> Variation of specific gravity within the [[trunk (botany)|bole]] of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.\n\n===Tabulated physical properties===\nThe following tables list the mechanical properties of wood and lumber plant species, including bamboo.\n\nWood properties:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.conradfp.com/pdf/ch4-Mechanical-Properties-of-Wood.pdf|title=Wood handbook\u2014Wood as an engineering material.|last=|first=|publisher=Forest Products Laboratory.|year=1999|series=Gen.

soft==\n\nIt is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.\n\nThere is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].\n\n==Chemistry==\n[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of [[lignin]], which comprises about 25% of wood dry matter and is responsible for many of its properties.]]\nThe chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]]) by weight.<ref>{{cite book|title=M\u00e9motech Bois et Mat\u00e9riaux Associ\u00e9s|date=1996|publisher=\u00c9ditions Casteilla|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7135-1645-0|page=22|author= Jean-Pierre Barette|author2= Claude Hazard et J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mayer}}</ref> Wood also contains [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other elements in small quantity.\n\nAside from water, wood has three main components. [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41\u201343%. Next in abundance is [[hemicellulose]], which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. [[Lignin]] is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.\n\nIn chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]]. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]]. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.<ref name=boerjan>{{cite journal| author = W.

Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.\n\n===Construction===\n\n[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.<ref>\"[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&nbsp;\u2013 Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=December 16, 2008 }}\",''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''</ref>]]\n\nWood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).\n\nWood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America. Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&pg=SA7-PA15&dq=%C2%A0Wood+to+be+used+for+construction+work+is+commonly+known+as+lumber+in+North+America#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0Wood%20to%20be%20used%20for%20construction%20work%20is%20commonly%20known%20as%20lumber%20in%20North%20America&f=false|title=Materials for Interior Environments|last=Binggeli|first=Corky|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-42160-4|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[Populus|poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c (\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f) (1714 \u0433.) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]\nNew domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.\n\nIn buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.\n\nWood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mold into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.\n\n====Flooring====\n[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]\n{{Main |Wood flooring}}A solid wood floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a single piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses moisture from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.\n\nSolid hardwood flooring is usually cheaper than engineered timbers and damaged areas can be sanded down and refinished repeatedly, the number of times being limited only by the thickness of wood above the tongue.\n\nSolid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors as well as most traditional wood blocks, [[mosaic]]s and [[parquetry]].\n\n====Engineered products====\n{{main |Engineered wood}}\n\nEngineered wood products, glued building products \"engineered\" for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.<ref name=\"apawood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf|title=APA \u2013 The Engineered Wood Association|work=apawood.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627045932/http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed%2FE30.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThese products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL) products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.<ref name=\"apawood\" /> Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.<ref name=Ullmann/> The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.\n\nWood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic materials]]. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].\n\n===Furniture and utensils===\nWood has always been used extensively for [[furniture]], such as [[chairs]] and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]] and [[pencil]].\n\n===Other===\nFurther developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|title=FPInnovations|work=forintek.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319100903/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nAs scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.<ref>\"System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements\" I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0</ref>\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion MET DP371962.jpg|thumb|''[[Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion]]'', [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]]]\nWood has long been used as an [[media (arts)|artistic medium]]. It has been used to make sculptures and [[wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'').\n\nOther uses of wood in the arts include:\n* [[Woodcut]] [[printmaking]] and [[wood engraving|engraving]]\n* Wood can be a surface to paint on, such as in [[panel painting]]\n* Many [[musical instrument]]s are made mostly or entirely of wood\n\n===Sports and recreational equipment===\nMany types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]]. The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA|parquetry]].\n\nMany other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[titanium]] or [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]]. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] commonly known as the ''[[wood (golf)|woods]]'', the heads of which were traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of [[Wood (golf)#Drivers|drivers]]) carbon-fiber composites.\n\n==Bacterial degradation==\nLittle is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose. [[Symbiotic bacteria]] in ''[[Xylophaga]]'' may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood. ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', ''[[Flavobacteria]]'', ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', ''[[Clostridia]]'', and ''[[Bacteroidetes]]'' have been detected in wood submerged for over a year.<ref>{{cite journal|title=How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life|author1=Christina Bienhold|author2=Petra Pop Ristova|author3=Frank Wenzh\u00f6fer|author4=Thorsten Dittmar|author5=Antje Boetius|journal=PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue=1|pages=e53590|date=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053590|pmid=23301092|pmc=3534711|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853590B}}</ref>\n<!--\nDO ''not'' ADD A \"Popular culture\" SECTION HERE.

It is an [[organic material]]{{snd}}a natural [[composite material|composite]] of [[cellulose]] fibers that are strong in tension and embedded in a [[:wikt:matrix|matrix]] of [[lignin]] that resists compression. Wood is sometimes defined as only the secondary [[xylem]] in the stems of trees,<ref>{{cite book|author=Hickey, M.|author2=King, C.|date=2001|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}</ref> or it is defined more broadly to include the same type of tissue elsewhere such as in the roots of trees or shrubs.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} In a living tree it performs a support function, enabling woody plants to grow large or to stand up by themselves. It also conveys water and [[nutrient]]s between the [[leaf|leaves]], other growing tissues, and the roots. Wood may also refer to other plant materials with comparable properties, and to material engineered from wood, or wood chips or fiber.\n\nWood has been used for thousands of years for [[fuel]], as a [[construction material]], for making [[tool]]s and [[weapon]]s, [[furniture]] and [[paper]].

A new layer of wood is added in each growing season, thickening the stem, existing branches and [[root]]s, to form a [[growth ring]].]]\n\n===Growth rings===\n{{main|Growth rings}}\n\nWood, in the strict sense, is yielded by [[tree]]s, which increase in [[diameter]] by the formation, between the existing wood and the inner [[Bark (botany)|bark]], of new woody layers which envelop the entire stem, living branches, and roots. This process is known as [[secondary growth]]; it is the result of cell division in the [[vascular cambium]], a lateral meristem, and subsequent expansion of the new cells. These cells then go on to form thickened secondary cell walls, composed mainly of [[cellulose]], [[hemicellulose]] and [[lignin]].\n\nWhere the differences between the four seasons are distinct, e.g. [[New Zealand]], growth can occur in a discrete annual or seasonal pattern, leading to [[growth ring]]s; these can usually be most clearly seen on the end of a log, but are also visible on the other surfaces. If the distinctiveness between seasons is annual (as is the case in equatorial regions, e.g. [[Singapore]]), these growth rings are referred to as annual rings. Where there is little seasonal difference growth rings are likely to be indistinct or absent.  If the bark of the tree has been removed in a particular area, the rings will likely be deformed as the plant overgrows the scar.\n\nIf there are differences within a growth ring, then the part of a growth ring nearest the center of the tree, and formed early in the growing season when growth is rapid, is usually composed of wider elements. It is usually lighter in color than that near the outer portion of the ring, and is known as earlywood or springwood. The outer portion formed later in the season is then known as the latewood or summerwood.<ref>[http://www.farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html Wood growth and structure] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091212121121/http://farmforestline.com.au/pages/2.1.2.1_wood.html |date=December 12, 2009 }} www.farmforestline.com.au</ref> However, there are major differences, depending on the kind of wood (see below).\nIf a tree grows all its life in the open and the conditions of [[soil]] and site remain unchanged, it will make its most rapid growth in youth, and gradually decline. The annual rings of growth are for many years quite wide, but later they become narrower and narrower. Since each succeeding ring is laid down on the outside of the wood previously formed, it follows that unless a tree materially increases its production of wood from year to year, the rings must necessarily become thinner as the trunk gets wider. As a tree reaches maturity its crown becomes more open and the annual wood production is lessened, thereby reducing still more the width of the growth rings. In the case of forest-grown trees so much depends upon the competition of the trees in their struggle for light and nourishment that periods of rapid and slow growth may alternate. Some trees, such as southern [[oak]]s, maintain the same width of ring for hundreds of years. Upon the whole, however, as a tree gets larger in diameter the width of the growth rings decreases.\n\n===Knots===\n<!--[[Wood knot]] and [[Knot (wood)]] redirect directly here.-->\n[[File:TreeKnot.jpg|thumb|left|A knot on a tree trunk]]\n\nAs a tree grows, lower branches often die, and their bases may become overgrown and enclosed by subsequent layers of trunk wood, forming a type of imperfection known as a knot. The dead branch may not be attached to the trunk wood except at its base, and can drop out after the tree has been sawn into boards. Knots affect the technical properties of the wood, usually reducing the local strength and increasing the tendency for splitting along the wood grain,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} but may be exploited for visual effect. In a longitudinally sawn plank, a knot will appear as a roughly circular \"solid\" (usually darker) piece of wood around which the [[wood grain|grain]] of the rest of the wood \"flows\" (parts and rejoins). Within a knot, the direction of the wood (grain direction) is up to 90 degrees different from the grain direction of the regular wood.\n\nIn the tree a knot is either the base of a side [[branch]] or a dormant bud. A knot (when the base of a side branch) is conical in shape (hence the roughly circular cross-section) with the inner tip at the point in stem diameter at which the plant's vascular cambium was located when the branch formed as a bud.\n\nIn grading [[lumber]] and structural timber, knots are classified according to their form, size, soundness, and the firmness with which they are held in place. This firmness is affected by, among other factors, the length of time for which the branch was dead while the attaching stem continued to grow.\n\n[[File:Wood Knot.JPG|thumb|upright|Wood knot in vertical section]]\n{{quote|''Knots materially affect cracking and warping, ease in working, and cleavability of timber. They are defects which weaken timber and lower its value for structural purposes where strength is an important consideration. The weakening effect is much more serious when timber is subjected to forces perpendicular to the grain and/or [[tension (physics)|tension]] than when under load along the grain and/or [[physical compression|compression]]. The extent to which knots affect the strength of a [[beam (structure)|beam]] depends upon their position, size, number, and condition. A knot on the upper side is compressed, while one on the lower side is subjected to tension. If there is a season check in the knot, as is often the case, it will offer little resistance to this tensile stress.  Small knots, however, may be located along the neutral plane of a beam and increase the strength by preventing longitudinal [[shear stress|shearing]]. Knots in a board or plank are least injurious when they extend through it at right angles to its broadest surface. Knots which occur near the ends of a beam do not weaken it. Sound knots which occur in the central portion one-fourth the height of the beam from either edge are not serious defects.''|Samuel J. Record|The Mechanical Properties of Wood<ref name=Record>{{cite book\n |last = Record\n |first = Samuel J\n |title = The Mechanical Properties of Wood\n |publisher = J.

Stiffness and elastic strength are more dependent upon the sound wood than upon localized defects. The breaking strength is very susceptible to defects. Sound knots do not weaken wood when subject to compression parallel to the grain.\n\nIn some decorative applications, wood with knots may be desirable to add visual interest. In applications where wood is [[painted]], such as skirting boards, fascia boards, door frames and furniture, resins present in the timber may continue to 'bleed' through to the surface of a knot for months or even years after manufacture and show as a yellow or brownish stain. A knot [[primer (paint)|primer]] paint or solution ([[knotting (wood treatment)|knotting]]), correctly applied during preparation, may do much to reduce this problem but it is difficult to control completely, especially when using mass-produced kiln-dried timber stocks.\n\n===Heartwood and sapwood===<!-- [[Sapwood (wood)]] redirects here -->\n{{More citations needed section|date=August 2016}}\n[[File:Taxus wood.jpg|thumb|right|A section of a [[Taxus|Yew]] branch showing 27 annual growth rings, pale sapwood, dark heartwood, and [[pith]] (center dark spot). The dark radial lines are small knots.]]\n'''Heartwood''' (or duramen<ref name=eb-duramen>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Duramen|volume=8|page=692|short=y}}</ref>) is wood that as a result of a naturally occurring chemical transformation has become more resistant to decay. Heartwood formation is a genetically programmed process that occurs spontaneously. Some uncertainty exists as to whether the wood dies during heartwood formation, as it can still chemically react to decay organisms, but only once.<ref>Shigo, Alex. (1986) ''A New Tree Biology Dictionary''. Shigo and Trees, Associates. {{ISBN|0-943563-12-7}}</ref>\n\nThe term ''heartwood'' derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree. This is evidenced by the fact that a tree can thrive with its heart completely decayed. Some species begin to form heartwood very early in life, so having only a thin layer of live sapwood, while in others the change comes slowly. Thin sapwood is characteristic of such species as [[chestnut]], [[black locust]], [[mulberry]], [[osage-orange]], and [[sassafras]], while in [[maple]], [[ash tree|ash]], [[hickory]], [[Celtis|hackberry]], [[beech]], and pine, thick sapwood is the rule.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/mechanicalprope02recogoog|page=[https://archive.org/details/mechanicalprope02recogoog/page/n70 51]|quote=The term heartwood derives solely from its position and not from any vital importance to the tree as a tree can thrive with heart completely decayed.|title=The Mechanical Properties of Wood: Including a Discussion of the Factors Affecting the Mechanical Properties, and Methods of Timber Testing|last=Record|first=Samuel James|date=1914|publisher=J. Wiley & Sons, Incorporated|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Others never form heartwood.\n\nHeartwood is often visually distinct from the living sapwood, and can be distinguished in a cross-section where the boundary will tend to follow the growth rings. For example, it is sometimes much darker. However, other processes such as decay or insect invasion can also discolor wood, even in woody plants that do not form heartwood, which may lead to confusion.\n\nIt is remarkable that the inner heartwood of old trees remains as sound as it usually does, since in many cases it is hundreds, and in a few instances thousands, of years old. Every broken limb or root, or deep wound from fire, insects, or falling timber, may afford an entrance for decay, which, once started, may penetrate to all parts of the trunk. The larvae of many insects bore into the trees and their tunnels remain indefinitely as sources of weakness. Whatever advantages, however, that sapwood may have in this connection are due solely to its relative age and position.\n\n'''Sapwood''' (or alburnum<ref name=\"eb-alburnum\">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Alburnum|volume=1|page=516|short=y}}</ref>) is the younger, outermost wood; in the growing tree it is living wood,<ref>Capon, Brian (2005), Botany for Gardeners (2nd ed.), Portland, OR: Timber Publishing, p. 65 {{ISBN|0-88192-655-8}}</ref> and its principal functions are to conduct water from the [[root]]s to the [[leaf|leaves]] and to store up and give back according to the season the reserves prepared in the leaves. However, by the time they become competent to conduct water, all xylem tracheids and vessels have lost their cytoplasm and the cells are therefore functionally dead. All wood in a tree is first formed as sapwood. The more leaves a tree bears and the more vigorous its growth, the larger the volume of sapwood required. Hence trees making rapid growth in the open have thicker sapwood for their size than trees of the same species growing in dense forests. Sometimes trees (of species that do form heartwood) grown in the open may become of considerable size, {{convert|30|cm|abbr=on}} or more in diameter, before any heartwood begins to form, for example, in second-growth [[hickory]], or open-grown [[pine]]s.\n[[File:Cross-section of an Oak Log Showing Growth Rings.jpg|thumb|Cross-section of an Oak Log Showing Growth Rings]]\n\nNo definite relation exists between the annual rings of growth and the amount of sapwood. Within the same species the cross-sectional area of the sapwood is very roughly proportional to the size of the crown of the tree. If the rings are narrow, more of them are required than where they are wide. As the tree gets larger, the sapwood must necessarily become thinner or increase materially in volume. Sapwood is relatively thicker in the upper portion of the trunk of a tree than near the base, because the age and the diameter of the upper sections are less.\n\nWhen a tree is very young it is covered with limbs almost, if not entirely, to the ground, but as it grows older some or all of them will eventually die and are either broken off or fall off. Subsequent growth of wood may completely conceal the stubs which will however remain as knots. No matter how smooth and clear a log is on the outside, it is more or less knotty near the middle. Consequently, the sapwood of an old tree, and particularly of a forest-grown tree, will be freer from knots than the inner heartwood. Since in most uses of wood, knots are defects that weaken the timber and interfere with its ease of working and other properties, it follows that a given piece of sapwood, because of its position in the tree, may well be stronger than a piece of heartwood from the same tree.\n\nDifferent pieces of wood cut from a large tree may differ decidedly, particularly if the tree is big and mature. In some trees, the wood laid on late in the life of a tree is softer, lighter, weaker, and more even-textured than that produced earlier, but in other trees, the reverse applies. This may or may not correspond to heartwood and sapwood. In a large log the sapwood, because of the time in the life of the tree when it was grown, may be inferior in [[hardness]], [[strength of materials|strength]], and toughness to equally sound heartwood from the same log. In a smaller tree, the reverse may be true.\n\n===Color===\n[[File:Sequoia wood.jpg|thumb|The wood of [[Sequoia sempervirens|coast redwood]] is distinctively red.]]\nIn species which show a distinct difference between heartwood and sapwood the natural color of heartwood is usually darker than that of the sapwood, and very frequently the contrast is conspicuous (see section of yew log above). This is produced by deposits in the heartwood of chemical substances, so that a dramatic color variation does not imply a significant difference in the mechanical properties of heartwood and sapwood, although there may be a marked biochemical difference between the two.\n\nSome experiments on very resinous [[longleaf pine]] specimens indicate an increase in strength, due to the [[resin]] which increases the strength when dry. Such resin-saturated heartwood is called \"fat lighter\". Structures built of fat lighter are almost impervious to rot and [[termite]]s; however they are very flammable. [[Tree stump|Stumps]] of old longleaf pines are often dug, split into small pieces and sold as kindling for fires. Stumps thus dug may actually remain a century or more since being cut. [[Spruce]] impregnated with crude resin and dried is also greatly increased in strength thereby.\n\nSince the latewood of a growth ring is usually darker in color than the earlywood, this fact may be used in visually judging the density, and therefore the hardness and strength of the material. This is particularly the case with coniferous woods. In ring-porous woods the vessels of the early wood often appear on a finished surface as darker than the denser latewood, though on cross sections of heartwood the reverse is commonly true. Otherwise the color of wood is no indication of strength.\n\nAbnormal discoloration of wood often denotes a diseased condition, indicating unsoundness. The black check in western [[Tsuga|hemlock]] is the result of insect attacks. The reddish-brown streaks so common in hickory and certain other woods are mostly the result of injury by birds. The discoloration is merely an indication of an injury, and in all probability does not of itself affect the properties of the wood. Certain [[wood-decay fungus|rot-producing fungi]] impart to wood characteristic colors which thus become symptomatic of weakness; however an attractive effect known as [[spalting]] produced by this process is often considered a desirable characteristic. Ordinary sap-staining is due to fungal growth, but does not necessarily produce a weakening effect.\n\n===Water content===\nWater occurs in living wood in three locations, namely:\n* in the [[cell wall]]s,\n* in the [[protoplasm]]ic contents of the [[cell (biology)|cells]]\n* as free water in the cell cavities and spaces, especially of the xylem\n\nIn heartwood it occurs only in the first and last forms. Wood that is thoroughly air-dried retains 8\u201316% of the water in the cell walls, and none, or practically none, in the other forms. Even oven-dried wood retains a small percentage of moisture, but for all except chemical purposes, may be considered absolutely dry.\n\nThe general effect of the water content upon the wood substance is to render it softer and more pliable. A similar effect occurs in the softening action of water on rawhide, paper, or cloth. Within certain limits, the greater the water content, the greater its softening effect.\n\nDrying produces a decided increase in the strength of wood, particularly in small specimens. An extreme example is the case of a completely dry [[spruce]] block 5&nbsp;cm in section, which will sustain a permanent load four times as great as a green (undried) block of the same size will.\n\nThe greatest strength increase due to drying is in the ultimate crushing strength, and strength at [[yield (engineering)|elastic limit]] in endwise compression; these are followed by the modulus of rupture, and stress at elastic limit in cross-bending, while the [[elastic modulus|modulus of elasticity]] is least affected.<ref name=Record>{{cite book\n |last = Record\n |first = Samuel J\n |title = The Mechanical Properties of Wood\n |publisher = J.

The latewood will be denser than that formed early in the season. When examined under a microscope, the cells of dense latewood are seen to be very thick-walled and with very small cell cavities, while those formed first in the season have thin walls and large cell cavities. The strength is in the walls, not the cavities. Hence the greater the proportion of latewood, the greater the density and strength. In choosing a piece of pine where strength or stiffness is the important consideration, the principal thing to observe is the comparative amounts of earlywood and latewood. The width of ring is not nearly so important as the proportion and nature of the latewood in the ring.\n\nIf a heavy piece of pine is compared with a lightweight piece it will be seen at once that the heavier one contains a larger proportion of latewood than the other, and is therefore showing more clearly demarcated growth rings. In [[Pinus classification|white pines]] there is not much contrast between the different parts of the ring, and as a result the wood is very uniform in texture and is easy to work. In [[Pinus classification|hard pines]], on the other hand, the latewood is very dense and is deep-colored, presenting a very decided contrast to the soft, straw-colored earlywood.\n\nIt is not only the proportion of latewood, but also its quality, that counts. In specimens that show a very large proportion of latewood it may be noticeably more porous and weigh considerably less than the latewood in pieces that contain less latewood. One can judge comparative density, and therefore to some extent strength, by visual inspection.\n\nNo satisfactory explanation can as yet be given for the exact mechanisms determining the formation of earlywood and latewood. Several factors may be involved. In conifers, at least, rate of growth alone does not determine the proportion of the two portions of the ring, for in some cases the wood of slow growth is very hard and heavy, while in others the opposite is true. The quality of the site where the tree grows undoubtedly affects the character of the wood formed, though it is not possible to formulate a rule governing it. In general, however, it may be said that where strength or ease of working is essential, woods of moderate to slow growth should be chosen.\n\n====In ring-porous woods====\n[[File:Wood Fraxinus excelsior.jpg|thumb|upright|Earlywood and latewood in a ring-porous wood (ash) in a ''[[Fraxinus excelsior]]''; tangential view, wide growth rings]]\nIn ring-porous woods, each season's growth is always well defined, because the large pores formed early in the season abut on the denser tissue of the year before.\n\nIn the case of the ring-porous hardwoods, there seems to exist a pretty definite relation between the rate of growth of timber and its properties. This may be briefly summed up in the general statement that the more rapid the growth or the wider the rings of growth, the heavier, harder, stronger, and stiffer the wood. This, it must be remembered, applies only to ring-porous woods such as oak, ash, hickory, and others of the same group, and is, of course, subject to some exceptions and limitations.\n\nIn ring-porous woods of good growth, it is usually the latewood in which the thick-walled, strength-giving fibers are most abundant. As the breadth of ring diminishes, this latewood is reduced so that very slow growth produces comparatively light, porous wood composed of thin-walled vessels and wood parenchyma. In good oak, these large vessels of the earlywood occupy from 6 to 10 percent of the volume of the log, while in inferior material they may make up 25% or more. The latewood of good oak is dark colored and firm, and consists mostly of thick-walled fibers which form one-half or more of the wood. In inferior oak, this latewood is much reduced both in quantity and quality. Such variation is very largely the result of rate of growth.\n\nWide-ringed wood is often called \"second-growth\", because the growth of the young timber in open stands after the old trees have been removed is more rapid than in trees in a closed forest, and in the manufacture of articles where strength is an important consideration such \"second-growth\" hardwood material is preferred. This is particularly the case in the choice of hickory for handles and [[spoke]]s. Here not only strength, but toughness and resilience are important.<ref name=Record/>\n\nThe results of a series of tests on hickory by the U.S. Forest Service show that:\n:\"The work or shock-resisting ability is greatest in wide-ringed wood that has from 5 to 14 rings per inch (rings 1.8-5 mm thick), is fairly constant from 14 to 38 rings per inch (rings 0.7\u20131.8 mm thick), and decreases rapidly from 38 to 47 rings per inch (rings 0.5\u20130.7 mm thick). The strength at maximum load is not so great with the most rapid-growing wood; it is maximum with from 14 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3\u20131.8 mm thick), and again becomes less as the wood becomes more closely ringed. The natural deduction is that wood of first-class mechanical value shows from 5 to 20 rings per inch (rings 1.3\u20135 mm thick) and that slower growth yields poorer stock. Thus the inspector or buyer of hickory should discriminate against timber that has more than 20 rings per inch (rings less than 1.3 mm thick). Exceptions exist, however, in the case of normal growth upon dry situations, in which the slow-growing material may be strong and tough.\"<ref name=USforest>U.S. Department of Agriculture, Forest Products Laboratory. ''[http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm The Wood Handbook: Wood as an engineering material] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070315214043/http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr113/fplgtr113.htm |date=March 15, 2007 }}''. General Technical Report 113. Madison, WI.</ref>\n\nThe effect of rate of growth on the qualities of chestnut wood is summarized by the same authority as follows:\n\n:\"When the rings are wide, the transition from spring wood to summer wood is gradual, while in the narrow rings the spring wood passes into summer wood abruptly. The width of the spring wood changes but little with the width of the annual ring, so that the narrowing or broadening of the annual ring is always at the expense of the summer wood. The narrow vessels of the summer wood make it richer in wood substance than the spring wood composed of wide vessels. Therefore, rapid-growing specimens with wide rings have more wood substance than slow-growing trees with narrow rings. Since the more the wood substance the greater the weight, and the greater the weight the stronger the wood, chestnuts with wide rings must have stronger wood than chestnuts with narrow rings. This agrees with the accepted view that sprouts (which always have wide rings) yield better and stronger wood than seedling chestnuts, which grow more slowly in diameter.\"<ref name=USforest/>\n\n====In diffuse-porous woods====\nIn the diffuse-porous woods, the demarcation between rings is not always so clear and in some cases is almost (if not entirely) invisible to the unaided eye. Conversely, when there is a clear demarcation there may not be a noticeable difference in structure within the growth ring.\n\nIn diffuse-porous woods, as has been stated, the vessels or pores are even-sized, so that the water conducting capability is scattered throughout the ring instead of collected in the earlywood. The effect of rate of growth is, therefore, not the same as in the ring-porous woods, approaching more nearly the conditions in the conifers. In general it may be stated that such woods of medium growth afford stronger material than when very rapidly or very slowly grown. In many uses of wood, total strength is not the main consideration. If ease of working is prized, wood should be chosen with regard to its uniformity of texture and straightness of grain, which will in most cases occur when there is little contrast between the latewood of one season's growth and the earlywood of the next.\n\n===Monocot wood===\n[[File:Gelugu (coconut wood) in Klaten, Java.jpg|thumb|Trunks of the [[coconut]] palm, a monocot, in Java. From this perspective these look not much different from trunks of a [[dicot]] or [[conifer]]]]\nStructural material that resembles ordinary, \"dicot\" or conifer timber in its gross handling characteristics is produced by a number of [[monocotyledon|monocot]] plants, and these also are colloquially called wood. Of these, [[bamboo]], botanically a member of the grass family, has considerable economic importance, larger culms being widely used as a building and construction material and in the manufacture of engineered flooring, panels and [[Wood veneer|veneer]]. Another major plant group that produces material that often is called wood are the [[Arecaceae|palms]]. Of much less importance are plants such as ''[[Pandanus]],'' ''[[Dracaena (plant)|Dracaena]]'' and ''[[Cordyline]].'' With all this material, the structure and composition of the processed raw material is quite different from ordinary wood.\n\n===Specific gravity===\nThe single most revealing property of wood as an indicator of wood quality is specific gravity (Timell 1986),<ref name=\"tim\">Timell, T.E. 1986. Compression wood in gymnosperms. Springer-Verlag, Berlin. 2150 p.</ref> as both pulp yield and lumber strength are determined by it. Specific gravity is the ratio of the mass of a substance to the mass of an equal volume of water; density is the ratio of a mass of a quantity of a substance to the volume of that quantity and is expressed in mass per unit substance, e.g., grams per milliliter (g/cm<sup>3</sup> or g/ml). The terms are essentially equivalent as long as the metric system is used. Upon drying, wood shrinks and its density increases. Minimum values are associated with green (water-saturated) wood and are referred to as ''basic specific gravity'' (Timell 1986).<ref name=\"tim\" />\n\n===Wood density===\n\n{{See also|Janka hardness test}}\n\nWood density is determined by multiple growth and physiological factors compounded into \u201cone fairly easily measured wood characteristic\u201d (Elliott 1970).<ref name=\"ell\">Elliott, G.K. 1970. Wood density in conifers. Commonwealth For. Bureau, Oxford, U.K., Tech. Commun. 8. 44 p.</ref>\n\nAge, diameter, height, radial (trunk) growth, geographical location, site and growing conditions, [[silviculture|silvicultural]] treatment, and seed source all to some degree influence wood density. Variation is to be expected. Within an individual tree, the variation in wood density is often as great as or even greater than that between different trees (Timell 1986).<ref name=\"tim\" /> Variation of specific gravity within the [[trunk (botany)|bole]] of a tree can occur in either the horizontal or vertical direction.\n\n===Tabulated physical properties===\nThe following tables list the mechanical properties of wood and lumber plant species, including bamboo.\n\nWood properties:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.conradfp.com/pdf/ch4-Mechanical-Properties-of-Wood.pdf|title=Wood handbook\u2014Wood as an engineering material.|last=|first=|publisher=Forest Products Laboratory.|year=1999|series=Gen.

soft==\n\nIt is common to classify wood as either [[softwood]] or [[hardwood]]. The wood from [[Pinophyta|conifers]] (e.g. pine) is called softwood, and the wood from [[dicotyledons]] (usually broad-leaved trees, e.g. oak) is called hardwood. These names are a bit misleading, as hardwoods are not necessarily hard, and softwoods are not necessarily soft. The well-known balsa (a hardwood) is actually softer than any commercial softwood. Conversely, some softwoods (e.g. [[Taxus baccata|yew]]) are harder than many hardwoods.\n\nThere is a strong relationship between the properties of wood and the properties of the particular tree that yielded it. The density of wood varies with species. The density of a wood correlates with its strength (mechanical properties). For example, [[mahogany]] is a medium-dense hardwood that is excellent for fine furniture crafting, whereas [[Ochroma pyramidale|balsa]] is light, making it useful for [[Physical model|model]] building. One of the densest woods is [[Olea laurifolia|black ironwood]].\n\n==Chemistry==\n[[File:Lignin.png|thumb|right|upright=1.35|Chemical structure of [[lignin]], which comprises about 25% of wood dry matter and is responsible for many of its properties.]]\nThe chemical composition of wood varies from species to species, but is approximately 50% carbon, 42% oxygen, 6% hydrogen, 1% nitrogen, and 1% other elements (mainly [[calcium]], [[potassium]], [[sodium]], [[magnesium]], [[iron]], and [[manganese]]) by weight.<ref>{{cite book|title=M\u00e9motech Bois et Mat\u00e9riaux Associ\u00e9s|date=1996|publisher=\u00c9ditions Casteilla|location=Paris|isbn=978-2-7135-1645-0|page=22|author= Jean-Pierre Barette|author2= Claude Hazard et J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mayer}}</ref> Wood also contains [[sulfur]], [[chlorine]], [[silicon]], [[phosphorus]], and other elements in small quantity.\n\nAside from water, wood has three main components. [[Cellulose]], a crystalline polymer derived from glucose, constitutes about 41\u201343%. Next in abundance is [[hemicellulose]], which is around 20% in deciduous trees but near 30% in conifers. It is mainly [[pentose|five-carbon sugars]] that are linked in an irregular manner, in contrast to the cellulose. [[Lignin]] is the third component at around 27% in coniferous wood vs. 23% in deciduous trees. Lignin confers the hydrophobic properties reflecting the fact that it is based on [[aromatic ring]]s. These three components are interwoven, and direct covalent linkages exist between the lignin and the hemicellulose. A major focus of the paper industry is the separation of the lignin from the cellulose, from which paper is made.\n\nIn chemical terms, the difference between hardwood and softwood is reflected in the composition of the constituent [[lignin]]. Hardwood lignin is primarily derived from [[sinapyl alcohol]] and [[coniferyl alcohol]]. Softwood lignin is mainly derived from coniferyl alcohol.<ref name=boerjan>{{cite journal| author = W.

Hardwood is preferred over softwood because it creates less smoke and burns longer. Adding a woodstove or fireplace to a home is often felt to add ambiance and warmth.\n\n===Construction===\n\n[[File:Saitta House Dyker Heights.JPG|thumb|left|upright|The [[Saitta House]], [[Dyker Heights]], [[Brooklyn]], New York built in 1899 is made of and decorated in wood.<ref>\"[http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf Saitta House&nbsp;\u2013 Report Part 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216233832/http://www.dykerheightscivicassociation.com/saittareport.pdf |date=December 16, 2008 }}\",''DykerHeightsCivicAssociation.com''</ref>]]\n\nWood has been an important construction material since humans began building shelters, houses and boats. Nearly all boats were made out of wood until the late 19th century, and wood remains in common use today in boat construction. [[Elm]] in particular was used for this purpose as it resisted decay as long as it was kept wet (it also served for water pipe before the advent of more modern plumbing).\n\nWood to be used for construction work is commonly known as ''[[lumber]]'' in North America. Elsewhere, ''lumber'' usually refers to felled trees, and the word for sawn planks ready for use is ''timber''.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=jSiRAAAAQBAJ&pg=SA7-PA15&dq=%C2%A0Wood+to+be+used+for+construction+work+is+commonly+known+as+lumber+in+North+America#v=onepage&q=%C2%A0Wood%20to%20be%20used%20for%20construction%20work%20is%20commonly%20known%20as%20lumber%20in%20North%20America&f=false|title=Materials for Interior Environments|last=Binggeli|first=Corky|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-1-118-42160-4|language=en|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In Medieval Europe [[oak]] was the wood of choice for all wood construction, including beams, walls, doors, and floors. Today a wider variety of woods is used: solid wood doors are often made from [[Populus|poplar]], small-knotted [[pine]], and [[Douglas fir]].\n\n[[File:\u041f\u0440\u0435\u043e\u0431\u0440\u0430\u0436\u0435\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0430\u044f \u0446\u0435\u0440\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044c (\u0434\u0435\u0440\u0435\u0432\u044f\u043d\u043d\u0430\u044f) (1714 \u0433.) 01.JPG|thumb|right|The churches of [[Kizhi]], Russia are among a handful of [[World Heritage Site]]s built entirely of wood, without metal joints. See [[Kizhi Pogost]] for more details.]]\nNew domestic housing in many parts of the world today is commonly made from timber-framed construction. [[Engineered wood]] products are becoming a bigger part of the construction industry. They may be used in both residential and commercial buildings as structural and aesthetic materials.\n\nIn buildings made of other materials, wood will still be found as a supporting material, especially in roof construction, in interior doors and their frames, and as exterior cladding.\n\nWood is also commonly used as shuttering material to form the mold into which concrete is poured during [[reinforced concrete]] construction.\n\n====Flooring====\n[[File:LightningVolt Wood Floor.jpg|thumb|right|Wood can be cut into straight planks and made into a [[wood flooring]].]]\n{{Main |Wood flooring}}A solid wood floor is a floor laid with planks or battens created from a single piece of timber, usually a hardwood. Since wood is hydroscopic (it acquires and loses moisture from the ambient conditions around it) this potential instability effectively limits the length and width of the boards.\n\nSolid hardwood flooring is usually cheaper than engineered timbers and damaged areas can be sanded down and refinished repeatedly, the number of times being limited only by the thickness of wood above the tongue.\n\nSolid hardwood floors were originally used for structural purposes, being installed perpendicular to the wooden support beams of a building (the joists or bearers) and solid construction timber is still often used for sports floors as well as most traditional wood blocks, [[mosaic]]s and [[parquetry]].\n\n====Engineered products====\n{{main |Engineered wood}}\n\nEngineered wood products, glued building products \"engineered\" for application-specific performance requirements, are often used in construction and industrial applications. Glued engineered wood products are manufactured by bonding together wood strands, veneers, lumber or other forms of wood fiber with glue to form a larger, more efficient composite structural unit.<ref name=\"apawood\">{{cite web|url=http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed/E30.pdf|title=APA \u2013 The Engineered Wood Association|work=apawood.org|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060627045932/http://www.apawood.org/pdfs/download_pdf.cfm?PDFFilename=managed%2FE30.pdf|archivedate=June 27, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThese products include [[glued laminated timber]] (glulam), wood structural panels (including [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and composite panels), [[laminated veneer lumber]] (LVL) and other structural composite lumber (SCL) products, [[parallel strand lumber]], and I-joists.<ref name=\"apawood\" /> Approximately 100 million cubic meters of wood was consumed for this purpose in 1991.<ref name=Ullmann/> The trends suggest that particle board and fiber board will overtake plywood.\n\nWood unsuitable for construction in its native form may be broken down mechanically (into fibers or chips) or chemically (into cellulose) and used as a raw material for other building materials, such as engineered wood, as well as [[particle board|chipboard]], [[hardboard]], and [[medium-density fiberboard]] (MDF). Such wood derivatives are widely used: wood fibers are an important component of most paper, and cellulose is used as a component of some [[Organic compound#Synthetic compounds|synthetic materials]]. Wood derivatives can be used for kinds of flooring, for example [[laminate flooring]].\n\n===Furniture and utensils===\nWood has always been used extensively for [[furniture]], such as [[chairs]] and beds. It is also used for tool handles and cutlery, such as [[chopsticks]], [[toothpick]]s, and other utensils, like the [[wooden spoon]] and [[pencil]].\n\n===Other===\nFurther developments include new [[lignin]] glue applications, recyclable food packaging, rubber tire replacement applications, anti-bacterial medical agents, and high strength fabrics or composites.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|title=FPInnovations|work=forintek.ca|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319100903/http://www.forintek.ca/public/pdf/annual%20report/AR_2007_2008/AR_ENG_2007.pdf|archivedate=March 19, 2009|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\nAs scientists and engineers further learn and develop new techniques to extract various components from wood, or alternatively to modify wood, for example by adding components to wood, new more advanced products will appear on the marketplace. Moisture content electronic monitoring can also enhance next generation wood protection.<ref>\"System for remotely monitoring moisture content on wooden elements\" I Arakistain, O Munne EP Patent EPO1382108.0</ref>\n\n===Art===\n[[File:Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion MET DP371962.jpg|thumb|''[[Prayer Bead with the Adoration of the Magi and the Crucifixion]]'', [[Gothic boxwood miniature]]]]\nWood has long been used as an [[media (arts)|artistic medium]]. It has been used to make sculptures and [[wood carving|carvings]] for millennia. Examples include the [[totem pole]]s carved by North American indigenous people from conifer trunks, often Western Red Cedar (''[[Thuja plicata]]'').\n\nOther uses of wood in the arts include:\n* [[Woodcut]] [[printmaking]] and [[wood engraving|engraving]]\n* Wood can be a surface to paint on, such as in [[panel painting]]\n* Many [[musical instrument]]s are made mostly or entirely of wood\n\n===Sports and recreational equipment===\nMany types of [[sports equipment]] are made of wood, or were constructed of wood in the past. For example, [[cricket bat]]s are typically made of [[Salix alba|white willow]]. The [[baseball bat]]s which are legal for use in [[Major League Baseball]] are frequently made of [[Fraxinus|ash wood]] or [[hickory]], and in recent years have been constructed from [[maple]] even though that wood is somewhat more fragile. NBA courts have been traditionally made out of [[Parquetry#Use in the NBA|parquetry]].\n\nMany other types of sports and recreation equipment, such as [[ski]]s, [[ice hockey stick]]s, [[lacrosse stick]]s and [[bow (weapon)|archery bows]], were commonly made of wood in the past, but have since been replaced with more modern materials such as aluminium, [[titanium]] or [[composite material]]s such as [[fiberglass]] and [[carbon fiber]]. One noteworthy example of this trend is the family of [[Golf club (equipment)|golf clubs]] commonly known as the ''[[wood (golf)|woods]]'', the heads of which were traditionally made of [[Diospyros|persimmon]] wood in the early days of the game of golf, but are now generally made of metal or (especially in the case of [[Wood (golf)#Drivers|drivers]]) carbon-fiber composites.\n\n==Bacterial degradation==\nLittle is known about the bacteria that degrade cellulose. [[Symbiotic bacteria]] in ''[[Xylophaga]]'' may play a role in the degradation of sunken wood. ''[[Alphaproteobacteria]]'', ''[[Flavobacteria]]'', ''[[Actinobacteria]]'', ''[[Clostridia]]'', and ''[[Bacteroidetes]]'' have been detected in wood submerged for over a year.<ref>{{cite journal|title=How Deep-Sea Wood Falls Sustain Chemosynthetic Life|author1=Christina Bienhold|author2=Petra Pop Ristova|author3=Frank Wenzh\u00f6fer|author4=Thorsten Dittmar|author5=Antje Boetius|journal=PLOS ONE|volume = 8|issue=1|pages=e53590|date=January 2, 2013|df=mdy-all|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0053590|pmid=23301092|pmc=3534711|bibcode = 2013PLoSO...853590B}}</ref>\n<!--\nDO ''not'' ADD A \"Popular culture\" SECTION HERE.

These \"candles\" offer [[forester]]s a means to evaluate [[soil fertility|fertility]] of the soil and vigour of the trees.\n\n=== Bark ===\nThe [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of most pines is thick and scaly, but some species have thin, flaky bark. The branches are produced in regular \"pseudo whorls\", actually a very tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point. Many pines are uninodal, producing just one such whorl of branches each year, from [[bud]]s at the tip of the year's new [[plant stem|shoot]], but others are multinodal, producing two or more whorls of branches per year. \n\n=== Foliage ===\nPines have four types of [[leaf]]:\n* Seed leaves ([[cotyledon]]s) on seedlings are borne in a whorl of 4\u201324.\n* Juvenile leaves, which follow immediately on seedlings and young plants, are 2\u20136 cm long, single, green or often blue-green, and arranged spirally on the shoot. These are produced for six months to five years, rarely longer.\n* Scale leaves, similar to bud scales, are small, brown and not photosynthetic, and arranged spirally like the juvenile leaves.\n* Needles, the adult leaves, are green ([[photosynthetic]]) and bundled in clusters called fascicles. The needles can number from one to seven per fascicle, but generally number from two to five. Each fascicle is produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf. These bud scales often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath. The needles persist for 1.5\u201340 years, depending on species. If a shoot is damaged (e.g. eaten by an animal), the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a bud which can then replace the lost leaves.\n\n===Cones===\n[[File:A pine cone.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pine cone]]]]\nPines are mostly [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]], having the male and female [[Conifer cone|cones]] on the same tree, though a few species are [[Plant reproductive morphology#Terminology|sub-dioecious]], with individuals predominantly, but not wholly, single-sex. The male cones are small, typically 1\u20135 cm long, and only present for a short period (usually in spring, though autumn in a few pines), falling as soon as they have shed their [[pollen]]. The female cones take 1.5\u20133 years (depending on species) to mature after [[pollination]], with actual fertilization delayed one year. At maturity the female cones are 3\u201360 cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds. \n\nThe seeds are mostly small and winged, and are [[Anemophily|anemophilous]] (wind-dispersed), but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing, and are [[bird]]-dispersed (see below). Female cones are woody and sometimes armed to protect developing seeds from foragers. At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds. In some of the bird-dispersed species, for example [[whitebark pine]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomback|first=Diana F. | name-list-format = vanc |date= June 1982 |title=Dispersal of Whitebark Pine seeds by Clark's Nutcracker: a mutualism hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=451\u2013467|doi=10.2307/3976|jstor=3976}}</ref>), the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. This is called [[serotiny]]. The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence, in which a resin binds the cones shut until melted by a forest fire, for example in ''[[Pinus rigida]]''.\n\n==Evolutionary history==\nConifers evolved about 300 million years ago, and pines perhaps around 153 million years ago. The genus ''Pinus'' is thought to have diverged from other pines approximately 95 million years ago. \n\n''Pinus'' is the largest genus of the [[Pinaceae]], the pine family, which is the oldest and largest conifer family. It dates back to 206 million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Ran JH, Shen TT, Wu H, Gong X, Wang XQ | title = Phylogeny and evolutionary history of Pinaceae updated by transcriptomic analysis | journal = Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution | volume = 129 | pages = 106\u2013116 | date = December 2018 | pmid = 30153503 | doi = 10.1016/j.ympev.2018.08.011 }}</ref> Based on recent [[Transcriptome|transriptome]] analysis, ''Pinus'' is most closely related to the genus ''[[Cathaya]]'', which in turn is closely related to [[Spruce|spruces]].

Pines are prone to inter-specific breeding. Wind pollination, long life spans, overlapping generations, large population size, and weak [[reproductive isolation]] make breeding across species more likely.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Hern\u00e1ndez-Le\u00f3n S, Gernandt DS, P\u00e9rez de la Rosa JA, Jard\u00f3n-Barbolla L | title = Phylogenetic relationships and species delimitation in pinus section trifoliae inferrred from plastid DNA | journal = PLOS One | volume = 8 | issue = 7 | pages = e70501 | date = 2013-07-30 | pmid = 23936218 | pmc = 3728320 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0070501 | bibcode = 2013PLoSO...870501H }}</ref> As the pines have diversified, gene transfer between different species has created a complex history of genetic relatedness.\n\n==Taxonomy, nomenclature and codification==\n{{Main|List of Pinus species|l1=List of ''Pinus'' species}}\n\nPines are [[gymnosperm]]s.

A few are able to sprout after forest fires (e.g. [[Canary Island pine]]). Some species of pines (e.g. [[bishop pine]]) need fire to regenerate, and their populations slowly decline under fire suppression regimens. \n\nSeveral species are adapted to extreme conditions imposed by elevation and latitude (e.g. Siberian dwarf pine, [[mountain pine]], whitebark pine, and the [[bristlecone pine]]s). The pinyon pines and a number of others, notably [[Turkish pine]] and [[gray pine]], are particularly well adapted to growth in hot, dry [[desert|semidesert]] climates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2011}}\n\nThe seeds are commonly eaten by birds, such as grouse, crossbills, jays, nuthatches, siskins, and woodpeckers, and by [[squirrel]]s. Some birds, notably the [[spotted nutcracker]], [[Clark's nutcracker]], and [[pinyon jay]], are of importance in distributing pine seeds to new areas.

Commercial pines are grown in [[plantation]]s for timber that is denser and therefore more durable than [[spruce]] (''Picea'').  Pine wood is widely used in high-value carpentry items such as furniture, window frames, panelling, floors, and roofing, and the [[resin]] of some species is an important source of [[turpentine]].\n\nBecause pines have no insect- or decay-resistant qualities after logging, untreated they are generally recommended for construction purposes as indoor use only (indoor [[drywall]] framing, for example).

Imperfect trees (such as those with bent trunks or forks, smaller trees, or diseased trees) are removed in a \"thinning\" operation every 5\u201310 years. Thinning allows the best trees to grow much faster, because it prevents weaker trees from competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients. Young trees removed during thinning are used for pulpwood, while most older ones are good enough for saw timber.\n\nThe final wood quality can be improved by pruning small branches at ages 5, 7, and 9. Pruning usually goes up to a height of {{convert|6|m|ft}}. This results in smooth timber with no knots, which is considerably more valuable.\n<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.forestrycorporation.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/238473/pine-plantation-rotation.pdf \n |title=The Pine Plantation Rotation \n |publisher=Forests NSW \n |access-date= 1 April 2016 \n |url-status=live \n |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308115907/http://www.forestrycorporation.com.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0009/238473/pine-plantation-rotation.pdf \n |archive-date=2016-03-08 \n}}</ref>\n\nA 30-year-old commercial pine tree grown in good conditions will be about {{convert|0.3|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in diameter and about {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} high.

These \"candles\" offer [[forester]]s a means to evaluate [[soil fertility|fertility]] of the soil and vigour of the trees.\n\n=== Bark ===\nThe [[Bark (botany)|bark]] of most pines is thick and scaly, but some species have thin, flaky bark. The branches are produced in regular \"pseudo whorls\", actually a very tight spiral but appearing like a ring of branches arising from the same point. Many pines are uninodal, producing just one such whorl of branches each year, from [[bud]]s at the tip of the year's new [[plant stem|shoot]], but others are multinodal, producing two or more whorls of branches per year. \n\n=== Foliage ===\nPines have four types of [[leaf]]:\n* Seed leaves ([[cotyledon]]s) on seedlings are borne in a whorl of 4\u201324.\n* Juvenile leaves, which follow immediately on seedlings and young plants, are 2\u20136 cm long, single, green or often blue-green, and arranged spirally on the shoot. These are produced for six months to five years, rarely longer.\n* Scale leaves, similar to bud scales, are small, brown and not photosynthetic, and arranged spirally like the juvenile leaves.\n* Needles, the adult leaves, are green ([[photosynthetic]]) and bundled in clusters called fascicles. The needles can number from one to seven per fascicle, but generally number from two to five. Each fascicle is produced from a small bud on a dwarf shoot in the axil of a scale leaf. These bud scales often remain on the fascicle as a basal sheath. The needles persist for 1.5\u201340 years, depending on species. If a shoot is damaged (e.g. eaten by an animal), the needle fascicles just below the damage will generate a bud which can then replace the lost leaves.\n\n===Cones===\n[[File:A pine cone.jpg|thumb|240px|[[Pine cone]]]]\nPines are mostly [[Plant sexuality|monoecious]], having the male and female [[Conifer cone|cones]] on the same tree, though a few species are [[Plant reproductive morphology#Terminology|sub-dioecious]], with individuals predominantly, but not wholly, single-sex. The male cones are small, typically 1\u20135 cm long, and only present for a short period (usually in spring, though autumn in a few pines), falling as soon as they have shed their [[pollen]]. The female cones take 1.5\u20133 years (depending on species) to mature after [[pollination]], with actual fertilization delayed one year. At maturity the female cones are 3\u201360 cm long. Each cone has numerous spirally arranged scales, with two seeds on each fertile scale; the scales at the base and tip of the cone are small and sterile, without seeds. \n\nThe seeds are mostly small and winged, and are [[Anemophily|anemophilous]] (wind-dispersed), but some are larger and have only a vestigial wing, and are [[bird]]-dispersed (see below). Female cones are woody and sometimes armed to protect developing seeds from foragers. At maturity, the cones usually open to release the seeds. In some of the bird-dispersed species, for example [[whitebark pine]],<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tomback|first=Diana F. | name-list-format = vanc |date= June 1982 |title=Dispersal of Whitebark Pine seeds by Clark's Nutcracker: a mutualism hypothesis|journal=The Journal of Animal Ecology|volume=51|issue=2|pages=451\u2013467|doi=10.2307/3976|jstor=3976}}</ref>), the seeds are only released by the bird breaking the cones open. In others, the seeds are stored in closed cones for many years until an environmental cue triggers the cones to open, releasing the seeds. This is called [[serotiny]]. The most common form of serotiny is pyriscence, in which a resin binds the cones shut until melted by a forest fire, for example in ''[[Pinus rigida]]''.\n\n==Evolutionary history==\nConifers evolved about 300 million years ago, and pines perhaps around 153 million years ago. The genus ''Pinus'' is thought to have diverged from other pines approximately 95 million years ago. \n\n''Pinus'' is the largest genus of the [[Pinaceae]], the pine family, which is the oldest and largest conifer family.

Imperfect trees (such as those with bent trunks or forks, smaller trees, or diseased trees) are removed in a \"thinning\" operation every 5\u201310 years. Thinning allows the best trees to grow much faster, because it prevents weaker trees from competing for sunlight, water, and nutrients.

Some of the main symbolic attributes of pines in Chinese art and literature are longevity and steadfastness: the pine retains its green needles through all the seasons. Sometimes the pine and cypress are paired. At other times the pine, plum, and bamboo are considered as the \"[[Three Friends of Winter]]\".<ref>[[Wolfram Eberhard|Eberhard, Wolfram]] (2003 [1986 (German version 1983)]), ''A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols: Hidden Symbols in Chinese Life and Thought''.
