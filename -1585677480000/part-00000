It is an act or reaction, such as an expression of [[feeling]]s (including close [[friendship]], [[platonic love]], [[romance (love)|romantic love]] or [[sexual attraction]]), between people. Examples of physical intimacy include being inside someone's [[Proxemics|personal space]], [[holding hands]], [[hug]]ging, [[kiss]]ing, caressing and [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]].<ref>Cf.

Physical intimacy can be exchanged between any people but as it is often used to communicate positive and intimate feelings, it most often occurs in people who have a preexisting [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]], whether familial platonic or romantic, with romantic relationships having increased physical intimacy. Several forms of romantic touch have been noted including holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, caressing and massaging, and physical affection is highly correlated with overall relationship and partner satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9guen|first=Nicolas|last2=Fischer-Lokou|first2=Jacques|date=February 2003|title=Another Evaluation of Touch and Helping Behavior|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=92|issue=1|pages=62\u201364|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.62|pmid=12674258|issn=0033-2941}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to be physically intimate with someone without actually touching them; however, a certain [[Proxemics|proximity]] is necessary. For instance, a sustained [[eye contact]] is considered a form of physical intimacy, analogous to touching. When a person enters someone else's personal space for the purpose of being intimate, it is physical intimacy, regardless of the lack of actual physical contact.\n\nMost people partake in physical intimacy, which is a natural part of interpersonal relationships and [[human sexuality]], and research has shown it has health benefits. A hug or touch can result in the release of [[oxytocin]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], and in a reduction in stress [[hormone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-28-touch-healing_N.htm |title=Human touch may have some healing properties |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}</ref>\n\nDue to the important role that language-based communication plays in humans, the role of touch is often downplayed, however there is ample evidence that physical touch still plays an important role in everyday human relationships. While humans often communicate verbally, they also participate in close contact. Physical touch has emotional and social connotations that often far outweigh anything that can be expressed via language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|date=1991|title=Relational message interpretations of touch, conversational distance, and posture|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=15|issue=4|pages=233\u2013259|doi=10.1007/bf00986924|issn=0191-5886}}</ref>\n\nInducements towards physical intimacy can come from various sources. During colder seasons, humans as well as other animals seek physical intimacy with one another as a means to apportion thermoregulation.<ref>Stabentheiner, Anton, et al. \"Endothermic heat production in honeybee winter clusters.\" Journal of Experimental Biology 206.2 (2003): 353-358.</ref> Some forms of physical touch among monkeys and apes, serve multiple functions, including cleaning, treatment of a lice influx or infection and social grooming.<ref>Diezinger, F.

This attitude is especially marked amongst those with [[haphephobia]].<ref>Synnott, Anthony. \"Bodily senses.\" The International Encyclopedia of Human Sexuality (2015).</ref> One study has shown that there's generally a higher level of physical intimacy allowed between [[immediate family]] members than between [[second-degree relative]]s.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spring.org.uk/2015/10/the-body-map-of-acceptable-social-touching.php|title=The Body Map of Acceptable Social Touching - PsyBlog|date=28 October 2015|website=Spring.org.uk|accessdate=18 September 2017}}</ref> Intimacy norms are usually more negative near [[erogenous zone]]s.

The skin is the largest sensory organ and is the first to develop. Humans experience touch as early as fetal development, when the fetus begins receiving sensory information from coming in contact with the mothers\u2019 abdominal wall. In infancy, babies receive significant amounts of touch through being held, cuddled, and breastfed. In addition to necessary functions like breastfeeding, touch is also used to sooth and calm babies or with skin-to-skin contact called \"kangaroo care.\"<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Ferber|first=Sari Goldstein|last2=Feldman|first2=Ruth|last3=Makhoul|first3=Imad R.|date=June 2008|title=The development of maternal touch across the first year of life|journal=Early Human Development|volume=84|issue=6|pages=363\u2013370|doi=10.1016/j.earlhumdev.2007.09.019|pmid=17988808|issn=0378-3782}}</ref> Vision and auditory senses are limited in infancy and babies are introduced to their world primarily through touch and are able to distinguish between temperature and texture.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|last2=Hernandez-Reif|first2=Maria|last3=Diego|first3=Miguel|date=2010-05-04|title=Depressed mothers' newborns are less responsive to animate and inanimate stimuli|journal=Infant and Child Development|volume=20|issue=1|pages=94\u2013105|doi=10.1002/icd.687|issn=1522-7227}}</ref>\n\nDecreased amounts of affectionate touch from caregivers (i.e. for infants in institutional settings or infants with depressed mothers) is related to cognitive and neurodevelopmental delays.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=MACLEAN|first=KIM|date=2003-11-14|title=The impact of institutionalization on child development|journal=Development and Psychopathology|volume=15|issue=4|pages=853\u2013884|doi=10.1017/s0954579403000415|issn=0954-5794}}</ref> These delays appear to persist for years and sometimes whole lifetimes.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Beckett|first=Celia|last2=Maughan|first2=Barbara|last3=Rutter|first3=Michael|last4=Castle|first4=Jenny|last5=Colvert|first5=Emma|last6=Groothues|first6=Christine|last7=Kreppner|first7=Jana|last8=Stevens|first8=Suzanne|last9=O'Connor|first9=Thomas G.|date=May 2006|title=Do the Effects of Early Severe Deprivation on Cognition Persist Into Early Adolescence?

However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it is at times difficult to maintain personal space, for example, in a crowded [[train]], [[elevator]] or street. Many people find the physical proximity within crowded spaces to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable.<ref name=Hall /> In an impersonal crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important. Non-consensual intimate and sexual contact, such as [[frotteurism]] and [[groping]], are unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, most people occasionally desire physical proximity to others, and will at times welcome a familiar and trusted person into their personal space. When a partner or friend is not available at such a time, some people satisfy this need for human contact in a crowded venue, such as a [[bar]], [[nightclub]], [[rock concert]], [[festival|street festival]], etc.\n\n==Display of affection==\nPeople who are on a [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiar basis]] may enter into each other's personal space to make physical contact. These can be indicators of affection and trust. The manner in which people display affection is generally different in a public context to a private one. In private, people in an [[intimate relationship]] or who are familiar with each other may be at ease with physical contact and displays of affection, which may involve:\n* cuddling,\n* caressing (e.g. head, hands, arms, back and waist),\n* [[tickling]] (e.g. back and waist),\n* [[massage]] (e.g. neck, shoulders, back, thighs), or\n* [[touching heads]].\n\nBonding through intimate, non-sexual contact between platonic friends and family members includes, but is not limited to, holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and kissing on the cheeks.\n\nIn public, however, and depending on the nature of the relationship between the people, a [[public display of affection]] is generally constrained by [[social norm]]s and can range from a gesture, such as a [[kiss]] or [[hug]] in greeting, to an embrace or [[holding hands]]. Maintaining [[eye contact]] can be regarded socially and psychologically as analogous to touching.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe role of touch in interpersonal relationships across development and in different cultures is understudied, however, some observational data suggests that in cultures who engage in more physical intimacy have lower rates of violence, demonstrated in adolescents and children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|date=January 1999|title=Preschoolers in America are Touched Less and are More Aggressive Than Preschoolers in France|journal=Early Child Development and Care|volume=151|issue=1|pages=11\u201317|doi=10.1080/0300443991510102|issn=0300-4430}}</ref> Peoples living nearer to the equator tend to have high-contact social norms (Mediterranean, central and south America, Islamic countries, whereas countries further from the equator tend to be lower contact (northern Europe, north America, northeast Asian).

Physical intimacy can be exchanged between any people but as it is often used to communicate positive and intimate feelings, it most often occurs in people who have a preexisting [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]], whether familial platonic or romantic, with romantic relationships having increased physical intimacy. Several forms of romantic touch have been noted including holding hands, hugging, kissing, cuddling, caressing and massaging, and physical affection is highly correlated with overall relationship and partner satisfaction.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gu\u00e9guen|first=Nicolas|last2=Fischer-Lokou|first2=Jacques|date=February 2003|title=Another Evaluation of Touch and Helping Behavior|journal=Psychological Reports|volume=92|issue=1|pages=62\u201364|doi=10.2466/pr0.2003.92.1.62|pmid=12674258|issn=0033-2941}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible to be physically intimate with someone without actually touching them; however, a certain [[Proxemics|proximity]] is necessary. For instance, a sustained [[eye contact]] is considered a form of physical intimacy, analogous to touching. When a person enters someone else's personal space for the purpose of being intimate, it is physical intimacy, regardless of the lack of actual physical contact.\n\nMost people partake in physical intimacy, which is a natural part of interpersonal relationships and [[human sexuality]], and research has shown it has health benefits. A hug or touch can result in the release of [[oxytocin]], [[dopamine]] and [[serotonin]], and in a reduction in stress [[hormone]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/health/2008-09-28-touch-healing_N.htm |title=Human touch may have some healing properties |publisher=USA Today |date=2008-09-28 |accessdate=2011-01-03}}</ref>\n\nDue to the important role that language-based communication plays in humans, the role of touch is often downplayed, however there is ample evidence that physical touch still plays an important role in everyday human relationships. While humans often communicate verbally, they also participate in close contact. Physical touch has emotional and social connotations that often far outweigh anything that can be expressed via language.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Burgoon|first=Judee K.|date=1991|title=Relational message interpretations of touch, conversational distance, and posture|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=15|issue=4|pages=233\u2013259|doi=10.1007/bf00986924|issn=0191-5886}}</ref>\n\nInducements towards physical intimacy can come from various sources.

The skin is the largest sensory organ and is the first to develop. Humans experience touch as early as fetal development, when the fetus begins receiving sensory information from coming in contact with the mothers\u2019 abdominal wall. In infancy, babies receive significant amounts of touch through being held, cuddled, and breastfed.

However, in modern society, especially in crowded urban communities, it is at times difficult to maintain personal space, for example, in a crowded [[train]], [[elevator]] or street. Many people find the physical proximity within crowded spaces to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable,.<ref name=Hall /> In an impersonal crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important. Non-consensual intimate and sexual contact, such as [[frotteurism]] and [[groping]], are unacceptable.\n\nOn the other hand, most people occasionally desire physical proximity to others, and will at times welcome a familiar and trusted person into their personal space. When a partner or friend is not available at such a time, some people satisfy this need for human contact in a crowded venue, such as a [[bar]], [[nightclub]], [[rock concert]], [[festival|street festival]], etc.\n\n==Display of affection==\nPeople who are on a [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiar basis]] may enter into each other's personal space to make physical contact. These can be indicators of affection and trust. The manner in which people display affection is generally different in a public context to a private one. In private, people in an [[intimate relationship]] or who are familiar with each other may be at ease with physical contact and displays of affection, which may involve:\n* cuddling,\n* caressing (e.g. head, hands, arms, back and waist),\n* [[tickling]] (e.g. back and waist),\n* [[massage]] (e.g. neck, shoulders, back, thighs), or\n* [[touching heads]].\n\nBonding through intimate, non-sexual contact between platonic friends and family members includes, but is not limited to, holding hands, hugging, cuddling, and kissing on the cheeks.\n\nIn public, however, and depending on the nature of the relationship between the people, a [[public display of affection]] is generally constrained by [[social norm]]s and can range from a gesture, such as a [[kiss]] or [[hug]] in greeting, to an embrace or [[holding hands]]. Maintaining [[eye contact]] can be regarded socially and psychologically as analogous to touching.\n\n== Culture ==\nThe role of touch in interpersonal relationships across development and in different cultures is understudied, however, some observational data suggests that in cultures who engage in more physical intimacy have lower rates of violence, demonstrated in adolescents and children.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Field|first=Tiffany|date=January 1999|title=Preschoolers in America are Touched Less and are More Aggressive Than Preschoolers in France|journal=Early Child Development and Care|volume=151|issue=1|pages=11\u201317|doi=10.1080/0300443991510102|issn=0300-4430}}</ref> Peoples living nearer to the equator tend to have high-contact social norms (Mediterranean, central and south America, Islamic countries, whereas countries further from the equator tend to be lower contact (northern Europe, north America, northeast Asian).
