At the turn of the 20th century, Burmese literature made a remarkable departure from its traditional classicism.\n\n[[File:\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c.jpg|thumb|right|  \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c ]]\n\nIn 1904, James Hla Kyaw adapted part of the story [[The Count of Monte Cristo]], by the French writer [[Alexandre Dumas]], into Burmese under the title Maung Yin Maung Ma Me Ma, the first modern Burmese novel. It was an epoch-making work in the history of Burmese literature. This innovation led others to realize that exposure to world literature, particularly those of the West, would greatly assist efforts to modernize Burmese literary writing.\n\nIn 1920, the [[University of Rangoon]] was founded and some persons connected with it\u2014 most notably J S Furnivall, founder of the Burma Education Extension Association\u2014 were determined to make foreign literature available to [[Burmese]].\n\nMany new adaptations of foreign works into Burmese followed. The writers of the new movement, who were called the \u201cUniversity Wits,\u201d also did original works, including short stories and poems. There were three luminaries in this movement, which we now call Khitsan (\u201cNew Writing\u201d). Theitpan Maung Wa was famous for his lucid prose style, while Zawgyi and Min Thu Wun were highly respected for their keen powers of observation, revealed in poems about the everyday life of people and the minute details of nature.\n\nThe styles and outlooks of [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[John Keats]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] of India\u2014broadly speaking, the major exponents of Romanticism\u2014were the major influences on the Khitsan writers. Later on, many critics pointed out that while the Khitsan movement had made great strides in the development of artistic technique, they had failed to meet the contemporary political needs of the whole nation\u2014particularly, the growing demand for independence from British colonial rule.\n\nThe most influential literary figure throughout the colonial period was Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, a highly respected journalist, playwright, poet, and historian. His literary works succeeded in arousing patriotism, love, and compassion, mainly dealing with the past history of [[Burma]] as well as the contemporary political movement for independence. Commentators agree that Kodaw Hmaing, alone amongst his contemporaries, was completely successful in meeting the esthetic and political requirements of his age, even though he continued to write in a traditional style of poetic composition.\n\nMany of the young writers who emerged in the years following the [[Second World War]] were deeply affected by their experiences during the struggles against [[imperialism]] and [[fascism]], as well as by their exposure to the prevailing left-wing political ideologies of the post-war period. Dagon Taya, a tremendously creative writer who continues to compose beautiful poems, short stories, novels, and commentaries even now, became the recognized leader of the post-war progressive writers with his magazine Taya, which strove to promote literary realism and \u201cart for people\u2019s sake\u201d under the banner of Sar Pe Thit (\u201cNew Literature\u201d).\n\nHe was, in fact, the direct heir of Kodaw Hmaing\u2019s politically oriented brand of literature, bringing to it a more sophisticated outlook and manner of presentation. Some observers have described the work of Dagon Taya as the product of a fusion of Kodaw Hmaing\u2019s style with that of the earlier, pre-independence Khitsan writers. Min Thu Wun, the hero of Khitsan, dubbed Dagon Taya\u2019s New Literature Movement \u201cthe Khitsan of the Khitsan.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Dagon Taya and his fellow writers made a breakaway from Khitsan not only in terms of theme but also in sensibility and style, though many of them continued to use the rhyme schemes of their Khitsan predecessors when composing poems. The influence of Dagon Taya\u2019s literary movement has, amazingly, continued to the present day. But he has not been without his critics, particularly amongst rival literary schools (including other advocates of \u201cPeople\u2019s literature\u201d), which have accused him of writing in an overly stylized and unrealistic, even abstract, manner.\n\nThe influence of Dagon Taya\u2019s literary movement has, amazingly, continued to the present day. But he has not been without his critics, particularly amongst rival literary schools (including other advocates of \u201cPeople\u2019s literature\u201d), which have accused him of writing in an overly stylized and unrealistic, even abstract, manner.\n\nNot just a leading literary figure but also a famous peace activist who has made a significant contribution to both internal and international peace efforts, Dagon Taya has also been subjected to political persecution. After the military staged a coup in 1962, he was arrested and imprisoned for four years on suspicion of being a communist.\n\nPersonally, [[Dagon Taya]] is known to be calm, reserved and flexible, but also firm in his convictions. He was a close friend of Burma\u2019s independence hero, [[Aung San]], who in 1943 offered him a high-ranking position in the Japanese occupation government\u2014an offer that Dagon Taya refused. Before [[Aung San]]\u2019s assassination in 1947, Dagon Taya wrote a very beautiful but highly critical essay about [[Aung San]]\u2019s personality, titled \u201cAung San the Untamed\u201d\n\nMany Burmese were shocked by this apparent criticism of their revered father of independence, but Dagon Taya, and [[Aung San]] himself, merely smiled in response to the storm of controversy that this essay generated when it first appeared in Taya magazine. Even more daring was Dagon Taya\u2019s rejection of an honor bestowed upon veterans of the independence movement by General [[Ne Win]]\u2019s socialist regime.\n\nThe State Honorary Award, which carried a grant and a monthly stipend, was generally regarded as a bribe to win the loyalty of famous patriots. After his refusal to accept the award, Dagon Taya went into self-imposed exile from the capital and composed one of his best-known poems, \u201cSending myself to the Mae Za.\u201d\n\n\"He then came to be seen as the Boris [[Pasternak]] of [[Burma]] in the eyes of the authorities,\u201d recounts a young poet and close associate of Dagon Taya now living in exile. \u201cMae Za, in the Burmese political context, means the place where opponents of the king used to be sent as exiles, something like the gulags of [[Soviet Russia]].\u201d\n\nDespite his strong leftist sympathies, Dagon Taya felt no need to conform to preconceived notions of socialist orthodoxy, either intellectually or in his lifestyle. He eschewed any sycophancy towards self-declared \u201cliberators\u201d of the masses, and throughout his life, kept his distance from political parties. A lifelong bachelor with long, wavy hair and custom of wearing iridescent silk longyis and colorful Indonesian batik shirts, this \u201cfriend of the common man\u201d also loved to express his free-spirited nature through painting and by playing the piano in a completely improvised, unrestrained manner.\n\nIn the 1970s, a new generation of poets, strongly influenced by their reading of contemporary Western literature and by their fervid, anti-imperialist response to the [[Vietnam War]], broke with tradition and began composing poems in free verse. Although not explicitly anti-government in nature, the artistic liberties were taken in these poems, as well as the themes of social injustice that frequently ran through them, provoked harsh criticism from conservatives close to Ne Win\u2019s regime. Accused of trying to destroy classical literature or of being communist agents, these young poets found their greatest defender in Dagon Taya, who reiterated his position that, while it was good to have knowledge of the classics, it wasn\u2019t strictly necessary as long as the poet\u2019s work served the interests of the people.\n\nIn 1988, when demands for political reform in [[Burma]] came to a head, many writers both young and old became actively involved in the pro-democracy movement. Since then, to avoid censorship, many have used a variety of highly abstract styles and techniques, including surrealism, magic realism, and stream-of-consciousness, to express their dissatisfaction with the status quo and their hopes for a more democratic society.\n\nMeanwhile, Dagon Taya, who continues to write prolifically even as his eyesight fades in his old age, addressed the changes in the global political climate in a poem titled \u201cThe Thaw,\u201d written after the fall of [[Berlin Wall]], and in an article on the collapse of both individuals and entire nations as a result of political dogmatism and artistic rigidity. While the retreat from realism in Burmese literature has been understandable considering the circumstances, an unfortunate side effect of this development has been a growing tendency for young writers to divorce themselves from reality altogether.\n\nModernist and postmodernist literary theories have found many adherents in [[Burma]] since the early 1990s, resulting in a number of original works that are both aesthetically and politically significant. But, for the most part, they seem to have created an almost totally detached attitude towards the issues of society at large. \u201cTo an extent, [the introduction of new theories] needs to be welcomed. But when it becomes excessive, the young writers seem to be distracted from reflecting on the current situation,\u201d commented one well-known writer based in [[Mandalay]].\n\nIn reaction to the military regime\u2019s propagandistic works of art, which promote an ideal of selfless service to the nation, and blindly following imported Western concepts, some young writers have even gone to the extreme of declaring themselves followers of the school of \u201cart for no sake.\u201d According to a well-known literary critic who writes for a famous magazine inside Burma, Dagon Taya briefly came under attack from one such group in the mid-1990s. This group\u2014consisting of ex-communists, former members of Ne Win\u2019s Burma Socialist Program Party and a few younger writers\u2014accused Dagon Taya of being out-dated and an obstacle to a new generation of writers.\n\n\u201cThese attacks seemed to have had a hidden agenda,\u201d observed one historian who closely followed the renewed controversy surrounding [[Burma]]\u2019s most famous living author.\n\n\u201cThey tried to denounce Dagon Taya by labeling him an old communist. The military regime was no doubt pleased to see him come under fresh attack.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Dagon Taya was not the only casualty of this latest assault on the living bastion of Burma\u2019s modern literary history.\n\n\u201cThe Burmese literary movement is scattering and dividing itself up,\u201d remarked the historian, adding that literary figures and other left-leaning intellectuals have always been regarded as a threat by the country\u2019s ruling military elite.\n\nThese attacks have since subsided; and, as if to demonstrate his own powers of endurance, Dagon Taya seems to have derived from them an even deeper awareness of the social and psychological state of Burma today.\n\nRecognizing the deep sense of intellectual and spiritual drift that afflicts many young writers as they desperately seek a meaningful direction for the future, Dagon Taya reaffirms his belief that writers cannot afford to lose touch with their surroundings.\n\n\u201cOne can not separate the arts from their socio-political setting,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cBurma is now in a transitional period, and young people naturally feel that something is lacking in their minds and in their creative efforts. Indeed, Burmese literature is now looking for a new shore.\u201d<ref>https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/the-living-history-dagon-taya-modern-burmese-literature.html</ref>\n\n==Death & Rest Place==\nHe passed away at [[Aungban|Aungpan]], Southern [[Shan State]] in the afternoon (at 1:15 ) of August 19th, 2013 .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.myanmarcelebrity.com/2013/08/the-last-day-of-prominent-author-dagon.html |title=The Last Day of Prominent Author Dagon Taryar ~ Myanmar Celebrity: All about Myanmar Celebrities |publisher=Info.myanmarcelebrity.com |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205546/http://info.myanmarcelebrity.com/2013/08/the-last-day-of-prominent-author-dagon.html |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nHis monument can be seen at the Maeko Mountain (\u1019\u101a\u103a\u1001\u102d\u102f\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a) of [[Aungban|Aungpan]] surrounded by beautiful pine trees.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Literature}}\n* [http://www.burmesebookshelf.com/book_download_3_1.php?file=1953 ''May''] from burmesebookshelf.com (burmeseclassic.com)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:2013 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burmese writers]]\n[[Category:University of Yangon alumni]]\n[[Category:Burmese people of Mon descent]]\n[[Category:People from Ayeyarwady Region]]\n\n\n{{Burma-bio-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2014}}\n{{Infobox writer <!-- for more information see [[:Template:Infobox writer/doc]] -->\n| name        = Dagon Taya\n| native_name = {{my|\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c}}\n| image       = \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038 \u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c.jpg\n| caption     =  \n| pseudonym   = ''Myaing Thazin'', ''Maung Nan Nwe'', ''Saw Htut'', ''U Toe'', ''Maung Linn Htet'', ''Banya Thiha'', ''U Dagon''\n| birth_name  = Htay Myaing\n| birth_date  = {{birth date|1919|5|10|df=y}}\n| birth_place = [[Kyaiklat Township|Kyaiklat]], [[British Burma]]\n| death_date  = {{death date and age|df=y|2013|8|19|1919|5|10}}\n| death_place = [[Aungban|Aungpan]], Southern [[Shan State]], [[Myanmar]]\n| notableworks = ''May'' (1947)\n| occupation  = Writer, journalist\n| genre       = \n| period      = \n| nationality = Burmese\n| spouse      = \n| children    = \n| alma_mater  = [[University of Yangon|Rangoon University]]\n| awards      = [[Burma National Literature Award|Sarpay Beikman Literary award]] (1961) <br> [[Pakokku U Ohn Pe literary award|Pakokku U Ohn Pe Life Time Achievement award]] (2001) <br> [[Manhae Prize]](2013)\n}}\n\n==Overview==\n\n'''Dagon Taya''' ({{lang-my|\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c}}; 10 May 1919 \u2013 19 August 2013; also spelt '''Dagon Taryar'''), born '''Htay Myaing''', was a renowned [[Myanmar]] writer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mizzima.com/culture/life/9884-renowned-writer-dagon-taryar-passes-away |title=Renowned writer Dagon Taryar passes away |publisher=Mizzima.com |accessdate=25 August 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824152147/http://mizzima.com/culture/life/9884-renowned-writer-dagon-taryar-passes-away |archivedate=24 August 2013 |df=dmy }}</ref> He was born at Htai Ku Myit Tan Village ([[Mon people|Mon]]), [[Kyaiklat Township]], [[Ayeyarwady Division|Ayeyarwaddy Region]] on 10 May 1919.

At the turn of the 20th century, Burmese literature made a remarkable departure from its traditional classicism.\n\n[[File:\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c.jpg|thumb|right|  \u1006\u101b\u102c\u1000\u103c\u102e\u1038\u1012\u1002\u102f\u1014\u103a\u1010\u102c\u101b\u102c ]]\n\nIn 1904, James Hla Kyaw adapted part of the story [[The Count of Monte Cristo]], by the French writer [[Alexandre Dumas]], into Burmese under the title Maung Yin Maung Ma Me Ma, the first modern Burmese novel. It was an epoch-making work in the history of Burmese literature. This innovation led others to realize that exposure to world literature, particularly those of the West, would greatly assist efforts to modernize Burmese literary writing.\n\nIn 1920, the [[University of Rangoon]] was founded and some persons connected with it\u2014 most notably J S Furnivall, founder of the Burma Education Extension Association\u2014 were determined to make foreign literature available to [[Burmese]].\n\nMany new adaptations of foreign works into Burmese followed. The writers of the new movement, who were called the \u201cUniversity Wits,\u201d also did original works, including short stories and poems. There were three luminaries in this movement, which we now call Khitsan (\u201cNew Writing\u201d). Theitpan Maung Wa was famous for his lucid prose style, while Zawgyi and Min Thu Wun were highly respected for their keen powers of observation, revealed in poems about the everyday life of people and the minute details of nature.\n\nThe styles and outlooks of [[William Wordsworth]], [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]], [[John Keats]] and [[Rabindranath Tagore]] of India\u2014broadly speaking, the major exponents of Romanticism\u2014were the major influences on the Khitsan writers. Later on, many critics pointed out that while the Khitsan movement had made great strides in the development of artistic technique, they had failed to meet the contemporary political needs of the whole nation\u2014particularly, the growing demand for independence from British colonial rule.\n\nThe most influential literary figure throughout the colonial period was Thakin Kodaw Hmaing, a highly respected journalist, playwright, poet, and historian. His literary works succeeded in arousing patriotism, love, and compassion, mainly dealing with the past history of [[Burma]] as well as the contemporary political movement for independence. Commentators agree that Kodaw Hmaing, alone amongst his contemporaries, was completely successful in meeting the esthetic and political requirements of his age, even though he continued to write in a traditional style of poetic composition.\n\nMany of the young writers who emerged in the years following the [[Second World War]] were deeply affected by their experiences during the struggles against [[imperialism]] and [[fascism]], as well as by their exposure to the prevailing left-wing political ideologies of the post-war period. Dagon Taya, a tremendously creative writer who continues to compose beautiful poems, short stories, novels, and commentaries even now, became the recognized leader of the post-war progressive writers with his magazine Taya, which strove to promote literary realism and \u201cart for people\u2019s sake\u201d under the banner of Sar Pe Thit (\u201cNew Literature\u201d).\n\nHe was, in fact, the direct heir of Kodaw Hmaing\u2019s politically oriented brand of literature, bringing to it a more sophisticated outlook and manner of presentation. Some observers have described the work of Dagon Taya as the product of a fusion of Kodaw Hmaing\u2019s style with that of the earlier, pre-independence Khitsan writers. Min Thu Wun, the hero of Khitsan, dubbed Dagon Taya\u2019s New Literature Movement \u201cthe Khitsan of the Khitsan.\u201d\n\nIn fact, Dagon Taya and his fellow writers made a breakaway from Khitsan not only in terms of theme but also in sensibility and style, though many of them continued to use the rhyme schemes of their Khitsan predecessors when composing poems. The influence of Dagon Taya\u2019s literary movement has, amazingly, continued to the present day. But he has not been without his critics, particularly amongst rival literary schools (including other advocates of \u201cPeople\u2019s literature\u201d), which have accused him of writing in an overly stylized and unrealistic, even abstract, manner.\n\nThe influence of Dagon Taya\u2019s literary movement has, amazingly, continued to the present day. But he has not been without his critics, particularly amongst rival literary schools (including other advocates of \u201cPeople\u2019s literature\u201d), which have accused him of writing in an overly stylized and unrealistic, even abstract, manner.\n\nNot just a leading literary figure but also a famous peace activist who has made a significant contribution to both internal and international peace efforts, Dagon Taya has also been subjected to political persecution. After the military staged a coup in 1962, he was arrested and imprisoned for four years on suspicion of being a communist.\n\nPersonally, [[Dagon Taya]] is known to be calm, reserved and flexible, but also firm in his convictions. He was a close friend of Burma\u2019s independence hero, [[Aung San]], who in 1943 offered him a high-ranking position in the Japanese occupation government\u2014an offer that Dagon Taya refused. Before [[Aung San]]\u2019s assassination in 1947, Dagon Taya wrote a very beautiful but highly critical essay about [[Aung San]]\u2019s personality, titled \u201cAung San the Untamed\u201d\n\nMany Burmese were shocked by this apparent criticism of their revered father of independence, but Dagon Taya, and [[Aung San]] himself, merely smiled in response to the storm of controversy that this essay generated when it first appeared in Taya magazine. Even more daring was Dagon Taya\u2019s rejection of an honor bestowed upon veterans of the independence movement by General [[Ne Win]]\u2019s socialist regime.\n\nThe State Honorary Award, which carried a grant and a monthly stipend, was generally regarded as a bribe to win the loyalty of famous patriots. After his refusal to accept the award, Dagon Taya went into self-imposed exile from the capital and composed one of his best-known poems, \u201cSending myself to the Mae Za.\u201d\n\n\"He then came to be seen as the Boris [[Pasternak]] of [[Burma]] in the eyes of the authorities,\u201d recounts a young poet and close associate of Dagon Taya now living in exile. \u201cMae Za, in the Burmese political context, means the place where opponents of the king used to be sent as exiles, something like the gulags of [[Soviet Russia]].\u201d\n\nDespite his strong leftist sympathies, Dagon Taya felt no need to conform to preconceived notions of socialist orthodoxy, either intellectually or in his lifestyle. He eschewed any sycophancy towards self-declared \u201cliberators\u201d of the masses, and throughout his life, kept his distance from political parties. A lifelong bachelor with long, wavy hair and custom of wearing iridescent silk longyis and colorful Indonesian batik shirts, this \u201cfriend of the common man\u201d also loved to express his free-spirited nature through painting and by playing the piano in a completely improvised, unrestrained manner.\n\nIn the 1970s, a new generation of poets, strongly influenced by their reading of contemporary Western literature and by their fervid, anti-imperialist response to the [[Vietnam War]], broke with tradition and began composing poems in free verse. Although not explicitly anti-government in nature, the artistic liberties were taken in these poems, as well as the themes of social injustice that frequently ran through them, provoked harsh criticism from conservatives close to Ne Win\u2019s regime. Accused of trying to destroy classical literature or of being communist agents, these young poets found their greatest defender in Dagon Taya, who reiterated his position that, while it was good to have knowledge of the classics, it wasn\u2019t strictly necessary as long as the poet\u2019s work served the interests of the people.\n\nIn 1988, when demands for political reform in [[Burma]] came to a head, many writers both young and old became actively involved in the pro-democracy movement. Since then, to avoid censorship, many have used a variety of highly abstract styles and techniques, including surrealism, magic realism, and stream-of-consciousness, to express their dissatisfaction with the status quo and their hopes for a more democratic society.\n\nMeanwhile, Dagon Taya, who continues to write prolifically even as his eyesight fades in his old age, addressed the changes in the global political climate in a poem titled \u201cThe Thaw,\u201d written after the fall of [[Berlin Wall]], and in an article on the collapse of both individuals and entire nations as a result of political dogmatism and artistic rigidity. While the retreat from realism in Burmese literature has been understandable considering the circumstances, an unfortunate side effect of this development has been a growing tendency for young writers to divorce themselves from reality altogether.\n\nModernist and postmodernist literary theories have found many adherents in [[Burma]] since the early 1990s, resulting in a number of original works that are both aesthetically and politically significant. But, for the most part, they seem to have created an almost totally detached attitude towards the issues of society at large. \u201cTo an extent, [the introduction of new theories] needs to be welcomed. But when it becomes excessive, the young writers seem to be distracted from reflecting on the current situation,\u201d commented one well-known writer based in [[Mandalay]].\n\nIn reaction to the military regime\u2019s propagandistic works of art, which promote an ideal of selfless service to the nation, and blindly following imported Western concepts, some young writers have even gone to the extreme of declaring themselves followers of the school of \u201cart for no sake.\u201d According to a well-known literary critic who writes for a famous magazine inside Burma, Dagon Taya briefly came under attack from one such group in the mid-1990s. This group\u2014consisting of ex-communists, former members of Ne Win\u2019s Burma Socialist Program Party and a few younger writers\u2014accused Dagon Taya of being out-dated and an obstacle to a new generation of writers.\n\n\u201cThese attacks seemed to have had a hidden agenda,\u201d observed one historian who closely followed the renewed controversy surrounding [[Burma]]\u2019s most famous living author.\n\n\u201cThey tried to denounce Dagon Taya by labeling him an old communist. The military regime was no doubt pleased to see him come under fresh attack.\u201d\n\nHe also noted that Dagon Taya was not the only casualty of this latest assault on the living bastion of Burma\u2019s modern literary history.\n\n\u201cThe Burmese literary movement is scattering and dividing itself up,\u201d remarked the historian, adding that literary figures and other left-leaning intellectuals have always been regarded as a threat by the country\u2019s ruling military elite.\n\nThese attacks have since subsided; and, as if to demonstrate his own powers of endurance, Dagon Taya seems to have derived from them an even deeper awareness of the social and psychological state of Burma today.\n\nRecognizing the deep sense of intellectual and spiritual drift that afflicts many young writers as they desperately seek a meaningful direction for the future, Dagon Taya reaffirms his belief that writers cannot afford to lose touch with their surroundings.\n\n\u201cOne can not separate the arts from their socio-political setting,\u201d he wrote recently. \u201cBurma is now in a transitional period, and young people naturally feel that something is lacking in their minds and in their creative efforts. Indeed, Burmese literature is now looking for a new shore.\u201d<ref>https://www.irrawaddy.com/news/burma/the-living-history-dagon-taya-modern-burmese-literature.html</ref>\n\n==Death & Rest Place==\nHe passed away at [[Aungban|Aungpan]], Southern [[Shan State]] in the afternoon (at 1:15 ) of August 19th, 2013 .<ref>{{cite web |url=http://info.myanmarcelebrity.com/2013/08/the-last-day-of-prominent-author-dagon.html |title=The Last Day of Prominent Author Dagon Taryar ~ Myanmar Celebrity: All about Myanmar Celebrities |publisher=Info.myanmarcelebrity.com |date=21 August 2013 |accessdate=25 August 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104205546/http://info.myanmarcelebrity.com/2013/08/the-last-day-of-prominent-author-dagon.html |archive-date=4 January 2014 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nHis monument can be seen at the Maeko Mountain (\u1019\u101a\u103a\u1001\u102d\u102f\u1010\u1031\u102c\u1004\u103a) of [[Aungban|Aungpan]] surrounded by beautiful pine trees.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Literature}}\n* [http://www.burmesebookshelf.com/book_download_3_1.php?file=1953 ''May''] from burmesebookshelf.com (burmeseclassic.com)\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n[[Category:1919 births]]\n[[Category:2013 deaths]]\n[[Category:Burmese writers]]\n[[Category:University of Yangon alumni]]\n[[Category:Burmese people of Mon descent]]\n[[Category:People from Ayeyarwady Region]]\n\n\n{{Burma-bio-stub}}\n", "name_user": "Kmthu.ytu", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dagon_Taya"}

Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as [[chaparral]]. San Diego County contains more than a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|title=The California Chaparral Field Institute|website=Web.archive.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623064734/http://californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorth San Diego County is known as [[North County, San Diego|North County]]; the exact geographic definitions of \"North County\" vary, but it includes the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the [[City of San Diego]].\n\nThe eastern suburbs are collectively known as [[East County, San Diego|East County]], though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as [[South Bay, San Diego|South Bay]].\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to [[wildfire]]s that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 [[Lilac Fire]] and the [[May 2014 San Diego County wildfires]]; before them was the [[Witch Creek Fire]] in 2007 and the [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]] in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area).

In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons).

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/gtg/ca/state/overview/county.html#1|title=About County Government|work=Guide to Government|publisher=League of Women Voters of California|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> Some chartered cities such as [[San Diego]] and [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities such as [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]] and [[Vista, California|Vista]] arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis.\n\nThe county government is composed of the elected five-member [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], several other elected offices and officers including the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff]], the [[San Diego County District Attorney|District Attorney]], [[San Diego County Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk|Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk]], and [[San Diego County Treasurer/Tax Collector|Treasurer/Tax Collector]], and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer such as the [[San Diego County, California Probation|Probation Department]]. In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the [[Superior Court of San Diego County|San Diego Superior Court]].\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors]] is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of January 2019, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Supervisors|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/general/bos.html|website=Sandiegocounty.gov}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2 width=\"35%\"\n|-\n!

Various cities within the county are swing areas that have split their votes in elections since 2000.  Republican strength is concentrated in North County, East County and the eastern backlands. Coronado has also traditionally been a Republican stronghold.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of [[Golden Hall (sports venue)|Golden Hall]], a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\"  The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/election/article_92315642-27a2-11e2-a565-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Where to Find Us on Election Day|last=Libby|first=Sarah|date=November 5, 2012|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041104/news_1m4hall.html|title=Amid the celebrations, farewell - The San Diego Union-Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Signsonsandiego.com}}</ref>\n\nOn Nov 4, 2008 San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which was overturned by a ruling from the [[California Supreme Court]].

This treaty designated the new border as terminating at a point on the Pacific Ocean coast which would result in the border passing one Spanish league south of the southernmost portion of [[San Diego Bay]], thus ensuring that the United States received all of this natural harbor.\n\nSan Diego County was one of the original counties of California, created at the time of California statehood in 1850.<ref name=coy>{{cite book |last=Coy |first=Owen C.; PhD |title=California County Boundaries |publisher=California Historical Commission |year=1923 |location=Berkeley |asin=B000GRBCXG}}</ref>{{rp|221}}\n\nAt the time of its establishment in 1850, San Diego County was relatively large, and included all of southernmost California south and east of [[Los Angeles County]].

[[Cleveland National Forest]] is spread across the central portion of the county, while the [[Anza-Borrego Desert|Anza-Borrego Desert State Park]] occupies most of the northeast.\n\nAlthough the county's western third is primarily urban, the mountains and deserts in the eastern two-thirds are primarily undeveloped [[backcountry]]. Most of these backcountry areas are home to a native plant community known as [[chaparral]]. San Diego County contains more than a million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of chaparral, twice as much as any other California county.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|title=The California Chaparral Field Institute|website=Web.archive.org|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623064734/http://californiachaparral.com/factsandmyths/wheretofindchaparral.html|archivedate=June 23, 2006|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nNorth San Diego County is known as [[North County, San Diego|North County]]; the exact geographic definitions of \"North County\" vary, but it includes the northern suburbs and sometimes certain northern neighborhoods of the [[City of San Diego]].\n\nThe eastern suburbs are collectively known as [[East County, San Diego|East County]], though most still lie in the western third of the county. The southern suburbs and southern detached portion of the city of San Diego, extending to the Mexican border, are collectively referred to as [[South Bay, San Diego|South Bay]].\n\nPeriodically the area has been subject to [[wildfire]]s that force thousands to evacuate. The most recent are the December 2017 [[Lilac Fire]] and the [[May 2014 San Diego County wildfires]]; before them was the [[Witch Creek Fire]] in 2007 and the [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]] in 2003. California defines a fire season in which fires are most likely to occur, usually between late July and late October (which are the driest months of the area). Signs posted in numerous spots of the county provide information on the level of threats from fires based on weather conditions.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\n===Climate===\n{{Main|Climate of San Diego, California}}\n[[File:Mountlagunasmall.jpg|thumb|left|[[Cleveland National Forest]]]]\n\nUnder the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]] system, the urban and suburban San Diego area straddles areas of [[Mediterranean climate]] (CSa) to the north and [[semi-arid climate]] (BSh) to the south and east.<ref>{{cite journal|author=M.

Western San Diego's climate is characterized by warm, dry summers and mild winters with most of the annual precipitation falling between November and March. The city has mild, mostly dry weather, with an average of 201 days above {{convert|70|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and low rainfall ({{convert|9|\u2013|13|in|cm}} annually). Summer temperatures are generally warm, with average highs of {{convert|70|\u2013|78|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|55|\u2013|66|F|C}}. Temperatures exceed {{convert|90|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} only four days a year. Most rainfall occurs from November to April. Winter temperatures are mild, with average high temperatures of {{convert|66|\u2013|70|F|C}} and lows of {{convert|50|\u2013|56|F|C}}.\n\nThe climate in the San Diego area, like much of California, often varies significantly over short geographical distances resulting in [[microclimate]]s. In San Diego's case this is mainly due to the city's topography (the Bay, and the numerous hills, mountains, and canyons). Frequently, particularly during the \"May gray/[[June gloom]]\" period, a thick [[marine layer]] will keep the air cool and damp within a few miles of the coast, but will yield to bright cloudless sunshine approximately {{convert|5|\u2013|10|mi|km}} inland.

The County government provides countywide services such as elections and voter registration, law enforcement, jails, vital records, property records, tax collection, public health, and social services. In addition the County serves as the local government for all unincorporated areas.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.smartvoter.org/gtg/ca/state/overview/county.html#1|title=About County Government|work=Guide to Government|publisher=League of Women Voters of California|accessdate=December 26, 2012}}</ref> Some chartered cities such as [[San Diego]] and [[Chula Vista, California|Chula Vista]] provide municipal services such as police, public safety, libraries, parks and recreation, and zoning. Other cities such as [[Del Mar, California|Del Mar]] and [[Vista, California|Vista]] arrange to have the County provide some or all of these services on a contract basis.\n\nThe county government is composed of the elected five-member [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], several other elected offices and officers including the [[San Diego County Sheriff's Department|Sheriff]], the [[San Diego County District Attorney|District Attorney]], [[San Diego County Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk|Assessor/Recorder/County Clerk]], and [[San Diego County Treasurer/Tax Collector|Treasurer/Tax Collector]], and numerous county departments and entities under the supervision of the Chief Administrative Officer such as the [[San Diego County, California Probation|Probation Department]]. In addition, several entities of the [[government of California]] have jurisdiction conterminous with San Diego County, such as the [[Superior Court of San Diego County|San Diego Superior Court]].\n\nUnder its foundational Charter, the five-member elected [[San Diego County Board of Supervisors]] is the county legislature. The board operates in a legislative, executive, and [[Quasi-judicial body|quasi-judicial]] capacity. As a legislative authority, it can pass ordinances for the unincorporated areas (ordinances that affect the whole county, like posting of restaurant ratings, must be ratified by the individual city). As an executive body, it can tell the county departments what to do, and how to do it. As a quasi-judicial body, the Board is the final venue of appeal in the local planning process.\n\nAs of January 2019, the members of the San Diego County Board of Supervisors are:<ref>{{cite web|title=Board of Supervisors|url=http://www.sandiegocounty.gov/general/bos.html|website=Sandiegocounty.gov}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=3 cellspacing=2 width=\"35%\"\n|-\n!

Various cities within the county are swing areas that have split their votes in elections since 2000.  Republican strength is concentrated in North County, East County and the eastern backlands. Coronado has also traditionally been a Republican stronghold.\n\nOne unique feature of the political scene is the use of [[Golden Hall (sports venue)|Golden Hall]], a convention facility next to San Diego's City Hall, as \"Election Central.\"  The County Registrar of Voters rents the hall to distribute election results. Supporters and political observers gather to watch the results come in; supporters of the various candidates parade around the hall, carrying signs and chanting; candidates give their victory and concession speeches and host parties for campaign volunteers and donors at the site; and television stations broadcast live from the floor of the convention center.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.voiceofsandiego.org/election/article_92315642-27a2-11e2-a565-0019bb2963f4.html|title=Where to Find Us on Election Day|last=Libby|first=Sarah|date=November 5, 2012|work=Voice of San Diego|accessdate=December 28, 2012}}</ref> The atmosphere at Election Central on the evening of election day has been compared to the voting portion of a political party national convention.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20041104/news_1m4hall.html|title=Amid the celebrations, farewell - The San Diego Union-Tribune<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Signsonsandiego.com}}</ref>\n\nOn Nov 4, 2008 San Diego County voted 53.71% for Proposition 8 which amended the California Constitution to ban same-sex marriages, thus restoring [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]] which was overturned by a ruling from the [[California Supreme Court]].

Blake would later make landfall in  northwestern [[Australia]] and soon degenerate afterwards. At the same time, Claudia, another tropical cyclone, formed. It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating east of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February.

It persisted for two weeks and reached category 3 on the [[Australian tropical cyclone scale]] before dissipating east of Australia. Later that month, a tropical low formed and lasted for a week before dissipating in late January without been named. Three other tropical lows formed in late January and early February. One of them dissipated later. Another one of them has been moving in and out of the Australian region. It was designated 06F by the [[Fiji Meteorological Service]]. The third one intensified into Cyclone Damien. In late February, 2 new tropical lows formed, and were named Esther and Ferdinand.

{"title_page": "Church of the East in China", "text_new": "The '''[[Church of the East]]''' or the sometimes referred to as [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] Church historically had a presence in [[China]] during two periods: first from the 7th through the 10th century, and later during the Mongol [[Yuan Dynasty]] in the 13th and 14th centuries. Locally, the religion was known as '''Jingjiao''' ({{lang-zh|t=\u666f\u6559|w=Ching3-Chiao4|p=J\u01d0ngji\u00e0o|l=Luminous Religion}}).\n\n[[File:Nestorian-Stele-Budge-plate-X.jpg|thumb|The [[Nestorian Stele]], erected in Chang'an 781.]]\n\nAfter centuries of latency, the 21st century marked a historical moment between the Assyrian Church of the East and the Church in China, when the [[Liturgy of Addai and Mari]] was celebrated.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Tang era ==\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | header = \n | image1 = T'ang dynasty Nestorian image of Jesus Christ (Original version).jpg\n | width1 = 124\n | alt1 = \n | caption1 = The original work\n | image2 = T'ang dynasty Nestorian image of Jesus Christ.jpg\n | width2 = 137\n | alt2 = \n | caption2 = A copy\n | image3 = Restoration of T\u2018ang Dynasty Nestorian Image of Jesus Christ.jpg\n | width3 = 141\n | alt3 = \n | caption3 = A restoration\n | footer = A [[Tang dynasty]] (9th century) fragmentary [[Painting of a Nestorian Christian figure|silk painting of Jesus Christ]] according to the Chinese [[Church of the East|Nestorian]] vision, discovered in Cave 17 at [[Mogao Caves|Mo-kao Caves]].

Alopen's mission arrived in the Chinese capital [[Chang'an]] in 635, during the reign of Emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Taizong extended official tolerance to the mission and invited the Christians to translate their sacred works for the imperial library. This tolerance was followed by many of Taizong's successors, allowing the Church of the East to thrive in China for over 200 years.<ref>Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 38</ref><ref name=Moffett>Moffett, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nChina became a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] province of the Church of the East, under the name [[Beth Sinaye]], in the first quarter of the 8th century. According to the 14th-century writer \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of Nisibis, the province was established by the patriarch [[Sliba-zkha]] (714\u201328).<ref>Mai, ''Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio'', x. 141</ref> Arguing from its position in the list of exterior provinces, which implied an 8th-century foundation, and on grounds of general historical probability, \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf refuted alternative claims that the province of Beth Sinaye had been founded either by the 5th-century patriarch [[Ahha]] (410\u201314) or the 6th-century patriarch [[Shila (Nestorian Patriarch)|Shila]] (503\u201323).<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 123\u20134</ref>\n\nIn 781 the Christian community in Chang'an erected a tablet known as the [[Nestorian Stele]] on the grounds of a local monastery. The stele contains a long inscription in Chinese with [[Syriac language|Syriac]] glosses, composed by the cleric Adam, probably the metropolitan of Beth Sinaye. The inscription describes the eventful progress of the Nestorian (Church of the East) mission in China since Alopen's arrival. The inscription also mentions the archdeacons Gigoi of Khumdan [Chang'an] and Gabriel of Sarag [Lo-yang]; Yazdbuzid, 'priest and country-bishop of Khumdan'; Sargis, 'priest and country-bishop'; and the bishop Yohannan. These references confirm that the Church of the East in China had a well-developed hierarchy at the end of the 8th century, with bishops in both northern capitals, and there were probably other dioceses besides Chang'an and Lo-yang. Shortly afterwards Thomas of Marga mentions the monk David of Beth \u02bfAbe, who was metropolitan of Beth Sinaye during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823). Timothy I is said also to have consecrated a metropolitan for Tibet (Beth Tuptaye), a province not again mentioned.\n\nThe province of Beth Sinaye is last mentioned in 987 by the Arab writer [[Ibn al-Nadim]], who met a Nestorian monk who had recently returned from China, who informed him that 'Christianity was just extinct in China; the native Christians had perished in one way or another; the church which they had used had been destroyed; and there was only one Christian left in the land'.<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 222</ref> The collapse of the Church of the East in China coincided with the fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]], which led to a tumultuous era (the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]).<ref name=Moffett/>\n\nDozens of Jingjiao texts were translated from Syriac into Chinese. Only a few have survived. These are generally referred to as the Chinese [[Jingjiao Documents]]. One of the surviving texts, the ''Zunjing'' or ''Book of Praise'' (\u5c0a\u7d93), lists about 35 books that had been translated into Chinese. Among these books are some translations of the Scriptures, including the [[Pentateuch]] (\u725f\u4e16\u6cd5\u738b\u7d93) - [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] is known as \u6e3e\u5143\u7d93, [[Psalms]] (\u591a\u60e0\u8056\u738b\u7d93), [[the Gospels]] (\u963f\u601d\u77bf\u5229\u5bb9\u7d93), [[Acts of the Apostles]] (\u50b3\u5316\u7d93) and a collection of the [[Pauline epistles]] (\u5bf3\u8def\u6cd5\u738b\u7d93). These translations of the Scriptures have not survived. However, three non-scriptural Christian books listed in the ''Zunjing'' are among the Jingjiao manuscripts that were discovered in the early 20th century: the ''Sutra on the Origin of Origins'', the ''Sutra of Ultimate and Mysterious Happiness'', and the ''Hymn of Perfection of the Three Majesties'' (also called ''Gloria in Excelsis Deo''). Two additional Jingjiao manuscripts not listed in the ''Zunjing'' have also been discovered: ''Sutra of Hearing the Messiah'' and ''Treatise on the One God''.<ref>[[P. Y.

The [[Mongol invasion of China]] in the 13th century allowed the church to return to China. By the end of the century two new metropolitan provinces had been created for China: Tangut and 'Katai and Ong'.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 48\u20139, 103\u20134 and 137\u20138</ref>\n\nThe province of Tangut covered northwestern China, and its metropolitan seems to have sat at [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]]. The province evidently had several dioceses, even though they cannot now be localised, as the metropolitan Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on Bar Qaligh of Tangut was arrested by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281 'together with a number of his bishops'.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 450</ref>\n\nThe province of Katai [Cathay] and Ong, which seems to have replaced the old Tang dynasty province of Beth Sinaye, covered northern China and the country of the Christian [[Ongud|Ongut]] tribe around the great bend of the Yellow River.  The metropolitans of Katai and Ong probably sat at the Mongol capital Khanbaliq.  The patriarch Yahballaha III grew up in a monastery in northern China in the 1270s, and the metropolitans Giwargis and Nestoris are mentioned in his biography.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 127 and 132</ref>  [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]] himself was consecrated metropolitan of Katai and Ong by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 452</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 14th century there were Nestorian Christian communities in many cities in China, and the province of Katai and Ong probably had several suffragan dioceses. In 1253 William of Rubruck mentioned a Nestorian bishop in the town of 'Segin' (Xijing, modern [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province). The tomb of a Nestorian bishop named Shlemun, who died in 1313, has recently been discovered at [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]] province. Shlemun's epitaph described him as 'administrator of the Christians and [[Manicheans]] of Manzi (south China)'. Marco Polo had earlier reported the existence of a Manichean community in Fujian, at first thought to be Christian, and it is not surprising to find this small religious minority represented officially by a Christian bishop.<ref>Lieu, S., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 180</ref>\n\nThe Church of the East declined in China substantially in the mid-14th century. Several contemporaries, including the papal envoy [[John of Marignolli]], mention the murder of the Latin bishop Richard and six of his companions in 1339 or 1340 by a Muslim mob in Almaliq, the chief city of Tangut, and the forcible conversion of the city's Christians to Islam.<ref>Yule and Cordier, ''Cathay and the Way Thither'', iii. 31\u20133 and 212</ref> The last tombstones in two [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] cemeteries discovered in Mongolia around the end of the 19th century date from 1342, and several commemorate deaths during a plague in 1338.<ref>Nau, \u2018Les pierres tombales nestoriennes du mus\u00e9e Guimet\u2019, ''ROC'', 18 (1913), 3\u201335</ref> In China, the last references to East Syriac and Latin Christians date from the 1350s, and it is likely that all foreign Christians were expelled from China soon after the revolution of 1368, which replaced the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan dynasty]] with the xenophobic [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasty]].<ref>Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 216\u201340</ref>\n\n[[Roman Catholicism in China]] was expanded at the expense of the Nestorians during the Yuan dynasty.\n\nThe Mongols called \"Nestorian\" Christians (or \"Nestorian\" Christian priests in particular) ''Arka\u2032un'' or ''Erke\u2032un'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Dale A.|title=Searching for Jesus on the Silk Road|isbn=978-1300435310|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xWQDBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA133#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2013}}</ref>{{Self-published source|date=April 2020}} which was later applied for Christians in general (including [[Roman Catholics]])<ref name=\"CE\">{{CathEncy |wstitle = The Church in China}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |date=2007 |publisher=City University of HK Press |isbn = 978-9629371401 |page = 680 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA680#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> whereby Christianity was named in Chinese as [[:zh:\u4e5f\u91cc\u53ef\u6eab\u6559|\u4e5f\u91cc\u53ef\u6eab\u6559]] (''Y\u011bl\u01d0k\u011bw\u0113n ji\u00e0o'').

Alopen's mission arrived in the Chinese capital [[Chang'an]] in 635, during the reign of Emperor [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Taizong]] of the [[Tang Dynasty]]. Taizong extended official tolerance to the mission and invited the Christians to translate their sacred works for the imperial library. This tolerance was followed by many of Taizong's successors, allowing the Church of the East to thrive in China for over 200 years.<ref>Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 38</ref><ref name=Moffett>Moffett, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nChina became a [[Metropolitan bishop|metropolitan]] province of the Church of the East, under the name [[Beth Sinaye]], in the first quarter of the 8th century. According to the 14th-century writer \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf of Nisibis, the province was established by the patriarch [[Sliba-zkha]] (714\u201328).<ref>Mai, ''Scriptorum Veterum Nova Collectio'', x. 141</ref> Arguing from its position in the list of exterior provinces, which implied an 8th-century foundation, and on grounds of general historical probability, \u02bfAbdisho\u02bf refuted alternative claims that the province of Beth Sinaye had been founded either by the 5th-century patriarch [[Ahha]] (410\u201314) or the 6th-century patriarch [[Shila (Nestorian Patriarch)|Shila]] (503\u201323).<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 123\u20134</ref>\n\nIn 781 the Christian community in Chang'an erected a tablet known as the [[Nestorian Stele]] on the grounds of a local monastery. The stele contains a long inscription in Chinese with [[Syriac language|Syriac]] glosses, composed by the cleric Adam, probably the metropolitan of Beth Sinaye. The inscription describes the eventful progress of the Nestorian (Church of the East) mission in China since Alopen's arrival. The inscription also mentions the archdeacons Gigoi of Khumdan [Chang'an] and Gabriel of Sarag [Lo-yang]; Yazdbuzid, 'priest and country-bishop of Khumdan'; Sargis, 'priest and country-bishop'; and the bishop Yohannan. These references confirm that the Church of the East in China had a well-developed hierarchy at the end of the 8th century, with bishops in both northern capitals, and there were probably other dioceses besides Chang'an and Lo-yang. Shortly afterwards Thomas of Marga mentions the monk David of Beth \u02bfAbe, who was metropolitan of Beth Sinaye during the reign of [[Timothy I (Nestorian Patriarch)|Timothy I]] (780\u2013823). Timothy I is said also to have consecrated a metropolitan for Tibet (Beth Tuptaye), a province not again mentioned.\n\nThe province of Beth Sinaye is last mentioned in 987 by the Arab writer [[Ibn al-Nadim]], who met a Nestorian monk who had recently returned from China, who informed him that 'Christianity was just extinct in China; the native Christians had perished in one way or another; the church which they had used had been destroyed; and there was only one Christian left in the land'.<ref>Wilmshurst, ''The Martyred Church'', 222</ref> The collapse of the Church of the East in China coincided with the fall of the [[Tang Dynasty]], which led to a tumultuous era (the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]]).<ref name=Moffett/>\n\nDozens of Jingjiao texts were translated from Syriac into Chinese. Only a few have survived. These are generally referred to as the Chinese [[Jingjiao Documents]]. One of the surviving texts, the ''Zunjing'' or ''Book of Praise'' (\u5c0a\u7d93), lists about 35 books that had been translated into Chinese. Among these books are some translations of the Scriptures, including the [[Pentateuch]] (\u725f\u4e16\u6cd5\u738b\u7d93) - [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] is known as \u6e3e\u5143\u7d93, [[Psalms]] (\u591a\u60e0\u8056\u738b\u7d93), [[the Gospels]] (\u963f\u601d\u77bf\u5229\u5bb9\u7d93), [[Acts of the Apostles]] (\u50b3\u5316\u7d93) and a collection of the [[Pauline epistles]] (\u5bf3\u8def\u6cd5\u738b\u7d93). These translations of the Scriptures have not survived. However, three non-scriptural Christian books listed in the ''Zunjing'' are among the Jingjiao manuscripts that were discovered in the early 20th century: the ''Sutra on the Origin of Origins'', the ''Sutra of Ultimate and Mysterious Happiness'', and the ''Hymn of Perfection of the Three Majesties'' (also called ''Gloria in Excelsis Deo''). Two additional Jingjiao manuscripts not listed in the ''Zunjing'' have also been discovered: ''Sutra of Hearing the Messiah'' and ''Treatise on the One God''.<ref>[[P. Y.

The [[Mongol invasion of China]] in the 13th century allowed the church to return to China. By the end of the century two new metropolitan provinces had been created for China: Tangut and 'Katai and Ong'.<ref>Fiey, ''POCN'', 48\u20139, 103\u20134 and 137\u20138</ref>\n\nThe province of Tangut covered northwestern China, and its metropolitan seems to have sat at [[Almaliq, Xinjiang|Almaliq]]. The province evidently had several dioceses, even though they cannot now be localised, as the metropolitan Shem{{transl|ar|DIN|\u02bf}}on Bar Qaligh of Tangut was arrested by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281 'together with a number of his bishops'.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 450</ref>\n\nThe province of Katai [Cathay] and Ong, which seems to have replaced the old Tang dynasty province of Beth Sinaye, covered northern China and the country of the Christian [[Ongud|Ongut]] tribe around the great bend of the Yellow River.  The metropolitans of Katai and Ong probably sat at the Mongol capital Khanbaliq.  The patriarch Yahballaha III grew up in a monastery in northern China in the 1270s, and the metropolitans Giwargis and Nestoris are mentioned in his biography.<ref>Wallis Budge, ''The Monks of Kublai Khan'', 127 and 132</ref>  [[Yaballaha III|Yahballaha]] himself was consecrated metropolitan of Katai and Ong by the patriarch [[Mar Denha I|Denha I]] shortly before his death in 1281.<ref>Bar Hebraeus, ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'', ii. 452</ref>\n\nDuring the first half of the 14th century there were Nestorian Christian communities in many cities in China, and the province of Katai and Ong probably had several suffragan dioceses. In 1253 William of Rubruck mentioned a Nestorian bishop in the town of 'Segin' (Xijing, modern [[Datong]] in [[Shanxi]] province). The tomb of a Nestorian bishop named Shlemun, who died in 1313, has recently been discovered at [[Quanzhou]] in [[Fujian]] province. Shlemun's epitaph described him as 'administrator of the Christians and [[Manicheans]] of Manzi (south China)'. Marco Polo had earlier reported the existence of a Manichean community in Fujian, at first thought to be Christian, and it is not surprising to find this small religious minority represented officially by a Christian bishop.<ref>Lieu, S., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 180</ref>\n\nThe Church of the East declined in China substantially in the mid-14th century. Several contemporaries, including the papal envoy [[John of Marignolli]], mention the murder of the Latin bishop Richard and six of his companions in 1339 or 1340 by a Muslim mob in Almaliq, the chief city of Tangut, and the forcible conversion of the city's Christians to Islam.<ref>Yule and Cordier, ''Cathay and the Way Thither'', iii. 31\u20133 and 212</ref> The last tombstones in two [[East Syriac Rite|East Syriac]] cemeteries discovered in Mongolia around the end of the 19th century date from 1342, and several commemorate deaths during a plague in 1338.<ref>Nau, \u2018Les pierres tombales nestoriennes du mus\u00e9e Guimet\u2019, ''ROC'', 18 (1913), 3\u201335</ref> In China, the last references to East Syriac and Latin Christians date from the 1350s, and it is likely that all foreign Christians were expelled from China soon after the revolution of 1368, which replaced the [[Mongol]] [[Yuan Dynasty|Yuan dynasty]] with the xenophobic [[Ming Dynasty|Ming dynasty]].<ref>Moule, ''Christians in China before the Year 1550'', 216\u201340</ref>\n\n[[Roman Catholicism in China]] was expanded at the expense of the Nestorians during the Yuan dynasty.\n\nThe Mongols called \"Nestorian\" Christians (or \"Nestorian\" Christian priests in particular) ''Arka\u2032un'' or ''Erke\u2032un'',<ref>{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Dale A.|title=Searching for Jesus on the Silk Road|isbn=978-1300435310|page=133|url=https://books.google.com/?id=xWQDBAAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&pg=PA133#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=2013}}</ref>{{Self-published source|date=}} which was later applied for Christians in general (including [[Roman Catholics]])<ref name=\"CE\">{{CathEncy |wstitle = The Church in China}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |title=China: Five Thousand Years of History and Civilization |date=2007 |publisher=City University of HK Press |isbn = 978-9629371401 |page = 680 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=z-fAxn_9f8wC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA680#v=onepage&q&f=false}}</ref> whereby Christianity was named in Chinese as [[:zh:\u4e5f\u91cc\u53ef\u6eab\u6559|\u4e5f\u91cc\u53ef\u6eab\u6559]] (''Y\u011bl\u01d0k\u011bw\u0113n ji\u00e0o'').
