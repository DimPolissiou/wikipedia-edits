A18774.jpg|thumb|White Ensign flying from [[HMS Foxhound (H69)|HMS ''Foxhound'']], 1943.]]\nThe '''White Ensign''', at one time called the '''St George's Ensign''' due to the simultaneous existence of a cross-less version of the flag, is an [[ensign]] flown on British [[Royal Navy]] [[Royal Navy ships|ships]] and [[shore establishment]]s. It consists of a red [[St George's Cross]] on a white field with the [[Union Flag]] in the upper canton.\n\nThe White Ensign is also flown by [[yacht]]s of members of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] and by ships of [[Trinity House]] escorting [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the reigning monarch]].\n\nIn addition to the United Kingdom, several other nations have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with the St George's Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge omitting the cross altogether. Yachts of the [[Royal Irish Yacht Club]] fly a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the [[Heraldic Badge of Ireland]]. The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]] and the Commissioners' flag of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] place the Union emblem in the first quarter of a white field, omitting the overall red St George's Cross, but are not ensigns for use at sea.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|320px|Striped ensigns flying on English and Spanish galleons in 1588: (enlarge image for detailed view)]]\n[[File:48 NATO fleet entering Stavanger Norway April 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Ensign flying from a Royal Navy vessel.]]\n[[File:Royal Marine, 1914.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Royal Marine]] holding up the White Ensign aboard {{HMS|Pegasus|1897|6}}, during the [[Battle of Zanzibar]] (20 September 1914).]]\n\nEnglish naval ensigns were first used during the 16th century, and were often striped in green and white (the Tudor colours), but other colours were also used to indicate different squadrons, including blue, red and tawny brown. (These striped ensigns can be seen in use on both English and Spanish warships in contemporary paintings of the 1588 [[Spanish Armada]] battles). Later, there was usually a St George's Cross in the upper canton, or sewn across the field as on the modern White Ensign. These striped ensigns continued in use under the Stuart kings: the Naval ensign of 1623 is described as having \"15 horizontal stripes alternately blue, white and yellow with a Cross of St George in the canton\". This design fell out of use after 1630, with the introduction of the Red, White and Blue ensigns. The use of stripes continued in the red and white of both the [[East India Company|flag of the Honourable East India Company]], adopted in 1600, and of the 1775 [[Grand Union Flag]] that formed the basis for the modern [[flag of the United States of America]], and the red, white and blue striped ensign that serves as the [[flag of Hawaii]].\n\nThe first recognisable White Ensign appears to have been in use during the 16th century, consisting of a white field with a broad St George's cross, and a second St. George's cross in the canton. By 1630 the white ensign consisted of simply a white field, with a small St George's cross in the canton, which was consistent with the red and blue ensigns of the time. In 1707, the St. George's cross was reintroduced to the flag as a whole, though not as broad as before, and the [[Union Flag]] was placed in the canton. There was also a version of this flag without the overall St George's cross, which appears to have been for use in home waters only, though this flag appears to have fallen out of use by 1720. In 1801, after the [[Act of Union 1800]], the flag was updated to include the new Union Flag in the canton, and so took on the form as used today. The blue field of the Union Flag was darkened at this time at the request of the [[Admiralty]], in the hope that the new flags would not require replacing as often as the previous design, due to fading of the blue. Throughout this period, the proportions of the flags changed. In 1687, the then [[Secretary of the Admiralty]], [[Samuel Pepys]], instructed that flags be of the ratio 11:18 (18&nbsp;inches long for each breadth, 11&nbsp;inches at the time). In the early 18th century, the breadth of cloth had been reduced to 10&nbsp;inches, so the flags became 5:9. In 1837, the breadth was reduced for the final time to 9&nbsp;inches, giving the current ratio of 1:2.\n\nThroughout this period in the history of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign was one of three ensigns in use, with each one being assigned to one of the three [[Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy|squadrons]] of the navy, according to its colour (red, white and blue, with red being the most senior and blue the least). Ships flew the colour of ensign corresponding to the squadron to which they were attached, which was in turn determined by the seniority of the admiral under whose command the ship sailed (a rear admiral of the red was senior to a rear admiral of the white).\n\nIn 1864 the Admiralty decided to end the ambiguity caused by the Red Ensign being both a [[civil ensign]] and a naval ensign, and the White Ensign was reserved to the [[Royal Navy]]; the relevant [[Order in Council]] retained the option to use Red or Blue Ensigns in HM Ships if desired.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Tudor Ensign 1485-1603.svg|Tudor Ensign<br>1485\u20131603\n|Stuart Royal Navy Squadron Ensign of 1620.svg|Stuart Royal Navy Squadron Ensign<br>1620\n|English White Ensign 1620.svg|English White Ensign<br>1630\u20131707\n}}\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|White Squadron Ensign 1702-1707.svg|White Squadron Ensign<br>1702\u20131707\n|British-White-Ensign-1707.svg|British White Ensign<br>1707\u20131800\n}}\n\n==Current use==\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:White Ensign Church.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Ensign flying from [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in [[Trafalgar Square]], London.]]\nRoyal Navy ships and submarines wear the White Ensign at all times when underway on the surface.

In 1965, with the adoption of the Maple Leaf [[Canadian flag]], Canada stopped using the White Ensign on its naval vessels in favour of the new flag. Following a reorganisation of the Canadian armed forces in 1968, a new \"white ensign\" was adopted, incorporating the Canadian flag in the canton and a badge in the fly. This flag, however, was until 2013 not used as the ensign, but as the jack, and also as the basis of the queen's colours of the Royal Canadian Navy. In May 2013 the Canadian \"white ensign\" became the ensign and the national flag the jack. Many Canadian veterans' organisations still use the original White and Blue Ensigns unofficially as symbols of history and heritage.\n\nDuring Australia's involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], the RAN modified the White Ensign (1967) to create a uniquely Australian ensign which would avoid any confusion with UK vessels; Britain was not involved in the conflict.  New Zealand followed suit in 1968.  The modified RAN and RNZN White Ensigns incorporate the Union Flag in the first quarter, but with the [[Southern Cross]] designs from each national flag (blue stars for the RAN and red stars for the RNZN) replacing St. George's Cross.\n\nSeveral other Commonwealth navies also use naval ensigns with a visual connection to the White Ensign. For example, the Indian Navy and the [[South African Navy]] have both retained a cross on a white field, with their own national flag in the canton, in place of the Union Flag. The Royal Indian Marine (Royal Indian Navy from 1934) used the unaltered White Ensign as its ensign from 1928 until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth. After that date, the RIN became the Indian Navy and the Union Jack in the canton was replaced with the Indian Tricolour. Apart from a brief period from 2001\u20132004, the Indian Navy has retained its variant of the White Ensign with one minor modification: the addition of the [[Lion Capital of Asoka]] crest in gold at the centre of the cross. Effective from 15 August 2014, the Indian national motto ''\"Satyameva Jayate\"'' (\"Truth Alone Triumphs\") is also added in gold script below the crest, correcting a long-standing omission.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indian-navy-correct-anomaly-satyameva-jayate-pranab-mukherjee-aamir-khan/1/375586.html | title =Indian Navy to finally include Satyameva Jayata below national emblem on its flag and crest | publisher = IndiaToday| date = 8 August 2014 | accessdate = 8 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!Flag\n!Name\n!Country\n!Use\n|-\n| {{ListFlag|Naval Ensign of Australia.svg|100px}}\n| [[Royal Australian Navy Ensign]]\n| [[Australia]]\n| [[Royal Australian Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of the Bahamas.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Bahamas Naval Ensign]]\n| [[The Bahamas]]\n| [[Royal Bahamas Defence Force]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Bangladesh.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Naval Ensign of Bangladesh]]\n| [[Bangladesh]]\n| [[Bangladesh Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Barbados.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Barbados Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Barbados]]\n| [[Barbados Coast Guard]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Canada.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Canadian Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Canada]]\n| [[Canadian Forces]]<!--Not only RCN; other commands within CF use it-->\n|- \n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Fiji.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Fijian Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Fiji]]\n| [[Republic of Fiji Military Forces]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Ghana.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Naval Ensign of Ghana]]\n| [[Ghana]]\n| [[Ghana Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of India.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Indian Naval Ensign]]\n| [[India]]\n| [[Indian Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Jamaica.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Jamaican Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Jamaica]]\n| [[Military of Jamaica]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Kenya.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Naval Ensign of Kenya]]\n| [[Kenya]]\n| [[Kenyan Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Malaysia.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Malaysian Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Malaysia]]\n| [[Royal Malaysian Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of New Zealand.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Royal New Zealand Navy Ensign]]\n| [[New Zealand]]\n| [[Royal New Zealand Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Nigeria.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Nigerian Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Nigeria]]\n| [[Nigerian Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Papua New Guinea.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Papua New Guinea Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Papua New Guinea]]\n| [[Papua New Guinea Defence Force]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Singapore.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Singapore Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Singapore]]\n| [[Republic of Singapore Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of South Africa.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[South African Naval Ensign]]\n| [[South Africa]]\n| [[South African Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Sri Lanka.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Sri Lanka Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Sri Lanka]]\n| [[Sri Lanka Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Tonga.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Tonga Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Tonga]]\n| [[Tongan Maritime Force]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Vanuatu.svg|100px|border]]\n| [[Flag of Vanuatu|Vanuatu Naval Ensign]]\n| [[Vanuatu]]\n| [[Vanuatu Mobile Forces]]\n|}\n\n=== Other former British colonies ===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!Flag\n!Name\n!Country\n!Use\n|-\n| {{ListFlag|Naval Ensign of Myanmar.svg|100px|border}} \n| [[Naval Ensign of Myanmar]]\n| [[Myanmar]]\n| [[Myanmar Navy]]\n|-\n| [[File:Naval Ensign of Sudan.svg|100px|border]] \n| [[Naval Ensign of Sudan]]\n| [[Sudan]]\n| [[Sudanese Navy]]\n|-\n|}\n\n=== United States ===\n[[File:USS Winston S.

Yachts of the [[Royal Irish Yacht Club]] fly a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the [[Heraldic Badge of Ireland]]. The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]] and the Commissioners' flag of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] place the Union emblem in the first quarter of a white field, omitting the overall red St George's Cross, but are not ensigns for use at sea.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|320px|Striped ensigns flying on English and Spanish galleons in 1588: (enlarge image for detailed view)]]\n[[File:48 NATO fleet entering Stavanger Norway April 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Ensign flying from a Royal Navy vessel.]]\n[[File:Royal Marine, 1914.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Royal Marine]] holding up the White Ensign aboard {{HMS|Pegasus|1897|6}}, during the [[Battle of Zanzibar]] (20 September 1914).]]\n\nEnglish naval ensigns were first used during the 16th century, and were often striped in green and white (the Tudor colours), but other colours were also used to indicate different squadrons, including blue, red and tawny brown. (These striped ensigns can be seen in use on both English and Spanish warships in contemporary paintings of the 1588 [[Spanish Armada]] battles). Later, there was usually a St George's Cross in the upper canton, or sewn across the field as on the modern White Ensign. These striped ensigns continued in use under the Stuart kings: the Naval ensign of 1623 is described as having \"15 horizontal stripes alternately blue, white and yellow with a Cross of St George in the canton\". This design fell out of use after 1630, with the introduction of the Red, White and Blue ensigns. The use of stripes continued in the red and white of both the [[East India Company|flag of the Honourable East India Company]], adopted in 1600, and of the 1775 [[Grand Union Flag]] that formed the basis for the modern [[flag of the United States of America]], and the red, white and blue striped ensign that serves as the [[flag of Hawaii]].\n\nThe first recognisable White Ensign appears to have been in use during the 16th century, consisting of a white field with a broad St George's cross, and a second St. George's cross in the canton. By 1630 the white ensign consisted of simply a white field, with a small St George's cross in the canton, which was consistent with the red and blue ensigns of the time. In 1707, the St. George's cross was reintroduced to the flag as a whole, though not as broad as before, and the [[Union Flag]] was placed in the canton. There was also a version of this flag without the overall St George's cross, which appears to have been for use in home waters only, though this flag appears to have fallen out of use by 1720. In 1801, after the [[Act of Union 1800]], the flag was updated to include the new Union Flag in the canton, and so took on the form as used today. The blue field of the Union Flag was darkened at this time at the request of the [[Admiralty]], in the hope that the new flags would not require replacing as often as the previous design, due to fading of the blue. Throughout this period, the proportions of the flags changed. In 1687, the then [[Secretary of the Admiralty]], [[Samuel Pepys]], instructed that flags be of the ratio 11:18 (18&nbsp;inches long for each breadth, 11&nbsp;inches at the time). In the early 18th century, the breadth of cloth had been reduced to 10&nbsp;inches, so the flags became 5:9. In 1837, the breadth was reduced for the final time to 9&nbsp;inches, giving the current ratio of 1:2.\n\nThroughout this period in the history of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign was one of three ensigns in use, with each one being assigned to one of the three [[Coloured squadrons of the Royal Navy|squadrons]] of the navy, according to its colour (red, white and blue, with red being the most senior and blue the least). Ships flew the colour of ensign corresponding to the squadron to which they were attached, which was in turn determined by the seniority of the admiral under whose command the ship sailed (a rear admiral of the red was senior to a rear admiral of the white).\n\nIn 1864 the Admiralty decided to end the ambiguity caused by the Red Ensign being both a [[civil ensign]] and a naval ensign, and the White Ensign was reserved to the [[Royal Navy]]; the relevant [[Order in Council]] retained the option to use Red or Blue Ensigns in HM Ships if desired.\n\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|Tudor Ensign 1485-1603.svg|Tudor Ensign<br>1485\u20131603\n|Stuart Royal Navy Squadron Ensign of 1620.svg|Stuart Royal Navy Squadron Ensign<br>1620\n|English White Ensign 1620.svg|English White Ensign<br>1630\u20131707\n}}\n{{gallery|mode=nolines|whitebg=y|height=100\n|White Squadron Ensign 1702-1707.svg|White Squadron Ensign<br>1702\u20131707\n|British-White-Ensign-1707.svg|British White Ensign<br>1707\u20131800\n}}\n\n==Current use==\n\n===United Kingdom===\n[[File:White Ensign Church.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Ensign flying from [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] church in [[Trafalgar Square]], London.]]\nRoyal Navy ships and submarines wear the White Ensign at all times when underway on the surface.
