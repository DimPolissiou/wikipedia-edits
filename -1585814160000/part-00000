By construction, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is the union of open simplices corresponding to all markings on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>. Note that two open simplices in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> either are disjoint or coincide.\n\n====Closed simplices====\nLet ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 where \u0393 is a marking and let ''k'' be the number of topological edges in \u0393. As before, we order the edges of \u0393 as ''e''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''e''<sub>''k''</sub>. Define \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2286 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup> as the set of all ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>) \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>, such that <math>\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i=1</math>, such that each ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 0 and such that the set of all edges ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''<math>\\Gamma</math>'' with ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 is a subforest in \u0393.\n\nThe map ''j'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> extends to a map ''h'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> as follows. For ''x'' in \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> put ''h''(''x'') = ''j''(''x''). For ''x'' \u2208 \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; &minus; \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> the point ''h''(''x'') of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is obtained by taking the marking ''f'', contracting all edges ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''<math>\\Gamma</math>'' with ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 to obtain a new marking ''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393<sub>1</sub> and then assigning to each surviving edge ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of \u0393<sub>1</sub> length ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> > 0.\n\nIt can be shown that for every marking ''f'' the map ''h'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is still injective. The image of ''h'' is called the ''closed simplex'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> corresponding to ''f'' and is denoted by ''S''&prime;(''f''). Every point in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> belongs to only finitely many closed simplices and a point of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> represented by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 where the graph \u0393 is tri-valent belongs to a unique closed simplex in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, namely ''S''&prime;(''f'').\n\nThe '''weak topology''' on the Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is defined by saying that a subset ''C'' of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is closed if and only if for every marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 the set ''h''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''C'') is closed in \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime;. In particular, the map ''h'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is a [[topological embedding]].\n\n===Points of Outer space as actions on trees===\nLet ''x'' be a point in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> given by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with a volume-one metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393. Let ''T'' be the [[universal cover]] of \u0393. Thus ''T'' is a simply connected graph, that is ''T'' is a topological tree. We can also lift the metric structure ''L'' to ''T'' by giving every edge of ''T'' the same length as the length of its image in \u0393. This turns ''T'' into a [[metric space]] (''T'',''d'') which is a [[real tree]]. The fundamental group {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(\u0393) acts on ''T'' by [[covering transformation]]s which are also isometries of (''T'',''d''), with the quotient space ''T''/{{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(\u0393) = \u0393. Since the [[induced homomorphism]] ''f''<sub>#</sub> is an isomorphism between ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''R''<sub>''n''</sub>) and {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(\u0393), we also obtain an isometric action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on ''T'' with ''T''/''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = \u0393. This action is free and [[discontinuous action|discrete]]. Since \u0393 is a finite connected graph with no degree-one vertices, this action is also ''minimal'', meaning that ''T'' has no proper ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-invariant subtrees.\n\nMoreover, every minimal free and discrete isometric action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on a real tree with the quotient being a metric graph of volume one arises in this fashion from some point ''x'' of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. This defines a bijective correspondence between ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> and the set of equivalence classes of minimal free and discrete isometric actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on a [[real tree]]s with volume-one quotients. Here two such actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on real trees ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are ''equivalent'' if there exists an ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-equivariant isometry between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n====Length functions====\nGive an action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on a real tree ''T'' as above, one can define the ''translation length function'' associate with this action:\n:<math>\\ell_T: F_n \\to \\mathbb R, \\quad \\ell_T(g)=\\min_{t\\in T} d(t,gt), \\quad\\text{ for } g\\in F_n. </math>\nFor ''g'' \u2260 1 there is a (unique) isometrically embedded copy of '''R''' in ''T'', called the ''axis'' of ''g'', such that ''g'' acts on this axis by a translation of magnitude <math>\\ell_T(g)>0</math>. For this reason <math>\\ell_T(g)</math> is called the ''translation length'' of ''g''. For any ''g'', ''u'' in ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> we have <math>\\ell_T(ugu^{-1})=\\ell_T(g)</math>, that is the function <math>\\ell_T</math> is constant on each [[conjugacy class]] in ''G''.\n\nIn the marked metric graph model of Outer space translation length functions can be interpreted as follows. Let ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> be represented by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with a volume-one metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393. Let ''g'' \u2208 ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''R''<sub>''n''</sub>). First push ''g'' forward via ''f''<sub>#</sub> to get a closed loop in \u0393 and then tighten this loop to an immersed circuit in \u0393. The ''L''-length of this circuit is the translation length <math>\\ell_T(g)</math> of ''g''.\n\nA basic general fact from the theory of group actions on real trees says that a point of the Outer space is uniquely determined by its translation length function. Namely if two trees with minimal free isometric actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> define equal translation length functions on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> then the two trees are ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-equivariantly isometric. Hence the map <math> T\\mapsto \\ell_T</math> from ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> to the set of '''R'''-valued functions on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> is injective.\n\nOne defines the '''length function topology''' or '''axes topology''' on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> as follows. For every ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, every finite subset ''K'' of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and every ''\u03b5'' > 0 let\n:<math> V_T(K,\\epsilon)= \\{ T'\\in X_n: |\\ell_T(g)-\\ell_{T'}(g)| < \\epsilon \\text{ for every } g\\in K\\}. </math>\nIn the length function topology for every ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> a basis of neighborhoods of ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by the family ''V''<sub>''T''</sub>(''K'', ''\u03b5'') where ''K'' is a finite subset of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and where ''\u03b5'' > 0.\n\nConvergence of sequences in the length function topology can be characterized as follows. For ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> and a sequence ''T''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> we have <math>\\lim_{i\\to\\infty} T_i =T</math> if and only if for every ''g'' in ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> we have <math> \\lim_{i\\to\\infty} \\ell_{T_i}(g)=\\ell_T(g)</math>.\n\n===Gromov topology===\nAnother topology on <math>X_n</math> is the so-called ''Gromov topology'' or the ''equivariant Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence topology'', which provides a version of [[Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence]] adapted to the setting of an isometric group action.\n\nWhen defining the Gromov topology, one should think of points of <math>X_n</math> as actions of <math>F_n</math> on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees.\nInformally, given a tree <math> T\\in X_n</math>, another tree <math>T'\\in X_n</math> is \"close\" to <math>T</math> in the Gromov topology, if for some large finite subtrees of <math> Y\\subseteq T, Y'\\subseteq T'\\in X_n</math> and a large finite subset <math>B\\subseteq F_n</math> there exists an \"almost isometry\" between <math>Y'</math> and <math>Y</math> with respect to which the (partial) actions of <math>B</math> on <math>Y'</math> and <math>Y</math> almost agree. For the formal definition of the Gromov topology see.<ref name=Paulin>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Paulin, ''The Gromov topology on '''R'''-trees''.

''[[Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics]]'' '''1''' (2007), no. 2, 135\u2013181.</ref>\n\n==Action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on Outer space==\nThe group [[Out(Fn)|Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)]] admits a natural right [[group action (mathematics)|action]] by [[homeomorphism]]s on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nFirst we define the action of the [[automorphism group]] Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. Let ''\u03b1'' \u2208 Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) be an automorphism of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>. \nLet ''x'' be a point of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> given by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with a volume-one metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393. Let ''\u03c4'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> be a homotopy equivalence whose [[induced homomorphism]] at the [[fundamental group]] level is the automorphism ''\u03b1'' of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''R''<sub>''n''</sub>). The element ''x\u03b1'' of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by the marking ''f'' o ''\u03c4'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with the metric structure ''L'' on \u0393. That is, to get ''x'' ''\u03b1'' from ''x'' we simply precompose the marking defining ''x'' with ''\u03c4''.\n\nIn the real tree model this action can be described as follows. Let ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> be a real tree with a minimal free and discrete co-volume-one isometric action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>. Let ''\u03b1'' \u2208 Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>). As a metric space, ''T\u03b1'' is equal to ''T''. The action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> is twisted by ''\u03b1''. Namely, for any ''t'' in ''T'' and ''g'' in ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> we have:\n:<math> g\\underset{T\\alpha}{\\cdot} t= \\alpha(g) \\underset{T}{\\cdot} t.</math>\n\nAt the level of translation length functions the tree ''T\u03b1'' is given as:\n:<math>\\ell_{T\\alpha}(g)=\\ell_T(\\alpha(g)) \\quad \\text{ for } g\\in F_n.</math>\n\nOne then checks that for the above action of Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> the subgroup of [[inner automorphism]]s Inn(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is contained in the kernel of this action, that is every inner automorphism acts trivially on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. It follows that the action of Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> quotients through to an action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) = Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)/Inn(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. namely, if ''\u03c6'' \u2208 Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is an outer automorphism of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and if ''\u03b1'' in Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is an actual automorphism representing ''\u03c6'' then for any ''x'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> we have ''x\u03c6'' = ''x\u03b1''.\n\nThe right action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> can be turned into a left action via a standard conversion procedure. Namely, for ''\u03c6'' \u2208 Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) and ''x'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> set\n:''\u03c6'' ''x'' = ''x'' ''\u03c6''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.\n\nThis left action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is also sometimes considered in the literature although most sources work with the right action.\n\n===Moduli space===\nThe quotient space ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>/Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is the '''moduli space''' which consists of isometry types of finite connected graphs \u0393 without degree-one and degree-two vertices, with [[fundamental group]]s isomorphic to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> (that is, with the first [[Betti number]] equal to ''n'') equipped with volume-one metric structures. The quotient topology on ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> is the same as that given by the [[Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence|Gromov\u2013Hausdorff distance]] between metric graphs representing points of ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>. The moduli space ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> is not [[compact space|compact]] and the \"cusps\" in ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> arise from decreasing towards zero lengths of edges for homotopically nontrivial subgraphs (e.g. an essential circuit) of a metric graph \u0393.\n\n==Basic properties and facts about Outer space==\n* Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[contractible space|contractible]] and the action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuous]], as was proved by Culler and [[Karen Vogtmann|Vogtmann]] in their original 1986 paper<ref name=CV86/> where Outer space was introduced. \n* The space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> has [[topological dimension]] 3''n'' &minus; 4. The reason is that if \u0393 is a finite connected graph without degree-one and degree-two vertices with [[fundamental group]] isomorphic to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>, then \u0393 has at most 3''n'' &minus; 3 edges and it has exactly 3''n'' &minus; 3 edges when \u0393 is trivalent. Hence the top-dimensional open simplex in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> has dimension 3''n'' &minus; 4.\n* Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> contains a specific [[deformation retract]] ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, called the '''spine''' of Outer space. The spine ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> has dimension 2''n'' &minus; 3, is Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)-invariant and has compact quotient under the action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\n==Unprojectivized Outer space==\nThe ''unprojectivized Outer space'' <math>cv_n </math> consists of equivalence classes of all marked metric graph structures on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> where the volume of the metric graph in the marking is allowed to be any positive real number. The space <math>cv_n </math> can also be thought of as the set of all free minimal discrete isometric actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on '''R'''-trees, considered up to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-equivariant isometry. The unprojectivized Outer space inherits the same structures that <math>X_n</math> has, including the coincidence of the three topologies (Gromov, axes, weak), and an <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math>-action. In addition, there is a natural action of <math>\\mathbb R_{>0}</math> on <math>cv_n </math> by scalar multiplication.\n\nTopologically, <math>cv_n </math> is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to <math>X_n\\times (0,\\infty)</math>. In particular, <math>cv_n </math> is also contractible.\n\n==Projectivized Outer space==\nThe projectivized Outer space is the quotient space <math>CV_n:=cv_n/\\mathbb R_{>0}</math> under the action of <math>\\mathbb R_{>0}</math> on <math>cv_n </math> by scalar multiplication. The space <math>CV_n</math> is equipped with the quotient topology. For a tree <math>T\\in cv_n</math> its projective equivalence class is denoted <math>[T]=\\{cT|c>0\\}\\subseteq cv_n</math>. The action of <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math> on <math>cv_n</math> naturally quotients through to the action of <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math> on <math>CV_n</math>. Namely, for <math>\\phi\\in \\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math> and <math>T\\in cv_n</math> put <math>[T]\\phi:= [T\\phi]</math>.\n\nA key observation is that the map <math> X_n\\to CV_n, T\\mapsto [T]</math> is an <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math>-equivariant homeomorphism. For this reason the spaces <math>X_n</math> and <math>CV_n</math> are often identified.\n\n==Lipschitz distance==\n<!--[[Lipschitz distance]] redirects to this section.\n-->The Lipschitz distance,<ref name=\"FM08\">{{cite journal | last = Francaviglia| first = Stefano | last2 = Martino| first2=Armando | title = Metric properties of Outer Space |journal=[[Publicacions Matem\u00e0tiques]] | date=2011 | arxiv = 0803.0640v2 }}</ref> named for [[Rudolf Lipschitz]], for Outer space corresponds to the Thurston metric in Teichm\u00fcller space.

Let\n:<math>\\Delta_k=\\left\\{ (x_1,\\dots, x_k)\\in \\mathbb R^k \\,\\Big|\\, \\sum_{i=1}^k x_i =1, x_i >0 \\text{ for } i=1,\\dots, k\\right\\} </math>\nbe the standard (''k'' &minus; 1)-dimensional open simplex in '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>.\n\nGiven ''f'', there is a natural map ''j'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, where for ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>) \u2208 \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>, the point ''j''(''x'') of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by the marking ''f'' together with the metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393 such that ''L''(''e''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1,...,''k''.\n\nOne can show that ''j'' is in fact an injective map, that is, distinct points of \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> correspond to non-equivalent marked metric graph structures on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nThe set ''j''(\u0394<sub>''k''</sub>) is called ''open simplex'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> corresponding to ''f'' and is denoted ''S''(''f''). By construction, ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is the union of open simplices corresponding to all markings on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>. Note that two open simplices in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> either are disjoint or coincide.\n\n====Closed simplices====\nLet ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 where \u0393 is a marking and let ''k'' be the number of topological edges in \u0393. As before, we order the edges of \u0393 as ''e''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''e''<sub>''k''</sub>. Define \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2286 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup> as the set of all ''x'' = (''x''<sub>1</sub>,..., ''x''<sub>''k''</sub>) \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''k''</sup>, such that <math>\\sum_{i=1}^k x_i=1</math>, such that each ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> \u2265 0 and such that the set of all edges ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''<math>\\Gamma</math>'' with ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 is a subforest in \u0393.\n\nThe map ''j'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> extends to a map ''h'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> as follows. For ''x'' in \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> put ''h''(''x'') = ''j''(''x''). For ''x'' \u2208 \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; &minus; \u0394<sub>''k''</sub> the point ''h''(''x'') of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is obtained by taking the marking ''f'', contracting all edges ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of ''<math>\\Gamma</math>'' with ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> = 0 to obtain a new marking ''f''<sub>1</sub> : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393<sub>1</sub> and then assigning to each surviving edge ''e''<sub>''i''</sub> of \u0393<sub>1</sub> length ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> > 0.\n\nIt can be shown that for every marking ''f'' the map ''h'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is still injective. The image of ''h'' is called the ''closed simplex'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> corresponding to ''f'' and is denoted by ''S''&prime;(''f''). Every point in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> belongs to only finitely many closed simplices and a point of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> represented by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 where the graph \u0393 is tri-valent belongs to a unique closed simplex in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, namely ''S''&prime;(''f'').\n\nThe '''weak topology''' on the Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is defined by saying that a subset ''C'' of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is closed if and only if for every marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 the set ''h''<sup>&minus;1</sup>(''C'') is closed in \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime;. In particular, the map ''h'' : \u0394<sub>''k''</sub>&prime; \u2192 ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is a [[topological embedding]].\n\n===Points of Outer space as actions on trees===\nLet ''x'' be a point in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> given by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with a volume-one metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393. Let ''T'' be the [[universal cover]] of \u0393. Thus ''T'' is a simply connected graph, that is ''T'' is a topological tree. We can also lift the metric structure ''L'' to ''T'' by giving every edge of ''T'' the same length as the length of its image in \u0393. This turns ''T'' into a [[metric space]] (''T'',''d'') which is a [[real tree]]. The fundamental group {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(\u0393) acts on ''T'' by [[covering transformation]]s which are also isometries of (''T'',''d''), with the quotient space ''T''/{{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(\u0393) = \u0393. Since the [[induced homomorphism]] ''f''<sub>#</sub> is an isomorphism between ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''R''<sub>''n''</sub>) and {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(\u0393), we also obtain an isometric action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on ''T'' with ''T''/''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = \u0393. This action is free and [[discontinuous action|discrete]]. Since \u0393 is a finite connected graph with no degree-one vertices, this action is also ''minimal'', meaning that ''T'' has no proper ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-invariant subtrees.\n\nMoreover, every minimal free and discrete isometric action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on a real tree with the quotient being a metric graph of volume one arises in this fashion from some point ''x'' of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. This defines a bijective correspondence between ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> and the set of equivalence classes of minimal free and discrete isometric actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on a [[real tree]]s with volume-one quotients. Here two such actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on real trees ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub> are ''equivalent'' if there exists an ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-equivariant isometry between ''T''<sub>1</sub> and ''T''<sub>2</sub>.\n\n====Length functions====\nGive an action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on a real tree ''T'' as above, one can define the ''translation length function'' associate with this action:\n:<math>\\ell_T: F_n \\to \\mathbb R, \\quad \\ell_T(g)=\\min_{t\\in T} d(t,gt), \\quad\\text{ for } g\\in F_n. </math>\nFor ''g'' \u2260 1 there is a (unique) isometrically embedded copy of '''R''' in ''T'', called the ''axis'' of ''g'', such that ''g'' acts on this axis by a translation of magnitude <math>\\ell_T(g)>0</math>. For this reason <math>\\ell_T(g)</math> is called the ''translation length'' of ''g''. For any ''g'', ''u'' in ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> we have <math>\\ell_T(ugu^{-1})=\\ell_T(g)</math>, that is the function <math>\\ell_T</math> is constant on each [[conjugacy class]] in ''G''.\n\nIn the marked metric graph model of Outer space translation length functions can be interpreted as follows. Let ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> be represented by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with a volume-one metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393. Let ''g'' \u2208 ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''R''<sub>''n''</sub>). First push ''g'' forward via ''f''<sub>#</sub> to get a closed loop in \u0393 and then tighten this loop to an immersed circuit in \u0393. The ''L''-length of this circuit is the translation length <math>\\ell_T(g)</math> of ''g''.\n\nA basic general fact from the theory of group actions on real trees says that a point of the Outer space is uniquely determined by its translation length function. Namely if two trees with minimal free isometric actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> define equal translation length functions on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> then the two trees are ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-equivariantly isometric. Hence the map <math> T\\mapsto \\ell_T</math> from ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> to the set of '''R'''-valued functions on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> is injective.\n\nOne defines the '''length function topology''' or '''axes topology''' on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> as follows. For every ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, every finite subset ''K'' of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and every ''\u03b5'' > 0 let\n:<math> V_T(K,\\epsilon)= \\{ T'\\in X_n: |\\ell_T(g)-\\ell_{T'}(g)| < \\epsilon \\text{ for every } g\\in K\\}. </math>\nIn the length function topology for every ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> a basis of neighborhoods of ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by the family ''V''<sub>''T''</sub>(''K'', ''\u03b5'') where ''K'' is a finite subset of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and where ''\u03b5'' > 0.\n\nConvergence of sequences in the length function topology can be characterized as follows. For ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> and a sequence ''T''<sub>''i''</sub> in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> we have <math>\\lim_{i\\to\\infty} T_i =T</math> if and only if for every ''g'' in ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> we have <math> \\lim_{i\\to\\infty} \\ell_{T_i}(g)=\\ell_T(g)</math>.\n\n===Gromov topology===\nAnother topology on <math>X_n</math> is the so-called ''Gromov topology'' or the ''equivariant Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence topology'', which provides a version of [[Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence]] adapted to the setting of an isometric group action.\n\nWhen defining the Gromov topology, one should think of points of <math>X_n</math> as actions of <math>F_n</math> on <math>\\mathbb R</math>-trees.\nInformally, given a tree <math> T\\in X_n</math>, another tree <math>T'\\in X_n</math> is \"close\" to <math>T</math> in the Gromov topology, if for some large finite subtrees of <math> Y\\subseteq T, Y'\\subseteq T'\\in X_n</math> and a large finite subset <math>B\\subseteq F_n</math> there exists an \"almost isometry\" between <math>Y'</math> and <math>Y</math> with respect to which the (partial) actions of <math>B</math> on <math>Y'</math> and <math>Y</math> almost agree. For the formal definition of the Gromov topology see.<ref name=Paulin>Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Paulin, ''The Gromov topology on '''R'''-trees''. ''[[Topology and its Applications]]'' '''32''' (1989), no. 3, 197\u2013221.</ref>\n\n====Coincidence of the weak, the length function and Gromov topologies====\nAn important basic result states that the Gromov topology, the weak topology and the length function topology on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> coincide.<ref name=GL07>Vincent Guirardel, Gilbert Levitt, ''Deformation spaces of trees''. ''[[Groups, Geometry, and Dynamics]]'' '''1''' (2007), no. 2, 135\u2013181.</ref>\n\n==Action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on Outer space==\nThe group [[Out(Fn)|Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)]] admits a natural right [[group action (mathematics)|action]] by [[homeomorphism]]s on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>.\n\nFirst we define the action of the [[automorphism group]] Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. Let ''\u03b1'' \u2208 Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) be an automorphism of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>. \nLet ''x'' be a point of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> given by a marking ''f'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with a volume-one metric graph structure ''L'' on \u0393. Let ''\u03c4'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> be a homotopy equivalence whose [[induced homomorphism]] at the [[fundamental group]] level is the automorphism ''\u03b1'' of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> = {{pi}}<sub>1</sub>(''R''<sub>''n''</sub>). The element ''x\u03b1'' of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is given by the marking ''f'' o ''\u03c4'' : ''R''<sub>''n''</sub> \u2192 \u0393 with the metric structure ''L'' on \u0393. That is, to get ''x'' ''\u03b1'' from ''x'' we simply precompose the marking defining ''x'' with ''\u03c4''.\n\nIn the real tree model this action can be described as follows. Let ''T'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> be a real tree with a minimal free and discrete co-volume-one isometric action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>. Let ''\u03b1'' \u2208 Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>). As a metric space, ''T\u03b1'' is equal to ''T''. The action of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> is twisted by ''\u03b1''. Namely, for any ''t'' in ''T'' and ''g'' in ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> we have:\n:<math> g\\underset{T\\alpha}{\\cdot} t= \\alpha(g) \\underset{T}{\\cdot} t.</math>\n\nAt the level of translation length functions the tree ''T\u03b1'' is given as:\n:<math>\\ell_{T\\alpha}(g)=\\ell_T(\\alpha(g)) \\quad \\text{ for } g\\in F_n.</math>\n\nOne then checks that for the above action of Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> the subgroup of [[inner automorphism]]s Inn(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is contained in the kernel of this action, that is every inner automorphism acts trivially on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. It follows that the action of Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> quotients through to an action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) = Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)/Inn(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>. namely, if ''\u03c6'' \u2208 Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is an outer automorphism of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> and if ''\u03b1'' in Aut(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is an actual automorphism representing ''\u03c6'' then for any ''x'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> we have ''x\u03c6'' = ''x\u03b1''.\n\nThe right action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> can be turned into a left action via a standard conversion procedure. Namely, for ''\u03c6'' \u2208 Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) and ''x'' in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> set\n:''\u03c6'' ''x'' = ''x'' ''\u03c6''<sup>&minus;1</sup>.\n\nThis left action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is also sometimes considered in the literature although most sources work with the right action.\n\n===Moduli space===\nThe quotient space ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> = ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>/Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) is the '''moduli space''' which consists of isometry types of finite connected graphs \u0393 without degree-one and degree-two vertices, with [[fundamental group]]s isomorphic to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> (that is, with the first [[Betti number]] equal to ''n'') equipped with volume-one metric structures. The quotient topology on ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> is the same as that given by the [[Gromov\u2013Hausdorff convergence|Gromov\u2013Hausdorff distance]] between metric graphs representing points of ''M''<sub>''n''</sub>. The moduli space ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> is not [[compact space|compact]] and the \"cusps\" in ''M''<sub>''n''</sub> arise from decreasing towards zero lengths of edges for homotopically nontrivial subgraphs (e.g. an essential circuit) of a metric graph \u0393.\n\n==Basic properties and facts about Outer space==\n* Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[contractible space|contractible]] and the action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>) on ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> is [[properly discontinuous action|properly discontinuous]], as was proved by Culler and [[Karen Vogtmann|Vogtmann]] in their original 1986 paper<ref name=CV86/> where Outer space was introduced. \n* The space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> has [[topological dimension]] 3''n'' &minus; 4. The reason is that if \u0393 is a finite connected graph without degree-one and degree-two vertices with [[fundamental group]] isomorphic to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>, then \u0393 has at most 3''n'' &minus; 3 edges and it has exactly 3''n'' &minus; 3 edges when \u0393 is trivalent. Hence the top-dimensional open simplex in ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> has dimension 3''n'' &minus; 4.\n* Outer space ''X''<sub>''n''</sub> contains a specific [[deformation retract]] ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> of ''X''<sub>''n''</sub>, called the '''spine''' of Outer space. The spine ''K''<sub>''n''</sub> has dimension 2''n'' &minus; 3, is Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>)-invariant and has compact quotient under the action of Out(''F''<sub>''n''</sub>).\n\n==Unprojectivized Outer space==\nThe ''unprojectivized Outer space'' <math>cv_n </math> consists of equivalence classes of all marked metric graph structures on ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> where the volume of the metric graph in the marking is allowed to be any positive real number. The space <math>cv_n </math> can also be thought of as the set of all free minimal discrete isometric actions of ''F''<sub>''n''</sub> on '''R'''-trees, considered up to ''F''<sub>''n''</sub>-equivariant isometry. The unprojectivized Outer space inherits the same structures that <math>X_n</math> has, including the coincidence of the three topologies (Gromov, axes, weak), and an <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math>-action. In addition, there is a natural action of <math>\\mathbb R_{>0}</math> on <math>cv_n </math> by scalar multiplication.\n\nTopologically, <math>cv_n </math> is [[homeomorphism|homeomorphic]] to <math>X_n\\times (0,\\infty)</math>. In particular, <math>cv_n </math> is also contractible.\n\n==Projectivized Outer space==\nThe projectivized Outer space is the quotient space <math>CV_n:=cv_n/\\mathbb R_{>0}</math> under the action of <math>\\mathbb R_{>0}</math> on <math>cv_n </math> by scalar multiplication. The space <math>CV_n</math> is equipped with the quotient topology. For a tree <math>T\\in cv_n</math> its projective equivalence class is denoted <math>[T]=\\{cT|c>0\\}\\subseteq cv_n</math>. The action of <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math> on <math>cv_n</math> naturally quotients through to the action of <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math> on <math>CV_n</math>. Namely, for <math>\\phi\\in \\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math> and <math>T\\in cv_n</math> put <math>[T]\\phi:= [T\\phi]</math>.\n\nA key observation is that the map <math> X_n\\to CV_n, T\\mapsto [T]</math> is an <math>\\operatorname{Out}(F_n)</math>-equivariant homeomorphism. For this reason the spaces <math>X_n</math> and <math>CV_n</math> are often identified.\n\n==Lipschitz distance==\n<!--[[Lipschitz distance]] redirects to this section.\n-->The Lipschitz distance,<ref name=\"FM08\">{{cite journal | last = Francaviglia| first = Stefano | last2 = Martino| first2=Armando | title = Metric properties of Outer Space |journal=[[Publicacions Matem\u00e0tiques]] | date=2011 | arxiv = 0803.0640v2 }}</ref> named for [[Rudolf Lipschitz]], for Outer space corresponds to the Thurston metric in Teichm\u00fcller space.

Dude\u0219tii Vechi is mostly populated by [[Banat Bulgarians]] (Pal\u0107ene), a regional minority group of ethnic [[Bulgarians]] that profess [[Roman Catholicism]], who came from northern [[Bulgaria]], and who are descendants of [[Paulicians]] that settled in the area around 1738. At the 2011 census, the total population of the commune numbered 4203 people.\n\n==Name==\nUntil 1968, it was known as ''Be\u0219enova Veche''.

It also included [[V\u0103lcani]] village until 2005, when it was split off to form a separate commune.\n\nColonia Bulgar\u0103 ([[Banat Bulgarian language|Banat Bulgarian]]: ''Telepa'', {{lang-de|Bulgarische Kolonie}}, {{lang-hu|Bolgartelep}}) was founded as ''Telepa'' by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Banat Bulgarians|Banat Bulgarian]] colonists in 1846.

It is the oldest school of the Bulgarian diaspora and the only school in Romania where Bulgarian language is taught to all grades. {{As of|2004}}, education in Bulgarian was optional, but efforts were made to transform the school into a [[bilingual]] one.

Dude\u0219tii Vechi is mostly populated by [[Banat Bulgarians]] (Pal\u0107ene), a regional minority group of ethnic [[Bulgarians]] that profess [[Roman Catholicism]], who came from northern [[Bulgaria]], and who are descendants of [[Paulicians]] that settled in the area around 1738. At the 2011 census, the total population of the commune numbered 4203 people.\n\n==Name==\nUntil 1968, it was known as ''Be\u0219enova Veche''.

It also included [[V\u0103lcani]] village until 2005, when it was split off to form a separate commune.\n\nColonia Bulgar\u0103 ([[Banat Bulgarian language|Banat Bulgarian]]: ''Telepa'', {{lang-de|Bulgarische Kolonie}}, {{lang-hu|Bolgartelep}}) was founded as ''Telepa'' by [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] [[Banat Bulgarians|Banat Bulgarian]] colonists in 1846. In 1910, it had a population of 714 Bulgarians. In 1930, the population was 830, of which 353 Bulgarians, 338 [[Hungarians]], 123 [[Germans]], 13 [[Romanians]] and 3 [[Romani people|Romani]]. In the 1940 census, the Bulgarians were not recognized as a separate ethnic group by [[Ion Antonescu]]'s regime, and the population was 729, of which 314 \"others\", 295 Hungarians, 107 Germans and 13 Romanians.\n\n==Culture==\nThe school in Dude\u0219tii Vechi was founded in 1745 by the Bulgarian settlers with the help of the Roman Catholic Church. It is the oldest school of the Bulgarian diaspora and the only school in Romania where Bulgarian language is taught to all grades. {{As of|2004}}, education in Bulgarian was optional, but efforts were made to transform the school into a [[bilingual]] one.

It occurred at [[Manado]] (also spelled Menado) on the Minahasa Peninsula on the northern part of Celebes Island (modern day [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]]), from 11\u201312 January 1942. The battle was noted as the first time in Japanese history that the country had deployed paratroopers in a military operation.{{Campaignbox Netherlands East Indies}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Minahasa's strategic value ===\nEven though the Minahasa Peninsula does not contain any raw materials or strategic technical installations, its military value remained essential. The sheltered bays of Manado and Lake Tondano provide good bases for seaplanes, as Dutch forces established a Naval Base on the southeast side of Tondano Lake, near Tasoeka (Tasuka). A seaplane base was also established on the southern part of the Lake, near Kakas.<ref name=\"Nortier 65\">Nortier (1980), pp. 65</ref> \n\nAside from that, Dutch forces also constructed two airfields nearby. At the Kalawiran village near Langoan, the Menado II/Langoan Airfield was established. When the war broke out, Manado I Airfield, located just east of Manado City at Mapanget was still under construction.<ref name=\"Nortier 65\"/>\n\n=== Japanese invasion plan ===\nAs part of the Japan's plan to conquer the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]], particularly the island of Java, air support from southern Sumatra, [[Kuching]], [[Banjarmasin]] (south-eastern part of Dutch Borneo), [[Makassar]] and [[Kendari]] (both on southern Celebes) was required.<ref name=\"Remmelink  4\">Remmelink (2015), pp. 4</ref> Beforehand, however, in order to set up the aforementioned aerial support, specifically in southern Celebes and Banjarmasin, relay fields in Manado, Tarakan and Balikpapan had to be conquered as well.<ref name=\"Remmelink  4\"/>\n\nThe seizure of Manado was outlined as part of Japan's Eastern Offensive prong to capture the Dutch East Indies. Responsilibility for conducting attacks on this prong falls to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>Nortier (1980), pp. 67</ref>\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Japan ===\n\n==== Ground forces ====\n* Sasebo Combined Special Landing Force (Commander: Capt.

He also ordered Capt. Kroon's Combined Force (ca. 400 troops in total) to occupy the Manado coastlines and guard it against possible landings.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> On Kroon's left flank, in the Sario District, he placed Masselink's European Militia, while Lt. de Man's Stadswacht dig in on the right. Engineers are placed on standby, waiting for the order to destroy vital installations; NCOs and members of local government were also informed of the looming Japanese landing.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 399-400</ref><ref name=\"Nortier 77\">Nortier (1980), pp. 77</ref>\n\nMori's 1st Sasebo Force landed on the northern and southern coast of Manado at 04:00 A.M on 11 January. Upon hearing reports about the landing, Kroon's ''Compagnie Menado'' immediately withdrew to the rear positions at Pineleng and Tino\u00f6r, without knowing what is happening on the beach, as Mori's troops overrun the 75 mm gun that was firing at the landing boats. Yet they also ran into stout opposition from Masselink's militias, forcing them to bring all their automatic fire to bear. Japanese pressure forced Masselink to withdraw to Pineleng, only to find that the 1st Force had bypassed them into the town at 05:00, pressing him to move further southward.<ref name=\"Nortier 77\"/>\n\nWhen Kroon's troops arrived half an hour later, Mori's troops forced him to withdraw southward along the Manado-Tomohon road to Roeroekan (Rurukan). When Masselink reported his positions to Schillm\u00f6ller, he ordered him occupy the bridge at Pineleng instead, even though Japanese troops had already occupied it. Masselink eventually continued the retreat, reaching Tino\u00f6r by 07:00. After battling the Combined Force, Mori's 1st Force occupied Manado by 08:30. As reports of the landing began to come in, Schillm\u00f6ller sent 5 RK brigades under Lt. van de Laar in Tomohon to Tino\u00f6r to support the retreating Combined Force. Immediately after capturing Manado, Mori advance southward to Tomohon at 09:45, bypassing the Dutch line of retreat.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 401</ref>  \n\nSoon, Schillm\u00f6ller pulled three brigades from van de Laar's force back to Tomohon to reinforce the town against a false intelligence about Japanese landing in Tanahwangko, further west of Manado. Despite this withdrawal, van de Laar was reinforced by stragglers from ''Compagnie Menado'' and an ''overvalwagen'' as well as Stadswacht troops under Lt. de Man. To provide protection against Japanese tanks, Dutch troops swiftly cut down a heavy tree that will fall on the road the moment the tanks came. As Mori's vanguard of four [[Type 95 Ha-Go light tank|Type 95 tanks]] approached the town at 10:30, the falling tree and concentrated machine gun fire knocked out three of them and repel Mori's troops. van de Laar's troops hold on to Tinoor until about noon, when the shortage of ammunition forced them back to Kakaskasen.<ref>Nortier (1980), pp. 79</ref>   \n\nNow supported by ''overvalwagens'', van de Laar set up a new defensive position just north of Kakaskasen.1st Force engaged them again at 16:00, but Dutch troops managed to stem their advance and caused substantial casualties before retreating again. Yet, since Mori continues to bypass them, once the Dutch arrived in Tomohon, they found themselves immediately fighting the 1st Force's. The Combined Force attempted a defense against the Japanese advance, but they could not stop Mori from seizing Tomohon by 19:30. van de Laar's troops moved eastwards to Roeroekan, arriving at 22:00. By morning of the 12th, Mori advanced to Langoan Airfield by way of Tomohon to Kawangkoan. By 12:30, his troops established contact with the 1st Yokosuka paras and arrived at Langoan and Kakas at 14:00. Dutch forces had, by then, retreated to Amoerang (Amurang) further west, while blowing up bridges and warehouses, making no attempts of counterattack in the meantime.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/>    \n\n=== Landing on Kema (2nd Force) ===\n[[File:Japanese_Landing_on_Kema,_11_January_1942.jpg|thumb|360x360px|2nd Sasebo Force Landing Route on Kema, 11 January 1942]]\nLt. Radema's A Company, tasked with defending the eastern coast, was spread in the road between the coastal city of Kema and Ajermadidih. In addition to the brigades at both aforementioned cities, three brigades were stationed at Mapanget Airfield, and one brigade each were stationed in Likoepang and Bitoeng, further north from Kema. Radema also constructed machine gun casemates and tank barricades along the road from Kema to Ajermadidih.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 42</ref>  \n\nAt the same time with the 1st Force landing, Commander Uroku Hashimoto 's 2nd Sasebo Force landed at Kema on the east at 04:20 and engaged Radema's two brigades. When notified about the Landing, Radema ordered the dispersed A-Company to gather at Ajermadidih, but only the troops from Likoepang eventually came. Meanwhile at Kema, the two brigade under Sgt. Soenda retreated after destroying the town bridge; Hashimoto spared no time continued to advance to Ajermadidih. Near Kasar the brigades clashed with the 2nd Force and had to withdraw again after inflicting modest casualties.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 44</ref>\n\nBy 09:00, the 2nd Force, supported by three Type 95 tanks, advanced to the east of Ajermadidih and engaged Radema's Company, now reinforced with its remaining brigades (ca. 300 troops). Even though Radema's troops managed to caused considerable casualties, Japanese tanks eventually broke through and threatened to outflank the Dutch defense, forcing Radema to retreat by 14:00. To cover their withdraw, Sgt. Roemambi and Pvt. Iniray and Poesoeng continued to fire from their casemate until it was destroyed by tank shells.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/>\n\nAnother cover force of a brigade under Sgt. Sigar hold Hashimoto's troops at Sawangan to allow Radema safe passage to Tondano. After driving Sigar's brigade back through force majeure and airplane attacks, an element of the 2nd Force reached Tondano by 18:00, and by 22:00, Hashimoto had reached the town and halted there for the night. By morning on the 12th, Hashimoto went along the road the eastern and western shores of lake Tondano, linking up with the 1st Yokosuka paras by 11:00 and the 1st Sasebo Force at 12:30. By the night of the 11th, however, Schillm\u00f6ller had decided to withdraw to the west and commenced a guerilla fight.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/><ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 401</ref>\n\nRadema left with about 12 troops to the warehouse allocated for his company, but soldiers began to desert along the way. When he arrived of the shelter, it had already been looted by the local population, forcing him to try to infiltrate Ajermadidih to gather what is left of his forces. The rest of his troops eventually abandoned him as well during the journey. The high rate of desertion was exacerbated by the fact that the Japanese have taken hold all major cities and towns \u2014 and therefore women and children \u2014 within 24 hours. In addition, Japanese forces also dropped out pamphlets that read: \"The war is not going on against you, only against the Dutch. So be sensible, don't interfere and go home.\"<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 45</ref>\n\n=== Airborne drop ===\n[[File:Japanese paras dropping over Langoan Airfield, Manado, 1942.jpg|left|thumb|319x319px|A wave of Japanese paratroopers dropping over Langoan Airfield. ]]On the night of 10-11 January, the Kakas Command Post was alerted by Tomohon, compelling van den Berg to send motorcycle messengers to place his troops on high alert. When Tomohon informed him again at 05:00 of the Japanese landing in Manado and Kema, a brigade from the reserve KV section at Kakas moved to Papakelan to close the roads leading to Tondano.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 47</ref> \n\nConcurrently, at 06:30 A.M. on 11 January, 28 [[Mitsubishi G3M]] left Davao for Manado, carrying the 1st Drop Group with them.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref name=\"Salecker 1\">Salecker (2010), pp. 1</ref> While the flight approached northern Celebes, a group of [[Mitsubishi F1M|Mitsubishi F1M \"Pete\"]] that was covering the naval invasion force mistakenly attacked them, shooting down a G3M and killing all 12 paras aboard.<ref name=\"Salecker 1\"/> To prevent further friendly fire incident, [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters from the carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuiho'']] escorted the flight until it reached the drop zone.<ref name=\"Salecker 2\"/> In due course, the 1st Group began dropping over Langoan at 09:52 and completed the drop by 10:20.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> Van den Berg immediately ordered the rest of the reserve KV section to take position west of Kakas to defend against another possible landing. He wanted to call in the reserve KV section in Langoan as well, but Schillm\u00f6ller had already used them. \n\nRobbemond's troops, though lacking in anti-aircraft guns, used their [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] and [[Madsen machine gun|Madsen]] machine guns to open fire into the paras and repel the oncoming assault.<ref>Salecker (2010), pp. 3</ref> Several paras were dropped close to Dutch pillboxes, and they had to destroy them with pistols and hand grenades, while giving time for the rest of the group to gather weapons from the cargo container.<ref name=\"Salecker 5\">Salecker (2010), pp. 5</ref>\n\nUpon retrieving their weapons, Horiuchi focused the attack against Robbemond's troops on the northern side of the airfield.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> By 10:50, the paras had enveloped the northern side, capturing the ''overvalwagen'' with it.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> Schillm\u00f6ller then put in the reserve KV Company section in Kakas into the battle. The Company was ordered to advance to Toelian and reinforce Van den Berg's troops at the airfield. However the order was not carried out, as the unit disappeared with no further notification.<ref name=\"Nortier 518\">Nortier (1989), pp. 518</ref> Van den Berg then ordered the two ''overvalwagens'' on reserve under ter Voert to attack the airfield.<ref name=\"Salecker 5\"/> Entering the vicinity of Langoan under heavy fire, one ''overvalwagen'' had its engine shot off. Its gunners, Pvt.Tauran and Pvt. Toemoedi kept firing their machine guns to provide cover for rest of the crew, before retreating in the face of the advancing paras. The second one, under Sgt. Bojoh, entered the airfield and took part in the battle before eventually withdrawing.<ref name=\"Salecker 6\">Salecker (2010), pp. 6</ref> \n[[File:Japanese_Paras_Drop_Zones_in_Manado,_11_January_1942.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Japanese Paras Drop Zones in Manado, 11 January 1942.

Defense position of a KV brigade''\n]]\nIn spite of the dogged resistance, the 1st Drop Group overran the airfield by 11:25.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> As the battle progresses, Van den Berg called Lt. Fuchter's Company, along with the ''Mobile Colonne'' to attack the paras from a westerly direction, via Panasen. Yet Fuchter did not arrive at Kakas until 11:30, where by then Langoan Airfield had already been lost, thus cancelling the attack.<ref name=\"Nortier 518\"/> Van den Berg then ordered Fuchter's Company and the ''Mobile Colonne'' to take position to the south and west of Kakas and relieve the Militia-Landstorm Company stationed there. Upon accessing the number of casualties sustained and the very few troops that were still able to fight, van den Berg's troops destroyed the Tasoeka Naval Base and prepare his troops to move into their assigned guerrilla territory.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 401</ref> \n\nAt 12:35 van den Berg informed Tomohon that he was leaving for the area east of Tasoeka. He sent the Militia-Landstorm Company \u2014 deemed unfit for a guerrilla fight \u2014 westwards to Kotamobagoe (Kotamobagu) to join forces with the Manado Militia Company. Lt. Wielinga, the overall commander of the airfield defense, did not use his brigade to support the battle, and had already retreated during the battle instead.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 50</ref>\n\nUpon capturing the airfield, Horiuchi sent a reconnaissance team moved to the Kakas area at 13:00 to reconnoiter Dutch movement.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 161</ref> Ter Voert, Tauran and Toemoedi who just reached Kakas on foot immediately reported the movement. The team encountered and captured an ''overvalwagen'' before moving into Kakas, where they engaged another ''overvalwagen'' and forced it to withdraw. 1st and 2nd Company, advancing towards Kakas, engaged with Fuchter's Company, which was supported by an ''overvalwagen''. After an extensive fight, the paras drove Fuchter's troops off and seized Kakas by 14:50. At 15:50 the paras attacked the seaplane base and captured it by 18:00. The attack was supported by the Tondano Lake Unit, who landed by two [[Kawanishi H6K|Mavis]] flying boats on Tondano Lake at 14:57.<ref name=\"Salecker 6\"/> While landing, the Unit came under fire from ''Mobile Colonne''<nowiki/>'s 37 mm guns, which was not sufficient to halt the process.<ref name=\"Nortier 518\"/>\n\nThe following day, the 2nd Drop Group parachuted into Langoan airfield at 09:52 A.M. and linked up with the 1st Drop Group.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/> Horiuchi's force, in full capacity, launched an assault on Langoan city and the neighboring Tompaso. By then, Schillm\u00f6ller had withdrawn westward, towards Amoerang (Amurang), leaving behind large amounts of weapon and ammunition. Langoan was captured by 11:25, with Tompaso following suit at 12:30. Another element of the paras advanced to Paso and seized the city at 10:35. By 14:00, Horiuchi managed to link up with both 1st and 2nd Sasebo Force.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Japanese paras landing on Langoan Airfield, January 1942.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Japanese paratroopers landing on Langoan Airfield]]\nFrom 13 January, the Sasebo Combined Special Landing Force conducted a mopping-up operation of Manado and its vicinity. They completed the operation on the 16th, and assembled in Menado to start preparations for the capture of Kendari.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/> The 1st Yokosuka SNLF, on the other hand, continued to be stationed at the Langoan Airfield until 24 April, when they were assigned in small groups to attack nearby islands on landing crafts. The force reassembled at Makassar in November 1942 to be transported back to Japan.<ref>Salecker (2010), pp. 9</ref>\n\n=== Casualties ===\nJapanese casualties from the battle are as follows:<ref name=\"Salecker 7\">Salecker (2010), pp. 7</ref><ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/>\n\n* 1st Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF): 32 killed, ca. 90 wounded\n* Sasebo Combined Special Landing Force: 12 killed, 154 wounded\n\n140 Dutch troops were killed in the battle, with another 48 captured.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/> The Japanese also captured ten 8-mm field guns and a significant number of machineguns, rifles, and other supplies.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/>\n\n=== Reprisals ===\nIn retaliation for the high number of casualties, Horiuchi's paras executed Dutch POW's defending the airfield. Lt. Wielinga was captured in Gorontalo and taken to Langoan, where he was beheaded on 1 March. In addition, the paras also beheaded or bayonetted: Sgt. Robbemond, Sgt. B. Visscher, Pvt. Toemedi and nine Menadonese soldiers. Another two Menadonese soldiers died from torture in captivity.<ref name=\"Salecker 7\"/><ref name=\"Nortier 51\">Nortier (1988), pp. 51</ref>\n\n== The guerrilla war ==\nOn the night of 11 January in Roeroekan, when the Dutch decided to commence their guerrila war, Schilm\u00f6ller gave money to three of his commanders \u2013 captains Kroon and Abbink and lieutenant Van de Laar \u2013 and ordered them to begin the guerrilla fighting in their respective regions. Minahasa's geography of open terrain, however, makes it difficult to stage a guerilla fighting. Furthermore, some of the underground warehouses had already been looted by the local population, which adds to the crucial question of supplying the troops.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indonesisch Leger (1948), pp. 401-402</ref>\n\n=== Schilmoller's Group ===\nSchilm\u00f6ller himself planned to set up his base in Lake Tondano and established contact with any unlocated units from there. With three brigades from RK's B-Company, he moved to the area between Lake Tondano and the Lembean Mountains. Yet when his only radio broke down, Schilm\u00f6ller marched his group westwards to Kotamobagoe (Kotamobagu), where the Menadonese Militia Company was located, to establish communication with KNIL Headquarter based in Java. On 20 January, his group made contact with Capt. Van den Berg's group just southeast of Lake Tondano. The latter suggested that he left B-Company behind and take the elderly and the physically weak to Kotamobagoe. Instead, Schilm\u00f6ller, kept B-Company and reinforced it with Capt. Van den Berg's best troops.<ref name=\"Nortier 51\"/>\n\nThe next day, the former's group left for Pasolo on the east coast, where from there they will steam south as far as possible. When the group reached Pasolo, however, the insufficient amount of water transport means that they could not depart in one go. Half of the group, including Sgt. Chief of Staff J.F. Flips, were left under the command of 1st Lt. Siegmund and will be picked up later. But before it could happened, the Japanese overran and captured the group. After being subjected to extensive torture, Siegmund and Flips were executed in Langoan on 27 January.<ref name=\"Nortier 51\"/>\n\nSchillm\u00f6ller arrived in Kotamobagoe on 26 January, where he was able reestablish radio communication and reported his conditions to the Dutch General Headquarters in Java (Bandoeng). On 31 January, the Headquarters ordered Schillm\u00f6ller to make his way to Makassar, where from there he will be transported back to Java. Under pressure from Japanese propaganda which could spark local uprising, Schillm\u00f6ller decided to bring his group to Poso, in Central Celebes. However, the Dutch were not able to acquire sea transport until 26 February, at which point Makassar had already fallen into Japanese hands for over two weeks (9 February).<ref name=\"Koninklijke 403\">Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 403</ref>\n\nWith few options remaining, Schillm\u00f6ller decided to continue to wage guerrilla warfare in Central Celebes, bolstering his group with Dutch detachments from Poso, Paloe (Palu) and Kolonedale (Kolonodale). First to join was Lt. Willem van Daalen and his 60 troops; another two detachments joined in from Poso, one under the command of Lt. Johannes de Jong.<ref name=\"De Jong 812\"/> Despite the increasing number, most of the troops are lightly armed, and some of them (local militia) have no training at all. Furthermore, there's also the consideration that the local population could not be expected to provide support in continuing the fight. Eventually, when he heard the news of Dutch surrender at Java on 8 March, Schillm\u00f6ller decided to capitulate.<ref name=\"Koninklijke 403\"/>\n\n=== Kroon's Group ===\nOn 12 January, Captain Kroon and the remainder 50 troops his company left Roeroekan and headed northward to Kembes. The high rate of desertion by Menadonese soldiers left Kroon with only 9 men, when Japanese troops captured his group and take them to Kembes, before eventually transporting them to Manado. On January 26, a day after they arrived, all European soldiers - except Captain Kroon - were executed. Those executed included 4 NCOs and 2 Militia-Landstorm soldiers.<ref name=\"Nortier 53\">Nortier (1988), pp. 53</ref>\n\n=== Abbink-Masselink's Group ===\nCapt. Abbink's group headed southwest to start their guerrilla fighting in the Amoerang area, yet the similar wave of desertion left him with only four soldiers. Hoping to connect with other guerrilla forces, Abbink traveled from 17 January to 1 February, when his group met with 8 RK soldiers under Lt. Masselink at northeast of Amoerang. After the battle in Tino\u00f6r, Masselink and Sgt. Siwy arrived in Kakaskasen and attempted to reach the command post in Tomohon. Yet when they heard that Japanese troops had occupied the city, their guerrilla warfare had already begun.<ref name=\"Nortier 53\"/>\n\nOn 13 or 14 January Masselink's group met up  with 27 former soldiers who had retretated from Tanahwangko. As they began preparing for the guerrilla fighting, the high desertion rate had shrunk Masselink's group to 5 troops. The Abbink / Masselink group soon learned of the Dutch forces' surrender in Manado and lost contact with Schillm\u00f6ller's group. These factors led them to leave for the safety of Kotamobagoe, where they raided supplies and arms from the local police. After arriving at the Manado Milita Company barracks on 9 February, they left for Poso in Central Celebes.<ref name=\"Nortier 54\">Nortier (1988), pp. 54</ref>[[File:Guerrilla_Area_of_Sgt._Mali\u00ebzer\u2019s_Group,_January-February_1942.jpg|alt=|thumb|255x255px|Guerrilla Area of Sgt. Meli\u00ebzer\u2019s Group, January-February 1942]]\n=== Meli\u00ebzer's Group ===\nOn 11 January, Sgt. Johan Meli\u00ebzer's E-Detachment was stationed at Amoerang when it came under fire from Japanese ships, killing one and injuring three. Having lost contact with Tomohon,  Meli\u00ebzer sent a motorcycle messenger to Maj. Schilm\u00f6ller, who ordered the Detachment to reinforce the troops at Langoan Airfield. Making the advance under constant fear of air raid, E-Detachment's 20 troops arrived at the airfield on 12 January, only to find that Japanese troops already occupied it. E-Detachment's troops immediately dispersed and returned home, with many feared to take up arms again for the guerilla fighting.<ref name=\"Nortier 54\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Mali\u00ebzer refused to capitulate and began organizing a guerrilla group of approximately 15 troops in the second half of January. The group is also joined by civilians, among them Mrs. Hoffman (n\u00e9e Paratasis), the spouse of a retired MWO ([[Military Order of William|Militaire Willems-Orde]]) Knight who was executed for aiding Dutch guerrilla troops. On 8 February, the group repulsed a day-long Japanese attack at Kanejan, just east of Toempa\u00e4n (Tumpaan). In reprisal for their loss at Kanejan, Japanese troops burned down a kampong (village) and beheaded five civilians, including two women. In another battle just four days later, they captured Meli\u00ebzer's group and brought them to Langoan. After a short time in captivity, Mali\u00ebzer was beheaded in Langoan on 20 February, along with 12 other members of his group, among them Mrs. Hoffman.<ref name=\"Nortier 54\"/>\n\n=== van den Berg's Group ===\n[[File:Guerrilla_Area_of_Capt._van_den_Berg,_January-February_1942.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|340x340px|Guerrilla Area of Capt. van den Berg, January-February 1942]]\n[[File:Capt._W.C._van_den_Berg.jpg|thumb|Capt. Willem Carel van den Berg]]\nFrom Tasoeka, Capt. van den Berg's group make camp on the slopes of the Lembean mountains on the night of 11 January. A steady stream of troops joining in turns his group into a 101-strong force just three days later. van den Berg divided them into four brigades of 22 soldiers each, along with a staff group of 13 troops and nurses. Two of the brigades were commanded by Fuchter, while Sgt. Maj. Ranti commanded the other two and Ter Voert commanded the staff group.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 55</ref>\n\nOn 17 January in Karor, naval personnels from Kema, under the command of 2nd Lt. W.A. de Ruiter, joined the group. Three days later, they met with Schilm\u00f6ller's group, just north of Kajoe Watoe (Kayuwatu). As mentioned, Schilm\u00f6ller deprived the group of most of its fighting force, leaving van den Berg with just 23 troops left (along with Ranti and Ter Voert) that will gather other dispersed troops in the region, thus diminishing the capacity to wage guerrilla in Minahasa.<ref name=\"Nortier 56\">Nortier (1988), pp. 56</ref>  \n\nDuring the encounter with Schilm\u00f6ller, Fuchter's brigades have been on patrol for 5 days, when they encountered a Japanese motorcade in a chaotic nightime fighting that left Fuchter with just 10 soldiers at its conclusion. By the night of 22 January, Japanese troops raided his barracks at Kombi and captured his entire group. Ranti's brigades, who was deployed to the southeastern side of Lake Tondano on 15 January, returned from the patrol on January 20. Half of them, however, decided to continue the guerrilla in Kaweng.<ref name=\"Nortier 56\"/>\n\nOn 4 On February, the group at Kaweng fought off a Japanese attack that killed three of their soldiers, for the unconfirmed loss of 37 Japanese troops.  Meanwhile, van den Berg's group - amounting to just 1 brigade - continues to maintain itself in Lembean mountains for the time being and carried out demolition works. The group also continued to gather any soldier in an attempt to carry out a large-scale raid on Langoan Airfield or Tondano.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 57</ref> \n\nBefore this endeavor could be conducted, 60-80 Japanese troops \u2014  aided by the local population \u2014  encircled van den Berg's base just southwest of Kasar on 17 February. Realizing that a daylight outbreak could not be successful, the group attempted to escape from the barracks at night. One by one, and under cover of darkness, soldiers from the group left the barracks, with Capt. van den Berg being the last person to leave.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 402</ref><ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 58</ref> Despite the success of the escape, the involvement of the local population on the Japanese side meant that the situation for the group was becoming more untenable. \n\nBy 20 February, leaving the sick and elderly behind, the group moved to the mouth of Kali Rakar, where they began the trek south along the coast using wooden boats. After rowing for 14 hours, the brigade reached Pasir Poetih (Pasir Putih), ca. 80 km south of Kali Rakar. A local fisherman quickly notified their presence to the Japanese, who swiftly surrounded the coast. The group managed to flee once more, but was captured on 22 February, a day after they had come ashore. Admiring their persistent resistance and heroic stand, the Japanese War Council in Langoan spared Van den Berg's group from execution.<ref name=\"De Jong 812\"/> After the war, van den Berg was made Knight Commander of the [[Military Order of William|Militaire Williams-Orde]], 4th Class. \n\n=== de Jong & van Daalen's Group ===\n[[File:Japanese Attack on Celebes, 1942.jpg|left|thumb|397x397px|Map of Japanese attack on Celebes, January-February 1942, showing Poso and Kolonedale]]\nOn 12 March, Schillm\u00f6ller sent one of his officer to Manado to discuss the terms of surrender with the Japanese. He had hoped that his troops would be allowed to keep their weapons, to maintain order and protect the European civil servants and families that have been travelling along with the group. Instead, the Japanese demanded that the Dutch surrender all their weapons and for all members of the group to make their way to Manado. Schillm\u00f6ller left the group for Manado on 23 March, while a detachment of 50 Japanese soldiers was sent to Poso to bring his group back to Manado. De Jong and van Daalen, however, rejected the demand to surrender their weapons and turned back on their decision to capitulate. When the Japanese detachment arrived in April, the Dutch opened fire at them, killing the detachment commander and wounding others.<ref name=\"Koninklijke 404\">Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 404</ref>\n\nIn May, the Japanese sent a 400-strong unit to engage the Dutch guerrilla force of 125 soldiers who withdrew and continued their fight inland.<ref>Hegener (1990), pp. 75-77</ref> De Jong and van Daalen created two groups and based themselves each in the east of Poso and around Kolonedale respectively. On 9-10 June, de Jong's group came upon a National Administration's radio station in Kolonedale and establish contact with Dutch representatives in Australia, requesting food, weapons and ammunition.<ref name=\"De Jong 813\">De Jong (1984), pp. 813</ref> Unbeknownst to them, Japanese forces managed to intercept the radio communication.  \n\nResponding to the newly-established contact, a \"party\" was created in Australia, whose task is to infiltrate Celebes and came back with intelligence or conduct sabotage operation. Named ''Lion'', the party consisted of engineer Robert Hees, telegraphist Bernard Belloni and marine engineer Hans Brandon. ''Lion'' party left the port on the boat ''Samoa'' (a 14-meter-long two-mast) on 24 June and landed in Wotoe (Wotu), south of Kolonedale, after a 1,700-kilometer journey. Local population immediately reported their presence to the Japanese, who captured all three after a firefight on 12-13 July. After a period of captivity and torture, the Japanese beheaded them in Makassar on 14 September.<ref>de Jong (1986), pp. 60, 181, 191, 215</ref>[[File:Johannes Adrianus de Jong.jpg|thumb|261x261px|Lt. Johannes Adrianus de Jong]]Even as the Japanese continue to add pressure on both guerrilla groups, in conjunction with increasing desertion and casualties, both groups continued to exert casualties on the Japanese force. Before July, the group had killed around 100 Japanese soldiers, at a loss of three killed and four captured.<ref>van Meel (1985), pp. 27</ref> On 7 July , de Jong's troops attacked Japanese forces in Salenda (Lembosalenda). The Japanese came in three vehicles and were equipped with automatic weapons and mortars. A heavy firefight ensued until 21:00 on the 7th, and continued again to 06:00-09:00 the next day. At the end of it, seven Japanese officers and between 35-70 Japanese soldiers had been killed. Witnesses stated that all three vehicles were astrewn with Japanese bodies, which were then burned with gasoline.<ref>Immerzeel & Van Esch (1990), pp. 212-213. Hegener (1990), pp. 139-144.</ref> \n\nIt was not until 15 July for the supplies to be delivered from Australia. At that point, the Japanese had already landed at Kolonedale, destroyed the radio station and captured the supply drops.<ref name=\"De Jong 813\"/> At the same time, local residents had been recruited to aid the search for the Dutch guerrillas. The Japanese finally captured de Jong and van Daalen on 9 August 1942. Both officers were imprisoned at Kolonedale, before transferred to Manado. After extended interrogation and torture, de Jong and van Daalen were beheaded on 25 August.<ref name=\"Koninklijke 404\"/><ref name=\"De Jong 813\"/> Along with them, the Japanese also beheaded 15 soldiers from the guerrila group (11 Dutch, 4 Indonesians). Earlier on 13 August, 9 soldiers (8 NCO, 1 Pvt.) had also been executed.<ref>van Meel (1985), pp. 29</ref> \n\nHegener argued de Jong and van Daalen's guerrilla actions had been quite effective due to Minahasa's natural suitability and the Japanese's lack of experience in dealing with guerrilla warfare. The group had initial hit-and-run successes, but as the local population's support for the Japanese grew and more troops were being allocated to fight them, the effectiveness of the guerrilla war eventually dwindled away.<ref>Hegener (1990), pp. 101</ref> After the war, de Jong was made Knight Commander of the [[Military Order of William|Militaire Williams-Orde]], 4th Class and van Daalen received the Bronze Lion, both posthumously.\n\n=== Liberation ===\nMenado remained under Japanese occupation until October 1945, when the Australian-composed \"Menado Force\" liberated the region.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*De Jong, Loe.

It occurred at [[Manado]] (also spelled Menado) on the Minahasa Peninsula on the northern part of Celebes Island (modern day [[Sulawesi]] in [[Indonesia]]), from 11\u201312 January 1942. The battle was noted as the first time in Japanese history that the country had deployed paratroopers in a military operation.{{Campaignbox Netherlands East Indies}}\n\n== Background ==\n\n=== Minahasa's strategic value ===\nEven though the Minahasa Peninsula does not contain any raw materials or strategic technical installations, its military value remained essential. The sheltered bays of Manado and Lake Tondano provide good bases for seaplanes, as Dutch forces established a Naval Base on the southeast side of Tondano Lake, near Tasoeka (Tasuka). A seaplane base was also established on the southern part of the Lake, near Kakas.<ref name=\"Nortier 65\">Nortier (1980), pp. 65</ref> \n\nAside from that, Dutch forces also constructed two airfields nearby. At the Kalawiran village near Langoan, the Menado II/Langoan Airfield was established. When the war broke out, Manado I Airfield, located just east of Manado City at Mapanget was still under construction.<ref name=\"Nortier 65\"/>\n\n=== Japanese invasion plan ===\nAs part of the Japan's plan to conquer the [[Dutch East Indies|Netherlands East Indies]], particularly the island of Java, air support from southern Sumatra, [[Kuching]], [[Banjarmasin]] (south-eastern part of Dutch Borneo), [[Makassar]] and [[Kendari]] (both on southern Celebes) was required.<ref name=\"Remmelink  4\">Remmelink (2015), pp. 4</ref> Beforehand, however, in order to set up the aforementioned aerial support, specifically in southern Celebes and Banjarmasin, relay fields in Manado, Tarakan and Balikpapan had to be conquered as well.<ref name=\"Remmelink  4\"/>\n\nThe seizure of Manado was outlined as part of Japan's Eastern Offensive prong to capture the Dutch East Indies. Responsilibility for conducting attacks on this prong falls to the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]].<ref>Nortier (1980), pp. 67</ref>\n\n== Order of battle ==\n\n=== Japan ===\n\n==== Ground forces ====\n* Sasebo Combined Special Landing Force (Commander: Capt.

He also ordered Capt. Kroon's Combined Force (ca. 400 troops in total) to occupy the Manado coastlines and guard it against possible landings.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> On Kroon's left flank, in the Sario District, he placed Masselink's European Militia, while Lt. de Man's Stadswacht dig in on the right. Engineers are placed on standby, waiting for the order to destroy vital installations; NCOs and members of local government were also informed of the looming Japanese landing.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 399-400</ref><ref name=\"Nortier 77\">Nortier (1980), pp. 77</ref>\n\nMori's 1st Sasebo Force landed on the northern and southern coast of Manado at 04:00 A.M on 11 January. Upon hearing reports about the landing, Kroon's ''Compagnie Menado'' immediately withdrew to the rear positions at Pineleng and Tino\u00f6r, without knowing what is happening on the beach, as Mori's troops overrun the 75 mm gun that was firing at the landing boats. Yet they also ran into stout opposition from Masselink's militias, forcing them to bring all their automatic fire to bear. Japanese pressure forced Masselink to withdraw to Pineleng, only to find that the 1st Force had bypassed them into the town at 05:00, pressing him to move further southward.<ref name=\"Nortier 77\"/>\n\nWhen Kroon's troops arrived half an hour later, Mori's troops forced him to withdraw southward along the Manado-Tomohon road to Roeroekan (Rurukan). When Masselink reported his positions to Schillm\u00f6ller, he ordered him occupy the bridge at Pineleng instead, even though Japanese troops had already occupied it. Masselink eventually continued the retreat, reaching Tino\u00f6r by 07:00. After battling the Combined Force, Mori's 1st Force occupied Manado by 08:30. As reports of the landing began to come in, Schillm\u00f6ller sent 5 RK brigades under Lt. van de Laar in Tomohon to Tino\u00f6r to support the retreating Combined Force. Immediately after capturing Manado, Mori advance southward to Tomohon at 09:45, bypassing the Dutch line of retreat.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 401</ref>  \n\nSoon, Schillm\u00f6ller pulled three brigades from van de Laar's force back to Tomohon to reinforce the town against a false intelligence about Japanese landing in Tanahwangko, further west of Manado. Despite this withdrawal, van de Laar was reinforced by stragglers from ''Compagnie Menado'' and an ''overvalwagen'' as well as Stadswacht troops under Lt. de Man. To provide protection against Japanese tanks, Dutch troops swiftly cut down a heavy tree that will fall on the road the moment the tanks came. As Mori's vanguard of four [[Type 95 Ha-Go light tank|Type 95 tanks]] approached the town at 10:30, the falling tree and concentrated machine gun fire knocked out three of them and repel Mori's troops. van de Laar's troops hold on to Tinoor until about noon, when the shortage of ammunition forced them back to Kakaskasen.<ref>Nortier (1980), pp. 79</ref>   \n\nNow supported by ''overvalwagens'', van de Laar set up a new defensive position just north of Kakaskasen.1st Force engaged them again at 16:00, but Dutch troops managed to stem their advance and caused substantial casualties before retreating again. Yet, since Mori continues to bypass them, once the Dutch arrived in Tomohon, they found themselves immediately fighting the 1st Force's. The Combined Force attempted a defense against the Japanese advance, but they could not stop Mori from seizing Tomohon by 19:30. van de Laar's troops moved eastwards to Roeroekan, arriving at 22:00. By morning of the 12th, Mori advanced to Langoan Airfield by way of Tomohon to Kawangkoan. By 12:30, his troops established contact with the 1st Yokosuka paras and arrived at Langoan and Kakas at 14:00. Dutch forces had, by then, retreated to Amoerang (Amurang) further west, while blowing up bridges and warehouses, making no attempts of counterattack in the meantime.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/>    \n\n=== Landing on Kema (2nd Force) ===\n[[File:Japanese_Landing_on_Kema,_11_January_1942.jpg|thumb|360x360px|2nd Sasebo Force Landing Route on Kema, 11 January 1942]]\nLt. Radema's A Company, tasked with defending the eastern coast, was spread in the road between the coastal city of Kema and Ajermadidih. In addition to the brigades at both aforementioned cities, three brigades were stationed at Mapanget Airfield, and one brigade each were stationed in Likoepang and Bitoeng, further north from Kema. Radema also constructed machine gun casemates and tank barricades along the road from Kema to Ajermadidih.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 42</ref>  \n\nAt the same time with the 1st Force landing, Commander Uroku Hashimoto 's 2nd Sasebo Force landed at Kema on the east at 04:20 and engaged Radema's two brigades. When notified about the Landing, Radema ordered the dispersed A-Company to gather at Ajermadidih, but only the troops from Likoepang eventually came. Meanwhile at Kema, the two brigade under Sgt. Soenda retreated after destroying the town bridge; Hashimoto spared no time continued to advance to Ajermadidih. Near Kasar the brigades clashed with the 2nd Force and had to withdraw again after inflicting modest casualties.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 44</ref>\n\nBy 09:00, the 2nd Force, supported by three Type 95 tanks, advanced to the east of Ajermadidih and engaged Radema's Company, now reinforced with its remaining brigades (ca. 300 troops). Even though Radema's troops managed to caused considerable casualties, Japanese tanks eventually broke through and threatened to outflank the Dutch defense, forcing Radema to retreat by 14:00. To cover their withdraw, Sgt. Roemambi and Pvt. Iniray and Poesoeng continued to fire from their casemate until it was destroyed by tank shells.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/>\n\nAnother cover force of a brigade under Sgt. Sigar hold Hashimoto's troops at Sawangan to allow Radema safe passage to Tondano. After driving Sigar's brigade back through force majeure and airplane attacks, an element of the 2nd Force reached Tondano by 18:00, and by 22:00, Hashimoto had reached the town and halted there for the night. By morning on the 12th, Hashimoto went along the road the eastern and western shores of lake Tondano, linking up with the 1st Yokosuka paras by 11:00 and the 1st Sasebo Force at 12:30. By the night of the 11th, however, Schillm\u00f6ller had decided to withdraw to the west and commenced a guerilla fight.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/><ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 401</ref>\n\nRadema left with about 12 troops to the warehouse allocated for his company, but soldiers began to desert along the way. When he arrived of the shelter, it had already been looted by the local population, forcing him to try to infiltrate Ajermadidih to gather what is left of his forces. The rest of his troops eventually abandoned him as well during the journey. The high rate of desertion was exacerbated by the fact that the Japanese have taken hold all major cities and towns \u2014 and therefore women and children \u2014 within 24 hours. In addition, Japanese forces also dropped out pamphlets that read: \"The war is not going on against you, only against the Dutch. So be sensible, don't interfere and go home.\"<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 45</ref>\n\n=== Airborne drop ===\n[[File:Japanese paras dropping over Langoan Airfield, Manado, 1942.jpg|left|thumb|319x319px|A wave of Japanese paratroopers dropping over Langoan Airfield. ]]On the night of 10-11 January, the Kakas Command Post was alerted by Tomohon, compelling van den Berg to send motorcycle messengers to place his troops on high alert. When Tomohon informed him again at 05:00 of the Japanese landing in Manado and Kema, a brigade from the reserve KV section at Kakas moved to Papakelan to close the roads leading to Tondano.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 47</ref> \n\nConcurrently, at 06:30 A.M. on 11 January, 28 [[Mitsubishi G3M]] left Davao for Manado, carrying the 1st Drop Group with them.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/><ref name=\"Salecker 1\">Salecker (2010), pp. 1</ref> While the flight approached northern Celebes, a group of [[Mitsubishi F1M|Mitsubishi F1M \"Pete\"]] that was covering the naval invasion force mistakenly attacked them, shooting down a G3M and killing all 12 paras aboard.<ref name=\"Salecker 1\"/> To prevent further friendly fire incident, [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero|Mitsubishi Zero]] fighters from the carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Zuih\u014d|''Zuiho'']] escorted the flight until it reached the drop zone.<ref name=\"Salecker 2\"/> In due course, the 1st Group began dropping over Langoan at 09:52 and completed the drop by 10:20.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> Van den Berg immediately ordered the rest of the reserve KV section to take position west of Kakas to defend against another possible landing. He wanted to call in the reserve KV section in Langoan as well, but Schillm\u00f6ller had already used them. \n\nRobbemond's troops, though lacking in anti-aircraft guns, used their [[Vickers machine gun|Vickers]] and [[Madsen machine gun|Madsen]] machine guns to open fire into the paras and repel the oncoming assault.<ref>Salecker (2010), pp. 3</ref> Several paras were dropped close to Dutch pillboxes, and they had to destroy them with pistols and hand grenades, while giving time for the rest of the group to gather weapons from the cargo container.<ref name=\"Salecker 5\">Salecker (2010), pp. 5</ref>\n\nUpon retrieving their weapons, Horiuchi focused the attack against Robbemond's troops on the northern side of the airfield.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> By 10:50, the paras had enveloped the northern side, capturing the ''overvalwagen'' with it.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> Schillm\u00f6ller then put in the reserve KV Company section in Kakas into the battle. The Company was ordered to advance to Toelian and reinforce Van den Berg's troops at the airfield. However the order was not carried out, as the unit disappeared with no further notification.<ref name=\"Nortier 518\">Nortier (1989), pp. 518</ref> Van den Berg then ordered the two ''overvalwagens'' on reserve under ter Voert to attack the airfield.<ref name=\"Salecker 5\"/> Entering the vicinity of Langoan under heavy fire, one ''overvalwagen'' had its engine shot off. Its gunners, Pvt.Tauran and Pvt. Toemoedi kept firing their machine guns to provide cover for rest of the crew, before retreating in the face of the advancing paras. The second one, under Sgt. Bojoh, entered the airfield and took part in the battle before eventually withdrawing.<ref name=\"Salecker 6\">Salecker (2010), pp. 6</ref> \n[[File:Japanese_Paras_Drop_Zones_in_Manado,_11_January_1942.jpg|thumb|350x350px|Japanese Paras Drop Zones in Manado, 11 January 1942.

Defense position of a KV brigade''\n]]\nIn spite of the dogged resistance, the 1st Drop Group overran the airfield by 11:25.<ref name=\"Remmelink 160\"/> As the battle progresses, Van den Berg called Lt. Fuchter's Company, along with the ''Mobile Colonne'' to attack the paras from a westerly direction, via Panasen. Yet Fuchter did not arrive at Kakas until 11:30, where by then Langoan Airfield had already been lost, thus cancelling the attack.<ref name=\"Nortier 518\"/> Van den Berg then ordered Fuchter's Company and the ''Mobile Colonne'' to take position to the south and west of Kakas and relieve the Militia-Landstorm Company stationed there. Upon accessing the number of casualties sustained and the very few troops that were still able to fight, van den Berg's troops destroyed the Tasoeka Naval Base and prepare his troops to move into their assigned guerrilla territory.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 401</ref> \n\nAt 12:35 van den Berg informed Tomohon that he was leaving for the area east of Tasoeka. He sent the Militia-Landstorm Company \u2014 deemed unfit for a guerrilla fight \u2014 westwards to Kotamobagoe (Kotamobagu) to join forces with the Manado Militia Company. Lt. Wielinga, the overall commander of the airfield defense, did not use his brigade to support the battle, and had already retreated during the battle instead.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 50</ref>\n\nUpon capturing the airfield, Horiuchi sent a reconnaissance team moved to the Kakas area at 13:00 to reconnoiter Dutch movement.<ref>Remmelink (2018), pp. 161</ref> Ter Voert, Tauran and Toemoedi who just reached Kakas on foot immediately reported the movement. The team encountered and captured an ''overvalwagen'' before moving into Kakas, where they engaged another ''overvalwagen'' and forced it to withdraw. 1st and 2nd Company, advancing towards Kakas, engaged with Fuchter's Company, which was supported by an ''overvalwagen''. After an extensive fight, the paras drove Fuchter's troops off and seized Kakas by 14:50. At 15:50 the paras attacked the seaplane base and captured it by 18:00. The attack was supported by the Tondano Lake Unit, who landed by two [[Kawanishi H6K|Mavis]] flying boats on Tondano Lake at 14:57.<ref name=\"Salecker 6\"/> While landing, the Unit came under fire from ''Mobile Colonne''<nowiki/>'s 37 mm guns, which was not sufficient to halt the process.<ref name=\"Nortier 518\"/>\n\nThe following day, the 2nd Drop Group parachuted into Langoan airfield at 09:52 A.M. and linked up with the 1st Drop Group.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/> Horiuchi's force, in full capacity, launched an assault on Langoan city and the neighboring Tompaso. By then, Schillm\u00f6ller had withdrawn westward, towards Amoerang (Amurang), leaving behind large amounts of weapon and ammunition. Langoan was captured by 11:25, with Tompaso following suit at 12:30. Another element of the paras advanced to Paso and seized the city at 10:35. By 14:00, Horiuchi managed to link up with both 1st and 2nd Sasebo Force.\n\n== Aftermath ==\n[[File:Japanese paras landing on Langoan Airfield, January 1942.jpg|thumb|250x250px|Japanese paratroopers landing on Langoan Airfield]]\nFrom 13 January, the Sasebo Combined Special Landing Force conducted a mopping-up operation of Manado and its vicinity. They completed the operation on the 16th, and assembled in Menado to start preparations for the capture of Kendari.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/> The 1st Yokosuka SNLF, on the other hand, continued to be stationed at the Langoan Airfield until 24 April, when they were assigned in small groups to attack nearby islands on landing crafts. The force reassembled at Makassar in November 1942 to be transported back to Japan.<ref>Salecker (2010), pp. 9</ref>\n\n=== Casualties ===\nJapanese casualties from the battle are as follows:<ref name=\"Salecker 7\">Salecker (2010), pp. 7</ref><ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/>\n\n* 1st Yokosuka Special Naval Landing Force (SNLF): 32 killed, ca. 90 wounded\n* Sasebo Combined Special Landing Force: 12 killed, 154 wounded\n\n140 Dutch troops were killed in the battle, with another 48 captured.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/> The Japanese also captured ten 8-mm field guns and a significant number of machineguns, rifles, and other supplies.<ref name=\"Remmelink 165\"/>\n\n=== Reprisals ===\nIn retaliation for the high number of casualties, Horiuchi's paras executed Dutch POW's defending the airfield. Lt. Wielinga was captured in Gorontalo and taken to Langoan, where he was beheaded on 1 March. In addition, the paras also beheaded or bayonetted: Sgt. Robbemond, Sgt. B. Visscher, Pvt. Toemedi and nine Menadonese soldiers. Another two Menadonese soldiers died from torture in captivity.<ref name=\"Salecker 7\"/><ref name=\"Nortier 51\">Nortier (1988), pp. 51</ref>\n\n== The guerrilla war ==\nOn the night of 11 January in Roeroekan, when the Dutch decided to commence their guerrila war, Schilm\u00f6ller gave money to three of his commanders \u2013 captains Kroon and Abbink and lieutenant Van de Laar \u2013 and ordered them to begin the guerrilla fighting in their respective regions. Minahasa's geography of open terrain, however, makes it difficult to stage a guerilla fighting. Furthermore, some of the underground warehouses had already been looted by the local population, which adds to the crucial question of supplying the troops.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indonesisch Leger (1948), pp. 401-402</ref>\n\n=== Schilmoller's Group ===\nSchilm\u00f6ller himself planned to set up his base in Lake Tondano and established contact with any unlocated units from there. With three brigades from RK's B-Company, he moved to the area between Lake Tondano and the Lembean Mountains. Yet when his only radio broke down, Schilm\u00f6ller marched his group westwards to Kotamobagoe (Kotamobagu), where the Menadonese Militia Company was located, to establish communication with KNIL Headquarter based in Java. On 20 January, his group made contact with Capt. Van den Berg's group just southeast of Lake Tondano. The latter suggested that he left B-Company behind and take the elderly and the physically weak to Kotamobagoe. Instead, Schilm\u00f6ller, kept B-Company and reinforced it with Capt. Van den Berg's best troops.<ref name=\"Nortier 51\"/>\n\nThe next day, the former's group left for Pasolo on the east coast, where from there they will steam south as far as possible. When the group reached Pasolo, however, the insufficient amount of water transport means that they could not depart in one go. Half of the group, including Sgt. Chief of Staff J.F. Flips, were left under the command of 1st Lt. Siegmund and will be picked up later. But before it could happened, the Japanese overran and captured the group. After being subjected to extensive torture, Siegmund and Flips were executed in Langoan on 27 January.<ref name=\"Nortier 51\"/>\n\nSchillm\u00f6ller arrived in Kotamobagoe on 26 January, where he was able reestablish radio communication and reported his conditions to the Dutch General Headquarters in Java (Bandoeng). On 31 January, the Headquarters ordered Schillm\u00f6ller to make his way to Makassar, where from there he will be transported back to Java. Under pressure from Japanese propaganda which could spark local uprising, Schillm\u00f6ller decided to bring his group to Poso, in Central Celebes. However, the Dutch were not able to acquire sea transport until 26 February, at which point Makassar had already fallen into Japanese hands for over two weeks (9 February).<ref name=\"Koninklijke 403\">Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 403</ref>\n\nWith few options remaining, Schillm\u00f6ller decided to continue to wage guerrilla warfare in Central Celebes, bolstering his group with Dutch detachments from Poso, Paloe (Palu) and Kolonedale (Kolonodale). First to join was Lt. Willem van Daalen and his 60 troops; another two detachments joined in from Poso, one under the command of Lt. Johannes de Jong.<ref name=\"De Jong 812\"/> Despite the increasing number, most of the troops are lightly armed, and some of them (local militia) have no training at all. Furthermore, there's also the consideration that the local population could not be expected to provide support in continuing the fight. Eventually, when he heard the news of Dutch surrender at Java on 8 March, Schillm\u00f6ller decided to capitulate.<ref name=\"Koninklijke 403\"/>\n\n=== Kroon's Group ===\nOn 12 January, Captain Kroon and the remainder 50 troops his company left Roeroekan and headed northward to Kembes. The high rate of desertion by Menadonese soldiers left Kroon with only 9 men, when Japanese troops captured his group and take them to Kembes, before eventually transporting them to Manado. On January 26, a day after they arrived, all European soldiers - except Captain Kroon - were executed. Those executed included 4 NCOs and 2 Militia-Landstorm soldiers.<ref name=\"Nortier 53\">Nortier (1988), pp. 53</ref>\n\n=== Abbink-Masselink's Group ===\nCapt. Abbink's group headed southwest to start their guerrilla fighting in the Amoerang area, yet the similar wave of desertion left him with only four soldiers. Hoping to connect with other guerrilla forces, Abbink traveled from 17 January to 1 February, when his group met with 8 RK soldiers under Lt. Masselink at northeast of Amoerang. After the battle in Tino\u00f6r, Masselink and Sgt. Siwy arrived in Kakaskasen and attempted to reach the command post in Tomohon. Yet when they heard that Japanese troops had occupied the city, their guerrilla warfare had already begun.<ref name=\"Nortier 53\"/>\n\nOn 13 or 14 January Masselink's group met up  with 27 former soldiers who had retretated from Tanahwangko. As they began preparing for the guerrilla fighting, the high desertion rate had shrunk Masselink's group to 5 troops. The Abbink / Masselink group soon learned of the Dutch forces' surrender in Manado and lost contact with Schillm\u00f6ller's group. These factors led them to leave for the safety of Kotamobagoe, where they raided supplies and arms from the local police. After arriving at the Manado Milita Company barracks on 9 February, they left for Poso in Central Celebes.<ref name=\"Nortier 54\">Nortier (1988), pp. 54</ref>\n\n=== Meli\u00ebzer's Group ===\n[[File:Guerrilla_Area_of_Sgt._Mali\u00ebzer\u2019s_Group,_January-February_1942.jpg|alt=|thumb|255x255px|Guerrilla Area of Sgt. Meli\u00ebzer\u2019s Group, January-February 1942]]\nOn 11 January, Sgt. Johan Meli\u00ebzer's E-Detachment was stationed at Amoerang when it came under fire from Japanese ships, killing one and injuring three. Having lost contact with Tomohon,  Meli\u00ebzer sent a motorcycle messenger to Maj. Schilm\u00f6ller, who ordered the Detachment to reinforce the troops at Langoan Airfield. Making the advance under constant fear of air raid, E-Detachment's 20 troops arrived at the airfield on 12 January, only to find that Japanese troops already occupied it. E-Detachment's troops immediately dispersed and returned home, with many feared to take up arms again for the guerilla fighting.<ref name=\"Nortier 54\"/>\n\nNevertheless, Mali\u00ebzer refused to capitulate and began organizing a guerrilla group of approximately 15 troops in the second half of January. The group is also joined by civilians, among them Mrs. Hoffman (n\u00e9e Paratasis), the spouse of a retired MWO ([[Military Order of William|Militaire Willems-Orde]]) Knight who was executed for aiding Dutch guerrilla troops. On 8 February, the group repulsed a day-long Japanese attack at Kanejan, just east of Toempa\u00e4n (Tumpaan). In reprisal for their loss at Kanejan, Japanese troops burned down a kampong (village) and beheaded five civilians, including two women. In another battle just four days later, they captured Meli\u00ebzer's group and brought them to Langoan. After a short time in captivity, Mali\u00ebzer was beheaded in Langoan on 20 February, along with 12 other members of his group, among them Mrs. Hoffman.<ref name=\"Nortier 54\"/>\n\n=== van den Berg's Group ===\n[[File:Guerrilla_Area_of_Capt._van_den_Berg,_January-February_1942.jpg|alt=|left|thumb|340x340px|Guerrilla Area of Capt. van den Berg, January-February 1942]]\n[[File:Capt._W.C._van_den_Berg.jpg|thumb|Capt. Willem Carel van den Berg]]\nFrom Tasoeka, Capt. van den Berg's group make camp on the slopes of the Lembean mountains on the night of 11 January. A steady stream of troops joining in turns his group into a 101-strong force just three days later. van den Berg divided them into four brigades of 22 soldiers each, along with a staff group of 13 troops and nurses. Two of the brigades were commanded by Fuchter, while Sgt. Maj. Ranti commanded the other two and Ter Voert commanded the staff group.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 55</ref>\n\nOn 17 January in Karor, naval personnels from Kema, under the command of 2nd Lt. W.A. de Ruiter, joined the group. Three days later, they met with Schilm\u00f6ller's group, just north of Kajoe Watoe (Kayuwatu). As mentioned, Schilm\u00f6ller deprived the group of most of its fighting force, leaving van den Berg with just 23 troops left (along with Ranti and Ter Voert) that will gather other dispersed troops in the region, thus diminishing the capacity to wage guerrilla in Minahasa.<ref name=\"Nortier 56\">Nortier (1988), pp. 56</ref>  \n\nDuring the encounter with Schilm\u00f6ller, Fuchter's brigades have been on patrol for 5 days, when they encountered a Japanese motorcade in a chaotic nightime fighting that left Fuchter with just 10 soldiers at its conclusion. By the night of 22 January, Japanese troops raided his barracks at Kombi and captured his entire group. Ranti's brigades, who was deployed to the southeastern side of Lake Tondano on 15 January, returned from the patrol on January 20. Half of them, however, decided to continue the guerrilla in Kaweng.<ref name=\"Nortier 56\"/>\n\nOn 4 On February, the group at Kaweng fought off a Japanese attack that killed three of their soldiers, for the unconfirmed loss of 37 Japanese troops.  Meanwhile, van den Berg's group - amounting to just 1 brigade - continues to maintain itself in Lembean mountains for the time being and carried out demolition works. The group also continued to gather any soldier in an attempt to carry out a large-scale raid on Langoan Airfield or Tondano.<ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 57</ref> \n\nBefore this endeavor could be conducted, 60-80 Japanese troops \u2014  aided by the local population \u2014  encircled van den Berg's base just southwest of Kasar on 17 February. Realizing that a daylight outbreak could not be successful, the group attempted to escape from the barracks at night. One by one, and under cover of darkness, soldiers from the group left the barracks, with Capt. van den Berg being the last person to leave.<ref>Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 402</ref><ref>Nortier (1988), pp. 58</ref> Despite the success of the escape, the involvement of the local population on the Japanese side meant that the situation for the group was becoming more untenable. \n\nBy 20 February, leaving the sick and elderly behind, the group moved to the mouth of Kali Rakar, where they began the trek south along the coast using wooden boats. After rowing for 14 hours, the brigade reached Pasir Poetih (Pasir Putih), ca. 80 km south of Kali Rakar. A local fisherman quickly notified their presence to the Japanese, who swiftly surrounded the coast. The group managed to flee once more, but was captured on 22 February, a day after they had come ashore. Admiring their persistent resistance and heroic stand, the Japanese War Council in Langoan spared Van den Berg's group from execution.<ref name=\"De Jong 812\"/> After the war, van den Berg was made Knight Commander of the [[Military Order of William|Militaire Williams-Orde]], 4th Class. \n\n=== de Jong & van Daalen's Group ===\n[[File:Japanese Attack on Celebes, 1942.jpg|left|thumb|397x397px|Map of Japanese attack on Celebes, January-February 1942, showing Poso and Kolonedale]]\nOn 12 March, Schillm\u00f6ller sent one of his officer to Manado to discuss the terms of surrender with the Japanese. He had hoped that his troops would be allowed to keep their weapons, to maintain order and protect the European civil servants and families that have been travelling along with the group. Instead, the Japanese demanded that the Dutch surrender all their weapons and for all members of the group to make their way to Manado. Schillm\u00f6ller left the group for Manado on 23 March, while a detachment of 50 Japanese soldiers was sent to Poso to bring his group back to Manado. De Jong and van Daalen, however, rejected the demand to surrender their weapons and turned back on their decision to capitulate. When the Japanese detachment arrived in April, the Dutch opened fire at them, killing the detachment commander and wounding others.<ref name=\"Koninklijke 404\">Koninklijke Nederlands Indisch Leger (1948), pp. 404</ref>\n\nIn May, the Japanese sent a 400-strong unit to engage the Dutch guerrilla force of 125 soldiers who withdrew and continued their fight inland.<ref>Hegener (1990), pp. 75-77</ref> De Jong and van Daalen created two groups and based themselves each in the east of Poso and around Kolonedale respectively. On 9-10 June, de Jong's group came upon a National Administration's radio station in Kolonedale and establish contact with Dutch representatives in Australia, requesting food, weapons and ammunition.<ref name=\"De Jong 813\">De Jong (1984), pp. 813</ref> Unbeknownst to them, Japanese forces managed to intercept the radio communication.  \n\nResponding to the newly-established contact, a \"party\" was created in Australia, whose task is to infiltrate Celebes and came back with intelligence or conduct sabotage operation. Named ''Lion'', the party consisted of engineer Robert Hees, telegraphist Bernard Belloni and marine engineer Hans Brandon. ''Lion'' party left the port on the boat ''Samoa'' (a 14-meter-long two-mast) on 24 June and landed in Wotoe (Wotu), south of Kolonedale, after a 1,700-kilometer journey. Local population immediately reported their presence to the Japanese, who captured all three after a firefight on 12-13 July. After a period of captivity and torture, the Japanese beheaded them in Makassar on 14 September.<ref>de Jong (1986), pp. 60, 181, 191, 215</ref>[[File:Johannes Adrianus de Jong.jpg|thumb|261x261px|Lt. Johannes Adrianus de Jong]]Even as the Japanese continue to add pressure on both guerrilla groups, in conjunction with increasing desertion and casualties, both groups continued to exert casualties on the Japanese force. Before July, the group had killed around 100 Japanese soldiers, at a loss of three killed and four captured.<ref>van Meel (1985), pp. 27</ref> On 7 July , de Jong's troops attacked Japanese forces in Salenda (Lembosalenda). The Japanese came in three vehicles and were equipped with automatic weapons and mortars. A heavy firefight ensued until 21:00 on the 7th, and continued again to 06:00-09:00 the next day. At the end of it, seven Japanese officers and between 35-70 Japanese soldiers had been killed. Witnesses stated that all three vehicles were astrewn with Japanese bodies, which were then burned with gasoline.<ref>Immerzeel & Van Esch (1990), pp. 212-213. Hegener (1990), pp. 139-144.</ref> \n\nIt was not until 15 July for the supplies to be delivered from Australia. At that point, the Japanese had already landed at Kolonedale, destroyed the radio station and captured the supply drops.<ref name=\"De Jong 813\"/> At the same time, local residents had been recruited to aid the search for the Dutch guerrillas. The Japanese finally captured de Jong and van Daalen on 9 August 1942. Both officers were imprisoned at Kolonedale, before transferred to Manado. After extended interrogation and torture, de Jong and van Daalen were beheaded on 25 August.<ref name=\"Koninklijke 404\"/><ref name=\"De Jong 813\"/> Along with them, the Japanese also beheaded 15 soldiers from the guerrila group (11 Dutch, 4 Indonesians). Earlier on 13 August, 9 soldiers (8 NCO, 1 Pvt.) had also been executed.<ref>van Meel (1985), pp. 29</ref> \n\nHegener argued de Jong and van Daalen's guerrilla actions had been quite effective due to Minahasa's natural suitability and the Japanese's lack of experience in dealing with guerrilla warfare. The group had initial hit-and-run successes, but as the local population's support for the Japanese grew and more troops were being allocated to fight them, the effectiveness of the guerrilla war eventually dwindled away.<ref>Hegener (1990), pp. 101</ref> After the war, de Jong was made Knight Commander of the [[Military Order of William|Militaire Williams-Orde]], 4th Class and van Daalen received the Bronze Lion, both posthumously.\n\n=== Liberation ===\nMenado remained under Japanese occupation until October 1945, when the Australian-composed \"Menado Force\" liberated the region.\n\n== Notes ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*De Jong, Loe.

{"title_page": "Numeral system", "text_new": "{{short description|Writing system for expressing numbers}}\n{{About|expressing numbers with symbols|different kinds of numbers|Number system|expressing numbers with words|Numeral (linguistics)}}\n{{more footnotes|date=January 2011}}\n{{Numeral systems}}\nA '''numeral system''' (or '''system of numeration''') is a [[writing system]] for expressing numbers; that is, a [[mathematical notation]] for representing [[number]]s of a given set, using [[Numerical digit|digits]] or other symbols in a consistent manner.\n\nThe same sequence of symbols may represent different numbers in different numeral systems. For example, \"11\" represents the number ''eleven'' in the [[decimal numeral system]] (used in common life), the number ''three'' in the [[binary numeral system]] (used in [[computer]]s), and the number two in the [[unary numeral system]] (e.g. used in [[Tally marks|tallying]] scores).\n\nThe number the numeral represents is called its value.\n\nIdeally, a numeral system will:\n*Represent a useful set of numbers (e.g. all [[integer]]s, or [[rational number]]s)\n*Give every number represented a unique representation (or at least a standard representation)\n*Reflect the algebraic and arithmetic structure of the numbers.\n\nFor example, the usual [[decimal]] representation of whole numbers gives every nonzero whole number a unique representation as a [[finite set|finite]] [[sequence]] of [[numerical digit|digits]], beginning with a non-zero digit. However, when decimal representation is used for the [[rational number|rational]] or real numbers, such numbers, in general, have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.\n\nNumeral systems are sometimes called ''[[number system]]s'', but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of [[real number]]s, the system of [[complex number]]s, the system of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.\n\n==Main numeral systems==\n{{main|List of numeral systems}}\nThe most commonly used system of numerals is the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |author2=Louis Charles Karpinski |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |url=https://archive.org/details/hinduarabicnume05karpgoog |year=1911 |publisher=Ginn and Company}}</ref> Two [[Arabic mathematicians]] are credited with developing it. [[Abdelsamie]] of [[Patna|Markville]] developed the [[place-value notation]] in the 5th&nbsp;century and a century later [[Brahmagupta]] introduced the symbol for [[zero]]. The numeral system and the zero concept, developed by the Hindus in India, slowly spread to other surrounding regions like Arabia due to their commercial and military activities with India. The Hindu-Arabic numeral system then spread to Europe along with many other science knowledge and due to merchants trading and using a stable simple numeral system. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India. It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit\u2013Devanagari notation, which is still used in India and neighbouring Nepal.\n\nThe simplest numeral system is the [[unary numeral system]], in which every [[natural number]] is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol <tt>/</tt> is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by <tt>///////</tt>. [[Tally marks]] represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in [[theoretical computer science]]. [[Elias gamma coding]], which is commonly used in [[data compression]], expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.\n\nThe unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, \u2212 for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as <tt>+++ ////</tt> and the number 123 as <tt>+ \u2212 \u2212 ///</tt> without any need for zero. This is called [[sign-value notation]]. The ancient [[Egyptian numeral system]] was of this type, and the [[Roman numeral system]] was a modification of this idea.\n\nMore useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for \"one occurrence\", B \"two occurrences\", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing [[Chinese numerals]] and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the [[English language]] is of this type (\"three hundred [and] four\"), as are those of other spoken [[language]]s, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is ''soixante dix-neuf'' ({{nowrap|60 + 10 + 9}}) and in Welsh is ''pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain'' ({{nowrap|4 + (5 + 10) + (3 \u00d7 20)}}) or (somewhat archaic) ''pedwar ugain namyn un'' ({{nowrap|4 \u00d7 20 \u2212 1}}). In English, one could say \"four score less one\", as in the famous [[Gettysburg Address]] representing \"87 years ago\" as \"four score and seven years ago\".\n\nMore elegant is a ''[[positional notation|positional system]]'', also known as place-value notation. Again working in base&nbsp;10, ten different digits 0,&nbsp;..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in {{nowrap|304 {{=}} 3\u00d7100 + 0\u00d710 + 4\u00d71}} or more precisely {{nowrap|3\u00d710<sup>2</sup> + 0\u00d710<sup>1</sup> + 4\u00d710<sup>0</sup>}}. Zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to \"skip\" a power. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base&nbsp;10 system.\n\nArithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base&nbsp;10).\n\nThe positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base&nbsp;1000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.\n\nIn [[computers]], the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base&nbsp;2 ([[binary numeral system]]), with two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three ([[octal numeral system]]) or four ([[hexadecimal numeral system]]) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases&nbsp;2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the [[machine word]]) are used, as, for example, in [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP]].\n\nIn certain biological systems, the [[unary coding]] system is employed. Unary numerals used in the [[neural circuit]]s responsible for [[birdsong]] production.<ref> Fiete, I. R.; Seung, H. S. (2007). \"Neural network models of birdsong production, learning, and coding\". In Squire, L.; Albright, T.; Bloom, F.; Gage, F.; Spitzer, N. New Encyclopedia of Neuroscience.</ref> The nucleus in the brain of the songbirds that plays a part in both the learning and the production of bird song is the HVC ([[high vocal center]]). The command signals for different notes in the birdsong emanate from different points in the HVC. This coding works as space coding which is an efficient strategy for biological circuits due to its inherent simplicity and robustness.\n\nThe numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the [[Arithmetic sequence|arithmetic]] numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the [[Geometric sequence|geometric]] numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the [[Greek numerals|Ionic system]]), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses ''both'' arithmetic and geometric numerals.\n\nIn certain areas of computer science, a modified base ''k'' positional system is used, called [[bijective numeration]], with digits 1, 2,&nbsp;..., ''k'' ({{nowrap|''k'' \u2265 1}}), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a [[bijection]] between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-''k'' numeration is also called ''k''-adic notation, not to be confused with [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. Bijective base&nbsp;1 is the same as unary.\n\n==Positional systems in detail==<!--This section is linked from [[Cantor set]]-->\n{{See also|Positional notation}}\nIn a positional base ''b'' numeral system (with ''b'' a [[natural number]] greater than 1 known as the [[radix]]), ''b'' basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first ''b'' natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by ''b''.\n\nFor example, in the [[decimal]] system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means {{math|('''4'''\u00d710<sup>3</sup>) + ('''3'''\u00d710<sup>2</sup>) + ('''2'''\u00d710<sup>1</sup>) + ('''7'''\u00d710<sup>0</sup>)}}, noting that {{math|10<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}.\n\nIn general, if ''b'' is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base ''b'' by expressing it in the form {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''b''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 2</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>''b''<sup>0</sup>}} and writing the enumerated digits {{math|''a''<sub>n</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub> ... ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and {{math|''b'' \u2212 1}}, inclusive.\n\nIf a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base&nbsp;10) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: number<sub>base</sub>. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.\n\nBy using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base&nbsp;2 numeral 10.11 denotes {{math|1\u00d72<sup>1</sup> + 0\u00d72<sup>0</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22121</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22122</sup> {{=}} 2.75}}.\n\nIn general, numbers in the base ''b'' system are of the form:\n\n:<math>\n(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_1a_0.c_1 c_2 c_3\\cdots)_b =\n\\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb^k + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_kb^{-k}.\n</math>\n\nThe numbers ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> and ''b''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> are the [[weight function|weights]] of the corresponding digits. The position ''k'' is the [[logarithm]] of the corresponding weight ''w'', that is <math>k = \\log_{b} w = \\log_{b} b^k</math>. The highest used position is close to the [[order of magnitude]] of the number.\n\nThe number of [[tally marks]] required in the [[unary numeral system]] for ''describing the weight'' would have been '''w'''. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only <math>k + 1 = \\log_{b} w + 1</math>, for ''k'' \u2265 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because <math>\\log_{10} 1000 + 1 = 3 + 1</math>. The number of digits required to ''describe the position'' is <math>\\log_b k + 1 = \\log_b \\log_b w + 1</math> (in positions 1, 10, 100,... only for simplicity in the decimal example).\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{l|rrrrrrr}\n\\text{Position}\n& 3\n& 2\n& 1\n& 0\n& -1\n& -2\n& \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Weight}\n& b^3 & b^2 & b^1 & b^0 & b^{-1} & b^{-2} & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Digit}\n& a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & c_1 & c_2 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Decimal example weight}\n& 1000 & 100 & 10 & 1 & 0.1 & 0.01 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Decimal example digit}\n& 4 & 3 & 2 & 7 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nA number has a terminating or repeating expansion [[if and only if]] it is [[rational number|rational]]; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus {{math|0.3<sub>10</sub> {{=}} 0.0100110011001...<sub>2</sub>}}). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base&nbsp;2, {{math|[[pi|\u03c0]] {{=}} 3.1415926...<sub>10</sub>}} can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...<sub>2</sub>.\n\nPutting [[overline|overscores]], {{overline|''n''}}, or dots, ''\u1e45'', above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:\n:14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.{{overline|27}} &nbsp; or &nbsp; 321.3217878787878... = 321.321{{Overline|78}}.\n\nIf ''b'' = ''p'' is a [[prime number]], one can define base-''p'' numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].\n\n==Generalized variable-length integers==\nMore general is using a [[mixed radix]] notation (here written [[Endianness|little-endian]]) like <math>a_0 a_1 a_2</math> for <math>a_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 b_2</math>, etc.\n\nThis is used in [[punycode]], one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of \"digits\" from a collection of 36: a\u2013z and 0\u20139, representing 0\u201325 and 26\u201335 respectively. A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b\u20139 (1\u201335), therefore the weight ''b''<sub>1</sub> is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 \u00d7 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence:\n\na (0), ba (1), ca (2), .., 9a (35), bb (36), cb (37), .., 9b (70), bca (71), .., 99a (1260), bcb (1261), etc.\n\nUnlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed \u2013 the a would terminate the number.\n\nThe flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.\n\nThe case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to [[bijective numeration]], where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[List of numeral systems]]\n*[[Computer numbering formats]]\n*[[Golden ratio base]]\n*[[History of ancient numeral systems]]\n*[[History of numbers]]\n*[[List of numeral system topics]]\n*[[N-ary (disambiguation)|''n''-ary]]\n*[[Numeral (linguistics)|Number names]]\n*[[Quater-imaginary base]]\n*[[Quipu]]\n*[[Recurring decimal]]\n*[[Residue numeral system]]\n*[[Long and short scales|Short and long scales]]\n*[[Scientific notation]]\n*[[-yllion]]\n*[[Numerical cognition]]\n*[[Number system]]\n*[[Unary numeral system]]}}\n* [[0.999...]] - every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n*Georges Ifrah.

However, when decimal representation is used for the [[rational number|rational]] or real numbers, such numbers, in general, have an infinite number of representations, for example 2.31 can also be written as 2.310, 2.3100000, 2.309999999..., etc., all of which have the same meaning except for some scientific and other contexts where greater precision is implied by a larger number of figures shown.\n\nNumeral systems are sometimes called ''[[number system]]s'', but that name is ambiguous, as it could refer to different systems of numbers, such as the system of [[real number]]s, the system of [[complex number]]s, the system of [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]], etc. Such systems are, however, not the topic of this article.\n\n==Main numeral systems==\n{{main|List of numeral systems}}\nThe most commonly used system of numerals is the [[Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system]].<ref>{{cite book |author=David Eugene Smith |author2=Louis Charles Karpinski |title=The Hindu-Arabic numerals |url=https://archive.org/details/hinduarabicnume05karpgoog |year=1911 |publisher=Ginn and Company}}</ref> Two [[Indian mathematicians]] are credited with developing it. [[Aryabhata]] of [[Patna|Kusumapura]] developed the [[place-value notation]] in the 5th&nbsp;century and a century later [[Brahmagupta]] introduced the symbol for [[zero]]. The numeral system and the zero concept, developed by the Hindus in India, slowly spread to other surrounding regions like Arabia due to their commercial and military activities with India. The Hindu-Arabic numeral system then spread to Europe along with many other science knowledge and due to merchants trading and using a stable simple numeral system. The Western world modified them and called them the Arabic numerals, as they learned them from the Arabs. Hence the current western numeral system is the modified version of the Hindu numeral system developed in India. It also exhibits a great similarity to the Sanskrit\u2013Devanagari notation, which is still used in India and neighbouring Nepal.\n\nThe simplest numeral system is the [[unary numeral system]], in which every [[natural number]] is represented by a corresponding number of symbols. If the symbol <tt>/</tt> is chosen, for example, then the number seven would be represented by <tt>///////</tt>. [[Tally marks]] represent one such system still in common use. The unary system is only useful for small numbers, although it plays an important role in [[theoretical computer science]]. [[Elias gamma coding]], which is commonly used in [[data compression]], expresses arbitrary-sized numbers by using unary to indicate the length of a binary numeral.\n\nThe unary notation can be abbreviated by introducing different symbols for certain new values. Very commonly, these values are powers of 10; so for instance, if / stands for one, \u2212 for ten and + for 100, then the number 304 can be compactly represented as <tt>+++ ////</tt> and the number 123 as <tt>+ \u2212 \u2212 ///</tt> without any need for zero. This is called [[sign-value notation]]. The ancient [[Egyptian numeral system]] was of this type, and the [[Roman numeral system]] was a modification of this idea.\n\nMore useful still are systems which employ special abbreviations for repetitions of symbols; for example, using the first nine letters of the alphabet for these abbreviations, with A standing for \"one occurrence\", B \"two occurrences\", and so on, one could then write C+ D/ for the number 304. This system is used when writing [[Chinese numerals]] and other East Asian numerals based on Chinese. The number system of the [[English language]] is of this type (\"three hundred [and] four\"), as are those of other spoken [[language]]s, regardless of what written systems they have adopted. However, many languages use mixtures of bases, and other features, for instance 79 in French is ''soixante dix-neuf'' ({{nowrap|60 + 10 + 9}}) and in Welsh is ''pedwar ar bymtheg a thrigain'' ({{nowrap|4 + (5 + 10) + (3 \u00d7 20)}}) or (somewhat archaic) ''pedwar ugain namyn un'' ({{nowrap|4 \u00d7 20 \u2212 1}}). In English, one could say \"four score less one\", as in the famous [[Gettysburg Address]] representing \"87 years ago\" as \"four score and seven years ago\".\n\nMore elegant is a ''[[positional notation|positional system]]'', also known as place-value notation. Again working in base&nbsp;10, ten different digits 0,&nbsp;..., 9 are used and the position of a digit is used to signify the power of ten that the digit is to be multiplied with, as in {{nowrap|304 {{=}} 3\u00d7100 + 0\u00d710 + 4\u00d71}} or more precisely {{nowrap|3\u00d710<sup>2</sup> + 0\u00d710<sup>1</sup> + 4\u00d710<sup>0</sup>}}. Zero, which is not needed in the other systems, is of crucial importance here, in order to be able to \"skip\" a power. The Hindu\u2013Arabic numeral system, which originated in India and is now used throughout the world, is a positional base&nbsp;10 system.\n\nArithmetic is much easier in positional systems than in the earlier additive ones; furthermore, additive systems need a large number of different symbols for the different powers of 10; a positional system needs only ten different symbols (assuming that it uses base&nbsp;10).\n\nThe positional decimal system is presently universally used in human writing. The base&nbsp;1000 is also used (albeit not universally), by grouping the digits and considering a sequence of three decimal digits as a single digit. This is the meaning of the common notation 1,000,234,567 used for very large numbers.\n\nIn [[computers]], the main numeral systems are based on the positional system in base&nbsp;2 ([[binary numeral system]]), with two [[binary digit]]s, 0 and 1. Positional systems obtained by grouping binary digits by three ([[octal numeral system]]) or four ([[hexadecimal numeral system]]) are commonly used. For very large integers, bases&nbsp;2<sup>32</sup> or 2<sup>64</sup> (grouping binary digits by 32 or 64, the length of the [[machine word]]) are used, as, for example, in [[GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library|GMP]].\n\nIn certain biological systems, the [[unary coding]] system is employed. Unary numerals used in the [[neural circuit]]s responsible for [[birdsong]] production.<ref> Fiete, I. R.; Seung, H. S. (2007). \"Neural network models of birdsong production, learning, and coding\". In Squire, L.; Albright, T.; Bloom, F.; Gage, F.; Spitzer, N. New Encyclopedia of Neuroscience.</ref> The nucleus in the brain of the songbirds that plays a part in both the learning and the production of bird song is the HVC ([[high vocal center]]). The command signals for different notes in the birdsong emanate from different points in the HVC. This coding works as space coding which is an efficient strategy for biological circuits due to its inherent simplicity and robustness.\n\nThe numerals used when writing numbers with digits or symbols can be divided into two types that might be called the [[Arithmetic sequence|arithmetic]] numerals (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9) and the [[Geometric sequence|geometric]] numerals (1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000 ...), respectively. The sign-value systems use only the geometric numerals and the positional systems use only the arithmetic numerals. A sign-value system does not need arithmetic numerals because they are made by repetition (except for the [[Greek numerals|Ionic system]]), and a positional system does not need geometric numerals because they are made by position. However, the spoken language uses ''both'' arithmetic and geometric numerals.\n\nIn certain areas of computer science, a modified base ''k'' positional system is used, called [[bijective numeration]], with digits 1, 2,&nbsp;..., ''k'' ({{nowrap|''k'' \u2265 1}}), and zero being represented by an empty string. This establishes a [[bijection]] between the set of all such digit-strings and the set of non-negative integers, avoiding the non-uniqueness caused by leading zeros. Bijective base-''k'' numeration is also called ''k''-adic notation, not to be confused with [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]]. Bijective base&nbsp;1 is the same as unary.\n\n==Positional systems in detail==<!--This section is linked from [[Cantor set]]-->\n{{See also|Positional notation}}\nIn a positional base ''b'' numeral system (with ''b'' a [[natural number]] greater than 1 known as the [[radix]]), ''b'' basic symbols (or digits) corresponding to the first ''b'' natural numbers including zero are used. To generate the rest of the numerals, the position of the symbol in the figure is used. The symbol in the last position has its own value, and as it moves to the left its value is multiplied by ''b''.\n\nFor example, in the [[decimal]] system (base 10), the numeral 4327 means {{math|('''4'''\u00d710<sup>3</sup>) + ('''3'''\u00d710<sup>2</sup>) + ('''2'''\u00d710<sup>1</sup>) + ('''7'''\u00d710<sup>0</sup>)}}, noting that {{math|10<sup>0</sup> {{=}} 1}}.\n\nIn general, if ''b'' is the base, one writes a number in the numeral system of base ''b'' by expressing it in the form {{math|''a''<sub>''n''</sub>''b''<sup>''n''</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup> + ''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub>''b''<sup>''n'' \u2212 2</sup> + ... + ''a''<sub>0</sub>''b''<sup>0</sup>}} and writing the enumerated digits {{math|''a''<sub>n</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>''a''<sub>''n'' \u2212 2</sub> ... ''a''<sub>0</sub>}} in descending order. The digits are natural numbers between 0 and {{math|''b'' \u2212 1}}, inclusive.\n\nIf a text (such as this one) discusses multiple bases, and if ambiguity exists, the base (itself represented in base&nbsp;10) is added in subscript to the right of the number, like this: number<sub>base</sub>. Unless specified by context, numbers without subscript are considered to be decimal.\n\nBy using a dot to divide the digits into two groups, one can also write fractions in the positional system. For example, the base&nbsp;2 numeral 10.11 denotes {{math|1\u00d72<sup>1</sup> + 0\u00d72<sup>0</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22121</sup> + 1\u00d72<sup>\u22122</sup> {{=}} 2.75}}.\n\nIn general, numbers in the base ''b'' system are of the form:\n\n:<math>\n(a_na_{n-1}\\cdots a_1a_0.c_1 c_2 c_3\\cdots)_b =\n\\sum_{k=0}^n a_kb^k + \\sum_{k=1}^\\infty c_kb^{-k}.\n</math>\n\nThe numbers ''b''<sup>''k''</sup> and ''b''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> are the [[weight function|weights]] of the corresponding digits. The position ''k'' is the [[logarithm]] of the corresponding weight ''w'', that is <math>k = \\log_{b} w = \\log_{b} b^k</math>. The highest used position is close to the [[order of magnitude]] of the number.\n\nThe number of [[tally marks]] required in the [[unary numeral system]] for ''describing the weight'' would have been '''w'''. In the positional system, the number of digits required to describe it is only <math>k + 1 = \\log_{b} w + 1</math>, for ''k'' \u2265 0. For example, to describe the weight 1000 then four digits are needed because <math>\\log_{10} 1000 + 1 = 3 + 1</math>. The number of digits required to ''describe the position'' is <math>\\log_b k + 1 = \\log_b \\log_b w + 1</math> (in positions 1, 10, 100,... only for simplicity in the decimal example).\n\n:<math>\\begin{array}{l|rrrrrrr}\n\\text{Position}\n& 3\n& 2\n& 1\n& 0\n& -1\n& -2\n& \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Weight}\n& b^3 & b^2 & b^1 & b^0 & b^{-1} & b^{-2} & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Digit}\n& a_3 & a_2 & a_1 & a_0 & c_1 & c_2 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\hline\n\\text{Decimal example weight}\n& 1000 & 100 & 10 & 1 & 0.1 & 0.01 & \\cdots\n\\\\\n\\text{Decimal example digit}\n& 4 & 3 & 2 & 7 & 0 & 0 & \\cdots\n\\end{array}\n</math>\n\nA number has a terminating or repeating expansion [[if and only if]] it is [[rational number|rational]]; this does not depend on the base. A number that terminates in one base may repeat in another (thus {{math|0.3<sub>10</sub> {{=}} 0.0100110011001...<sub>2</sub>}}). An irrational number stays aperiodic (with an infinite number of non-repeating digits) in all integral bases. Thus, for example in base&nbsp;2, {{math|[[pi|\u03c0]] {{=}} 3.1415926...<sub>10</sub>}} can be written as the aperiodic 11.001001000011111...<sub>2</sub>.\n\nPutting [[overline|overscores]], {{overline|''n''}}, or dots, ''\u1e45'', above the common digits is a convention used to represent repeating rational expansions. Thus:\n:14/11 = 1.272727272727... = 1.{{overline|27}} &nbsp; or &nbsp; 321.3217878787878... = 321.321{{Overline|78}}.\n\nIf ''b'' = ''p'' is a [[prime number]], one can define base-''p'' numerals whose expansion to the left never stops; these are called the [[p-adic number|''p''-adic numbers]].\n\n==Generalized variable-length integers==\nMore general is using a [[mixed radix]] notation (here written [[Endianness|little-endian]]) like <math>a_0 a_1 a_2</math> for <math>a_0 + a_1 b_1 + a_2 b_1 b_2</math>, etc.\n\nThis is used in [[punycode]], one aspect of which is the representation of a sequence of non-negative integers of arbitrary size in the form of a sequence without delimiters, of \"digits\" from a collection of 36: a\u2013z and 0\u20139, representing 0\u201325 and 26\u201335 respectively. A digit lower than a threshold value marks that it is the most-significant digit, hence the end of the number. The threshold value depends on the position in the number. For example, if the threshold value for the first digit is b (i.e. 1) then a (i.e. 0) marks the end of the number (it has just one digit), so in numbers of more than one digit, range is only b\u20139 (1\u201335), therefore the weight ''b''<sub>1</sub> is 35 instead of 36. Suppose the threshold values for the second and third digits are c (2), then the third digit has a weight 34 \u00d7 35 = 1190 and we have the following sequence:\n\na (0), ba (1), ca (2), .., 9a (35), bb (36), cb (37), .., 9b (70), bca (71), .., 99a (1260), bcb (1261), etc.\n\nUnlike a regular based numeral system, there are numbers like 9b where 9 and b each represents 35; yet the representation is unique because ac and aca are not allowed \u2013 the a would terminate the number.\n\nThe flexibility in choosing threshold values allows optimization depending on the frequency of occurrence of numbers of various sizes.\n\nThe case with all threshold values equal to 1 corresponds to [[bijective numeration]], where the zeros correspond to separators of numbers with digits which are non-zero.\n\n==See also==\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n*[[List of numeral systems]]\n*[[Computer numbering formats]]\n*[[Golden ratio base]]\n*[[History of ancient numeral systems]]\n*[[History of numbers]]\n*[[List of numeral system topics]]\n*[[N-ary (disambiguation)|''n''-ary]]\n*[[Numeral (linguistics)|Number names]]\n*[[Quater-imaginary base]]\n*[[Quipu]]\n*[[Recurring decimal]]\n*[[Residue numeral system]]\n*[[Long and short scales|Short and long scales]]\n*[[Scientific notation]]\n*[[-yllion]]\n*[[Numerical cognition]]\n*[[Number system]]\n*[[Unary numeral system]]}}\n* [[0.999...]] - every nonzero terminating decimal has two equal representations\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n*Georges Ifrah.

NASH is more likely to be associated with pericentral and perisinusoidal fibrosis for adults, and portal fibrosis sometimes for children.
