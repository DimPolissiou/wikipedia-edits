He graduated from the Nikolaevskii General Staff Academy in 1896. Yanushkevich briefly served as a staff officer in the provinces before returning to the Life Guards as a company commander. From 1898 he served in a series of important administrative roles within the ministry of war, inc. Head of the Legislative Section of the Chancellery of the Minister of War (1905-1911) and Assistant Manager of the Chancellery of the Minister of War (1911-1913). Yanushkevich was appointed professor at the Nikolaevskii General Staff Academy (1910-1911) and became its head in 1913-14. He was appointed [[Chief of the General Staff (Russia)|Chief of the General Staff]] in March 1914  and became Chief of Staff to the Supreme Commander in Chief, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich]], at the outset of the war.\n\nYanushkevich was poorly qualified for the post of Chief of Staff. He had spent most of his career occupied by administrative duties in the [[Ministry of War of the Russian Empire|Ministry of War]]. He had never held a field commission and his command experience was extremely limited, being confined to a short period as a company commander.<ref>Alfred Knox, ''With the Russian Army 1914-1917'' (London, 1921) vol. I p42</ref> Historian Norman Stone derisively describes Yanushkevich as a \u2018clerk\u2019.<ref>Norman Stone, ''The Eastern Front 1914-1917'' (London, 1975) p26</ref>\n\nThe British military attach\u00e9 to the Russian Army during the war claims that Yanushkevich owed his high position largely to his skills as a courtier and was rumoured to have found favour with the tsar when serving as a captain of the palace guard.<ref>Knox, ''With the Russian Army'' vol. I pp42, 331</ref> Stone alternatively ascribes Yanushkevich\u2019s position to War Minister [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov|V.A. Sukhomlinov]]\u2019s practice of appointing officers  unlikely to threaten his own position, and only for a short period of time, to the post of Chief of the General Staff \u2013 \u2018[He was]\u2026chosen in the usual Sukhomlinov way to prevent anyone dangerous from taking over the job, and surviving in it from sheer force of characterlessness.\u2019<ref>Stone, ''The Eastern Front'', p52</ref> Historian David R.

According to Stone both he and the Supreme Commander, [[Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich of Russia (1856\u20131929)|Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich]], were mere figureheads\u2014command of the Russian armies was effectively exercised by the ostensible third-in-command, Quartermaster-General [[Yuri Danilov|Yu. N. Danilov]], a close associate of [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov|Sukhomlinov]].  Danilov was supported by a staff of fifteen whereas Yanushkevich had a single adjutant and spent part of his time developing his taste for pornography.<ref>Stone, ''The Eastern Front'', p. 52</ref> According to the Russian Minister of War [[Sukhomlinov]] in his memoirs he did not, all the briefing with through the hands of Nikolai Yanushkevich, his assistant.<ref>Vladimir Sukhomlinov (1924). ''Erinnerungen', pp. 360\u2013365</ref> The deeply anti-semitic Yanushkevich, however, played a leading role in the indiscriminate persecutions of Jews that accompanied the so-called \"Great Retreat\" of 1915.<ref>See Eric Lohr. \"The Russian Army and the Jews: Mass Deportation, Hostages, and Violence during World War I\", ''Russian Review'' 2001 60(3), pp. 404\u2013419</ref>\n\nYanushkevich was dismissed from his post in September 1915 as [[Tsar Nicholas II]] took personal charge of the Russian armies with [[Mikhail Alexeyev|M.V. Alekseev]] as his Chief of Staff.  At the insistence of Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich, Yanushkevich continued to serve as his chief-of-staff after the latter\u2019s dismissal as Supreme Commander and appointment to the post of Viceroy of the Caucasus.<ref>Knox, ''With the Russian Army'' vol. I p 332</ref>\n\nRetired from active service after the [[February Revolution]], at the start of 1918 Yanushkevich was arrested in [[Mogilev]] and sent to [[Petrograd]] but was killed by his guards en route.\n\n==Honours and awards==\n* [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]], 3rd class (1893); 2nd class (1902); 1st class (10 April 1911)\n* [[Order of St. Anna]], 3rd class (1898); 1st class (29 December 1913)\n* [[Order of St. Vladimir]], 4th class (1905); 3rd class (1907)\n* [[Order of St. George]], 4th class (23 September 1914)\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.firstworldwar.com/bio/yanushkevich.htm Short biography]\n* [[Vladimir Gurko|V.I.

N. Danilov]], a close associate of [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov|Sukhomlinov]].
