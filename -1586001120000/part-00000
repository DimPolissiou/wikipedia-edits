{"title_page": "Weigh in motion", "text_new": "{{more citations needed|date=January 2014}}\n'''Weigh-in-motion''' or weighing-in-motion (WIM) devices are designed to capture and record the [[axle]] weights and gross vehicle weights as vehicles drive over a measurement site. Unlike static scales, WIM&nbsp;systems are capable of measuring vehicles traveling at a reduced or normal traffic speed and do not require the vehicle to come to a stop. This makes the weighing process more efficient, and, in the case of commercial vehicles, allows for trucks under the weight limit to bypass static scales or inspection.\n\n== Introduction ==\nWeigh-in-motion is a technology that can be used for various private and public purposes (i.e. applications) related to the weights and axle loads of road and rail vehicles. WIM systems are installed on the road or rail track or on a vehicle and measure, store and provide data from the traffic flow and/or the specific vehicle. For WIM systems certain specific conditions apply. These conditions have an impact on the quality and reliability of the data measured by the WIM system and of the durability of the sensors and WIM system itself.\n\nWIM systems measure the dynamic axle loads of the vehicles and try to calculate the best possible estimate of the related static values. The WIM systems have to perform unattended, under harsh traffic and environmental conditions, often without any control over the way the vehicle is moving, or the driver is behaving. As a result of these specific measurement conditions, a successful implementation of a WIM system requires specific knowledge and experience.\n\n== WIM User Guides ==\nOver the past decades, a vast amount of scientific and practical experience has been gathered on the development, installation and operation of WIM systems. However, these experiences often come in the form of technical scientific reports, which are typically not accessible or understandable to a novice user of WIM systems or data. The International Society for Weigh-In-Motion ([http://www.is-wim.org www.is-wim]) has developed a WIM User Guide <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Guide for Users of Weigh-In-Motion, an Introduction to Weigh-In-Motion.|last=International Society for Weigh-In-Motion|first=|date=May 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref> providing basic, yet a comprehensive introduction to WIM.\n\nThe Guide covers different aspects related to the working, specification, purchase, installation, testing, operation and maintenance of WIM systems, and the application of the data they produce. To enhance accessibility for users starting with WIM, these topics are described in an easy-to-understand language. For those interested in more detailed and scientific explanations, references to these detailed reports are included.\n\nAn other introduction to Weigh-in-Motion can be found in the Weigh-In-Motion Pocket Guide ([https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/knowledgecenter/wim_guide/ fhwa/wim_guide]) developed by the Federal Highway Administration, Washington, USA. This Guide consists of three parts: Part 1, WIM Technology, Data, Acquisition and Procurement, Part 2, WIM Site Selection, Design and Installation Guide and Part 3, WIM Calibration and Maintenance Guide.\n\n== Importance of vehicle weight information ==\nKnowing that the installation, operation, calibration and maintenance of WIM systems are difficult, the question arises: '''''\u201cWhy use WIM systems in the first place?\u201d'''''\n\nThe answer is simple: '''''\u201cOnly a WIM will provide detailed vehicle weight information!\u201d'''''\n\nThe weight information consists of the gross vehicle weight and axle (group) loads combined with other parameters like: date and time, location, speed and vehicle class. For on-board WIM systems this pertains to the specific vehicle only. For in-road WIM systems this applies to the entire vehicle traffic flow.\n\nThis weight information provides the user with detailed knowledge of the loading of heavy goods vehicles  <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Dynamic Interaction between Vehicles and Infrastructure Experiment (DIVINE project), Final Report DSTI/DOT/RTR/IR6(98)1/FINAL: OECD Scientific Expert Group IR6.|last=DEVINE|first=|date=1998|work=|access-date=}}</ref>. This knowledge will replace the assumptions and estimates that had previously been used; as a result, margins of uncertainty are reduced. This means, for example, that the match between the heavy goods vehicles and the road/rail infrastructure can be optimized. This leads to more efficient goods transportation and better economic infrastructure management and productivity <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Vehicle mass data for pavement design and asset management.

In its original form, the fourth power law states that the rate of pavement damage is proportional to axle weight raised to the fourth power. WIM data provides information on the numbers of axles in each significant weight category which allows these kinds of calculations to be carried out.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWeigh in motion scales are often used to facilitate weight overload enforcement, such as the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]]'s Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks program. Weigh-in-motion systems can be used as part of traditional roadside inspection stations, or as part of virtual inspection stations.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration|url=http://www.fmcsa.dot.gov/facts-research/cvisn/expanded-CVISN.htm|title=Expanded CVISN capabilities|accessdate=Feb 8, 2012}}</ref> In most countries, WIM systems are not considered sufficiently accurate for direct enforcement of overloaded vehicles but this may change in the future.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Cornu |first=D. |last2=Stamberg |first2=R. |last3=Kriz |first3=I. |last4=Doupal |first4=E. |year=2012 |title=One Year 'WIM Direct Enforcement' Experiences in Czech Republic |url=https://trid.trb.org/view/1267707 |isbn=978-1-84821-415-6}}</ref>\n\nThe most common bridge application of WIM is the assessment of traffic loading.

This includes systems installed in or under the road pavements, bridges, rail tracks and on board vehicles.

Unlike static scales, WIM&nbsp;systems are capable of measuring vehicles traveling at a reduced or normal traffic speed and do not require the vehicle to come to a stop. This makes the weighing process more efficient, and, in the case of commercial vehicles, allows for trucks under the weight limit to bypass static scales or inspection.\n\n== Introduction ==\nWeigh-in-motion is a technology that can be used for various private and public purposes (i.e. applications) related to the weights and axle loads of road and rail vehicles. WIM systems are installed on the road or rail track or on a vehicle and measure, store and provide data from the traffic flow and/or the specific vehicle. For WIM systems certain specific conditions apply. These conditions have an impact on the quality and reliability of the data measured by the WIM system and of the durability of the sensors and WIM system itself.\n\nWIM systems measure the dynamic axle loads of the vehicles and try to calculate the best possible estimate of the related static values. The WIM systems have to perform unattended, under harsh traffic and environmental conditions, often without any control over the way the vehicle is moving, or the driver is behaving. As a result of these specific measurement conditions, a successful implementation of a WIM system requires specific knowledge and experience.\n\n== WIM User Guides ==\nOver the past decades, a vast amount of scientific and practical experience has been gathered on the development, installation and operation of WIM systems. However, these experiences often come in the form of technical scientific reports, which are typically not accessible or understandable to a novice user of WIM systems or data. The International Society for Weigh-In-Motion ([http://www.is-wim.org www.is-wim]) has developed a WIM User Guide <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Guide for Users of Weigh-In-Motion, an Introduction to Weigh-In-Motion.|last=International Society for Weigh-In-Motion|first=|date=May 2019|work=|access-date=}}</ref> providing basic, yet a comprehensive introduction to WIM.\n\nThe Guide covers different aspects related to the working, specification, purchase, installation, testing, operation and maintenance of WIM systems, and the application of the data they produce. To enhance accessibility for users starting with WIM, these topics are described in an easy-to-understand language. For those interested in more detailed and scientific explanations, references to these detailed reports are included.\n\nAn other introduction to Weigh-in-Motion can be found in the Weigh-In-Motion Pocket Guide ([https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/policyinformation/knowledgecenter/wim_guide/ fhwa/wim_guide]) developed by the Federal Highway Administration, Washington, USA. This Guide consists of three parts: Part 1, WIM Technology, Data, Acquisition and Procurement, Part 2, WIM Site Selection, Design and Installation Guide and Part 3, WIM Calibration and Maintenance Guide.\n\n== Importance of vehicle weight information ==\nKnowing that the installation, operation, calibration and maintenance of WIM systems are difficult, the question arises: '''''\u201cWhy use WIM systems in the first place?\u201d'''''\n\nThe answer is simple: '''''\u201cOnly a WIM will provide detailed vehicle weight information!\u201d'''''\n\nThe weight information consists of the gross vehicle weight and axle (group) loads combined with other parameters like: date and time, location, speed and vehicle class. For on-board WIM systems this pertains to the specific vehicle only. For in-road WIM systems this applies to the entire vehicle traffic flow.\n\nThis weight information provides the user with detailed knowledge of the loading of heavy goods vehicles  <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Dynamic Interaction between Vehicles and Infrastructure Experiment (DIVINE project), Final Report DSTI/DOT/RTR/IR6(98)1/FINAL: OECD Scientific Expert Group IR6.|last=DEVINE|first=|date=1998|work=|access-date=}}</ref>. This knowledge will replace the assumptions and estimates that had previously been used; as a result, margins of uncertainty are reduced. This means, for example, that the match between the heavy goods vehicles and the road/rail infrastructure can be optimized. This leads to more efficient goods transportation and better economic infrastructure management and productivity <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Vehicle mass data for pavement design and asset management.

WIM data provides information on the numbers of axles in each significant weight category which allows these kinds of calculations to be carried out.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nWeigh in motion scales are often used to facilitate weight overload enforcement, such as the [[Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration]]'s Commercial Vehicle Information Systems and Networks program.

These signals are used as triggering inputs to start and stop the measurement to initiate totaling gross vehicle weight of each vehicle.

Systems installed at yards usually works at lower speeds and are capable of higher accuracies.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n==Air applications==\nSome airports use airplane weighing, whereby the plane taxis across the scale bed, and its weight is measured. The weight may then be used to correlate with the pilot's log entry, to ensure there is just enough fuel, with a little margin for safety. This has been used for some time to conserve jet fuel.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nAlso, the main difference in these platforms, which are basically a \"transmission of weight\" application, there are [[checkweigher]]s, also known as dynamic scales or in-motion scales.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\n<br />\n\n== International Cooperation and Standards ==\nThe International Society for Weigh-In-Motion (ISWIM, [http://www.is-wim.org www.is-wim]) is an international non-profit organization, legally established in Switzerland in 2007. ISWIM is an international network of, and for, people and organisations active in the field of Weigh-In-Motion. The society brings together users, researchers, and vendors of WIM systems. This includes systems installed in or under the road pavements, bridges, rail tracks and on board vehicles. ISWIM organises periodically the International Conferences on WIM (ICWIM), regional seminars and workshops as part of other international conferences and exhibitions.\n\nIn the 1990s, the first WIM standard ASTM-E1318-09<ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Standard Specification for Highway Weigh-in-Motion (WIM) Systems with User Requirements and Test Methods.|last=ASTM-E1318-09|first=|date=2009|work=West Conshohocken, PA, USA: ASTM International.|access-date=}}</ref> was published in North America, and the COST 323 action provided draft European specifications of WIM<ref name=\":1\" /> as well as reports on Pan-European tests of WIM system. The European research project WAVE <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Weigh-in-Motion of Axles and Vehicles for Europe, General report.|last=WAVE|first=|date=2002|work=LCPC, Paris, France|access-date=}}</ref> and other initiatives delivered improved technologies and new methodologies of WIM.

Conference on Weigh-in-Motion.|access-date=}}</ref>.\n\nIn the early 2000s, the accuracy and reliability of WIM systems were significantly improved, and they were used more frequently for overload screening and pre-selection for road side weight enforcement controls (virtual weigh stations). The OIML R134 <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=Automatic instruments for weighing road vehicles in motion and measuring axle loads.|last=OIML R134|first=|date=2009|work=International Organization for Legal Metrology, Paris, France.|access-date=}}</ref> was published as an international standard of low speed WIM systems for legal applications like tolling by weight and direct weight enforcement. Most recently, the NMi-WIM standard <ref>{{Cite news|url=|title=NMi WIM standard - Specifications and test procedures for Weigh-in-Motion Systems|last=NMi|first=|date=2016|work=Dutch Metrology Organisation, Dordrecht, The Netherlands|access-date=}}</ref> offers a basis for the introduction of high speed WIM systems for direct automatic enforcement and free flow tolling by weight.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n[http://www.weighinfreeflow.com 6.

Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws.  Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to [[World War II|WWII]]-era shortages, or following [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1971 wage and price controls.  They remain in effect or have been reintroduced in some cities with large [[leasehold estate|tenant]] populations, such as [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Oakland, California]].

Under current state law, those units cannot be subject to rent control. ... In addition to expanding the types of properties that would fall under rent control, Prop. 10 would have let cities permanently cap the price of an apartment, allowing only modest increases even after tenants move out.

Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Statements are very likely true, but need references to back up the numbers.}}  No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Statements may be true, but need references to prove the claims, and a reference to prove that the non-building of mobile home parks is BECAUSE OF rent control; otherwise this statement is irrelevant to this article.}}\n\n==Law==\nRent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction.  For example, San Francisco's Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/rentboard_page.asp?id=54501|title=San Francisco Rent Board: Fact Sheet 1 \u2013 General Information}}</ref> [[New York State]] generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).<ref>http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/ora/pubs/html/orafac1.htm</ref>\n\nThe frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the [[Consumer Price Index]] or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.sfrb.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=1496|title=CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTIAL RENT STABILIZATION AND ARBITRATION BOARD Section 1.12|accessdate=2015-03-29}}</ref>\n\nRent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman's research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner.(Gilderbloom & Markham,1996).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.1996.tb00388.x|title=Moderate Rent Control: Sixty Cities over 20 Years|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|volume=18|issue=4|pages=409\u2013430|year=2016|last1=Gilderbloom|first1=John I.|last2=Markham|first2=John P.}}</ref>\n\n===Federal law===\nRent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v.

Sinclair]]''<ref>{{ussc|264|543|1924}}</ref> the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v.

Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high.  Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the [[lease]]. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with [[building code]] requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market.{{ r | GPG | p=1 | q=Another justification is to correct market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry and high transaction costs. Because of the high cost of moving, tenants can arguably be pressured by landlords to accept rent increases. Tenants may also be unaware of the real condition of units until they move in.

Using sweat equity, artists renovated their leased lofts converting them into habitable living/working studios, installing plumbing and electrical fixtures along with other improvements--generally at their own expense.

Between 1919 and 1924, a number of cities and states adopted rent- and eviction-control laws.  Modern rent controls were first adopted in response to [[World War II|WWII]]-era shortages, or following [[Richard Nixon]]'s 1971 wage and price controls.  They remain in effect or have been reintroduced in some cities with large [[leasehold estate|tenant]] populations, such as [[New York City]], [[San Francisco]], [[Los Angeles]], [[Washington, D.C.]], and [[Oakland, California]].

Leading the campaign to enact Proposition 13, California politician [[Howard Jarvis]] tried to get tenants to vote for Prop 13 by claiming that landlords would pass tax savings along to tenants; when most failed to do so, it became an additional motivating factor for rent control.{{ r | Birth_of_RC_in_SF | p=2 | q=Proposition 13 threw fuel on the fire. One of Howard Jarvis&apos; arguments for rolling back and rapidly freezing escalating property taxes (an inflation-induced mess, too) was that the savings would be passed onto tenants. Although several large San Francisco property owners passed Proposition 13 savings on to some 7,000 tenants, most landlords did not. In jurisdictions with large tenant populations like San Francisco, the empty promises became a rallying cry for activists.}}\n\nIn 1985, California adopted the [[Ellis Act]], eliminating municipalities' ability to prohibit the removal of properties from rental activities after the [[California Supreme Court]] in ''Nash v.

All are currently prohibited by Costa-Hawkins.{{ r | SJMN_RC_failed | p=1 | q=Prop. 10 took aim at a decades-old state law that prohibits cities from enforcing certain types of rent control.

Under current state law, those units cannot be subject to rent control. ... In addition to expanding the types of properties that would fall under rent control, Prop. 10 would have let cities permanently cap the price of an apartment, allowing only modest increases even after tenants move out. That policy, known as vacancy control, was used decades ago in a handful of cities including Berkeley, East Palo Alto and Santa Monica before California passed the Costa-Hawkins law banning it. Currently, landlords can raise prices to market rates after a tenant in a rent-controlled unit leaves. Vacancy control would have immediately taken effect in Berkeley if Prop. 10 passed, as it has remained on the books, unenforced, for more than two decades.}} The proposition failed 59% to 41%.<ref name=CA_SOS_Prop10 >{{ cite web | url=https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2018-general/sov/92-ballot-measures.pdf | title=State Ballot Measures | publisher=[[Secretary of State of California]] | accessdate=2019-03-03 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190108200833/https://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2018-general/sov/92-ballot-measures.pdf | archive-date=2019-01-08 | url-status=live | quote=State Totals 4,949,543 7,251,443  Percent 40.6% 59.4% }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web | url=https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_10,_Local_Rent_Control_Initiative_(2018) | title=California Proposition 10, Local Rent Control Initiative (2018)}}</ref>\n\n===Mobile homes===\n\nIn some regions, rent control laws are more commonly adopted for [[mobile home]] parks.  Reasons given for these laws include residents owning their homes while renting the land the home sits on, the high cost of moving mobile homes, and the loss of home value when they are moved. California, for example, has only 13 local apartment rent control laws but over 100 local mobile home rent control laws.{{citation needed|date=September 2018|reason=Statements are very likely true, but need references to back up the numbers.}}  No new mobile home parks have been built in California since 1991.{{citation needed|date=July 2018|reason=Statements may be true, but need references to prove the claims, and a reference to prove that the non-building of mobile home parks is BECAUSE OF rent control; otherwise this statement is irrelevant to this article.}}\n\n==Law==\nRent control laws define which rental units are affected, and may only cover larger complexes, or units older than a certain date. To attempt to not disincentivise investment in new housing stock, rent control laws often exempt new construction.  For example, San Francisco's Rent Stabilization Ordinance exempts all units built after 1979.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sfgov.org/site/rentboard_page.asp?id=54501|title=San Francisco Rent Board: Fact Sheet 1 \u2013 General Information}}</ref> [[New York State]] generally exempts units built after 1974 anywhere in the state (although owners can agree to rent stabilization in exchange for tax benefits).<ref>http://www.dhcr.state.ny.us/ora/pubs/html/orafac1.htm</ref>\n\nThe frequency and degree of rent increases are limited, usually to the rate of inflation defined by the [[Consumer Price Index]] or to a fraction thereof. San Francisco, for example, allows annual rent increases of 60% of the CPI, up to a maximum 7%.<ref>\n{{cite web|url=http://www.sfrb.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=1496|title=CITY AND COUNTY OF SAN FRANCISCO RESIDENTIAL RENT STABILIZATION AND ARBITRATION BOARD Section 1.12|accessdate=2015-03-29}}</ref>\n\nRent control laws are often administered by nonelected rent control boards. Officers in city government assign members of the board, which will ensure mixed numbers of tenants and property owners to balance out their benefits. As stated in Goodman's research, a typical rent control board in New York is structured by two tenants, two landlords, and one homeowner.(Gilderbloom & Markham,1996).<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9906.1996.tb00388.x|title=Moderate Rent Control: Sixty Cities over 20 Years|journal=Journal of Urban Affairs|volume=18|issue=4|pages=409\u2013430|year=2016|last1=Gilderbloom|first1=John I.|last2=Markham|first2=John P.}}</ref>\n\n===Federal law===\nRent regulation in the [[United States]] is an issue for each state. In 1921, the [[US supreme court|US Supreme Court]] case of ''[[Block v. Hirsh]]''<ref>{{ussc|256|135|1921}}</ref> held by a majority that regulation of rents in the District of Columbia as a temporary emergency measure was constitutional, but shortly afterwards in 1924 in ''[[Chastleton Corp v. Sinclair]]''<ref>{{ussc|264|543|1924}}</ref> the same law was unanimously struck down by the Supreme Court.  After the 1930s [[New Deal]], the Supreme Court ceased to interfere with social and economic legislation, and a growing number of states adopted rules.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} In the 1986 case of ''[[Fisher v. City of Berkeley]]'',<ref>{{ussc|475|260|1986}}</ref> the US Supreme court held that there was no incompatibility between rent control and the [[Sherman Act]].\n\n===State law===\nAs of 2019, five states ([[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], [[New Jersey]], [[Maryland]], [[Oregon]]) and the [[District of Columbia]] have localities in which some form of residential rent control is in effect (for normal structures, excluding [[mobile home]]s).{{ r | NMHC | rentprep_com }}  Thirty-seven states either prohibit or preempt rent control, while eight states allow their cities to enact rent control, but have no cities that have implemented it.{{ r | NMHC | rentprep_com }}\n\n==Arguments for==\n\n===Economic===\nThe rental-accommodation market suffers from [[asymmetrical information|information asymmetries]] and high [[transaction costs]]. Typically, a landlord has more information about a home than a prospective tenant can reasonably detect. Moreover, once the tenant has moved in, the costs of moving again are very high.  Unscrupulous landlords could conceal defects and, if the tenant complains, threaten to raise the rent at the end of the [[lease]]. With rent control, tenants can request that hidden defects, if they exist, be repaired to comply with [[building code]] requirements, without fearing retaliatory rent increases. Rent control could thus compensate somewhat for inefficiencies of the housing market.{{ r | GPG | p=1 | q=Another justification is to correct market inefficiencies such as information asymmetry and high transaction costs. Because of the high cost of moving, tenants can arguably be pressured by landlords to accept rent increases. Tenants may also be unaware of the real condition of units until they move in.

Using sweat equity, artists renovated their leased lofts converting them into habitable living/working studios, installing plumbing and electrical fixtures along with other improvements--generally at their own expense.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\nIn April, biostatistician Professor [[Sheila Bird]] said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.<ref name=guardian0404>{{cite web|author=Caelainn Barr, Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong |title=Why what we think we know about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong &#124;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\nIn April, biostatistician Professor [[Sheila Bird]] said that delays in the reporting of deaths from the virus mean that there is a risk of underestimating the steepness of the rising epidemic trend.<ref name=guardian0404>{{cite web|author=Caelainn Barr, Pamela Duncan and Niamh McIntyre |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/apr/04/why-what-we-think-we-know-about-the-uks-coronavirus-death-toll-is-wrong |title=Why what we think we know about the UK's coronavirus death toll is wrong &#124;

{"title_page": "Pointer jumping", "text_new": "{{moresources|date=December 2019}}\n\n'''Pointer jumping''' or '''path doubling''' is a [[Algorithm design|design technique]] for [[parallel algorithm]]s that operate on pointer structures, such as [[linked list]]s and [[directed graph]]s. Pointer jumping allows an algorithm to follow paths with a [[time complexity]] that is logarithmic with respect to the length of the longest path. It does this by \"jumping\" to the end of the path computed by neighbors.\n\nThe basic operation of pointer jumping is to replace each neighbor in a pointer structure with its neighbor's neighbor. In each step of the algorithm, this replacement is done for all nodes in the data structure, which can be done independently in parallel. In the next step when a neighbor's neighbor is followed, the neighbor's path already followed in the previous step is added to the node's followed path in a single step. Thus, each step effectively doubles the distance traversed by the explored paths.\n\nPointer jumping is best understood by looking at simple examples such as [[#list ranking|list ranking]] and [[#root finding|root finding]].\n\n== List ranking ==\n\nOne of the simpler tasks that can be solved by a pointer jumping algorithm is the ''list ranking'' problem. This problem is defined as follows: given a linked list of {{mvar|N}} nodes, find the distance (measured in the number of nodes) of each node to the end of the list. The distance {{mono|d(n)}} is defined as follows, for nodes {{mono|n}} that point to their successor by a pointer called {{mono|next}}:\n\n* If {{mono|n.next}} is [[Null pointer|{{mono|nil}}]], then {{mono|d(n) {{=}} 0}}.\n* For any other node, {{mono|d(n) {{=}} d(n.next) + 1}}.\n\nThis problem can easily be solved in linear time on a sequential machine, but a parallel algorithm can do better: given {{mvar|n}} processors, the problem can be solved in [[logarithmic time]], {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}}, by the following pointer jumping algorithm:<ref name=\"clrs\">{{Introduction to Algorithms|edition=2}}</ref>{{rp|693}}\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 35px; width: 600px\">\n{{framebox|blue}}\n* Allocate an array of {{mvar|N}} integers.\n* Initialize: for each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:\n** If {{mono|n.next {{=}} nil}}, set {{mono|d[n] \u2190 0}}.\n** Else, set {{mono|d[n] \u2190 1}}.\n* While any node {{mono|n}} has {{mono|n.next \u2260 nil}}:\n** For each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:\n*** If {{mono|n.next \u2260 nil}}:\n**** Set {{mono|d[n] \u2190 d[n] + d[n.next]}}.\n**** Set {{mono|n.next \u2190 n.next.next}}.\n{{frame-footer}}\n</div>\n\nThe pointer jumping occurs in the last line of the algorithm, where each node's {{mono|next}} pointer is reset to skip the node's direct successor. It is assumed, as in common in the [[parallel random access machine|PRAM]] model of computation, that memory access are performed in lock-step, so that each {{mono|n.next.next}} memory fetch is performed before each {{mono|n.next}} memory store; otherwise, processors may clobber each other's data, producing inconsistencies.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694}}\n\nThe following diagram follows how the parallel list ranking algorithm uses pointer jumping for a linked list with 11 elements. As the algorithm describes, the first iteration starts initialized with all ranks set to 1 except those with a null pointer for {{mono|next}}. The first iteration looks at immediate neighbors. Each subsequent iteration jumps twice as far as the previous.\n\n[[File:PointerJumpingListRanking.svg|An example of performing the parallel pointer jumping technique to compute list ranking.]]\n\nAnalyzing the algorithm yields a logarithmic running time. The initialization loop takes constant time, because each of the {{mvar|N}} processors performs a constant amount of work, all in parallel. The inner loop of the main loop also takes constant time, as does (by assumption) the termination check for the loop, so the running time is determined by how often this inner loop is executed. Since the pointer jumping in each iteration splits the list into two parts, one consisting of the \"odd\" elements and one of the \"even\" elements, the length of the list pointed to by each processor's {{mono|n}} is halved in each iteration, which can be done at most  {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}} time before each list has a length of at most one.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694\u2013695}}\n\n== Root finding ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nFollowing a [[path (graph theory)|path]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is an inherently serial operation, but pointer jumping reduces the total amount of work by following all paths simultaneously and sharing results among dependent operations. Pointer jumping iterates and finds a ''successor'' \u2014 a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] closer to the tree root \u2014 each time. By following successors computed for other vertices, the traversal down each path can be doubled every iteration, which means that the tree roots can be found in [[logarithmic time]].\n\nPointer doubling operates on an array <tt>successor</tt> with an entry for every vertex in the graph. Each <tt>successor[''i'']</tt> is initialized with the parent index of vertex <tt>''i''</tt> if that vertex is not a root or to <tt>''i''</tt> itself if that vertex is a root. At each iteration, each successor is updated to its successor's successor. The root is found when the successor's successor points to itself.\n\nThe following [[pseudocode]] demonstrates the algorithm.\n '''algorithm'''\n     '''Input:''' An array parent representing a forest of trees. parent[i] is the parent of vertex i or itself for a root\n     '''Output:''' An array containing the root ancestor for every vertex\n \n     '''for''' ''i'' \u2190 1 '''to''' length(parent) '''do in parallel'''\n         successor[''i''] \u2190 parent[''i'']\n     '''while''' true\n         '''for''' ''i'' \u2190 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''\n             successor_next[''i''] \u2190 successor[successor[''i'']]\n         '''if''' successor_next = successor '''then'''\n             break\n         '''for''' ''i'' \u2190 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''\n             successor[''i''] \u2190 successor_next[''i'']\n     '''return''' successor\n\nThe following image provides an example of using pointer jumping on a small forest. On each iteration the successor points to the vertex following one more successor. After two iterations, every vertex points to its root node.\n\n[[File:Pointer Jumping Example.svg|Pointer jumping: example execution]]\n\n== History and examples ==\n\nAlthough the name pointer jumping would come later, J\u00e1J\u00e1<ref name=\"JaJa\">{{cite books |first=Joseph |last=J\u00e1J\u00e1 |title=An Introduction to Parallel Algorithms |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=1992 |isbn=0-201-54856-9}}</ref>{{rp|88}} attributes the first uses of the technique in early [[parallel algorithm|parallel]] [[graph algorithm]]s<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirschberg |first1=D.

The distance {{mono|d(n)}} is defined as follows, for nodes {{mono|n}} that point to their successor by a pointer called {{mono|next}}:\n\n* If {{mono|n.next}} is [[Null pointer|{{mono|nil}}]], then {{mono|d(n) {{=}} 0}}.\n* For any other node, {{mono|d(n) {{=}} d(n.next) + 1}}.\n\nThis problem can easily be solved in linear time on a sequential machine, but a parallel algorithm can do better: given {{mvar|n}} processors, the problem can be solved in [[logarithmic time]], {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}}, by the following pointer jumping algorithm:<ref name=\"clrs\">{{Introduction to Algorithms|edition=2}}</ref>{{rp|693}}\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 35px; width: 600px\">\n{{framebox|blue}}\n* Allocate an array of {{mvar|N}} integers.\n* Initialize: for each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:\n** If {{mono|n.next {{=}} nil}}, set {{mono|d[n] \u2190 0}}.\n** Else, set {{mono|d[n] \u2190 1}}.\n* While any node {{mono|n}} has {{mono|n.next \u2260 nil}}:\n** For each processor/list node {{mvar|n}}, in parallel:\n*** If {{mono|n.next \u2260 nil}}:\n**** Set {{mono|d[n] \u2190 d[n] + d[n.next]}}.\n**** Set {{mono|n.next \u2190 n.next.next}}.\n{{frame-footer}}\n</div>\n\nThe pointer jumping occurs in the last line of the algorithm, where each node's {{mono|next}} pointer is reset to skip the node's direct successor. It is assumed, as in common in the [[parallel random access machine|PRAM]] model of computation, that memory access are performed in lock-step, so that each {{mono|n.next.next}} memory fetch is performed before each {{mono|n.next}} memory store; otherwise, processors may clobber each other's data, producing inconsistencies.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694}}\n\nThe following diagram follows how the parallel list ranking algorithm uses pointer jumping for a linked list with 11 elements. As the algorithm describes, the first iteration starts initialized with all ranks set to 1 except those with a null pointer for {{mono|next}}. The first iteration looks at immediate neighbors. Each subsequent iteration jumps twice as far as the previous.\n\n[[File:PointerJumpingListRanking.svg|An example of performing the parallel pointer jumping technique to compute list ranking.]]\n\nAnalyzing the algorithm yields a logarithmic running time. The initialization loop takes constant time, because each of the {{mvar|N}} processors performs a constant amount of work, all in parallel. The inner loop of the main loop also takes constant time, as does (by assumption) the termination check for the loop, so the running time is determined by how often this inner loop is executed. Since the pointer jumping in each iteration splits the list into two parts, one consisting of the \"odd\" elements and one of the \"even\" elements, the length of the list pointed to by each processor's {{mono|n}} is halved in each iteration, which can be done at most  {{math|''O''(log ''N'')}} time before each list has a length of at most one.{{r|clrs}}{{rp|694\u2013695}}\n\n== Root finding ==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=January 2020}}\nFollowing a [[path (graph theory)|path]] in a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] is an inherently serial operation, but pointer jumping reduces the total amount of work by following all paths simultaneously and sharing results among dependent operations. Pointer jumping iterates and finds a ''successor'' \u2014 a [[vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] closer to the tree root \u2014 each time. By following successors computed for other vertices, the traversal down each path can be doubled every iteration, which means that the tree roots can be found in [[logarithmic time]].\n\nPointer doubling operates on an array <tt>successor</tt> with an entry for every vertex in the graph. Each <tt>successor[''i'']</tt> is initialized with the parent index of vertex <tt>''i''</tt> if that vertex is not a root or to <tt>''i''</tt> itself if that vertex is a root. At each iteration, each successor is updated to its successor's successor. The root is found when the successor's successor points to itself.\n\nThe following [[pseudocode]] demonstrates the algorithm.\n '''algorithm'''\n     '''Input:''' An array parent representing a forest of trees. parent[i] is the parent of vertex i or itself for a root\n     '''Output:''' An array containing the root ancestor for every vertex\n \n     '''for''' ''i'' \u2190 1 '''to''' length(parent) '''do in parallel'''\n         successor[''i''] \u2190 parent[''i'']\n     '''while''' true\n         '''for''' ''i'' \u2190 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''\n             successor_next[''i''] \u2190 successor[successor[''i'']]\n         '''if''' successor_next = successor '''then'''\n             break\n         '''for''' ''i'' \u2190 1 '''to''' length(successor) '''do in parallel'''\n             successor[''i''] \u2190 successor_next[''i'']\n     '''return''' successor\n\nThe following image provides an example of using pointer jumping on a small forest. On each iteration the successor points to the vertex following one more successor. After two iterations, every vertex points to its root node.\n\n[[File:Pointer Jumping Example.svg|Pointer jumping: example execution]]\n\n== History and examples ==\n\nAlthough the name pointer jumping would come later, J\u00e1J\u00e1<ref name=\"JaJa\">{{cite books |first=Joseph |last=J\u00e1J\u00e1 |title=An Introduction to Parallel Algorithms |publisher=Addison Wesley |year=1992 |isbn=0-201-54856-9}}</ref>{{rp|88}} attributes the first uses of the technique in early [[parallel algorithm|parallel]] [[graph algorithm]]s<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Hirschberg |first1=D.
