That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild.

That review provided its findings to the then Federal Environment Minister Greg Hunt in December 2015. The findings were released to the public in September 2016. Whilst endorsing the process undertaken by previous governments to develop the 44 marine parks, the Review recommended changes to zoning in a number of the new parks.\n\nIn September 2016 the Turnbull Coalition Government commenced a further public consultation process to develop new management plans for the marine parks in order to change the zoning. In March 2018 the revised management plans were tabled in the Australian Parliament for consideration. Changes to the original 2012 zoning in the parks included removal of almost half the high level protective green \u2018sanctuary\u2019 zoning across the network - an area almost twice the size of the state of Victoria and equivalent in area to the loss of half of Australia's national parks on land - the biggest single windback of conservation area in Australia's history.\n\nThe alliance groups include:\n* [[Australian Conservation Foundation]]\n* [[Australian Marine Conservation Society]]\n* [[Conservation Council of Western Australia]]\n* [[Cairns and Far North Environment Centre]]\n* [[Conservation Council of WA]]\n* [[Conservation Council of South Australia]]\n* [[Environment Centre of the Northern Territory]]\n* [[Environment Tasmania]]\n* [[Environment Victoria]]\n* [[Environs Kimberley]]\n* [[Greenpeace Asia Pacific]]\n* [[Humane Society International]]\n* [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]]\n* [[National Parks Association of NSW]]\n* [[National Parks Association of Qld]]\n* [[Nature Conservation Council of NSW]]\n* [[North Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Queensland Conservation Council]]\n* [[Project AWARE|Project AWARE Foundation]]\n* [[Sealife Trust]]\n* [[Sea Shepherd]]\n* [[Surfrider]]\n* [[The Nature Conservancy]]\n* [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]]\n* [[The Wilderness Society (Australia)|The Wilderness Society]]\n* [[Victorian National Parks Association]]\n* [[Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society]]\n* [[Wildlife Preservation Council of Qld]]\n* [[World Wildlife Fund|World Wildlife Fund \u2013 Australia]]\n\n'''What's at stake'''\n\nMarine sanctuaries (green zones) are proven to work alongside sensible fisheries management to provide safe havens for fish and marine life to recover and rebuild.

Adam is handling the legal case of a former policeman named Martin Killane who does not wish to be evicted from his home, and Adam learns that his own father Ed is on the board of the adversarial land development company. Meanwhile, Adam still has no word from Corinne. Adam learns from Daisy's mother Vicky (who, like Corinne, is a teacher at the school) that nude photos purportedly of her young daughter Ella have been released to the entire school. It is revealed that Mike decapitated the alpaca while under the influence of drugs, so he, Thomas, and Daisy plot to dispose of the animal's severed head.  However, their movements are tracked by the police through Dante's phone. Mike is arrested, but Thomas and Daisy flee.

Johanna asks Wes to hide the fact that she knew Heidi so that she can be assigned to the investigation.  Adam confronts Mike's dad, Doug, after learning that the secretive phone call that Corinne made on the day of her disappearance was to him.  Doug tells Adam that the phone call concerned the money stolen from the football club and that Corinne wanted more time to sort the situation out and to show her innocence. At the murder investigation, Katz attempts to throw suspicion on Heidi's husband or a burglar, and volunteers to check the security videotape.  Thomas and Ryan tell Adam that they have tracked Corinne's phone and the three of them, with Killane, drive toward it, but they eventually find the phone abandoned on a bridge.

As Katz looks on, Adam tells Johanna of the visit from The Stranger that sparked Corinne's disappearance, and about the other victims he is aware of. Thomas and Mike go to see Daisy, and Mike confronts her over her belief that he had proliferated the nude photos of Ella. She believes his protestations of innocence, and admits to having drugged him with PCP during the rave, confessing that Olivia was the person who had accused Mike to her. They go to see Olivia, but her mother lies, saying that Olivia is still in the hospital. The Stranger and her friend wonder why they had not heard from Heidi and learn online that she had been murdered, thereupon deciding to immediately shut down their operation. Phillip (Johanna's estranged husband) visits her at work. Katz admits to never commencing a missing person's investigation for Corinne; after seeing the file, Wes and Johanna realize that Corinne is the woman whom Dante had filmed. Killane phones Adam about the demolition equipment in his neighborhood and tells him that he has located The Stranger's accomplice, Ingrid, and that she is connected to a detective agency. Adam and Doug arrive at Ingrid's office address while she is destroying evidence, but they are not allowed in. Later they follow her in their car, but lose her.

Mr Powers says that Katz is the head of security for the venture. He then tells Powers that the evidence packet he got from Heidi shows that Powers was deeply involved with Kimberley. Adam tells Johanna of Killane's confession. Johanna tells him that Corinne's car was located, and together they go to it and discover one of Corinne's earrings in the rear seat.  Thomas, Mike, and Daisy decide to try again to confront Olivia; she admits to Thomas that it was she, not Mike, who sent the photos from Ella's phone out of jealousy for Mike's attention. Adam tells Johanna about Ingrid. Wes finds Ingrid's office cleaned out.  Interviewing caf\u00e9 workers about Heidi's last days, Johanna learns of Heidi's meeting with The Stranger and Ingrid in a car park; she telephones the station to ask Wes to pull security video. Johanna shows the videotape to Kimberley, who confesses to her work with the Sugar Baby website and to being made aware by her mother of the blackmail. Mike tells Daisy that his memory of the rave-night is returning through flashbacks, and he remembers killing the alpaca with a shovel, but nothing concerning Dante other than that Dante was going into the woods with Daisy.

Dante, recovering in hospital, is interviewed by Johanna; he tells her that Daisy absconded with his clothes after an invitation to skinny-dip. He said he then was discovered by Max Bonner (Robert Ewens), the sports-club caretaker, who chased him with an axe, but that he remembers nothing more. Johanna and Wes interview Max, who claims he was only harvesting firewood and did no harm to Dante, who simply tripped and fell. Ed brings Peter Ince, a private investigator, to Adam to assist in the search for Corinne. Adam tells Ed and Peter about Corinne's fake pregnancy, his own affair, and The Stranger, prompting Ed to relate that The Stranger had visited him as well. Since The Stranger had been in the hospital while Killane was there, Ed surmises that the two are connected and Ed, Peter, and Adam begin to go through Killane's possessions, which Ed's company holds in storage. Johanna eulogizes Heidi at her memorial, while Wes reviews the case evidence. Johanna goes to Katz' house, and he tells her about his daughter's poisoning.

Peter tracks The Stranger (Christine Killane's) home address. Adam phones Johanna, reaching Katz, saying that The Stranger has been identified, and promising to text the location to Johanna's phone later, which he does on arrival at Christine's home address. Adam enters the apartment building, then is attacked and knocked unconscious by Ingrid.  He wakes in The Stranger's apartment, chained to an anchored table. She tells of finding out later that her father had killed her mother.  She also discloses that she learned that Killane (unbeknownst to him) is not actually her biological father, and that she is in fact Adam's half-sister through an affair Ed had with her mother.

Johanna asks Wes to hide the fact that she knew Heidi so that she can be assigned to the investigation.  Adam confronts Mike's dad, Doug, after learning that the secretive phone call that Corinne made on the day of her disappearance was to him.  Doug tells Adam that the phone call concerned the money stolen from the football club and that Corinne wanted more time to sort the situation out and to show her innocence. At the murder investigation, Katz attempts to throw suspicion on Heidi's husband or a burglar, and volunteers to check the security videotape.  Thomas and Ryan tell Adam that they have tracked Corinne's phone and the three of them, with Killane, drive toward it, but they eventually find the phone abandoned on a bridge. Adam finally reports Corinne as a missing person to the police. Kimberley tells Johanna about the blackmail attempt on Heidi without disclosing the reason.

Thomas and Mike go to see Daisy, and Mike confronts her over her belief that he had proliferated the nude photos of Ella. She believes his protestations of innocence, and admits to having drugged him with PCP during the rave, confessing that Olivia was the person who had accused Mike to her. They go to see Olivia, but her mother lies, saying that Olivia is still in the hospital. The Stranger and her friend wonder why they had not heard from Heidi and learn online that she had been murdered, thereupon deciding to immediately shut down their operation. Phillip (Johanna's estranged husband) visits her at work. Katz admits to never commencing a missing person's investigation for Corinne; after seeing the file, Wes and Johanna realize that Corinne is the woman whom Dante had filmed.

Mr Powers says that Katz is the head of security for the venture. He then tells Powers that the evidence packet he got from Heidi shows that Powers was deeply involved with Kimberley. Adam tells Johanna of Killane's confession. Johanna tells him that Corinne's car was located, and together they go to it and discover one of Corinne's earrings in the rear seat.  Thomas, Mike, and Daisy decide to try again to confront Olivia; she admits to Thomas that it was she, not Mike, who sent the photos from Ella's phone out of jealousy for Mike's attention. Adam tells Johanna about Ingrid. Wes finds Ingrid's office cleaned out.  Interviewing caf\u00e9 workers about Heidi's last days, Johanna learns of Heidi's meeting with The Stranger and Ingrid in a car park; she telephones the station to ask Wes to pull security video. Johanna shows the videotape to Kimberley, who confesses to her work with the Sugar Baby website and to being made aware by her mother of the blackmail. Mike tells Daisy that his memory of the rave-night is returning through flashbacks, and he remembers killing the alpaca with a shovel, but nothing concerning Dante other than that Dante was going into the woods with Daisy.

Dante, recovering in hospital, is interviewed by Johanna; he tells her that Daisy absconded with his clothes after an invitation to skinny-dip. He said he then was discovered by Max Bonner (Robert Ewens), the sports-club caretaker, who chased him with an axe, but that he remembers nothing more. Johanna and Wes interview Max, who claims he was only harvesting firewood and did no harm to Dante, who simply tripped and fell. Ed brings Peter Ince, a private investigator, to Adam to assist in the search for Corinne. Adam tells Ed and Peter about Corinne's fake pregnancy, his own affair, and The Stranger, prompting Ed to relate that The Stranger had visited him as well. Since The Stranger had been in the hospital while Killane was there, Ed surmises that the two are connected and Ed, Peter, and Adam begin to go through Killane's possessions, which Ed's company holds in storage. Johanna eulogizes Heidi at her memorial, while Wes reviews the case evidence. Johanna goes to Katz' house, and he tells her about his daughter's poisoning. Wes telephones Johanna and, on speakerphone, says that he found videotape showing Katz arriving at the murder scene.

Peter tracks The Stranger (Christine Killane's) home address. Adam phones Johanna, reaching Katz, saying that The Stranger has been identified, and promising to text the location to Johanna's phone later, which he does on arrival at Christine's home address. Adam enters the apartment building, then is attacked and knocked unconscious by Ingrid.  He wakes in The Stranger's apartment, chained to an anchored table. She tells of finding out later that her father had killed her mother.  She also discloses that she learned that Killane (unbeknownst to him) is not actually her biological father, and that she is in fact Adam's half-sister through an affair Ed had with her mother.  Katz bursts in brandishing a gun and holding Ingrid hostage; he tosses Ingrid to the ground then shoots her in the stomach. Adam escapes from his chains and attacks Katz, but is overpowered.  When Katz shoots at Adam, Christine jumps in front to take the bullet in her back. Police enter to take control of the situation. Johanna arrests Katz for Heidi's murder. Christine is hospitalized; Ingrid dies of her wounds. Christine admits to Adam that Bob, the football coach, had hired her to dig dirt on Corinne. Adam confronts Bob, and Bob tells Adam that Doug claimed Corinne stole the money from the football club and that she intended to pin the theft on Bob.  Adam drives to Doug's house and confronts him about stealing the money and sending texts from Corinne's phone after her disappearance, pulling a gun that Christine passed to him in the hospital.

Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol. She is absentminded at times and can be very clumsy and forgetful, especially when she is on an adventure. She owns a flying pirate ship that she sometimes accidentally docks in odd places. Shine loves pirate genies and Captain Zora is her favorite of them all, so she gets very nervous and sometimes cannot talk clearly when she is around Zora.\n*Layla (voiced by [[Danica McKellar]]) \u2013 An ice genie who is a good friend of Princess Samira. She possesses an ice gem necklace that gives her freezing powers and keeps her body cold. She originally lived in a genie bottle buried on a sandy beach in Zahramay Falls, but it was accidentally broken by Leah and her genies. She currently lives in an ice palace.\n*Shaya (voiced by [[Kin Santiago]] in Season 2 through 3 and [[Hudson West]]) \u2013 A lightning genie in training who rides around on a flying cloud-board and can generate magical lightning. Leah and her genies help him catch a run away magic lightning bolt he created while practicing his magic. Though he is reluctant to work with Leah and her genies at first, he eventually learns the value of teamwork from them.\n*Nila (voiced by [[Mila Brener]] in US, and [[Kimani Arthur]] in UK) \u2013 A mermaid who lives in the waters near Zahramay Falls. Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real. She helps the girls obtain the Mermaid Gem to change the girls back to their non-mermaid selves after Leah accidentally uses up her wishes which leaves the girls trapped in Mermaid form. After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay. The girls befriend her after Samira sends them on their first adventure to Rainbow Zahramay to investigate the cause of a weird mist produced by the falls that disrupts magic in Zahramay Falls and help Imma resolve the problem. Imma can use water magic that allows her to manipulate water using her magic staff which she also uses to activate the locks that control the flow of rainbow water to the falls.\n* Wishy Washy Genie (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2013 A male genie whose powerful magic is to remove or fix a wish that cannot be used on other genies. He can be very wishy washy, just like his name.

However it is rare for her to make dreams actually come true. \n*Ezri (voiced by [[Gunnar Sizemore]]) \u2013 Nadia's assistant who like Nadia knows about everybody in Zahramay Falls as he recognizes Leah, Shimmer, Shine, and even Zeta on first meeting them.\n*Misha (voiced by [[Jewel (singer)|Jewel]] in Season 3 and [[Kailey Snider]] in Season 4) \u2013 The Animal Genie who helps all the genies in Zarahmay Falls find their pets.\n*Princess Adara (voiced by [[Tania Gunadi]]) \u2013 The beautiful stardust princess of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Rubi (voiced by [[Luna Bella]]) \u2013 The Rainbow Genie of Zarahmay Skies.\n*Shaun (voiced by [[Ramone Hamilton]]) \u2013 Shaya's twin brother who's a cloud genie.\n\n===Animals===\nAll animals in the series are voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].\n*Tala \u2013 Shimmer's pet [[gibbon monkey]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170707235316/http://www.nick-asia.com/shows/shimmer-and-shine/characters/tala/41pirj|archivedate=July 7, 2017|title=Tala from Shimmer and Shine \u2013 Nick Asia|work=[[Nickelodeon (Southeast Asia)|Nickelodeon Southeast Asia]]|publisher=[[Viacom International|Viacom International, Inc.]]|accessdate=July 7, 2017}}</ref> She has green eyes and wears white pearls, like Shimmer does.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie. Like their brother, Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank all have purple eyes, blue toes, and white bellies and horns. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limited to saying his own name, which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.\n*Gleam \u2013 A blue glitter Zoomicorn native Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Lulu \u2013 Misha's pet Panda.\n*Zahrora, Zoomdust, and Zadazzle \u2013 three Zarahcorns.\n*Dahliza \u2013 Princess Adara's Zarahcorn.\n*Fuzzle Whuzzles \u2013 Little creatures in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Azah \u2013 Rubi's Zarahcorn.\n\n==Production==\n''Shimmer and Shine'' is based on an unreleased pilot that took six months to develop in 2013, with a reported completion date of September 2013.

Each day, the genies grant Leah three wishes, but they often make mistakes. Each episode features Leah working together with the genies to resolve the problems they unintentionally cause, all while keeping Shimmer and Shine a secret from her next door neighbor and best friend Zac.\n\nIn the second season, the characters are transported to Zahramay Falls, a magical land where Shimmer and Shine live. Leah reveals her genies' existence to Zac, who is given a genie of his own, named Kaz. Shimmer and Shine continue to grant Leah wishes in Zahramay Falls and befriend the sovereign of the land, Princess Samira. The season includes Samira's pet peacock, Roya and Leah's pet fox, Parisa. Also, Zeta, a villainous sorceress, and finally, Zeta's dragon, Nazboo.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{Main|List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n{{:List of Shimmer and Shine episodes}}\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Humans and genies===\n*Shimmer (voiced by [[Eva Bella]] in US, and [[Mia Wiltshire]] in UK) \u2013 An optimistic genie with blue eyes and pink hair. She is enthusiastic and encouraging. She loves cleaning, glitter, and collecting genie bottles. Her pet is a [[gibbon monkey]] named Tala.\n*Shine (voiced by [[Isabella Cramp]] in US, [[Elie Simons]] and [[Mia Hope]] in UK) \u2013 A courageous genie with purple eyes and blue hair. She is an animal lover and is often hungry. Her pet is a [[Bengal tiger]] cub named Nahal. Due to her love of animals, she is very knowledgeable about the behaviors of magical creatures native to Zahramay Falls. Unlike her sister, she hates cleaning. A running gag involves Shine saying \"It's like I always say...\" only to humorously reveal that she has just made up whatever she says next.\n*Leah (voiced by [[Alina Foley]] in US, and [[Claudia Burns]] in UK) \u2013 A blonde girl with green eyes who owns a genie bottle necklace, which includes Shimmer and Shine.<ref>{{cite episode |title=The Sweetest Thing |minutes=3 |series=Shimmer and Shine |quote=Boom Zahramay! Your best friends are on the way.}}</ref> Although Shimmer and Shine usually mess up her wishes, Leah is patient and forgiving with them. Originally, she was forced to keep her genies' existence a secret from her close friend Zac, but revealed her secret to him after being transported to Zahramay Falls. In the second season, Princess Samira grants Leah and Zac's wish to visit Zahramay Falls whenever they want. While visiting her genies in Zahramay Falls, Leah magically dons a genie disguise in order to blend in, as humans are normally not allowed in Zahramay Falls.\n*Zac (voiced by [[Blake Bertrand]] in the first two seasons, [[Justin Felbinger]], and later [[Ethan Jones]] in season three and onward in US, and [[Innis Robertson-Pinnel]] in UK) \u2013 Leah's neighbor with red hair and blue eyes, and best human friend. In the first season, he is oblivious to the fact that Leah has genies. Whenever something strange or unusual happens, he responds to it in a carefree manner. He also has a habit of telling humorous experiences he has had to Leah. In the second season, he learns that Leah has genies and gets a genie of his own named Kaz.\n*Princess Samira (voiced by [[Nikki SooHoo]] in US, and [[Cariad Lloyd]] in UK) \u2013 The ruler of Zahramay Falls with violet eyes and ice blue hair with darker blue tips, who is in charge of checking up on all the genies in training. She can grant wishes along with the younger genies. She occasionally rewards genies with magic Genie Gems that can have a variety of magical effects. She acts as Shimmer and Shine's mentor and teacher. Despite Zeta being her self-proclaimed rival, Samira likes Zeta and is willing to give her a second chance at becoming a genie-in-training, which in season three is revealed to be due to her past friendship with Zeta when they were both students under Empress Caliana and hopes that Zeta and her can one day become friends again.\n*Zeta the Sorceress (voiced by [[Lacey Chabert]] in US & UK) \u2013 A resident of Zahramay Falls with green eyes and purple hair, who is Princess Samira's rival and wishes to replace her as the most powerful person in Zahramay Falls. Zeta is a sorceress instead of a genie, as she has no desire to grant the wishes of others, relying on magic potions and magical items. Her plans are almost always thwarted by Shimmer, Shine, and Leah. However, her own arrogance and ignorance can cause her to foil her own schemes as well. Despite the trouble she causes, the girls and Zac don't hold it against her and generally try to be friendly towards her when not foiling her schemes. Though she tends to be antagonistic towards Leah and her genies, she can be civil towards them at times and even work with them such when she finds herself and/or Nazboo in danger usually when her schemes backfire, which usually results in them saving her. Before becoming a sorceress, she was a genie-in-training under Empress Caliana along with Samira, whom Zeta befriended when she was a new student, though later quit school due to her jealousy of Samira and decided to become a sorceress instead, though despite her current rivalry with Samira is shown to cherish their past friendship as she held onto a feather pen Samira gave her when they first met along with a picture of the two of them together when they were both still friends.\n*Kaz (voiced by [[Jet Jurgensmeyer]] in US, and [[Harrison Noble]] in UK) \u2013 A genie in training with blue eyes and magenta hair who becomes Zac's genie in the second season. In contrast to Zac's easy-going and adventurous personality, Kaz is more cautious and scared easily. Despite their contrasting personalities, Zac and Kaz work well together and can be brave when he has to be. His cautious nature also means he puts more thought into how he grants Zac's wishes. Like most genies in Zahramay Falls, he has his own magic carpet, though sometimes uses Zac's Super Zoom Flyer, a magic carpet wished up by Zac. Kaz has a pet Ziffilon named Zain, who summoned by one of Zac's wishes after he learned that Kaz always wanted a Ziffilon as a pet. Though he and Zac get along well, he occasionally becomes unenthusiastic when granting wishes for Zac he would prefer not too. He was initially afraid of Zac's dog Rocket due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though eventually overcame his fear after Zac and the girls reminded him of how other genies were initially scared of Zain before they got to know him.\n*Empress Caliana (voiced by [[Barbara Eden]]) \u2013 Princess Samira's famous, semi-retired mentor with purple eyes and blonde hair with pink tips. Caliana was the one who gave Samira her special necklace back when she was a little genie-in-training. Empress Caliana was a great explorer when she was a little girl and made many groundbreaking discoveries, such as finding the Caliana Caves. She is also old friends with Rohan, the normally shy crystalline golem that guards the caves. When Zeta and Samira were younger, Caliana taught genies-in-training at her school in Genie Hall, where Zeta was her top student. While praising Zeta's potion making skills, she tried to teach her to be more considerate of others and assigned Samira to sit next to Zeta when Samira was a new student which lead to Samira befriending Zeta, though Zeta eventually became jealous of Samira when she became the class's new top student, which eventually led Zeta to quit school and decide to become a Sorceress instead after her attempt to sabotage Samira backfired, though Caliana expressed hope to Samira that she would one day return. \n*Captain Zora (voiced by [[Kellie Pickler]] from the season two finale, [[Kate Higgins]] from season three and onward) \u2013 A pirate genie who is Shine's idol.

Leah and her genies befriend Nila after Leah wishes to find a Mermaid after learning they are real.

After Nila and the girls obtain the gem by befriending its lonely Guardian, she teaches them the spell to activate the gem's power which can both transform into Mermaids as well as undo the transformation allowing the girls to visit Nila and go on underwater adventures with her. \n*Imma  (voiced by [[Grace Kaufman]]) \u2013 The Waterfall Genie who oversees the source of the rainbow waterfalls of Zahramay Falls in Rainbow Zahramay.

She has a talent for playing the keyboard.\n*Rocket \u2013 Zac's pet beagle who appears in several episodes of the first season and reappears in the third season. He is a rambunctious dog with a tendency to drool and chew on things which often causes trouble, though is simply an overly playful pouch who means no real harm. He has encountered Shimmer, Shine, Tala, and Nahal at various times. The only pet native to Leah and Zac's world, he eventually is wished to Zahramay Falls by Zac though is mistakenly seen as a monster by genies like Kaz and animals native to genie world like Parisa and Zain who are unfamiliar with dogs at first due to dogs not being native to their world, with the exception of Shimmer, Shine, Tala, Nahal, and Samira. After helping Zac stop Zeta from stealing Samira's staff, Samira permits Rocket to accompany Zac when he visits Zahramay Falls. \n*Nazboo \u2013 Zeta's talking pet dragon, who caters to her every need and acts as Zeta's underling. He has teal scales, purple eyes, white horns, a white tummy, and blue toes. He is somewhat clumsy and often accidentally causes Zeta's schemes to backfire. He can also get easily distracted by food or anything that piques his interest. He also enjoys getting an occasional tummy rub from Zeta. Though he acts as Zeta's underling most of the time, he is friendly towards Leah, Zac, and their genies as well as their pets to the point he often greets them by saying \"''Hi, Friends!''\" even in the middle of one of Zeta's schemes. Unlike Zeta, he is generally more considerate of others and prefers to play fair in competitions though usually assists Zeta in cheating. In the third season, he is revealed to be from Manetikar, The Land of Dragons and befriended Zeta when she came to Manetikar to find a dragon for a pet. Feeling sorry for Zeta after her attempt to make one of the larger flying dragons her pet failed, he agreed to become her pet and went home with her to her lair in Zahramay Falls, where he has lived ever since. He has a sister and two brothers who resemble him in appearance and personality.\n*Roya \u2013 Princess Samira's pet peacock, who resides in her palace. Roya is the polar opposite of Shimmer and Shine's pets, as she would much rather show off her feathers or practice walking gracefully than play or dance. Unlike Samira, Roya has a strong dislike for Zeta and Nazboo, to the point of literally chasing them out of Samira's Palace on one occasion. Once a year, she sheds a special feather with the ability to repair any magical object. \n*Parisa \u2013 Leah's pet Zahramay fox who possesses the ability to camouflage herself, making her practically invisible, whenever she wants. she also has a talent for painting. Parisa is introduced midway through the second season. Like Kaz and Zain, she was initially scared of Rocket, due to being unfamiliar with dogs, though not to the same degree that Kaz and Zain were.\n*Zain \u2013 Kaz's pet Ziffilon (a griffin-like creature). Kaz had always wanted a pet Ziffilon before getting Zain, so Zac uses one of his wishes to wish up a Ziffilon for Kaz. Zain is by far the largest of the pets, as he is big enough for Kaz to ride on his back, though despite his size Zain gets scared easily even more so than Kaz. Like most Ziffilons his favorite food is Zlam Berries and is originally from Ziffilon Island. Though he gets along with the other pets, he is frightened by Rocket at first due to being unfamiliar with dogs though after Zac reminds Kaz and Zain how other genies were scared of Zain at first, he and Kaz manage to overcome their initial fear of Rocket. \n*Zoomicorns \u2013 Winged Unicorns native to Zahramay Falls and Rainbow Zahramay introduced in the second season. They are friendly and helpful creatures who occasionally aid the girls and allow them to ride them. There is also a game called Zoomicorn Toss, where players ride flying Zahramay Cloud Boards while trying to throw rings around a Zoomicorn's horn as it flies around, without the use of magic as using magic is considered unfair. The only known named Zoomicorn, is Gleam who lives in Rainbow Zahramay that is a friend of the Glitter Genie Afina whom the girls meet and befriend during one of their adventures in Rainbow Zahramay in the third season. \n*Scallywag \u2013 The magical pet of the Pirate Genie Captain Zora, who helps Zora remember things that she forgets such as names and the meaning of words and phrases used by pirates. Scallywag flies around by spinning her tail in helicopter like fashion. Her magic goes out of control when scared, causing random magic effects. \n*Nazboo's Family \u2013 Nazboo's three siblings Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank who are introduced in the third season. They are all small flightless dragons that resemble Nazboo in appearance and share his friendly, playful nature as well as his love of food and tummy rubs. Nazboo and his siblings tend to get into trouble when they are together, much to Zeta's frustration and annoyance. Nazboo's sister Razboo has purple scales and wears a dark pink bow on her head. His brother Kazboo has dark green scales and a purple mohawk, while his brother Frank has blue scales and wears a light pink bowtie. Like their brother, Razboo, Kazboo, and Frank all have purple eyes, blue toes, and white bellies and horns. While Kazboo and Razboo are capable of speech like Nazboo, Frank's vocabulary is apparently limited to saying his own name, which doesn't rhyme with his other siblings' names.\n*Gleam \u2013 A blue glitter Zoomicorn native Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Lulu \u2013 Misha's pet Panda.\n*Zahrora, Zoomdust, and Zadazzle \u2013 three Zarahcorns.\n*Dahliza \u2013 Princess Adara's Zarahcorn.\n*Fuzzle Whuzzles \u2013 Little creatures in Rainbow Zarahmay.\n*Azah \u2013 Rubi's Zarahcorn.\n\n==Production==\n''Shimmer and Shine'' is based on an unreleased pilot that took six months to develop in 2013, with a reported completion date of September 2013.

Some of the children acquired noble godparents, and Giambattista was originally named after his godfather, a Venetian nobleman called Giovanni Battista Dori\u00e0. He was baptised on 16 April 1696 in the local church, [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] (then still officially the cathedral of Venice). His father died about a year later, leaving his mother to bring up a family of young children, presumably in somewhat difficult circumstances.<ref name=OxfordArtOnline-Tiepolo/>\n\nIn  1710 he became a pupil of [[Gregorio Lazzarini]], a successful painter with an eclectic style. He was, though, at least equally strongly influenced  by his study of the works of other contemporary artists such as [[Sebastiano Ricci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] and those of his Venetian predecessors, especially [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} A biography of his teacher, published in 1732, says that Tiepolo \"departed from [Lazzarini's] studied manner of painting, and, all spirit and fire, embraced a quick and resolute style\".{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} His earliest known works are depictions of the apostles, painted in [[spandrel]]s as part of the decoration of the church of the Ospedoletto in Venice in 1715\u20136.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37\u20138}} At about the same time he became painter to the Doge, [[Giovanni II Cornaro]], and oversaw the hanging of pictures at his palace, as well as painting many works himself, of which only two portraits have been identified.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=57}}  He painted his first fresco in 1716,  on the ceiling of a church at [[Biadene]], near [[Treviso]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=39}}   He probably left Lazzarini's studio in 1717, the year he  was received into the [[Fraglia]] or guild of painters.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}}\n\nIn around 1719\u201320 he painted a scheme of frescoes for the wealthy, and recently ennobled, publisher Giambattista Baglione in the hall of  his villa at [[Massanzago]] near Padua. Tiepolo depicted the ''Triumph of Aurora'' on the ceiling, and the ''Myth of Phaethon'' on the walls, creating the kind of fluid spatial illusion which was to become a recurring theme in his work.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=40\u20131}}\n\nIn 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned  to contribute a painting   on canvas  of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme for the nave of [[San Stae]] in Venice. The other artists involved included Ricci, Piazetta, and Pellegrini.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n===Marriage and children===\n\nIn 1719, Tiepolo married noblewoman Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of two contemporary Venetian painters [[Francesco Guardi|Francesco]] and [[Giovanni Antonio Guardi]]. Together, Tiepolo and his wife had nine children. Four daughters and three sons survived childhood. Two of his sons, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo|Domenico]] and [[Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo|Lorenzo]], painted with him as his assistants and later achieved some independent recognition, in particular [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]]. His children painted figures with a design similar to that of their father, but with distinctive, including genre, styles. His third son became a priest. [[Fabio Canal]], [[Francesco Lorenzi]], [[Domenico Pasquini]] were among his pupils.\n\n===Early mature work (1726\u20131750)===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| |''Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida'', 1742 until 1745]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Juno and Luna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''Juno and Luna'',  between 1735 and 1745]]\n[[File:Tiepolo - Perseus and Andromeda, ca. 1730\u201331.jpg|thumbnail|''Perseus and Andromeda'', between 1730 and 1731]]\nSome major commissions came from the patrician  Dolfin family. Dioniso Dolfin, the Archbishop of [[Udine]] in [[Friuli]] employed him to decorate a chapel in the cathedral at Udine, and then to paint another cycle depicting episodes from the lives of Abraham and his descendants from the book of Genesis at his archiepiscopal palace (the \"Arcivescovado\"){{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}}\n(completed 1726\u20131728). Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace  as \"a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance. {{sfn|Levey|1980|p=198\u20139}} Tiepolo used a much [[colour temperature|cooler]]  palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=490}}  His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of [[Ca' Dolfin]] on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726\u20131729), depicting  battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n[[Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos|These early masterpieces]], innovative amongst Venetian frescoes for their luminosity, brought him many commissions. He painted canvases for churches such as that of [[Verolanuova]] (1735\u20131740), for the Scuola dei [[Carmini]] (1740\u20131747), and the [[Scalzi (Venice)|Chiesa degli Scalzi]] (1743\u20131744; now destroyed) in [[Cannaregio]], a ceiling for the Palazzi Archinto and Casati-Dugnani in Milan (1731), the [[Colleoni Chapel]] in [[Bergamo]] (1732\u20131733), a ceiling for the [[Gesuati]] (Santa Maria del Rosario) in Venice of ''St. Dominic Instituting the Rosary'' (1737\u20131739), Palazzo Clerici, Milan (1740), decorations for Villa Cordellini at [[Montecchio Maggiore]] (1743\u20131744) and for the ballroom of the [[Palazzo Labia]] in Venice (now a television studio), showing the ''Story of [[Cleopatra]]'' (1745\u20131750).\n\n===Etchings===\nTiepolo produced two sets of etchings, the ''Capricci'' (c. 1740\u20131742) and the ''Scherzi di  fantasia'' (c. 1743\u20131757). The ten ''[[Capriccio (painting)|capricci]]'' were first published by [[Anton Maria Zanetti]], incorporated into the third edition of  a  compilation  of woodcuts after Parmigiano. They were not published separately until 1785. The subject matter is often bizarre and fantastical, and the works owe a lot to the example of [[Salvator Rosa]] and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=349\u2013 50}} The 23 Scherzi were etched over more than ten years and privately circulated, only being commercially published after Tiepolo's death, with numbers and titles added by his son, Giandomenico. Subjects include  mysterious Eastern figures, and, in  some of the later prints, scenes of [[necromancy]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=358\u2013 9}}\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 034.jpg|thumb|''Apotheosis of Spain'' (1762-1766) in [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III, 1762, NGA 12137.jpg|thumb|''Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III'', 1762, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\n===W\u00fcrzburg Residenz (1750\u20131753)===\n\nBy 1750, Tiepolo's reputation was firmly established throughout Europe, with the help of his friend [[Francesco Algarotti]], an art dealer, critic and collector. That year, at the behest of Prince Bishop Karl Philip von Greiffenklau, he traveled to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] where he arrived in November 1750. He remained there for three years during which he executed ceiling paintings in the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence|New Residenz]] palace (completed 1744). He frescoed the Kaisersaal salon in collaboration with his sons Giandomenico and Lorenzo and was then invited to deliver a design for the grandiose entrance staircase (''Treppenhaus'') designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. It is a massive ceiling [[fresco]] at {{gaps|7|287 square feet}} {{nowrap|(677 m<sup>2</sup>)}}, and was completed in November 1753.{{sfn|Levey|1980|pp=225\u2013230}} His ''Allegory of the Planets and Continents'' depicts Apollo embarking on his daily course; deities around him symbolize the planets; allegorical figures (on the cornice) represent the four continents. He included several portraits in the Europe section of this fresco, including a self-portrait; one of his son Giandomenico; one of the prince-bishop von Greiffenklau; one of the painter Antonio Bossi; and one of the architect, [[Balthasar Neumann]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |title=Residenz staircase |publisher=Wurzburg Residenz |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629135139/http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |archivedate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Return to Venice and the Veneto (1753\u20131770)===\n[[File:The Immaculate Conception, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|[[The Immaculate Conception (Tiepolo)|''The Immaculate Conception'']], painted between 1767 and 1768]]\nTiepolo returned to Venice in 1753. He  was now in demand locally, as well as abroad where he was elected President of the Academy of [[Padua]]. He went on to complete theatrical frescoes for churches; the ''Triumph of Faith'' for the [[Chiesa della Piet\u00e0, Venice|Chiesa della Piet\u00e0]]; panel frescos for [[Ca' Rezzonico]] (which now also houses his ceiling fresco from the [[Palazzo Barbarigo]]); and paintings for patrician villas in the Venetian countryside, such as [[Villa Valmarana \"Ai Nani\"|Villa Valmarana]] in [[Vicenza]] and an elaborate panegyric ceiling for the [[Villa Pisani]] in [[Stra]].\n\nIn some  celebrated frescoes at the [[Palazzo Labia]], he depicted two scenes from the life of Cleopatra: ''Meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra''[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/1meetin.html] and ''Banquet of Cleopatra'',[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/2banquze.html] as well as, in a central ceiling fresco, the ''Triumph of Bellerophon over Time''. Here he  collaborated with  [[Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna]]. This connection with Colonna, who also designed sets for opera, highlights the increasing tendency towards composition as a staged fiction in Tiepolo's frescoes. The architecture of the ''Banquet'' fresco  also recalls that of  Veronese's ''Wedding at Cana''. In 1757, he painted an altar piece for the Thiene family, representing the apotheosis of [[Saint Cajetan]]. It is in the church of hamlet of Rampazzo in the [[Camisano Vicentino]].\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Apollo Pursuing Daphne, 1755-1760.jpg|thumbnail|''Apollo Pursuing Daphne'', 1755\u20131760]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Los hebreos recogiendo el man\u00e1 en el desierto (boceto) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| ''[[Manna]] in the desert'']]\nIn 1761, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] commissioned Tiepolo to create a ceiling fresco to decorate the throne room of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The [[panegyric]] theme is the ''Apotheosis of Spain'' and has allegorical depictions recalling the dominance of Spain in the Americas and across the globe.\n\nHe also painted two other ceilings in the palace, and carried out many private commissions in Spain.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}However he suffered from  the jealousy and the bitter opposition of the rising champion of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; at the instigation of Mengs' supporter, the King's confessor [[Joaquim de Electa]], had Tiepolo's series of canvases for the church of S. Pascual at [[Aranjuez]] replaced by works by his favourite.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}\n\nTiepolo died in Madrid on March 27, 1770.\n\nAfter his death, the rise of a stern Neoclassicism and the post-revolutionary decline of absolutism led to the slow decline of the Rococo style associated with his name, but failed to dent his reputation. In 1772, Tiepolo's son was sufficiently respected to be  painter to Doge [[Giovanni II Cornaro]], in charge of the decoration of [[Palazzo Mocenigo]] in the ''sestiere'' of [[San Polo]], [[Venice]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Paintings before 1740===\n{|  class=wikitable\n!  width=\"40%\" | Work\n!  width=\"10%\" | Date\n!  width=\"40%\" | Location\n!  width=\"10%\" | Link\n|-

He was prolific, and worked not only in Italy, but also in Germany and Spain.\n\nGiovan Battista Tiepolo, together with [[Giambattista Pittoni]], [[Canaletto]], [[Giovan Battista Piazzetta]], [[Giuseppe Maria Crespi]] and [[Francesco Guardi]] are considered the traditional [[Old Masters]] of that period.\n\nSuccessful from the beginning of his career, he has been described by [[Michael Levey]] as \"the greatest decorative painter of eighteenth-century Europe, as well as its most able craftsman.\"{{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}}\n\n==Biography==\n[[file:Accademia - Giambattista Tiepolo, San Domenico in gloria 1723.jpg|thumb|''The Glory of St. Dominic'' 1723]]\n[[Image:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva - Walters 37657.jpg|thumb|''Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva'' shows Massiva, the nephew of a prince of Numidia, being released after capture by [[Scipio Africanus]]<ref>{{cite web |publisher= |url= http://art.thewalters.org/detail/19755 |title=Scipio Africanus Freeing Massiva }}</ref> [[Walters Art Museum]].]]\n\n[[File:Giambattista Tiepolo - The Banquet of Cleopatra - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''[[The Banquet of Cleopatra (Tiepolo)|The Banquet of Cleopatra]]'']]\n\n===Early life (1696\u20131726)===\nBorn in Venice, he was the youngest of six children of Domenico and Orsetta Tiepolo.<ref name=OxfordArtOnline-Tiepolo>{{cite encyclopedia | last=Barcham | first=William L | title=Tiepolo |url=http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T084951 | encyclopedia=[[Grove Art Online]] | publisher=[[Oxford Art Online]], Oxford University Press | accessdate=3 May 2014}} {{subscription}}</ref> His father was a small shipping merchant<ref name=treccani>{{cite encyclopedia | encyclopedia=[[Treccani]] | title=Ti\u00e8polo, Giambattista | language=Italian| url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giambattista-tiepolo/ | publisher=Treccani | accessdate=3 May 2014}}</ref> who belonged to a family that bore the prestigious [[Jacopo Tiepolo|patrician name of Tiepolo]] without claiming any noble descent. Some of the children acquired noble godparents, and Giambattista was originally named after his godfather, a Venetian nobleman called Giovanni Battista Dori\u00e0. He was baptised on 16 April 1696 in the local church, [[San Pietro di Castello (church)|San Pietro di Castello]] (then still officially the cathedral of Venice). His father died about a year later, leaving his mother to bring up a family of young children, presumably in somewhat difficult circumstances.<ref name=OxfordArtOnline-Tiepolo/>\n\nIn  1710 he became a pupil of [[Gregorio Lazzarini]], a successful painter with an eclectic style. He was, though, at least equally strongly influenced  by his study of the works of other contemporary artists such as [[Sebastiano Ricci]] and [[Giovanni Battista Piazzetta]] and those of his Venetian predecessors, especially [[Tintoretto]] and [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} A biography of his teacher, published in 1732, says that Tiepolo \"departed from [Lazzarini's] studied manner of painting, and, all spirit and fire, embraced a quick and resolute style\".{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}} His earliest known works are depictions of the apostles, painted in [[spandrel]]s as part of the decoration of the church of the Ospedoletto in Venice in 1715\u20136.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37\u20138}} At about the same time he became painter to the Doge, [[Giovanni II Cornaro]], and oversaw the hanging of pictures at his palace, as well as painting many works himself, of which only two portraits have been identified.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=57}}  He painted his first fresco in 1716,  on the ceiling of a church at [[Biadene]], near [[Treviso]].{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=39}}   He probably left Lazzarini's studio in 1717, the year he  was received into the [[Fraglia]] or guild of painters.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=37}}\n\nIn around 1719\u201320 he painted a scheme of frescoes for the wealthy, and recently ennobled, publisher [[Giambattista Baglione]] in the hall of  his villa at [[Massanzago]] near Padua. Tiepolo depicted the ''Triumph of Aurora'' on the ceiling, and the ''Myth of Phaethon'' on the walls, creating the kind of fluid spatial illusion which was to become a recurring theme in his work.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=40\u20131}}\n\nIn 1722 he was one of twelve artists commissioned  to contribute a painting   on canvas  of one of the apostles as part of a decorative scheme for the nave of [[San Stae]] in Venice. The other artists involved included Ricci, Piazetta, and Pellegrini.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n===Marriage and children===\n\nIn 1719, Tiepolo married noblewoman Maria Cecilia Guardi, sister of two contemporary Venetian painters [[Francesco Guardi|Francesco]] and [[Giovanni Antonio Guardi]]. Together, Tiepolo and his wife had nine children. Four daughters and three sons survived childhood. Two of his sons, [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo|Domenico]] and [[Lorenzo Baldissera Tiepolo|Lorenzo]], painted with him as his assistants and later achieved some independent recognition, in particular [[Giovanni Domenico Tiepolo]]. His children painted figures with a design similar to that of their father, but with distinctive, including genre, styles. His third son became a priest. [[Fabio Canal]], [[Francesco Lorenzi]], [[Domenico Pasquini]] were among his pupils.\n\n===Early mature work (1726\u20131750)===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| |''Rinaldo Enchanted by Armida'', 1742 until 1745]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Juno and Luna - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail|''Juno and Luna'',  between 1735 and 1745]]\n[[File:Tiepolo - Perseus and Andromeda, ca. 1730\u201331.jpg|thumbnail|''Perseus and Andromeda'', between 1730 and 1731]]\nSome major commissions came from the patrician  Dolfin family. Dioniso Dolfin, the Archbishop of [[Udine]] in [[Friuli]] employed him to decorate a chapel in the cathedral at Udine, and then to paint another cycle depicting episodes from the lives of Abraham and his descendants from the book of Genesis at his archiepiscopal palace (the \"Arcivescovado\"){{sfn|Levey|1980|p=193}}\n(completed 1726\u20131728). Despite their elevated subject matter, they are bright in colour, and light-hearted in mood: Michael Levey describes the paintings at the palace  as \"a shimmering set of tableaux, full of wit and elegance. {{sfn|Levey|1980|p=198\u20139}} Tiepolo used a much [[colour temperature|cooler]]  palette than previous Venetian painters, in order to create a convincing effect of daylight.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=490}}  His first masterpieces in Venice were a cycle of ten enormous canvases painted to decorate a large reception room of [[Ca' Dolfin]] on the Grand Canal of Venice (ca. 1726\u20131729), depicting  battles and triumphs from the history of ancient Rome.{{sfn|''Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770''|1996|p=41}}\n\n[[Ca' Dolfin Tiepolos|These early masterpieces]], innovative amongst Venetian frescoes for their luminosity, brought him many commissions. He painted canvases for churches such as that of [[Verolanuova]] (1735\u20131740), for the Scuola dei [[Carmini]] (1740\u20131747), and the [[Scalzi (Venice)|Chiesa degli Scalzi]] (1743\u20131744; now destroyed) in [[Cannaregio]], a ceiling for the Palazzi Archinto and Casati-Dugnani in Milan (1731), the [[Colleoni Chapel]] in [[Bergamo]] (1732\u20131733), a ceiling for the [[Gesuati]] (Santa Maria del Rosario) in Venice of ''St. Dominic Instituting the Rosary'' (1737\u20131739), Palazzo Clerici, Milan (1740), decorations for Villa Cordellini at [[Montecchio Maggiore]] (1743\u20131744) and for the ballroom of the [[Palazzo Labia]] in Venice (now a television studio), showing the ''Story of [[Cleopatra]]'' (1745\u20131750).\n\n===Etchings===\nTiepolo produced two sets of etchings, the ''Capricci'' (c. 1740\u20131742) and the ''Scherzi di  fantasia'' (c. 1743\u20131757). The ten ''[[Capriccio (painting)|capricci]]'' were first published by [[Anton Maria Zanetti]], incorporated into the third edition of  a  compilation  of woodcuts after Parmigiano. They were not published separately until 1785. The subject matter is often bizarre and fantastical, and the works owe a lot to the example of [[Salvator Rosa]] and [[Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=349\u2013 50}} The 23 Scherzi were etched over more than ten years and privately circulated, only being commercially published after Tiepolo's death, with numbers and titles added by his son, Giandomenico. Subjects include  mysterious Eastern figures, and, in  some of the later prints, scenes of [[necromancy]].{{sfn|Giambattista Tiepolo 1698\u20131770|1996|pp=358\u2013 9}}\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo 034.jpg|thumb|''Apotheosis of Spain'' (1762-1766) in [[Royal Palace of Madrid]].]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III, 1762, NGA 12137.jpg|thumb|''Wealth and Benefits of the Spanish Monarchy under Charles III'', 1762, [[National Gallery of Art]]]]\n\n===W\u00fcrzburg Residenz (1750\u20131753)===\n\nBy 1750, Tiepolo's reputation was firmly established throughout Europe, with the help of his friend [[Francesco Algarotti]], an art dealer, critic and collector. That year, at the behest of Prince Bishop Karl Philip von Greiffenklau, he traveled to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] where he arrived in November 1750. He remained there for three years during which he executed ceiling paintings in the [[W\u00fcrzburg Residence|New Residenz]] palace (completed 1744). He frescoed the Kaisersaal salon in collaboration with his sons Giandomenico and Lorenzo and was then invited to deliver a design for the grandiose entrance staircase (''Treppenhaus'') designed by [[Balthasar Neumann]]. It is a massive ceiling [[fresco]] at {{gaps|7|287 square feet}} {{nowrap|(677 m<sup>2</sup>)}}, and was completed in November 1753.{{sfn|Levey|1980|pp=225\u2013230}} His ''Allegory of the Planets and Continents'' depicts Apollo embarking on his daily course; deities around him symbolize the planets; allegorical figures (on the cornice) represent the four continents. He included several portraits in the Europe section of this fresco, including a self-portrait; one of his son Giandomenico; one of the prince-bishop von Greiffenklau; one of the painter Antonio Bossi; and one of the architect, [[Balthasar Neumann]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |title=Residenz staircase |publisher=Wurzburg Residenz |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629135139/http://www.residenz-wuerzburg.de/englisch/residenz/treppe05.htm |archivedate=2008-06-29 }}</ref>\n\n===Return to Venice and the Veneto (1753\u20131770)===\n[[File:The Immaculate Conception, by Giovanni Battista Tiepolo, from Prado in Google Earth.jpg|thumb|[[The Immaculate Conception (Tiepolo)|''The Immaculate Conception'']], painted between 1767 and 1768]]\nTiepolo returned to Venice in 1753. He  was now in demand locally, as well as abroad where he was elected President of the Academy of [[Padua]]. He went on to complete theatrical frescoes for churches; the ''Triumph of Faith'' for the [[Chiesa della Piet\u00e0, Venice|Chiesa della Piet\u00e0]]; panel frescos for [[Ca' Rezzonico]] (which now also houses his ceiling fresco from the [[Palazzo Barbarigo]]); and paintings for patrician villas in the Venetian countryside, such as [[Villa Valmarana \"Ai Nani\"|Villa Valmarana]] in [[Vicenza]] and an elaborate panegyric ceiling for the [[Villa Pisani]] in [[Stra]].\n\nIn some  celebrated frescoes at the [[Palazzo Labia]], he depicted two scenes from the life of Cleopatra: ''Meeting of Anthony and Cleopatra''[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/1meetin.html] and ''Banquet of Cleopatra'',[http://www.wga.hu/html/t/tiepolo/gianbatt/4labia/2banquze.html] as well as, in a central ceiling fresco, the ''Triumph of Bellerophon over Time''. Here he  collaborated with  [[Girolamo Mengozzi Colonna]]. This connection with Colonna, who also designed sets for opera, highlights the increasing tendency towards composition as a staged fiction in Tiepolo's frescoes. The architecture of the ''Banquet'' fresco  also recalls that of  Veronese's ''Wedding at Cana''. In 1757, he painted an altar piece for the Thiene family, representing the apotheosis of [[Saint Cajetan]]. It is in the church of hamlet of Rampazzo in the [[Camisano Vicentino]].\n\n===Madrid===\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Apollo Pursuing Daphne, 1755-1760.jpg|thumbnail|''Apollo Pursuing Daphne'', 1755\u20131760]]\n[[File:Giovanni Battista Tiepolo - Los hebreos recogiendo el man\u00e1 en el desierto (boceto) - Google Art Project.jpg|thumbnail| ''[[Manna]] in the desert'']]\nIn 1761, [[Charles III of Spain|Charles III]] commissioned Tiepolo to create a ceiling fresco to decorate the throne room of the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]]. The [[panegyric]] theme is the ''Apotheosis of Spain'' and has allegorical depictions recalling the dominance of Spain in the Americas and across the globe.\n\nHe also painted two other ceilings in the palace, and carried out many private commissions in Spain.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}However he suffered from  the jealousy and the bitter opposition of the rising champion of [[Neoclassicism]], [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]; at the instigation of Mengs' supporter, the King's confessor [[Joaquim de Electa]], had Tiepolo's series of canvases for the church of S. Pascual at [[Aranjuez]] replaced by works by his favourite.{{sfn|Wittkower|1973|p=486}}\n\nTiepolo died in Madrid on March 27, 1770.\n\nAfter his death, the rise of a stern Neoclassicism and the post-revolutionary decline of absolutism led to the slow decline of the Rococo style associated with his name, but failed to dent his reputation. In 1772, Tiepolo's son was sufficiently respected to be  painter to Doge [[Giovanni II Cornaro]], in charge of the decoration of [[Palazzo Mocenigo]] in the ''sestiere'' of [[San Polo]], [[Venice]].\n\n==List of works==\n\n===Paintings before 1740===\n{|  class=wikitable\n!  width=\"40%\" | Work\n!  width=\"10%\" | Date\n!  width=\"40%\" | Location\n!  width=\"10%\" | Link\n|-

Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]].

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

movie rating]].

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game.

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed.

The twins also serve as executive producers with [[Shawn Levy]] and Dan Cohen. The series premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. Set in the 1980s in the fictional town of Hawkins, [[Indiana]], the first season focuses on the investigation into the disappearance of a young boy amid supernatural events occurring around the town, including the appearance of a girl with [[Psychokinesis|psychokinetic]] abilities.

Setting the series in the 1980s, the Duffer Brothers infused references to the [[1980s#Popular culture|pop culture of that decade]] while several themes and directorial aspects were inspired primarily by the works of [[Steven Spielberg]], [[John Carpenter]], and [[Stephen King]], as well as [[anime]] and [[video game]]s. They also took inspiration from strange experiments that took place during the [[Cold War]] and real world [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] involving secret government experiments.\n\n''Stranger Things'' has attracted record viewership on Netflix and has a broad, active, and international fan base. The series has received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to [[1980s in film|1980s films]].

As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as [[Project MKUltra]], which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual.

movie rating]].

They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.<ref name=\"rs\" />\n\nThe title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the ''Stranger Things'' title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of [[R/GA]], led by creative director Michelle Doughtey.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/08/stranger-things-titles-came-perfectly-retro/ |title=How the Stranger Things Titles Came Out So Perfectly Retro |first=Sean Patrick |last=Ferrell |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=February 11, 2017 |website=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]}}</ref> Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R/GA, such as ''[[Altered States]]'' and ''[[The Dead Zone (film)|The Dead Zone]]''. They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with [[ITC Benguiat]], requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film ''[[Bullitt]]'', which the producers had suggested to the studio.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/stranger-things/ |title=Stranger Things (2016) |first=Will |last=Perkins |date=August 9, 2016 |accessdate=February 9, 2017 |website=[[Art of the Title]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Main|Music of Stranger Things}}\nThe ''Stranger Things'' original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band [[Survive (band)|Survive]].<!-- based on wp guidelines, do not change to S U R V I V E --><ref name=\"billboard music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/rock/7488050/survive-stranger-things-soundtrack-interview |title=''Stranger Things'' Co-Composer Shares the Story Behind 2016's Most Unlikely Musical Sensation |last=Kaufman |first=Gil |date=August 29, 2016 |website=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]] |accessdate=August 31, 2016}}</ref> It makes extensive use of [[synthesizer]]s in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including [[Jean-Michel Jarre]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Vangelis]], [[Goblin (band)|Goblin]], [[John Carpenter]], [[Giorgio Moroder]], and [[Fabio Frizzi]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.factmag.com/2016/08/06/stranger-things-playlist/ |title=Stranger Things: 10 eerie electronic gems to hear if you loved the Netflix show |website=FACT Magazine: Music News, New Music. |accessdate=September 5, 2016}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix.<ref name=\"billboard music\" /><ref name=\"rs music\">{{cite web |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/stranger-things-survive-talk-their-creepy-nostalgic-score-w431789 |title='Stranger Things': Meet the Band Behind Show's Creepy, Nostalgic Score |first=Christopher |last=Weingarten |date=August 1, 2016 |accessdate=February 10, 2017 |website=[[Rolling Stone]]}}</ref> The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film ''[[The Guest (2014 American film)|The Guest]]'', where Survive features on the soundtrack.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Gruttadaro |first1=Andrew |title=How the Duffer Brothers Picked the Perfect Music for 'Stranger Things' |url=https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2016/08/stranger-things-music-duffer-brothers-interview |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |work=[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]] |date=August 2, 2018}}</ref> Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music;

Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/4/16418816/stranger-things-game-iphone-android |title=This Stranger Things mobile game will help prepare you for the Upside Down |first=Andrew |last=Webster |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[The Verge]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2017-10-04-theres-an-official-stranger-things-video-game-and-it-looks-retro-cool |title=There's an official Stranger Things video game and it looks retro cool |first=Wesley |last=Yin-Poole |date=October 4, 2017 |accessdate=October 4, 2017 |website=[[Eurogamer]]}}</ref> BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game.

The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed.

{"title_page": "List of Army Cadet Force units", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=February 2012}}\nThe [[Army Cadet Force]] (ACF) is a cadet organisation based in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is a voluntary youth group sponsored by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] ([[British Army]]). The ACF is largely composed of individual units. These units are organised into several different companies/squadrons, which in turn are organised into several different [[Corps]] or [[Regiment]]s of their parent British Army units.\n\n==Organisation==\nMost British [[county|counties]] have centralised cadet forces that make up the Army Cadet Force as a national whole. The counties are generally split into [[company (military unit)|companies]], each of which includes several '[[Detachment (military)|detachments]]', the name given to a unit of cadets that parade in a particular town or village. Battalions are usually affiliated with a certain [[Regiment]] or [[Corps]] within the British Army, and wear their insignia including cap badge, the colour of beret and [[stable belt]] subject to individual County/Area regulations. Detachments can be given special names after famous battles fought by the British Army, e.g. Rhine, Gibraltar and Waterloo.

It was completed in March 2008, at a total cost of \u00a31.33M, this was paid for by East Midlands [[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]] (EM RFCA) auctioning the old Barracks. This was done because the old barracks, situated in Newport in Lincoln, was falling into disrepair after the TA Detachment closed down in the 1990s leaving Lincs ACF the only occupants. Newport Barracks and its land was sold at \u00a31.65M and so the total project left EM RFCA with an extra \u00a30.32M. This saving was planned under its 'Spend to Save' scheme. The new Headquarters of Lincs ACF in Sobraon Barracks was officially opened in June 2009 by HM Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, Mr Tony Worth, with a celebratory open day and the building being blessed by the Padre of Lincs ACF.\n\n'''Nottinghamshire Army Cadet Force''' has detachments in [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], [[Bakersfield, Nottingham|Bakersfield]], [[Beeston,

It is a voluntary youth group sponsored by the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]] ([[British Army]]). The ACF is largely composed of individual units. These units are organised into several different companies/squadrons, which in turn are organised into several different [[Corps]] or [[Regiment]]s of their parent British Army units.\n\n==Organisation==\nMost British [[county|counties]] have centralised cadet forces that make up the Army Cadet Force as a national whole. The counties are generally split into [[company (military unit)|companies]], each of which includes several '[[Detachment (military)|detachments]]', the name given to a unit of cadets that parade in a particular town or village. Battalions are usually affiliated with a certain [[Regiment]] or [[Corps]] within the British Army, and wear their insignia including cap badge, the colour of beret and [[stable belt]] subject to individual County/Area regulations. Detachments can be given special names after famous battles fought by the British Army, e.g. Rhine, Gibraltar and Waterloo. But some detachments are just called by the name of the town they reside in.\n\n==England==\n\n===North East England===\n'''Cleveland ACF''' has detachments

It was completed in March 2008, at a total cost of \u00a31.33M, this was paid for by East Midlands [[Reserve Forces and Cadets Association]] (EM RFCA) auctioning the old Barracks. This was done because the old barracks, situated in Newport in Lincoln, was falling into disrepair after the TA Detachment closed down in the 1990s leaving Lincs ACF the only occupants. Newport Barracks and its land was sold at \u00a31.65M and so the total project left EM RFCA with an extra \u00a30.32M. This saving was planned under its 'Spend to Save' scheme. The new Headquarters of Lincs ACF in Sobraon Barracks was officially opened in June 2009 by HM Lord Lieutenant of Lincolnshire, Mr Tony Worth, with a celebratory open day and the building being blessed by the Padre of Lincs ACF.\n\n'''Nottinghamshire Army Cadet Force''' has detachments in [[Arnold, Nottinghamshire|Arnold]], [[Bakersfield, Nottingham|Bakersfield]], [[Beeston,
