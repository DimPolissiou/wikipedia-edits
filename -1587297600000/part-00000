The design of the bearing may, for example, provide for free [[line (geometry)|linear]] movement of the moving part or for free [[rotation around a fixed axis]]; or, it may ''prevent'' a motion by controlling the [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s of [[normal force]]s that bear on the moving parts.  Most bearings facilitate the desired motion by minimizing friction. Bearings are classified broadly according to the type of operation, the motions allowed, or to the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts.\n\nRotary bearings hold rotating components such as [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]]s or [[axle]]s within mechanical systems, and transfer axial and radial loads from the source of the load to the structure supporting it.  The simplest form of bearing, the ''[[plain bearing]]'', consists of a shaft rotating in a hole.  [[Lubrication]] is used to reduce friction.  In the ''[[ball bearing]]'' and ''[[roller bearing]]'', to reduce sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability and performance.\n \nThe term \"bearing\" is derived from the verb \"[[wikt:bear#Verb|to bear]]\";<ref name=\"MWCD_online-headword_bearing\">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=headwords \"bearing\" and \"bear\" |work=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, online subscription version |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate.htm |postscript=.

The simplest bearings are [[bearing surface]]s, cut or formed into a part, with varying degrees of control over the form, size, [[surface roughness|roughness]] and location of the surface. Other bearings are separate devices installed into a machine or machine part.

This is the first recorded use of bearings in an aerospace design. However, [[Agostino Ramelli]] is the first to have published sketches of roller and thrust bearings.<ref name=\"guran\"/> An issue with ball and roller bearings is that the balls or rollers rub against each other causing additional friction which can be reduced by enclosing the balls or rollers within a cage. The captured, or caged, [[ball bearing]] was originally described by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe first practical caged-roller bearing was invented in the mid-1740s by [[horology|horologist]] [[John Harrison]] for his H3 marine timekeeper. This uses the bearing for a very limited oscillating motion but Harrison also used a similar bearing in a truly rotary application in a contemporaneous regulator clock.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe first modern recorded [[patent]] on ball bearings was awarded to [[Philip Vaughan]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] inventor and [[ironmaster]] who created the first design for a ball bearing in [[Carmarthen]] in 1794. His was the first modern ball-bearing design, with the ball running along a groove in the axle assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intechbearing.com/5200Series-DoubleRowAngularContactBallBearings-SealsandShields-Shop.html|title=Double- Row Angular Contact Ball Bearings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511155609/http://www.intechbearing.com/5200Series-DoubleRowAngularContactBallBearings-SealsandShields-Shop.html|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBearings have played a pivotal role in the nascent [[Industrial Revolution]], allowing the new industrial machinery to operate efficiently. For example, they saw use for holding [[wheel and axle]] to greatly reduce friction over that of dragging an object by making the friction act over a shorter distance as the wheel turned.\n\nThe first plain and rolling-element bearings were [[wood]] closely followed by [[bronze]]. Over their history bearings have been made of many materials including [[ceramic]], [[sapphire]], [[glass]], [[steel]], [[bronze]], other metals and plastic (e.g., [[nylon]], [[polyoxymethylene]], [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], and [[UHMWPE]]) which are all used today.\n\nWatch makers produce \"jeweled\" watches using sapphire plain bearings to reduce friction thus allowing more precise time keeping.\n\nEven basic materials can have good durability. As examples, wooden bearings can still be seen today in old clocks or in water mills where the water provides cooling and lubrication.\n\n[[Image:Early Timken roller bearing.jpg|thumb|Early [[Timken Roller Bearing Company|Timken]] [[tapered roller bearing]] with notched rollers]]\nThe first [[patent]] for a radial style [[ball bearing]] was awarded to [[Jules Suriray]], a Parisian bicycle mechanic, on 3 August 1869.

The following year he formed a company to produce his innovation. Over a century the company grew to make bearings of all types, including specialty steel and an array of related products and services.\n\nErich Franke invented and patented the [[wire race bearing]] in 1934. His focus was on a bearing design with a cross section as small as possible and which could be integrated into the enclosing design.

Examples include ultra high speed bearings in dental drills, [[aerospace bearings]] in the Mars Rover, gearbox and wheel bearings on automobiles, flexure bearings in optical alignment systems, bicycle wheel hubs, and [[air bearings]] used in [[Coordinate-measuring machine]]s.\n\n==Common==\nBy far, the most common bearing is the [[plain bearing]], a bearing which uses surfaces in rubbing contact, often with a [[lubricant]] such as oil or graphite. A plain bearing may or may not be a [[wikt:discrete#Adjective|discrete]] device. It may be nothing more than the [[bearing surface]] of a hole with a shaft passing through it, or of a planar surface that [[wikt:bear#Verb|bears]] another (in these cases, not a discrete device); or it may be a layer of [[Babbitt (metal)|bearing metal]] either fused to the substrate (semi-discrete) or in the form of a separable sleeve (discrete). With suitable lubrication, plain bearings often give entirely acceptable accuracy, life, and friction at minimal cost. Therefore, they are very widely used.\n\nHowever, there are many applications where a more suitable bearing can improve efficiency, accuracy, service intervals, reliability, speed of operation, size, weight, and costs of purchasing and operating machinery.\n\nThus, there are many types of bearings, with varying shape, material, lubrication, principle of operation, and so on.\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:BallBearing.gif|thumb|Animation of ball bearing (Ideal figure without a cage). The inner ring rotates and the outer ring is stationary.]]\n\nThere are at least 6 common types of bearing, each of which operates on different principles:\n*[[Plain bearing]], consisting of a shaft rotating in a hole. There are several specific styles: bushing, [[journal bearing]], sleeve bearing, rifle bearing, [[composite bearing]];\n*[[Rolling-element bearing]], in which rolling elements placed between the turning and stationary races prevent sliding friction.  There are two main types:\n**[[Ball bearing]], in which the rolling elements are spherical balls;\n**[[Roller bearing]], in which the rolling elements are cylindrical, taper or spherical rollers;\n*[[Jewel bearing]], a plain bearing in which one of the bearing surfaces is made of an ultrahard glassy jewel material such as [[sapphire]] to reduce friction and wear;\n*[[Fluid bearing]], a noncontact bearing in which the load is supported by a gas or liquid (i.e. [[air bearing]]);\n*[[Magnetic bearing]], in which the load is supported by a [[magnetic field]];\n*[[Flexure bearing]], in which the motion is supported by a load element which bends.\n\n==Motions==\nCommon motions permitted by bearings are:\n\n*Radial rotation e.g. shaft rotation;\n*linear motion e.g. drawer;\n*spherical rotation e.g. ball and socket joint;\n*hinge motion e.g. door, elbow, knee.\n\n==Friction==\nReducing friction in bearings is often important for efficiency, to reduce wear and to facilitate extended use at high speeds and to avoid overheating and premature failure of the bearing. Essentially, a bearing can reduce friction by virtue of its shape, by its material, or by introducing and containing a fluid between surfaces or by separating the surfaces with an electromagnetic field.\n\n*'''By shape''', gains advantage usually by using spheres or [[Roller bearing|rollers]], or by forming flexure bearings.\n*'''By material''', exploits the nature of the bearing material used. (An example would be using plastics that have low surface friction.)\n*'''By fluid''', exploits the low viscosity of a layer of fluid, such as a lubricant or as a pressurized medium to keep the two solid parts from touching, or by reducing the normal force between them.\n*'''By fields''', exploits electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic fields, to keep solid parts from touching.\n*'''Air pressure''' exploits air pressure to keep solid parts from touching.\n\nCombinations of these can even be employed within the same bearing. An example of this is where the cage is made of plastic, and it separates the rollers/balls, which reduce friction by their shape and finish.\n\n==Loads==\n\nBearing design varies depending on the size and directions of the forces that they are required to support.  Forces can be predominately [[radius|radial]], [[axis of rotation|axial]] ([[thrust bearing]]s), or [[bending moment]]s perpendicular to the main axis.\n\n==Speeds==\nDifferent bearing types have different operating speed limits.  Speed is typically specified as maximum relative surface speeds, often specified ft/s or m/s.  Rotational bearings typically describe performance in terms of the product ''DN'' where ''D'' is the mean diameter (often in mm) of the bearing and ''N'' is the rotation rate in revolutions per minute.\n\nGenerally there is considerable speed range overlap between bearing types.  Plain bearings typically handle only lower speeds, rolling element bearings are faster, followed by fluid bearings and finally magnetic bearings which are limited ultimately by centripetal force overcoming material strength.\n\n==Play==\nSome applications apply bearing loads from varying directions and accept only limited play or \"slop\" as the applied load changes.  One source of motion is gaps or \"play\" in the bearing.  For example, a 10&nbsp;mm shaft in a 12&nbsp;mm hole has 2&nbsp;mm play.\n\nAllowable play varies greatly depending on the use.  As example, a wheelbarrow wheel supports radial and axial loads.  Axial loads may be hundreds of [[newton (units)|newton]]s force left or right, and it is typically acceptable for the wheel to wobble by as much as 10&nbsp;mm under the varying load.  In contrast, a lathe may position a cutting tool to \u00b10.002&nbsp;mm using a ball lead screw held by rotating bearings.  The bearings support axial loads of thousands of newtons in either direction, and must hold the ball lead screw to \u00b10.002&nbsp;mm across that range of loads\n\n==Stiffness==\nA second source of motion is elasticity in the bearing itself. For example, the balls in a ball bearing are like stiff rubber, and under load deform from round to a slightly flattened shape.  The race is also elastic and develops a slight dent where the ball presses on it.\n\nThe stiffness of a bearing is how the distance between the parts which are separated by the bearing varies with applied load.  With rolling element bearings this is due to the strain of the ball and race.  With fluid bearings it is due to how the pressure of the fluid varies with the gap (when correctly loaded, fluid bearings are typically stiffer than rolling element bearings).\n\n==Service life==\n;Fluid and magnetic bearings\n{{Main|Fluid bearing|Magnetic bearing}}\n\nFluid and magnetic bearings can have practically indefinite service lives.  In practice, there are fluid bearings supporting high loads in hydroelectric plants that have been in nearly continuous service since about 1900 and which show no signs of wear.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n;Rolling element bearings\nRolling element bearing life is determined by load, temperature, maintenance, lubrication, material defects, contamination, handling, installation and other factors.  These factors can all have a significant effect on bearing life.  For example, the service life of bearings in one application was extended dramatically by changing how the bearings were stored before installation and use, as vibrations during storage caused lubricant failure even when the only load on the bearing was its own weight;<ref name=\"Harris2001\">{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Tedric A. |title=Rolling bearing analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt9SAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-35457-4|ref=harv}}</ref>  the resulting damage is often [[false brinelling]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316543220_Time-dependent_analyses_of_wear_in_oscillating_bearing_applications|title=Time-dependent analyses of wear in oscillating bearing applications (PDF Download Available)|last=Schwack|first=Fabian|last2=Byckov|first2=Artjom|date=|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01|last3=Bader|first3=Norbert|last4=Poll|first4=Gerhard}}</ref>  Bearing life is statistical: several samples of a given bearing will often exhibit a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] of service life, with a few samples showing significantly better or worse life.  Bearing life varies because microscopic structure and contamination vary greatly even where macroscopically they seem identical.\n\n===L10 life===\n\nBearings are often specified to give an \"L10\" life (outside the USA, it may be referred to as \"B10\" life.) This is the life at which ten percent of the bearings in that application can be expected to have failed due to classical fatigue failure (and not any other mode of failure like lubrication starvation, wrong mounting etc.), or, alternatively, the life at which ninety percent will still be operating. The L10 life of the bearing is theoretical life and may not represent service life of the bearing. Bearings are also rated using C<sub>0</sub> (static loading) value. This is the basic load rating as a reference, and not an actual load value.\n\n;Plain bearings\nFor plain bearings, some materials give much longer life than others. Some of the [[John Harrison]] clocks still operate after hundreds of years because of the ''[[lignum vitae]]'' wood employed in their construction, whereas his metal clocks are seldom run due to potential wear.\n\n;Flexure bearings\nFlexure bearings rely on elastic properties of material. Flexure bearings bend a piece of material repeatedly.  Some materials fail after repeated bending, even at low loads, but careful material selection and bearing design can make flexure bearing life indefinite.\n\n;Short-life bearings\nAlthough long bearing life is often desirable, it is sometimes not necessary. {{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=}} describes a bearing for a rocket motor oxygen pump that gave several hours life, far in excess of the several tens of minutes life needed.<ref name=\"Harris2001\"/>\n\n'''Composite bearings'''\n\nDepending on the customized specifications (backing material and PTFE compounds), [[composite bearing]]s can operate up to 30 years without maintenance.\n\n'''Oscillating bearings'''\n\nFor bearings which are used in [[Oscillation|oscillating]] applications, customized approaches to calculate L10 are used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwack|first=F.|last2=Stammler|first2=M.|last3=Poll|first3=G.|last4=Reuter|first4=A.|date=2016|title=Comparison of Life Calculations for Oscillating Bearings Considering Individual Pitch Control in Wind Turbines|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/753/i=11/a=112013|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|language=en|volume=753|issue=11|pages=112013|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/753/11/112013|issn=1742-6596|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===External factors===\nThe service life of the bearing is affected by many parameters that are not controlled by the bearing manufacturers. For example, bearing mounting, temperature, exposure to external environment, lubricant cleanliness and [[shaft voltage|electrical currents through bearings]] etc. High frequency [[inverter drive|PWM inverter]]s can induce currents in a bearing, which can be suppressed by use of [[ferrite choke]]s.\n\nThe temperature and terrain of the micro-surface will determine the amount of friction by the touching of solid parts.\n\nCertain elements and fields reduce friction, while increasing speeds.\n\nStrength and mobility help determine the amount of load the bearing type can carry.\n\nAlignment factors can play a damaging role in wear and tear, yet overcome by computer aid signaling and non-rubbing bearing types, such as magnetic levitation or air field pressure.\n\n==Maintenance and lubrication==\nMany bearings require periodic maintenance to prevent premature failure, but many others require little maintenance. The latter include various kinds of polymer, fluid and magnetic bearings, as well as rolling-element bearings that are described with terms including ''sealed bearing'' and ''sealed for life''. These contain [[seal (mechanical)|seals]] to keep the dirt out and the grease in. They work successfully in many applications, providing maintenance-free operation. Some applications cannot use them effectively.\n\nNonsealed bearings often have a [[grease fitting]], for periodic lubrication with a [[grease gun (tool)|grease gun]], or an oil cup for periodic filling with oil. Before the 1970s, sealed bearings were not encountered on most machinery, and oiling and greasing were a more common activity than they are today. For example, automotive chassis used to require \"lube jobs\" nearly as often as engine oil changes, but today's car chassis are mostly sealed for life. From the late 1700s through mid 1900s, industry relied on many workers called [[oiler (occupation)|oilers]] to lubricate machinery frequently with [[oil can]]s.\n\nFactory machines today usually have ''lube systems'', in which a central pump serves periodic charges of oil or grease from a reservoir through ''lube lines'' to the various ''lube points'' in the machine's [[bearing surface]]s, bearing journals, [[pillow block bearing|pillow blocks]], and so on. The timing and number of such ''lube cycles'' is controlled by the machine's computerized control, such as [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] or [[numerical control|CNC]], as well as by manual override functions when occasionally needed. This automated process is how all modern CNC [[machine tool]]s and many other modern factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a [[hand pump]] that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called ''one-shot systems'' from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.\n\nThe oiling system inside a modern automotive or truck engine is similar in concept to the lube systems mentioned above, except that oil is pumped continuously. Much of this oil flows through passages drilled or cast into the [[engine block]] and [[cylinder head]]s, escaping through ports directly onto bearings, and squirting elsewhere to provide an oil bath. The oil pump simply pumps constantly, and any excess pumped oil continuously escapes through a relief valve back into the sump.\n\nMany bearings in high-cycle industrial operations need periodic lubrication and cleaning, and many require occasional adjustment, such as pre-load adjustment, to minimise the effects of wear.\n\nBearing life is often much better when the bearing is kept clean and well lubricated.  However, many applications make good maintenance difficult. For example, bearings in the conveyor of a [[crusher|rock crusher]] are exposed continually to hard abrasive particles.  Cleaning is of little use, because cleaning is expensive yet the bearing is contaminated again as soon as the conveyor resumes operation.  Thus, a good maintenance program might lubricate the bearings frequently but not include any disassembly for cleaning. The frequent lubrication, by its nature, provides a limited kind of cleaning action, by displacing older (grit-filled) oil or grease with a fresh charge, which itself collects grit before being displaced by the next cycle.\n\n===Rolling-element bearing outer race fault detection===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nRolling-element bearings are widely used in the industries today, and hence [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element bearings wear out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the outer race, inner race and ball. It is also the most vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and high running speed conditions. Regular [[diagnostics]] of rolling-element bearing faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time. Among the outer race, inner race and ball, the outer race tends to be more vulnerable to faults and defects.\n\nThere is still room for discussion as to whether the rolling element excites the [[natural frequencies]] of bearing component when it passes the [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] on the outer race. Hence we need to identify the bearing outer race natural frequency and its [[harmonics]]. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a [[FFT]] analysis. The [[natural frequencies]] of a rolling element bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3&nbsp;kHz. Therefore, in order to use the bearing component [[resonance]] bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range [[accelerometer]] should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired.  A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the outer race. The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a bearing outer race fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults [[waveform]], [[spectrum]] and [[envelope]] techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency [[demodulation]] is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect bearing fault characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of [[resonance]], as it may or may not contain fault frequency components.\n\nUsing spectral analysis as a tool to identify the faults in the bearings faces challenges due to issues like low energy, signal smearing, [[cyclostationarity]] etc. High resolution is often desired to differentiate the fault frequency components from the other high-amplitude adjacent frequencies. Hence, when the signal is sampled for [[FFT]] analysis, the sample length should be large enough to give adequate frequency resolution in the spectrum. Also, keeping the computation time and memory within limits and avoiding unwanted [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] may be demanding. However, a minimal frequency resolution required can be obtained by estimating the bearing fault frequencies and other vibration frequency components and its harmonics due to shaft speed, misalignment, line frequency, gearbox etc.\n\n===Packing===\nSome bearings use a thick [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] for lubrication, which is pushed into the gaps between the bearing surfaces, also known as ''packing''. The grease is held in place by a plastic, leather, or rubber gasket (also called a ''gland'') that covers the inside and outside edges of the bearing race to keep the grease from escaping.\n\nBearings may also be packed with other materials. Historically, the wheels on railroad cars used sleeve bearings packed with ''waste'' or loose scraps of cotton or wool fiber soaked in oil, then later used solid pads of cotton.<ref>{{White-Passenger-1985|volume=2|page=518}}</ref>\n\n===Ring oiler===\n{{details|Ring oiler}}\nBearings can be lubricated by a metal ring that rides loosely on the central rotating shaft of the bearing. The ring hangs down into a chamber containing lubricating oil. As the bearing rotates, viscous adhesion draws oil up the ring and onto the shaft, where the oil migrates into the bearing to lubricate it. Excess oil is flung off and collects in the pool again.<ref>{{cite book|title=Steam Power Plant Engineering|first= George Frederick |last=Gebhardt| publisher= J. Wiley |date= 1917|p= [https://archive.org/details/steampowerplant02gebhgoog/page/n813 791] |url=https://archive.org/details/steampowerplant02gebhgoog}}</ref>\n\n===Splash lubrication===\nSome machines contain a pool of lubricant in the bottom, with gears partially immersed in the liquid, or crank rods that can swing down into the pool as the device operates. The spinning wheels fling oil into the air around them, while the crank rods slap at the surface of the oil, splashing it randomly on the interior surfaces of the engine. Some small internal combustion engines specifically contain special plastic ''flinger wheels'' which randomly scatter oil around the interior of the mechanism.<ref>{{cite book|title=The gasoline automobile|first1= George William |last1=Hobbs |first2= Ben George |last2=Elliott|first3= Earl Lester |last3=Consoliver|publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1919 |pp= [https://archive.org/details/gasolineautomob00divigoog/page/n137 111]\u2013114 |url=https://archive.org/details/gasolineautomob00divigoog}}</ref>\n\n===Pressure lubrication===\nFor high speed and high power machines, a loss of lubricant can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction. In these applications, a fresh supply of lubricant can be continuously supplied to the bearing and all other contact surfaces, and the excess can be collected for filtration, cooling, and possibly reuse. Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex [[internal combustion engines]] in parts of the engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pressure Lubricating Characteristics|first1= Paul |last1=Dumas|journal=Motor age|volume= 42|publisher= Class Journal Co.|date= 14 Sep 1922 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0AfAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA10-PA22&dq=engine+pressure+oiling&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hZlzT-P5L6bt0gGhstH_Ag&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=engine%20pressure%20oiling&f=false }}</ref> High speed turbochargers also typically require a pressurized oil system to cool the bearings and keep them from burning up due to the heat from the turbine.\n\n===Composite bearings===\nComposite bearings are designed with a self-lubricating polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) liner with a laminated metal backing. The PTFE liner offers consistent, controlled friction as well as durability whilst the metal backing ensures the composite bearing is robust and capable of withstanding high loads and stresses throughout its long life. Its design also makes it lightweight-one tenth the weight of a traditional rolling element bearing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gobain|first1=Saint|title=Saint-Gobain and Norco Get Celebrity Thumbs-Up|url=http://www.pddnet.com/news/2012/06/saint-gobain-and-norco-get-celebrity-thumbs?terms=saint-gobain|accessdate=9 June 2016|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are many different types of bearings.

The design of the bearing may, for example, provide for free [[line (geometry)|linear]] movement of the moving part or for free [[rotation around a fixed axis]]; or, it may ''prevent'' a motion by controlling the [[vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]]s of [[normal force]]s that bear on the moving parts.  Most bearings facilitate the desired motion by minimizing friction. Bearings are classified broadly according to the type of operation, the motions allowed, or to the directions of the loads (forces) applied to the parts.\n\nRotary bearings hold rotating components such as [[shaft (mechanical engineering)|shaft]]s or [[axle]]s within mechanical systems, and transfer axial and radial loads from the source of the load to the structure supporting it.  The simplest form of bearing, the ''[[plain bearing]]'', consists of a shaft rotating in a hole.  [[Lubrication]] is used to reduce friction.  In the ''[[ball bearing]]'' and ''[[roller bearing]]'', to reduce sliding friction, rolling elements such as rollers or balls with a circular cross-section are located between the races or journals of the bearing assembly. A wide variety of bearing designs exists to allow the demands of the application to be correctly met for maximum efficiency, reliability, durability and performance.\n \nThe term \"bearing\" is derived from the verb \"[[wikt:bear#Verb|to bear]]\";<ref name=\"MWCD_online-headword_bearing\">{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=headwords \"bearing\" and \"bear\" |work=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary, online subscription version |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate.htm |postscript=.

The captured, or caged, [[ball bearing]] was originally described by [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] in the 17th century.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}}\n\nThe first practical caged-roller bearing was invented in the mid-1740s by [[horology|horologist]] [[John Harrison]] for his H3 marine timekeeper. This uses the bearing for a very limited oscillating motion but Harrison also used a similar bearing in a truly rotary application in a contemporaneous regulator clock.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===Industrial era===\nThe first modern recorded [[patent]] on ball bearings was awarded to [[Philip Vaughan]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] inventor and [[ironmaster]] who created the first design for a ball bearing in [[Carmarthen]] in 1794. His was the first modern ball-bearing design, with the ball running along a groove in the axle assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.intechbearing.com/5200Series-DoubleRowAngularContactBallBearings-SealsandShields-Shop.html|title=Double- Row Angular Contact Ball Bearings|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511155609/http://www.intechbearing.com/5200Series-DoubleRowAngularContactBallBearings-SealsandShields-Shop.html|archivedate=11 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBearings have played a pivotal role in the nascent [[Industrial Revolution]], allowing the new industrial machinery to operate efficiently. For example, they saw use for holding [[wheel and axle]] to greatly reduce friction over that of dragging an object by making the friction act over a shorter distance as the wheel turned.\n\nThe first plain and rolling-element bearings were [[wood]] closely followed by [[bronze]]. Over their history bearings have been made of many materials including [[ceramic]], [[sapphire]], [[glass]], [[steel]], [[bronze]], other metals and plastic (e.g., [[nylon]], [[polyoxymethylene]], [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], and [[UHMWPE]]) which are all used today.\n\nWatch makers produce \"jeweled\" watches using sapphire plain bearings to reduce friction thus allowing more precise time keeping.\n\nEven basic materials can have good durability. As examples, wooden bearings can still be seen today in old clocks or in water mills where the water provides cooling and lubrication.\n\n[[Image:Early Timken roller bearing.jpg|thumb|Early [[Timken Roller Bearing Company|Timken]] [[tapered roller bearing]] with notched rollers]]\nThe first [[patent]] for a radial style [[ball bearing]] was awarded to [[Jules Suriray]], a Parisian bicycle mechanic, on 3 August 1869.

Examples include ultra high speed bearings in dental drills, [[aerospace bearings]] in the Mars Rover, gearbox and wheel bearings on automobiles, flexure bearings in optical alignment systems, bicycle wheel hubs, and [[air bearings]] used in [[Coordinate-measuring machine]]s.\n\n==Common==\nBy far, the most common bearing is the [[plain bearing]], a bearing which uses surfaces in rubbing contact, often with a [[lubricant]] such as oil or graphite. A plain bearing may or may not be a [[wikt:discrete#Adjective|discrete]] device. It may be nothing more than the [[bearing surface]] of a hole with a shaft passing through it, or of a planar surface that [[wikt:bear#Verb|bears]] another (in these cases, not a discrete device); or it may be a layer of [[Babbitt (metal)|bearing metal]] either fused to the substrate (semi-discrete) or in the form of a separable sleeve (discrete). With suitable lubrication, plain bearings often give entirely acceptable accuracy, life, and friction at minimal cost. Therefore, they are very widely used.\n\nHowever, there are many applications where a more suitable bearing can improve efficiency, accuracy, service intervals, reliability, speed of operation, size, weight, and costs of purchasing and operating machinery.\n\nThus, there are many types of bearings, with varying shape, material, lubrication, principle of operation, and so on.\n\n==Types==\n[[Image:BallBearing.gif|thumb|Animation of ball bearing (Ideal figure without a cage). The inner ring rotates and the outer ring is stationary.]]\n\nThere are at least 6 common types of bearing, each of which operates on different principles:\n*[[Plain bearing]], consisting of a shaft rotating in a hole. There are several specific styles: bushing, [[journal bearing]], sleeve bearing, rifle bearing, [[composite bearing]];\n*[[Rolling-element bearing]], in which rolling elements placed between the turning and stationary races prevent sliding friction.  There are two main types:\n**[[Ball bearing]], in which the rolling elements are spherical balls;\n**[[Roller bearing]], in which the rolling elements are cylindrical, taper or spherical rollers;\n*[[Jewel bearing]], a plain bearing in which one of the bearing surfaces is made of an ultrahard glassy jewel material such as [[sapphire]] to reduce friction and wear;\n*[[Fluid bearing]], a noncontact bearing in which the load is supported by a gas or liquid (i.e. [[air bearing]]);\n*[[Magnetic bearing]], in which the load is supported by a [[magnetic field]];\n*[[Flexure bearing]], in which the motion is supported by a load element which bends.\n\n==Motions==\nCommon motions permitted by bearings are:\n\n*Radial rotation e.g. shaft rotation;\n*linear motion e.g. drawer;\n*spherical rotation e.g. ball and socket joint;\n*hinge motion e.g. door, elbow, knee.\n\n==Friction==\nReducing friction in bearings is often important for efficiency, to reduce wear and to facilitate extended use at high speeds and to avoid overheating and premature failure of the bearing. Essentially, a bearing can reduce friction by virtue of its shape, by its material, or by introducing and containing a fluid between surfaces or by separating the surfaces with an electromagnetic field.\n\n*'''By shape''', gains advantage usually by using spheres or [[Roller bearing|rollers]], or by forming flexure bearings.\n*'''By material''', exploits the nature of the bearing material used. (An example would be using plastics that have low surface friction.)\n*'''By fluid''', exploits the low viscosity of a layer of fluid, such as a lubricant or as a pressurized medium to keep the two solid parts from touching, or by reducing the normal force between them.\n*'''By fields''', exploits electromagnetic fields, such as magnetic fields, to keep solid parts from touching.\n*'''Air pressure''' exploits air pressure to keep solid parts from touching.\n\nCombinations of these can even be employed within the same bearing. An example of this is where the cage is made of plastic, and it separates the rollers/balls, which reduce friction by their shape and finish.\n\n==Loads==\n\nBearing design varies depending on the size and directions of the forces that they are required to support.  Forces can be predominately [[radius|radial]], [[axis of rotation|axial]] ([[thrust bearing]]s), or [[bending moment]]s perpendicular to the main axis.\n\n==Speeds==\nDifferent bearing types have different operating speed limits.  Speed is typically specified as maximum relative surface speeds, often specified ft/s or m/s.  Rotational bearings typically describe performance in terms of the product ''DN'' where ''D'' is the mean diameter (often in mm) of the bearing and ''N'' is the rotation rate in revolutions per minute.\n\nGenerally there is considerable speed range overlap between bearing types.  Plain bearings typically handle only lower speeds, rolling element bearings are faster, followed by fluid bearings and finally magnetic bearings which are limited ultimately by centripetal force overcoming material strength.\n\n==Play==\nSome applications apply bearing loads from varying directions and accept only limited play or \"slop\" as the applied load changes.  One source of motion is gaps or \"play\" in the bearing.  For example, a 10&nbsp;mm shaft in a 12&nbsp;mm hole has 2&nbsp;mm play.\n\nAllowable play varies greatly depending on the use.  As example, a wheelbarrow wheel supports radial and axial loads.  Axial loads may be hundreds of [[newton (units)|newton]]s force left or right, and it is typically acceptable for the wheel to wobble by as much as 10&nbsp;mm under the varying load.  In contrast, a lathe may position a cutting tool to \u00b10.002&nbsp;mm using a ball lead screw held by rotating bearings.  The bearings support axial loads of thousands of newtons in either direction, and must hold the ball lead screw to \u00b10.002&nbsp;mm across that range of loads\n\n==Stiffness==\nA second source of motion is elasticity in the bearing itself. For example, the balls in a ball bearing are like stiff rubber, and under load deform from round to a slightly flattened shape.  The race is also elastic and develops a slight dent where the ball presses on it.\n\nThe stiffness of a bearing is how the distance between the parts which are separated by the bearing varies with applied load.  With rolling element bearings this is due to the strain of the ball and race.  With fluid bearings it is due to how the pressure of the fluid varies with the gap (when correctly loaded, fluid bearings are typically stiffer than rolling element bearings).\n\n==Service life==\n;Fluid and magnetic bearings\n{{Main|Fluid bearing|Magnetic bearing}}\n\nFluid and magnetic bearings can have practically indefinite service lives.  In practice, there are fluid bearings supporting high loads in hydroelectric plants that have been in nearly continuous service since about 1900 and which show no signs of wear.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n;Rolling element bearings\nRolling element bearing life is determined by load, temperature, maintenance, lubrication, material defects, contamination, handling, installation and other factors.  These factors can all have a significant effect on bearing life.  For example, the service life of bearings in one application was extended dramatically by changing how the bearings were stored before installation and use, as vibrations during storage caused lubricant failure even when the only load on the bearing was its own weight;<ref name=\"Harris2001\">{{cite book|last=Harris|first=Tedric A. |title=Rolling bearing analysis|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pt9SAAAAMAAJ|year=2001|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0-471-35457-4|ref=harv}}</ref>  the resulting damage is often [[false brinelling]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/316543220_Time-dependent_analyses_of_wear_in_oscillating_bearing_applications|title=Time-dependent analyses of wear in oscillating bearing applications (PDF Download Available)|last=Schwack|first=Fabian|last2=Byckov|first2=Artjom|date=|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-08-01|last3=Bader|first3=Norbert|last4=Poll|first4=Gerhard}}</ref>  Bearing life is statistical: several samples of a given bearing will often exhibit a [[Normal distribution|bell curve]] of service life, with a few samples showing significantly better or worse life.  Bearing life varies because microscopic structure and contamination vary greatly even where macroscopically they seem identical.\n\n===L10 life===\n\nBearings are often specified to give an \"L10\" life (outside the USA, it may be referred to as \"B10\" life.) This is the life at which ten percent of the bearings in that application can be expected to have failed due to classical fatigue failure (and not any other mode of failure like lubrication starvation, wrong mounting etc.), or, alternatively, the life at which ninety percent will still be operating. The L10 life of the bearing is theoretical life and may not represent service life of the bearing. Bearings are also rated using C<sub>0</sub> (static loading) value. This is the basic load rating as a reference, and not an actual load value.\n\n;Plain bearings\nFor plain bearings, some materials give much longer life than others. Some of the [[John Harrison]] clocks still operate after hundreds of years because of the ''[[lignum vitae]]'' wood employed in their construction, whereas his metal clocks are seldom run due to potential wear.\n\n;Flexure bearings\nFlexure bearings rely on elastic properties of material. Flexure bearings bend a piece of material repeatedly.  Some materials fail after repeated bending, even at low loads, but careful material selection and bearing design can make flexure bearing life indefinite.\n\n;Short-life bearings\nAlthough long bearing life is often desirable, it is sometimes not necessary. {{harvnb|Harris|2001|p=}} describes a bearing for a rocket motor oxygen pump that gave several hours life, far in excess of the several tens of minutes life needed.<ref name=\"Harris2001\"/>\n\n'''Composite bearings'''\n\nDepending on the customized specifications (backing material and PTFE compounds), [[composite bearing]]s can operate up to 30 years without maintenance.\n\n'''Oscillating bearings'''\n\nFor bearings which are used in [[Oscillation|oscillating]] applications, customized approaches to calculate L10 are used.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schwack|first=F.|last2=Stammler|first2=M.|last3=Poll|first3=G.|last4=Reuter|first4=A.|date=2016|title=Comparison of Life Calculations for Oscillating Bearings Considering Individual Pitch Control in Wind Turbines|url=http://stacks.iop.org/1742-6596/753/i=11/a=112013|journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series|language=en|volume=753|issue=11|pages=112013|doi=10.1088/1742-6596/753/11/112013|issn=1742-6596|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n===External factors===\nThe service life of the bearing is affected by many parameters that are not controlled by the bearing manufacturers. For example, bearing mounting, temperature, exposure to external environment, lubricant cleanliness and [[shaft voltage|electrical currents through bearings]] etc. High frequency [[inverter drive|PWM inverter]]s can induce currents in a bearing, which can be suppressed by use of [[ferrite choke]]s.\n\nThe temperature and terrain of the micro-surface will determine the amount of friction by the touching of solid parts.\n\nCertain elements and fields reduce friction, while increasing speeds.\n\nStrength and mobility help determine the amount of load the bearing type can carry.\n\nAlignment factors can play a damaging role in wear and tear, yet overcome by computer aid signaling and non-rubbing bearing types, such as magnetic levitation or air field pressure.\n\n==Maintenance and lubrication==\nMany bearings require periodic maintenance to prevent premature failure, but many others require little maintenance. The latter include various kinds of polymer, fluid and magnetic bearings, as well as rolling-element bearings that are described with terms including ''sealed bearing'' and ''sealed for life''. These contain [[seal (mechanical)|seals]] to keep the dirt out and the grease in. They work successfully in many applications, providing maintenance-free operation. Some applications cannot use them effectively.\n\nNonsealed bearings often have a [[grease fitting]], for periodic lubrication with a [[grease gun (tool)|grease gun]], or an oil cup for periodic filling with oil. Before the 1970s, sealed bearings were not encountered on most machinery, and oiling and greasing were a more common activity than they are today. For example, automotive chassis used to require \"lube jobs\" nearly as often as engine oil changes, but today's car chassis are mostly sealed for life. From the late 1700s through mid 1900s, industry relied on many workers called [[oiler (occupation)|oilers]] to lubricate machinery frequently with [[oil can]]s.\n\nFactory machines today usually have ''lube systems'', in which a central pump serves periodic charges of oil or grease from a reservoir through ''lube lines'' to the various ''lube points'' in the machine's [[bearing surface]]s, bearing journals, [[pillow block bearing|pillow blocks]], and so on. The timing and number of such ''lube cycles'' is controlled by the machine's computerized control, such as [[programmable logic controller|PLC]] or [[numerical control|CNC]], as well as by manual override functions when occasionally needed. This automated process is how all modern CNC [[machine tool]]s and many other modern factory machines are lubricated. Similar lube systems are also used on nonautomated machines, in which case there is a [[hand pump]] that a machine operator is supposed to pump once daily (for machines in constant use) or once weekly. These are called ''one-shot systems'' from their chief selling point: one pull on one handle to lube the whole machine, instead of a dozen pumps of an alemite gun or oil can in a dozen different positions around the machine.\n\nThe oiling system inside a modern automotive or truck engine is similar in concept to the lube systems mentioned above, except that oil is pumped continuously. Much of this oil flows through passages drilled or cast into the [[engine block]] and [[cylinder head]]s, escaping through ports directly onto bearings, and squirting elsewhere to provide an oil bath. The oil pump simply pumps constantly, and any excess pumped oil continuously escapes through a relief valve back into the sump.\n\nMany bearings in high-cycle industrial operations need periodic lubrication and cleaning, and many require occasional adjustment, such as pre-load adjustment, to minimise the effects of wear.\n\nBearing life is often much better when the bearing is kept clean and well lubricated.  However, many applications make good maintenance difficult. For example, bearings in the conveyor of a [[crusher|rock crusher]] are exposed continually to hard abrasive particles.  Cleaning is of little use, because cleaning is expensive yet the bearing is contaminated again as soon as the conveyor resumes operation.  Thus, a good maintenance program might lubricate the bearings frequently but not include any disassembly for cleaning. The frequent lubrication, by its nature, provides a limited kind of cleaning action, by displacing older (grit-filled) oil or grease with a fresh charge, which itself collects grit before being displaced by the next cycle.\n\n===Rolling-element bearing outer race fault detection===\n{{unreferenced section|date=May 2015}}\nRolling-element bearings are widely used in the industries today, and hence [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] of these bearings becomes an important task for the maintenance professionals. The rolling-element bearings wear out easily due to metal-to-metal contact, which creates faults in the outer race, inner race and ball. It is also the most vulnerable component of a machine because it is often under high load and high running speed conditions. Regular [[diagnostics]] of rolling-element bearing faults is critical for industrial safety and operations of the machines along with reducing the maintenance costs or avoiding shutdown time. Among the outer race, inner race and ball, the outer race tends to be more vulnerable to faults and defects.\n\nThere is still room for discussion as to whether the rolling element excites the [[natural frequencies]] of bearing component when it passes the [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] on the outer race. Hence we need to identify the bearing outer race natural frequency and its [[harmonics]]. The bearing faults create impulses and results in strong harmonics of the fault frequencies in the spectrum of vibration signals. These fault frequencies are sometimes masked by adjacent frequencies in the spectra due to their little energy. Hence, a very high spectral resolution is often needed to identify these frequencies during a [[FFT]] analysis. The [[natural frequencies]] of a rolling element bearing with the free boundary conditions are 3&nbsp;kHz. Therefore, in order to use the bearing component [[resonance]] bandwidth method to detect the bearing fault at an initial stage a high frequency range [[accelerometer]] should be adopted, and data obtained from a long duration needs to be acquired.  A fault characteristic frequency can only be identified when the fault extent is severe, such as that of a presence of a hole in the outer race. The harmonics of fault frequency is a more sensitive indicator of a bearing outer race fault. For a more serious detection of defected bearing faults [[waveform]], [[spectrum]] and [[envelope]] techniques will help reveal these faults. However, if a high frequency [[demodulation]] is used in the envelope analysis in order to detect bearing fault characteristic frequencies, the maintenance professionals have to be more careful in the analysis because of [[resonance]], as it may or may not contain fault frequency components.\n\nUsing spectral analysis as a tool to identify the faults in the bearings faces challenges due to issues like low energy, signal smearing, [[cyclostationarity]] etc. High resolution is often desired to differentiate the fault frequency components from the other high-amplitude adjacent frequencies. Hence, when the signal is sampled for [[FFT]] analysis, the sample length should be large enough to give adequate frequency resolution in the spectrum. Also, keeping the computation time and memory within limits and avoiding unwanted [[Aliasing (computing)|aliasing]] may be demanding. However, a minimal frequency resolution required can be obtained by estimating the bearing fault frequencies and other vibration frequency components and its harmonics due to shaft speed, misalignment, line frequency, gearbox etc.\n\n===Packing===\nSome bearings use a thick [[Grease (lubricant)|grease]] for lubrication, which is pushed into the gaps between the bearing surfaces, also known as ''packing''. The grease is held in place by a plastic, leather, or rubber gasket (also called a ''gland'') that covers the inside and outside edges of the bearing race to keep the grease from escaping.\n\nBearings may also be packed with other materials. Historically, the wheels on railroad cars used sleeve bearings packed with ''waste'' or loose scraps of cotton or wool fiber soaked in oil, then later used solid pads of cotton.<ref>{{White-Passenger-1985|volume=2|page=518}}</ref>\n\n===Ring oiler===\n{{details|Ring oiler}}\nBearings can be lubricated by a metal ring that rides loosely on the central rotating shaft of the bearing. The ring hangs down into a chamber containing lubricating oil. As the bearing rotates, viscous adhesion draws oil up the ring and onto the shaft, where the oil migrates into the bearing to lubricate it. Excess oil is flung off and collects in the pool again.<ref>{{cite book|title=Steam Power Plant Engineering|first= George Frederick |last=Gebhardt| publisher= J.

The spinning wheels fling oil into the air around them, while the crank rods slap at the surface of the oil, splashing it randomly on the interior surfaces of the engine. Some small internal combustion engines specifically contain special plastic ''flinger wheels'' which randomly scatter oil around the interior of the mechanism.<ref>{{cite book|title=The gasoline automobile|first1= George William |last1=Hobbs |first2= Ben George |last2=Elliott|first3= Earl Lester |last3=Consoliver|publisher=McGraw-Hill |date=1919 |pp= [https://archive.org/details/gasolineautomob00divigoog/page/n137 111]\u2013114 |url=https://archive.org/details/gasolineautomob00divigoog}}</ref>\n\n===Pressure lubrication===\nFor high speed and high power machines, a loss of lubricant can result in rapid bearing heating and damage due to friction. Also in dirty environments the oil can become contaminated with dust or debris that increases friction. In these applications, a fresh supply of lubricant can be continuously supplied to the bearing and all other contact surfaces, and the excess can be collected for filtration, cooling, and possibly reuse. Pressure oiling is commonly used in large and complex [[internal combustion engines]] in parts of the engine where directly splashed oil cannot reach, such as up into overhead valve assemblies.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Pressure Lubricating Characteristics|first1= Paul |last1=Dumas|journal=Motor age|volume= 42|publisher= Class Journal Co.|date= 14 Sep 1922 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0AfAQAAMAAJ&pg=RA10-PA22&dq=engine+pressure+oiling&hl=en&sa=X&ei=hZlzT-P5L6bt0gGhstH_Ag&ved=0CEUQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=engine%20pressure%20oiling&f=false }}</ref> High speed turbochargers also typically require a pressurized oil system to cool the bearings and keep them from burning up due to the heat from the turbine.\n\n===Composite bearings===\nComposite bearings are designed with a self-lubricating polytetrafluroethylene (PTFE) liner with a laminated metal backing. The PTFE liner offers consistent, controlled friction as well as durability whilst the metal backing ensures the composite bearing is robust and capable of withstanding high loads and stresses throughout its long life. Its design also makes it lightweight-one tenth the weight of a traditional rolling element bearing.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gobain|first1=Saint|title=Saint-Gobain and Norco Get Celebrity Thumbs-Up|url=http://www.pddnet.com/news/2012/06/saint-gobain-and-norco-get-celebrity-thumbs?terms=saint-gobain|accessdate=9 June 2016|date=1 June 2012}}</ref>\n\n==Types==\nThere are many different types of bearings.

They were strongly influenced by the [[Celtici]]. Those [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European tribes]], [[Celts|Celtic]] or pre-Celtic, founded the city of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] (then called [[Lacobriga|Lac\u00f3briga]]). The Cynetes, also known as Conii were further influenced by the neighbouring [[Tartessos]]. [[Phoenicia]]ns had established semi-permanent trading posts along the coast c. 1000 BC. Some sources claim that the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] founded Portus Hanibalis \u2013 known today as [[Portim\u00e3o]] \u2013 c. 550 BC.\n\n===Roman period===\nThe Algarve region came under Roman control after [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus (consul 142 BC)|Fabius Maximus Servilianus]] defeated the [[Lusitanians]] and the [[Turduli]] in the context of the [[Lusitanian War]], as was the case of much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which was absorbed into the [[Roman Republic]] in the second century BC. Cyneticum (in reference to the Cynetes who inhabited the region), as it was then called, became integrated into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and into [[Lusitania]] afterwards, being under Roman influence for around 600 years (from 200 BC till 410 AD), having thus adopted [[Latin]] as the official language, as well as Roman cultural, political, architectonic, religious and economic tenets. \n\nSeeing that during this time traveling through the land was dangerous, its geography meant that Cyneticum was of crucial importance as a passageway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, connecting countless Roman ports to several provinces, mainly in other parts of [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. This meant that the region experienced a great level of prosperity accrued through an expansion of its trading and commercial capabilities, mainly from the production and commercialization of olive oil and [[garum]], products very much sought after throughout the Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Viegas |first1=Catarina |title=A Ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o Romana do Algarve |date=2011 |publisher=CENTRO DE ARQUEOLOGIA DA UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA |isbn=978-989-95653-4-0 |page=39 |url=https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/9775/1/CViegas-2011.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> As [[Christianity]] rose in popularity, becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire under [[Constantine the Great]], Cyneticum, following the same tendency of the rest of the Roman provinces, made the transition from a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] society into a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] one. The region made a gradual changeover into Christianity, as Pagan and [[Animism|Animistic]] religions became obsolete under this new cultural influence. Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]], himself a native of the Iberian Peninsula, would come to prohibit Paganism in 381. The [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Roman Temple of Milreu]], originally dedicated to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], transformed later on into a Paleochristian temple, is an example of the religious changes that took place in this period.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Neto, Jo\u00e3o; Gordalina, Ros\u00e1rio |title=Ru\u00ednas de Est\u00f3i / Ru\u00ednas de Milreu |url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2883 |website=Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Patrim\u00f3nio Cultural |publisher=SIPA |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2003}}</ref> \n\nMany Roman ruins, both in the form of temples, [[Villa rustica|countryside villas]] (of which more than 30 were found in the Algarve), public baths, bridges, salting and fish-processing facilities and mosaics are widespread all over the region, notably in [[Vila do Bispo]], [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Portim\u00e3o]], [[Roman ruins of Cerro da Vila|Quarteira]], [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Faro]], [[Olh\u00e3o]], [[Balsa (Roman town)|Tavira]] and in other areas, illustrating the strong contributions that Roman culture as a whole made to the Algarve.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finding Rome on the Atlantic: an informal guide to some of the visible remains of Rome in Southern Portugal and Southwest Spain |url=https://www.algarvehistoryassociation.com/pt/iberian-history/58-finding-rome-on-the-atlantic |website=Algarve History Association |publisher=David Johnson |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cm-faro.pt/3366/milreu-roman-ruins.aspx|title=Milreu Roman Ruins|last=CM-FARO|website=www.cm-faro.pt|access-date=2017-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Villa de Milreu, os romanos no Algarve |url=https://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/villa-de-milreu-os-romanos-no-algarve/ |website=RTP Ensina |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2015}}</ref>\n===Visigothic Kingdom and Moorish Occupation===\n[[File:Capitel_Visig\u00f3tico_de_Pedra_-_Silves_-_22.10.2019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Visigothic [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] found in [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]]]\n[[File:Cidade de Silves12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The city of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]], the first capital of the Algarve and an example of the noticeable Moorish influence in the region]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the [[Visigoths]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] originally from [[Scandinavia]] but who had spread into Eastern Europe, occupied the Iberian Peninsula around the year 500, having founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] as its capital, in 542. In 552, the Algarve was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and, in 571, [[Liuvigild]] managed to secure the region for the Visigothic Kingdom once again, which lasted until the year 711, and comprised most of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of modern France. Although already Christian as a whole, some of these Germanic peoples were still Pagan and thus brought Paganism back to the Iberian Peninsula, where it marginally co-existed with Christianity. The Visigoths reigned until the beginning of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] and, although not nearly as influential as the Romans, left some influence in the Algarve, both in words that were, after the Moorish Occupation, added to the lexicon, which are still present in modern-day [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as in local architecture. Several Visigothic [[Necropolis]] were found in the Algarve, suggesting that the presence was likely more significant than once believed.<ref>{{cite web |author1=M\u00e1rio Varela Gomes |title=A necr\u00f3pole visig\u00f3tica do Po\u00e7o dos Mouros (Silves) |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/media/uploads/revistaportuguesadearqueologia/5_2/13.pdf |publisher=Revista Portuguesa de Arqueologia.

Faro, which the Christian residents had called Santa Maria, was renamed Faraon, which means \"settlement of the knights\". Due to the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the region was called [[Gharb Al-Andalus]]: ''Gharb'' means \"the west\", while ''[[al-Andalus]]'' is the Arabic name for the Iberian Peninsula. For several years, the town of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]] was the capital of the region.\nIn the mid-13th century, during the [[Reconquista]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] took over the region in a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors. ''Al-Gharb'' became the [[Kingdom of the Algarve]], and the Moors were expelled in 1294. There were subsequent Moorish attempts to recapture the region, without success. King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] started calling himself King of Portugal and the Algarve. After 1471, with the conquest of several territories in the [[Maghreb]] \u2013 the area considered an extension of the Algarve \u2013 [[Afonso V of Portugal]] began fashioning himself \"King of Portugal and the Algarves\", referring to the European and African possessions.

Portuguese monarchs continued to use this title until the proclamation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910. Between 1595 and 1808, the Algarve was a semiautonomous area of Portugal with its own governor, as well as a separate taxation system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[File:Muralha de Lagos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Castle of Lagos|walls]] of the ancient town of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]]]]\nIn the 15th century, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] based himself near [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] and conducted various maritime expeditions which established the colonies that comprised the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Also from Lagos, [[Gil Eanes]] set sail in 1434 to become the first seafarer to round [[Cape Bojador]] in West Africa. The voyages of discovery brought Lagos fame and fortune. Trade flourished and Lagos became the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577 and remained so until the fabled [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. The earthquake damaged many areas in the Algarve and an accompanying [[tsunami]] destroyed or damaged coastal fortresses, while coastal towns and villages were heavily damaged except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]] lagoon. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For many Portuguese coastal regions, including the Algarve, the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake itself.\n\nIn 1807, while [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] led the first [[Napoleon]]ic invasion in the north of Portugal, the Algarve was occupied by Spanish troops under [[Manuel Godoy]]. Beginning in 1808, and after subsequent battles in various towns and villages, the region was the first to drive out the Spanish occupiers. During the [[Portuguese Civil War]], several battles took place in the region, especially the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|battle of Cape St. Vicente]] and the battle of Sant\u2019Ana, between liberals and Miguelites. [[Remexido]] was the guerrilla Algarvian leader who stood with the Miguelite absolutists for years, until he was executed in Faro in 1838.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.algarveprimeiro.com/d/remexido/200-33|title=Remexido|work=Algarve Primeiro|access-date=2017-02-27|language=pt-PT}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910 marked the end of the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve. The Algarve is a somewhat exotic region for the Portuguese, due to the Mediterranean climate, unique foods, architecture, and geographical location- many Portuguese traditionally spend their Summer break or own a holiday home in the Algarve.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|Pano_Sendeanlage_auf_dem_Foia_Algarve.jpg|1500px|A panoramic view from the highest point F\u00f3ia of the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]}}\nThe Algarve covers 4997&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=dgt/> extending just south of the Tagus valley to the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, joining Spain. Its highest point is [[F\u00f3ia (mountain)|F\u00f3ia]], {{convert|902|m|ft|abbr=on}}, in the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]. It also includes some islands and islets. The region is also the home of the [[Ria Formosa Lagoon]], a [[nature reserve]] of over 170&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a stopping place for hundreds of different species of birds. The length of the south-facing coastline is roughly 155&nbsp;km. Beyond the westernmost point of [[Cape St. Vincent]] it stretches a further 50&nbsp;km to the north. The coastline is notable for picturesque [[limestone]] caves and grottoes, particularly around Lagos, which are accessible by [[powerboat]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe maximum recorded temperatures in the Algarve fluctuate between {{convert|25|C|F}} in winter and over 40 C in summer, with the temperature rarely falling below freezing in the winter. The winter of 2008\u201309 was exceptionally cold and wet, with below-freezing temperatures (sub-{{convert|0|C|0|abbr=on}}) recorded in coastal areas for the first time in many years.\n\nGenerally, winter sees only subtle differences in daily maxima along the coastal Algarve, Tavira in the Eastern Algarve may see {{convert|16|-|17|C|F}}, Faro and Quarteira in the central Algarve broadly similar values, whist Sagres and the peninsula in the extreme west experiences more frontal activity off storms in the Atlantic and generally {{convert|15|C|F}} is the maximum daytime temperature. Conversely, overnight lows are higher in Sagres, at {{convert|9|C|F}}, whilst to the East {{convert|7|-|8|C|F}} is more common.\n\nSummer sees the highest average coastal temperatures in Faro and most points east, maxima around {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}}, whilst points west of Faro to about Lagos are in the range {{convert|27|-|29|C|F}}. The peninsula and Sagres see the coolest of the summer temperatures, being prone to the cooler North Westerly winds that topple round the Azores high so here we see {{convert|24|-|26|C|F}} more typically. Overnight lows are in the region of {{convert|17|-|19|C|F}} the higher values in Faro and to the east. \n\nYear to year, there can be considerable differences in the sea surface temperatures off the Algarve during the summer/early Autumn. In recent years, the sea temperatures have struggled to exceed {{convert|18|-|19|C|F}} till later in August, then weather conditions have encouraged a warm outflow from the Mediterranean, temporarily bathing the Algarve in warm surface water and sea temperatures can rise, very rapidly over a week or so, to {{convert|25|C|F}} and only slowly drop away during October. This warm plume of water can add some noticeable humidity to an otherwise very comfortable summer feel, temperature-wise. \n\nInland Algarve sees higher daytime temperatures than the coast, typically {{convert|31|-|33|C|F}} whilst overnight temperatures drop away to {{convert|16|-|18|C|F}}. Heatwaves can occasionally push the mercury to {{convert|45|C|F}} and at this intensity, overnight lows can remain uncomfortably high at over {{convert|25|C|F}}.\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Faro\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 21.9\n|Feb record high C = 24.7\n|Mar record high C = 28.9\n|Apr record high C = 30.1\n|May record high C = 33.6\n|Jun record high C = 37.1\n|Jul record high C = 44.3\n|Aug record high C = 39.6\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 33.3\n|Nov record high C = 28.6\n|Dec record high C = 24.0\n|year record high C = 44.3\n|Jan high C = 16.1\n|Feb high C = 16.9\n|Mar high C = 19.1\n|Apr high C = 20.4\n|May high C = 22.8\n|Jun high C = 26.4\n|Jul high C = 29.2\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.6\n|Oct high C = 23.2\n|Nov high C = 19.6\n|Dec high C = 17.0\n|year high C = 22.2\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.8\n|Mar mean C = 14.8\n|Apr mean C = 16.1\n|May mean C = 18.4\n|Jun mean C = 21.9\n|Jul mean C = 24.2\n|Aug mean C = 24.1\n|Sep mean C = 22.3\n|Oct mean C = 19.3\n|Nov mean C = 15.7\n|Dec mean C = 13.3\n|year mean C = 17.9\n|Jan low C = 7.9\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.5\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 14.0\n|Jun low C = 17.3\n|Jul low C = 19.1\n|Aug low C = 19.4\n|Sep low C = 18.0\n|Oct low C = 15.3\n|Nov low C = 11.7\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 13.6\n|Jan record low C = -1.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.2\n|Mar record low C = 2.3\n|Apr record low C = 3.6\n|May record low C = 6.7\n|Jun record low C = 8.0\n|Jul record low C = 11.9\n|Aug record low C = 13.1\n|Sep record low C = 9.9\n|Oct record low C = 7.8\n|Nov record low C = 2.7\n|Dec record low C = 1.2\n|year record low C = -1.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 52.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 39.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 38.6\n|May precipitation mm = 21.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 1.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 3.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 23.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 60.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 90.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 114.1\n|year precipitation mm = 508.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 10\n|May precipitation days = 7\n|Jun precipitation days = 4\n|Jul precipitation days = 1\n|Aug precipitation days = 1\n|Sep precipitation days = 3\n|Oct precipitation days = 9\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days = 11\n|Jan sun = 170.5\n|Feb sun = 165.2\n|Mar sun = 232.5\n|Apr sun = 252.0\n|May sun = 313.1\n|Jun sun = 333.0\n|Jul sun = 368.9\n|Aug sun = 353.4\n|Sep sun = 273.0\n|Oct sun = 226.3\n|Nov sun = 183.0\n|Dec sun = 167.4\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Instituto de Meteorologia]],<ref>[http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/008/ Faro] \u2013 Instituto de Meteorologia, 1981\u20132010 (provis\u00f3rias)</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name=weather>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/003/c00004.htm  |title=Monthly Averages for Faro, Portugal |publisher= World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> <small>(precipitation days)</small>, [[Hong Kong Observatory]]<ref>[http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/europe/sp_po/faro_e.htm \"Climatological Information for Faro, Portugal\"] Hong Kong Observatory.

[[Food processing]], cement and construction are the main industries. Tourism-related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve's economy during summer. The Algarve's economy has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since ancient times. Only since the 1960s has the region embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. With the increase in life quality and purchasing power, many shopping malls have been constructed, mostly in the past 15\u201320 years.

The region started the construction of better [[infrastructure]], mainly [[roads]], [[sanitation]], [[power grids]], [[telecommunications]], [[hospitals]], and [[House|housing]]. Due to the austerity measures introduced in 2011, tolls were placed on the main motorway that crosses the region to offset the expense of its maintenance. Private investors, with the support of [[municipalities]], also began the construction of a variety of [[hotels]], [[resorts]], [[golf courses]] (which are considered to be some of the best in Europe), and [[villa]]s. All this led to a large [[Economic development|development]] in the region, especially for the locals, who had previously lived in harsher circumstances.

It has since become a common destination for people from [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]] and [[Ireland]]. Many of these tourists own their a property in the region. Algarve-based [[publications]] and newspapers are written in English specifically for this community. In recent years, the Algarve has seen a high increase in tourists from [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], followed by [[Canadians]], [[Americans]], and [[Australians]]. Portuguese people from other parts of the country also visit the region in large numbers, especially in the peak of the summer (July and August).\n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o, one of many sites that attract tourists]]\nTourist attractions in the region include its beaches, [[Climate of Portugal|Mediterranean climate]], [[Crime in Portugal|safety]], [[Portuguese cuisine|cuisine]], and relatively low prices.

In addition to its natural features and beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of golf courses.\n\nThe Algarve is also popular for religious tourism, notably pilgrimages to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Piety (best known as the Sovereign Mother), a Marian shrine dedicated to the patron saint of [[Loul\u00e9]], that attract thousands of pilgrims of the Catholic faith to the city, or with the international pilgrimages to the site of the apparitions of Our Lady Mother of Goodness occurred near [[S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra]].\n\n[[File:Festa da Nossa Senhora 2012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The procession of the Sovereign Mother (Our Lady of Piety) attracts thousands of pilgrims to the Marian shrine of [[Loul\u00e9 Municipality|Loul\u00e9]], in the Algarve.]]\nThe Algarve's mild climate attracts interest from Portuguese and [[Northern European]] people wishing to have a holiday home or residence in the region.

A large number of seasonal job opportunities are tourism-related and are fulfilled by thousands of locals and immigrants. Due to its seasonal nature, most of the economy relies on the good weather available mostly for only about 5\u20136 months (characterised by a prolonged lack of rain and temperatures above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C throughout the day), meaning that many Algarvians go unemployed during the low season. Nonetheless, due to the very high monetary income that the high season brings, most people in the Algarve are still able to have comfortable lives even while unemployed. In March 2007, the Portuguese economic minister, Manuel Pinho, announced the creation of the \"Allgarve\" brand, as a part of a strategic promotion of the Algarve as a tourism destination for foreign citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/|title=Correio da Manh\u00e3: Portugal, Mundo, Sociedade, Cultura.

They were strongly influenced by the [[Celtici]]. Those [[Indo-European migrations|Indo-European tribes]], [[Celts|Celtic]] or pre-Celtic, founded the city of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] (then called [[Lacobriga|Lac\u00f3briga]]). The Cynetes, also known as Conii were further influenced by the neighbouring [[Tartessos]]. [[Phoenicia]]ns had established semi-permanent trading posts along the coast c. 1000 BC. Some sources claim that the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] founded Portus Hanibalis \u2013 known today as [[Portim\u00e3o]] \u2013 c. 550 BC.\n\n===Roman period===\nThe Algarve region came under Roman control after [[Quintus Fabius Maximus Servilianus (consul 142 BC)|Fabius Maximus Servilianus]] defeated the [[Lusitanians]] and the [[Turduli]] in the context of the [[Lusitanian War]], as was the case of much of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], which was absorbed into the [[Roman Republic]] in the second century BC. Cyneticum (in reference to the Cynetes who inhabited the region), as it was then called, became integrated into [[Hispania Ulterior]] and into [[Lusitania]] afterwards, being under Roman influence for around 600 years (from 200 BC till 410 AD), having thus adopted [[Latin]] as the official language, as well as Roman cultural, political, architectonic, religious and economic tenets. \n\nSeeing that during this time traveling through the land was dangerous, its geography meant that Cyneticum was of crucial importance as a passageway between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic Ocean, connecting countless Roman ports to several provinces, mainly in other parts of [[Hispania]], [[Gaul]] and [[Roman Britain|Britannia]]. This meant that the region experienced a great level of prosperity accrued through an expansion of its trading and commercial capabilities, mainly from the production and commercialization of olive oil and [[garum]], products very much sought after throughout the Roman Empire.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Viegas |first1=Catarina |title=A Ocupa\u00e7\u00e3o Romana do Algarve |date=2011 |publisher=CENTRO DE ARQUEOLOGIA DA UNIVERSIDADE DE LISBOA |isbn=978-989-95653-4-0 |page=39 |url=https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/9775/1/CViegas-2011.pdf |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref> As [[Christianity]] rose in popularity, becoming the official religion of the Roman Empire under [[Constantine the Great]], Cyneticum, following the same tendency of the rest of the Roman provinces, made the transition from a [[Polytheism|polytheistic]] society into a [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] one. The region made a gradual changeover into Christianity, as Pagan and [[Animism|Animistic]] religions became obsolete under this new cultural influence. Roman Emperor [[Theodosius I]], himself a native of the Iberian Peninsula, would come to prohibit Paganism in 381. The [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Roman Temple of Milreu]], originally dedicated to [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], transformed later on into a Paleochristian temple, is an example of the religious changes that took place in this period.<ref>{{cite web |author1=Neto, Jo\u00e3o; Gordalina, Ros\u00e1rio |title=Ru\u00ednas de Est\u00f3i / Ru\u00ednas de Milreu |url=http://www.monumentos.gov.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=2883 |website=Dire\u00e7\u00e3o-Geral do Patrim\u00f3nio Cultural |publisher=SIPA |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2003}}</ref> \n\nMany Roman ruins, both in the form of temples, [[Villa rustica|countryside villas]] (of which more than 30 were found in the Algarve), public baths, bridges, salting and fish-processing facilities and mosaics are widespread all over the region, notably in [[Vila do Bispo]], [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]], [[Roman ruins of Quinta da Abicada|Portim\u00e3o]], [[Roman ruins of Cerro da Vila|Quarteira]], [[Roman Ruins of Milreu|Faro]], [[Olh\u00e3o]], [[Balsa (Roman town)|Tavira]] and in other areas, illustrating the strong contributions that Roman culture as a whole made to the Algarve.<ref>{{cite web |title=Finding Rome on the Atlantic: an informal guide to some of the visible remains of Rome in Southern Portugal and Southwest Spain |url=https://www.algarvehistoryassociation.com/pt/iberian-history/58-finding-rome-on-the-atlantic |website=Algarve History Association |publisher=David Johnson |accessdate=18 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.cm-faro.pt/3366/milreu-roman-ruins.aspx|title=Milreu Roman Ruins|last=CM-FARO|website=www.cm-faro.pt|access-date=2017-02-27}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Villa de Milreu, os romanos no Algarve |url=https://ensina.rtp.pt/artigo/villa-de-milreu-os-romanos-no-algarve/ |website=RTP Ensina |accessdate=19 March 2020 |date=2015}}</ref>\n===Visigothic Kindgdom and Moorish Occupation===\n[[File:Capitel_Visig\u00f3tico_de_Pedra_-_Silves_-_22.10.2019.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Visigothic [[Capital (architecture)|capital]] found in [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]]]]\n[[File:Cidade de Silves12.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The city of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]], the first capital of the Algarve and an example of the noticeable Moorish influence in the region]]\n\nAfter the fall of the Western Roman Empire, the [[Visigoths]], a [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribe]] originally from [[Scandinavia]] but who had spread into Eastern Europe, occupied the Iberian Peninsula around the year 500, having founded the [[Visigothic Kingdom]], with [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] as its capital, in 542. In 552, the Algarve was conquered by the [[Byzantine Empire]] and, in 571, [[Liuvigild]] managed to secure the region for the Visigothic Kingdom once again, which lasted until the year 711, and comprised most of the Iberian Peninsula and parts of modern France. Although already Christian as a whole, some of these Germanic peoples were still Pagan and thus brought Paganism back to the Iberian Peninsula, where it marginally co-existed with Christianity. The Visigoths reigned until the beginning of the [[Umayyad conquest of Hispania]] and, although not nearly as influential as the Romans, left some influence in the Algarve, both in words that were, after the Moorish Occupation, added to the lexicon, which are still present in modern-day [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], as well as in local architecture. Several Visigothic [[Necropolis]] were found in the Algarve, suggesting that the presence was likely more significant than once believed.<ref>{{cite web |author1=M\u00e1rio Varela Gomes |title=A necr\u00f3pole visig\u00f3tica do Po\u00e7o dos Mouros (Silves) |url=http://www.patrimoniocultural.gov.pt/media/uploads/revistaportuguesadearqueologia/5_2/13.pdf |publisher=Revista Portuguesa de Arqueologia.

Faro, which the Christian residents had called Santa Maria, was renamed Faraon, which means \"settlement of the knights\". Due to the conquest of the Iberian Peninsula, the region was called [[Gharb Al-Andalus]]: ''Gharb'' means \"the west\", while ''[[al-Andalus]]'' is the Arabic name for the Iberian Peninsula. For several years, the town of [[Silves, Portugal|Silves]] was the capital of the region.\nIn the mid-13th century, during the [[Reconquista]], the [[Kingdom of Portugal]] took over the region in a series of successful military campaigns against the Moors. ''Al-Gharb'' became the [[Kingdom of the Algarve]], and the Moors were expelled in 1294. There were subsequent Moorish attempts to recapture the region, without success. King [[Afonso III of Portugal]] started calling himself King of Portugal and the Algarve. After 1471, with the conquest of several territories in the [[Maghreb]] \u2013 the area considered an extension of the Algarve \u2013 [[Afonso V of Portugal]] began fashioning himself \"King of Portugal and the Algarves\", referring to the European and African possessions.

Portuguese monarchs continued to use this title until the proclamation of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910. Between 1595 and 1808, the Algarve was a semiautonomous area of Portugal with its own governor, as well as a separate taxation system.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}\n\n[[File:Muralha de Lagos.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The [[Castle of Lagos|walls]] of the ancient town of [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]]]]\nIn the 15th century, Prince [[Henry the Navigator]] based himself near [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] and conducted various maritime expeditions which established the colonies that comprised the [[Portuguese Empire]]. Also from Lagos, [[Gil Eanes]] set sail in 1434 to become the first seafarer to round [[Cape Bojador]] in West Africa. The voyages of discovery brought Lagos fame and fortune. Trade flourished and Lagos became the capital of the historical province of Algarve in 1577 and remained so until the fabled [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]]. The earthquake damaged many areas in the Algarve and an accompanying [[tsunami]] destroyed or damaged coastal fortresses, while coastal towns and villages were heavily damaged except Faro, which was protected by the sandy banks of [[Ria Formosa]] lagoon. In Lagos, the waves reached the top of the city walls. For many Portuguese coastal regions, including the Algarve, the destructive effects of the tsunami were more disastrous than those of the earthquake itself.\n\nIn 1807, while [[Jean-Andoche Junot]] led the first [[Napoleon]]ic invasion in the north of Portugal, the Algarve was occupied by Spanish troops under [[Manuel Godoy]]. Beginning in 1808, and after subsequent battles in various towns and villages, the region was the first to drive out the Spanish occupiers. During the [[Portuguese Civil War]], several battles took place in the region, especially the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1833)|battle of Cape St. Vicente]] and the battle of Sant\u2019Ana, between liberals and Miguelites. [[Remexido]] was the guerrilla Algarvian leader who stood with the Miguelite absolutists for years, until he was executed in Faro in 1838.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.algarveprimeiro.com/d/remexido/200-33|title=Remexido|work=Algarve Primeiro|access-date=2017-02-27|language=pt-PT}}</ref>\n\nThe establishment of the [[First Portuguese Republic]] in 1910 marked the end of the Kingdom of Portugal and the Algarve. The Algarve is a somewhat exotic region for the Portuguese, due to the Mediterranean climate, unique foods, architecture, and geographical location- many Portuguese traditionally spend their Summer break or own a holiday home in the Algarve.\n\n==Geography==\n{{wide image|Pano_Sendeanlage_auf_dem_Foia_Algarve.jpg|1500px|A panoramic view from the highest point F\u00f3ia of the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]}}\nThe Algarve covers 4997&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>,<ref name=dgt/> extending just south of the Tagus valley to the southern coast of the Iberian Peninsula, joining Spain. Its highest point is [[F\u00f3ia (mountain)|F\u00f3ia]], {{convert|902|m|ft|abbr=on}}, in the [[Serra de Monchique|mountain range of Monchique]]. It also includes some islands and islets. The region is also the home of the [[Ria Formosa Lagoon]], a [[nature reserve]] of over 170&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> and a stopping place for hundreds of different species of birds. The length of the south-facing coastline is roughly 155&nbsp;km. Beyond the westernmost point of [[Cape St. Vincent]] it stretches a further 50&nbsp;km to the north. The coastline is notable for picturesque [[limestone]] caves and grottoes, particularly around Lagos, which are accessible by [[powerboat]].\n\n===Climate===\nThe maximum recorded temperatures in the Algarve fluctuate between {{convert|25|C|F}} in winter and over 40 C in summer, with the temperature rarely falling below freezing in the winter. The winter of 2008\u201309 was exceptionally cold and wet, with below-freezing temperatures (sub-{{convert|0|C|0|abbr=on}}) recorded in coastal areas for the first time in many years.\n\nGenerally, winter sees only subtle differences in daily maxima along the coastal Algarve, Tavira in the Eastern Algarve may see {{convert|16|-|17|C|F}}, Faro and Quarteira in the central Algarve broadly similar values, whist Sagres and the peninsula in the extreme west experiences more frontal activity off storms in the Atlantic and generally {{convert|15|C|F}} is the maximum daytime temperature. Conversely, overnight lows are higher in Sagres, at {{convert|9|C|F}}, whilst to the East {{convert|7|-|8|C|F}} is more common.\n\nSummer sees the highest average coastal temperatures in Faro and most points east, maxima around {{convert|29|-|30|C|F}}, whilst points west of Faro to about Lagos are in the range {{convert|27|-|29|C|F}}. The peninsula and Sagres see the coolest of the summer temperatures, being prone to the cooler North Westerly winds that topple round the Azores high so here we see {{convert|24|-|26|C|F}} more typically. Overnight lows are in the region of {{convert|17|-|19|C|F}} the higher values in Faro and to the east. \n\nYear to year, there can be considerable differences in the sea surface temperatures off the Algarve during the summer/early Autumn. In recent years, the sea temperatures have struggled to exceed {{convert|18|-|19|C|F}} till later in August, then weather conditions have encouraged a warm outflow from the Mediterranean, temporarily bathing the Algarve in warm surface water and sea temperatures can rise, very rapidly over a week or so, to {{convert|25|C|F}} and only slowly drop away during October. This warm plume of water can add some noticeable humidity to an otherwise very comfortable summer feel, temperature-wise. \n\nInland Algarve sees higher daytime temperatures than the coast, typically {{convert|31|-|33|C|F}} whilst overnight temperatures drop away to {{convert|16|-|18|C|F}}. Heatwaves can occasionally push the mercury to {{convert|45|C|F}} and at this intensity, overnight lows can remain uncomfortably high at over {{convert|25|C|F}}.\n\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Faro\n|metric first = yes\n|single line = yes\n|Jan record high C = 21.9\n|Feb record high C = 24.7\n|Mar record high C = 28.9\n|Apr record high C = 30.1\n|May record high C = 33.6\n|Jun record high C = 37.1\n|Jul record high C = 44.3\n|Aug record high C = 39.6\n|Sep record high C = 37.4\n|Oct record high C = 33.3\n|Nov record high C = 28.6\n|Dec record high C = 24.0\n|year record high C = 44.3\n|Jan high C = 16.1\n|Feb high C = 16.9\n|Mar high C = 19.1\n|Apr high C = 20.4\n|May high C = 22.8\n|Jun high C = 26.4\n|Jul high C = 29.2\n|Aug high C = 28.8\n|Sep high C = 26.6\n|Oct high C = 23.2\n|Nov high C = 19.6\n|Dec high C = 17.0\n|year high C = 22.2\n|Jan mean C = 12.0\n|Feb mean C = 12.8\n|Mar mean C = 14.8\n|Apr mean C = 16.1\n|May mean C = 18.4\n|Jun mean C = 21.9\n|Jul mean C = 24.2\n|Aug mean C = 24.1\n|Sep mean C = 22.3\n|Oct mean C = 19.3\n|Nov mean C = 15.7\n|Dec mean C = 13.3\n|year mean C = 17.9\n|Jan low C = 7.9\n|Feb low C = 8.7\n|Mar low C = 10.5\n|Apr low C = 11.8\n|May low C = 14.0\n|Jun low C = 17.3\n|Jul low C = 19.1\n|Aug low C = 19.4\n|Sep low C = 18.0\n|Oct low C = 15.3\n|Nov low C = 11.7\n|Dec low C = 9.6\n|year low C = 13.6\n|Jan record low C = -1.2\n|Feb record low C = -1.2\n|Mar record low C = 2.3\n|Apr record low C = 3.6\n|May record low C = 6.7\n|Jun record low C = 8.0\n|Jul record low C = 11.9\n|Aug record low C = 13.1\n|Sep record low C = 9.9\n|Oct record low C = 7.8\n|Nov record low C = 2.7\n|Dec record low C = 1.2\n|year record low C = -1.2\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 59.3\n|Feb precipitation mm = 52.0\n|Mar precipitation mm = 39.4\n|Apr precipitation mm = 38.6\n|May precipitation mm = 21.7\n|Jun precipitation mm = 4.3\n|Jul precipitation mm = 1.8\n|Aug precipitation mm = 3.9\n|Sep precipitation mm = 23.2\n|Oct precipitation mm = 60.1\n|Nov precipitation mm = 90.4\n|Dec precipitation mm = 114.1\n|year precipitation mm = 508.8\n|unit precipitation days = 0.1 mm\n|Jan precipitation days = 12\n|Feb precipitation days = 13\n|Mar precipitation days = 9\n|Apr precipitation days = 10\n|May precipitation days = 7\n|Jun precipitation days = 4\n|Jul precipitation days = 1\n|Aug precipitation days = 1\n|Sep precipitation days = 3\n|Oct precipitation days = 9\n|Nov precipitation days = 10\n|Dec precipitation days = 11\n|Jan sun = 170.5\n|Feb sun = 165.2\n|Mar sun = 232.5\n|Apr sun = 252.0\n|May sun = 313.1\n|Jun sun = 333.0\n|Jul sun = 368.9\n|Aug sun = 353.4\n|Sep sun = 273.0\n|Oct sun = 226.3\n|Nov sun = 183.0\n|Dec sun = 167.4\n|year sun = \n|source 1 = [[Instituto de Meteorologia]],<ref>[http://www.meteo.pt/pt/oclima/normais.clima/1981-2010/008/ Faro] \u2013 Instituto de Meteorologia, 1981\u20132010 (provis\u00f3rias)</ref> [[World Meteorological Organization]]<ref name=weather>{{cite web |url=http://www.worldweather.org/003/c00004.htm  |title=Monthly Averages for Faro, Portugal |publisher= World Meteorological Organization|accessdate=5 September 2012}}</ref> <small>(precipitation days)</small>, [[Hong Kong Observatory]]<ref>[http://www.weather.gov.hk/wxinfo/climat/world/eng/europe/sp_po/faro_e.htm \"Climatological Information for Faro, Portugal\"] Hong Kong Observatory.

[[Food processing]], cement and construction are the main industries. Tourism-related activities are extensive and make up the bulk of the Algarve's economy during summer. The Algarve's economy has always been closely linked to the sea, and fishing has been an important activity since ancient times. Only since the 1960s has the region embraced tourism, which has become its most important economic activity. With the increase in life quality and purchasing power, many shopping malls have been constructed, mostly in the past 15\u201320 years.

The region started the construction of better [[infrastructure]], mainly [[roads]], [[sanitation]], [[power grids]], [[telecommunications]], [[hospitals]], and [[House|housing]]. Due to the austerity measures introduced in 2011, tolls were placed on the main motorway that crosses the region to offset the expense of its maintenance. Private investors, with the support of [[municipalities]], also began the construction of a variety of [[hotels]], [[resorts]], [[golf courses]] (which are considered to be some of the best in Europe), and [[villa]]s. All this led to a large [[Economic development|development]] in the region, especially for the locals, who had previously lived in harsher circumstances.

It has since become a common destination for people from [[Germany]], [[The Netherlands]] and [[Ireland]]. Many of these tourists own their a property in the region. Algarve-based [[publications]] and newspapers are written in English specifically for this community. In recent years, the Algarve has seen a high increase in tourists from [[France]], [[Spain]] and [[Italy]], followed by [[Canadians]], [[Americans]], and [[Australians]]. Portuguese people from other parts of the country also visit the region in large numbers, especially in the peak of the summer (July and August).\n[[File:Praia da Rocha beach, Portim\u00e3o.jpg|thumb|Praia da Rocha, Portim\u00e3o, one of many sites that attract tourists]]\nTourist attractions in the region include its beaches, [[Climate of Portugal|Mediterranean climate]], [[Crime in Portugal|safety]], [[Portuguese cuisine|cuisine]], and relatively low prices.

In addition to its natural features and beaches, the Algarve has invested in the creation of a network of golf courses.\n\nThe Algarve is also popular for religious tourism, notably pilgrimages to the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Piety (best known as the Sovereign Mother), a Marian shrine dedicated to the patron saint of [[Loul\u00e9]], that attract thousands of pilgrims of the Catholic faith to the city, or with the international pilgrimages to the site of the apparitions of Our Lady Mother of Goodness occurred near [[S\u00e3o Marcos da Serra]].\n\n[[File:Festa da Nossa Senhora 2012.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The procession of the Sovereign Mother (Our Lady of Piety) attracts thousands of pilgrims to the Marian shrine of [[Loul\u00e9 Municipality|Loul\u00e9]], in the Algarve.]]\nThe Algarve's mild climate attracts interest from Portuguese and [[Northern European]] people wishing to have a holiday home or residence in the region. Being a region of Portugal, and therefore in the [[European Union]], any [[EU citizen]] has the right to freely buy property and reside with little formality in the Algarve.<ref>\"On the Rights of Citizens of the Union&nbsp;...\", EC Directive 2004/58 EC, retrieved 25 May 2007.[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2004:229:0035:0048:EN:PDF]</ref> British expatriates, followed by Germans, Dutch, and Scandinavians, are among the largest groups wishing to own a home in this sunny region of Portugal.\n\nTourism plays an important role in the economy of the Algarve. A large number of seasonal job opportunities are tourism-related and are fulfilled by thousands of locals and immigrants. Due to its seasonal nature, most of the economy relies on the good weather available mostly for only about 5\u20136 months (characterised by a prolonged lack of rain and temperatures above 30&nbsp;\u00b0C throughout the day), meaning that many Algarvians go unemployed during the low season. Nonetheless, due to the very high monetary income that the high season brings, most people in the Algarve are still able to have comfortable lives even while unemployed. In March 2007, the Portuguese economic minister, Manuel Pinho, announced the creation of the \"Allgarve\" brand, as a part of a strategic promotion of the Algarve as a tourism destination for foreign citizens.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.cmjornal.pt/|title=Correio da Manh\u00e3: Portugal, Mundo, Sociedade, Cultura.

Numerous ceramics and pottery outlets are open throughout the Algarve. For working potteries and ceramics workshops, the main (or best-known) pottery centers are located in the towns of [[Almancil]], [[Porches (Lagoa)|Porches]], and Loul\u00e9, but many other potteries and workshops are in the Algarve region.

The Mangere United team was a combined team from the Manukau and Mangere clubs. Both clubs retained their own identity in the junior grades.\n\nOn the opening day of the season all four First Grade matches were played on [[Carlaw Park]]. The junior matches on the same day were postponed as the railway workers were on strike and there was no way for the players to reach the outer suburban grounds which were used for matches in these grades.\n\n[[Marist Saints|Marist]] won the first grade championship for the first time in their history after defeating Devonport in the final by 20 points to 17 in front of a club record crowd of 17,000 at [[Carlaw Park]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Marist Win Final Replay/Twenty Points to Seventeen/Devonport Just Beaten\n| page =6\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18826\n| date = 1924-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240929.2.12.1\n| accessdate = 2019-09-09}}</ref> While City won the Roope Rooster competition for the 4th time.\n\n{{s-start}}\n    {{s-bef|before=[[1923 Auckland Rugby League season|1923]]}}\n    {{s-ttl|title=16th [[Auckland Rugby League]] season\n    |years=1924}}\n    {{s-aft|after=[[1925 Auckland Rugby League season|1925]]}}\n    {{end}}\n{{TOC right}}\n\n===Lou Brown Transfer Issue===\n[[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], the New Zealand international had played for [[Newton Rangers]] in 1922 and 1923 however at the end of the season he moved to England to play for Wigan. He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

As a result many players from the struggling [[Newton Rangers|Newton]] team made the trip to [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Win for South Auckland/Auckland Defeated By 21 To 5/Mediocre Representative Team\n| page =4\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18820\n| date = 1924-09-22\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240922.2.7.5\n| accessdate = 2019-09-02}}</ref>\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 4 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 15\u20137\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Visiting League Team/Australian Universities/Auckland Wins First Game/Fifteen Points to Seven/Superiority Throughout\n| page =9\n| work=[[The New Zealand Herald]]| volume=LXI| issue=18727\n| date = 1924-06-05\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19240605.2.124\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]], [[Ivan Littlewood]] 2\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]], [[Bert Laing]]\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 = Barry\n| con2 = Ryan\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 7000\n| referee = Neild\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n{{rugbybox collapsible\n| date = 7 June\n| time = 3:00\n| home = Auckland\n| score = 17\u20132\n| report = <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Beaten Again/Aussies\u2019 Poor Exhibition/Auckland Too Good/Football in the Mud\n| page =10\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=135\n| date = 1924-06-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240609.2.122\n| accessdate = 2019-09-05}}</ref>\n| away = Australian Universities\n| try1 = [[Ben Davidson (rugby league)|Ben Davidson]], McNeil, [[Nelson Bass]]\n| con1 = [[Craddock Dufty]] 3\n| pen1 = [[Craddock Dufty]]\n| try2 =\n| con2 =\n| pen2 = Ryan\n| stadium = Carlaw Park 1\n| attendance = 4000\n| referee = A Gallagher\n}}\n\n===Auckland v Australian Universities===\n[[Frank Delgrosso]] had to come on the replace [[George Davidson (athlete)|George Davidson]] after he collided badly with team mate [[Clarrie Polson]] when they were both going after the ball.

He had been granted a release by Newton and the New Zealand Rugby League. Upon his return he wished to play for the [[City Rovers]] club and he turned out for them despite being told by the [[Auckland Rugby League]] that he was not eligible to play for them. City were adamant that he had been fully released and could play for any team. The New Zealand Rugby League Council supported the decision but Brown played anyway. He was subsequently suspended for 3 matches. City took the extraordinary step of withdrawing its team from the competition and they defaulted their Round 9 match with Mangere United.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Mankukau Change Over, \n| page =8\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=165\n| date = 1924-07-14\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> On 18 July Newton held a special board meeting and agreed to grant Brown a transfer and thus the issue was finally settled.\n\n===Manukau Rovers Club Switches to Rugby Union===\nThe entire [[Manukau Magpies|Manukau Rovers]] club switched to rugby union after a dispute with Auckland Rugby League. The issue arose after one of their players (\"King\") was suspended for four playing Saturdays. He had been suspended because he was registered with the Manukau club but \"suddenly joined, or played, for a Mangere team without having been granted a transfer\". An opposing team had protested and King had also moved back to the Manukau team. The Manukau club took exception to the decision and refused to play any of its six teams in the following grades: Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth A, and Sixth B. It then went a step further by switching the rugby union with the Auckland Rugby Union accepting the club.<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Manukau Change Over/The Reason Why/Exception Taken to League's Ruling\n| page =5\n| work=[[Auckland Star]]| volume=LV| issue=162\n| date = 1924-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/AS19240710.2.74\n| accessdate = 2020-03-26}}</ref> The Secretary of the club, C.

This rule would come into place from Saturday, 23 August onwards.\n\n== First Grade Championship ==\nA record nine teams competed in the First Grade competition in 1924 with the addition of the Mangere and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]] senior teams. Mangere had their colours registered as green and black. This team was essentially the Manukau Magpies club of today though they had a patchy existence for their first two decades. It was initially decided that after the first round the bottom three teams would drop out of the competition for the second round. At the end of the first round these teams were Mangere, and [[Ellerslie Eagles|Ellerslie]]. However this was later rescinded and all teams remained in the competition until the end of the season.\n\n=== Final Standings ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!width=175

Jayalalithaa]] and [[Pandari Bai]], with [[Major Sundarrajan]], [[M. N. Nambiar]], [[Nagesh]] and [[V. Nagaiah]] in supporting roles. It revolves around a scarred business magnate who abandons his similarly scarred son, unable to tolerate his face.\n\n''Deiva Magan'' was released on 5 September 1969. The film received praise for Ganesan's performance and was a commercial success, running for over 100 days in theatres. It was the first Tamil film to be [[List of Indian submissions for the Academy Award for Best International Feature Film|submitted by India in contest for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film]]. The film was later remade in [[Kannada]] as ''Thayi Mamathe'' (1985).\n\n== Plot ==\nShankar, a business magnate with a scarred face, marries Parvathi. The couple lead a happy life and Parvathi gives birth to twin boys named Kannan and Vijay. Kannan, the older twin, is born with a scarred face like his father. Shankar, unable to tolerate his eldest son's face, leaves him under the custody of his doctor friend Raju to be killed and tells his wife that Kannan is dead. Raju does not kill the child but leaves him in an orphanage.\n\nAs years pass by, Kannan grows to be a strong man and a recluse inclined towards playing [[sitar]], while Vijay becomes a happy-go-lucky college-going timid son, falls in love with Nirmala. In the meanwhile, Kannan comes to know about his family and tries to meet his mother and brother but he is asked by his father not to reveal his identity to them. Kabali, a man once punished by Shankar, kidnaps Vijay in order to take revenge on him. In the end, Kannan rescues his brother, killing Kabali. He succumbs to his injuries and dies on the lap of his mother.\n\n== Cast ==\n* [[Sivaji Ganesan]] as Shankar, Kannan and Vijay\n* [[J.
