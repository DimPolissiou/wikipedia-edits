These audiobooks were described as the 'guide to...' series, covering several topics. As of May 2011, there are 12 \"Guides\" in total: Medicine, Natural History, Arts, Philosophy, The English, Society, Law & Order, The Future, The Human Body, The Earth, The [[2010 FIFA World Cup|World Cup 2010]], and [[Comic Relief]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_sb_noss?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&field-keywords=The+ricky+gervais+guide+to|title=The Ricky Gervais Guide to...|publisher=Amazon.co.uk|accessdate=31 January 2015}}</ref> The conversations typically begin on topic, but constantly stray away from the topic at hand.\n\n===Television===\n====Early television appearances====\n[[File:RickyGervaisBAFTA07.jpg|thumb|upright|Gervais at the [[60th British Academy Film Awards]] in 2007]]\nGervais has contributed to the [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]]-winning ''[[The Sketch Show]]'' (ITV), penning several sketches. His mainstream-TV on-screen debut came in September 1998 as part of [[Channel 4]]'s ''Comedy Lab'' series of pilots. His one-off show ''[[Golden Years (TV programme)|Golden Years]]'' focused on a [[David Bowie]]-obsessed character called Clive Meadows.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/the-long-funny-career-of-ricky-gervais-20110404/golden-years-1998-0520409Aa|title=The Long, Funny Career of Ricky Gervais|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Tom |last=Eames|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nGervais then came to much wider national attention with an obnoxious, cutting persona featured in a topical slot that replaced [[Ali G]]'s segments on the satirical Channel 4 comedy programme ''[[The 11 O'Clock Show]]'' in early 1999, in which his character used as many [[Profanity|expletive]]s as was possible and produced an inordinate number of politically incorrect statements. Among the other regular featured comedians on the show was [[Mackenzie Crook]], later a co-star of ''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]''. Two years later, Gervais went on to present his own comedy chat show for Channel 4 called ''[[Meet Ricky Gervais]]''. It was poorly received and has since been mocked by Gervais himself.\n\nThroughout this time, Gervais also wrote for the BBC sketch show ''[[Bruiser (TV series)|Bruiser]]'' and ''The [[Jim Tavar\u00e9|Jim Tavare]] Show''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|title=Comedy People A-Z Ricky Gervais|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 January 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924202642/http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/people/ricky_gervais_person_page.shtml|archive-date=24 September 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n====''The Office''====\n{{Main|The Office (UK TV series)}}\n''[[The Office (UK TV series)|The Office]]'' started when [[Stephen Merchant]], while on a BBC production course, had to make his own short film.

Able to [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen|open the innings]] or [[Batting order (cricket)#Top order|bat down the order]], Barnes was regarded as one of Australia's finest batsmen in the period immediately following the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He helped create an enduring record when scoring 234&nbsp;in the second Test against England at Sydney in December 1946; exactly the same score as his captain, [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]], in the process setting a world-record 405-run [[wicket#Partnership|fifth wicket]] [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]]. Barnes averaged 63.05 over 19 innings in a career that, like those of most of his contemporaries, was interrupted by the Second World War.\n\nHe made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut at the end of the 1936\u201337 season when selected for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]], and he was later included in the team for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 Australian tour of England]], making his Test debut in the final international of the series. On the resumption of Test cricket after the war, he was picked as the opening partner to [[Arthur Morris]]. Barnes was a member of [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|''The Invincibles'']], the 1948 Australian team that toured England without losing a single match. Retiring from cricket at the end of that tour, Barnes attempted a comeback to Test cricket in the 1951\u201352 season that was ultimately and controversially unsuccessful.<ref>As a convention, cricket seasons are denoted as a single year to represent northern hemisphere summer, or dashed for southern hemisphere. See [[Cricket season]] for more information.</ref>\n\nBarnes had a reputation as an eccentric and was frequently the subject of controversy. This included a celebrated [[Defamation|libel]] case, following his exclusion from the national team in 1951\u201352 for \"reasons other than cricket ability\". He was later involved in an incident where, acting as [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]], he performed his duties on the ground in a suit and tie (rather than [[Flannels|'whites']]), carrying a bizarre range of superfluous items. Despite this reputation, Barnes was a shrewd businessman who used the opportunities afforded by cricket to supplement his income through trading, journalism and [[Real-estate developer|property development]]. Increasing [[paranoia]] brought about by [[bipolar disorder]] saw Barnes lose many of the friends he had made through the game as he sought treatment for his depression. On 16 December 1973, he was found dead at his home in the Sydney suburb of [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]]; he had ingested [[barbiturate]]s and [[bromide]] in a probable suicide.\n\n==Early years==\nBarnes was born in 1916 in [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], an inner suburb of Sydney.<ref>Smith, p.3. \"was born in Annandale on 5 June 1916. She christened him Sidney George after the city of his birth and his maternal grandfather. Sid's place of birth would remain a problem for many years to come. He always thought it was [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]] in [[Queensland]] and said so in his autobiography. He also confessed confusion over the year citing 1918 or 1919, rather than 1916.\"</ref> However, in his autobiography, he claims to have been born in 1918 or 1919 in [[Queensland]],<ref>Barnes, p. 13.</ref> and his military service record has his date of birth as 5 June 1917.<ref>[http://naa12.naa.gov.au/scripts/ItemDetail.asp?M=0&B=5659359 Military service record], National Archives</ref> He was the third child of Alfred Percival Barnes and Hilda May Barnes (n\u00e9e Jeffery), both from farming families near [[Tamworth, New South Wales|Tamworth]] in northern [[New South Wales]]. After marrying, the couple left Tamworth to take up a lease on a remote [[sheep station]] near [[Hughenden, Queensland|Hughenden]] in North Queensland. Before Sid was born, Alfred died from [[typhoid fever]], caused by drinking contaminated water on the family property. After his death, Hilda, widowed and pregnant with her latest child, moved to Sydney with her children and stayed with her sister, where Sid was born. From her husband's estate, Hilda Barnes mother was able to purchase and renovate real estate in [[Stanmore, New South Wales|Stanmore]] and [[Leichhardt, New South Wales|Leichhardt]],&nbsp;New South Wales, to let or sell. Later in life, Barnes would recount how, as a child, he used to collect the rents for his mother.<ref>Smith, pp. 2\u20133.</ref>\n\n===Childhood and club cricket===\n[[File:Sid Barnes, 16 Petersham.jpg|thumb|left|Barnes, aged 16, as a Petersham player]]\nBarnes attended [[Stanmore, New South Wales#Schools|Stanmore Public School]] and, although not a scholar, was a keen participant in sporting activities.<ref>Smith, p. 5.</ref> His introduction to cricket came via his older brother, Horrie; Horrie was a useful batsman who played in the local Western Suburbs Churches league and paid Sid [[Sixpence (Australian)|sixpence]] to bowl to him after he finished work. Taking an interest in the game, Sid had trials for the school team and was eventually selected in the first XI. An early controversy saw Barnes suspended for three weeks for disputing an [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]]'s decision.<ref name=\"smith10\">Smith, p. 10.</ref> Successes for both his school team and his local club team, St. Augustine, saw him acquire the nickname ''The Governor-General''\u2014the nickname of Australian Test player, [[Charlie Macartney]], and he was selected for New South Wales Schoolboys to play teams from [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[Queensland]].<ref name=\"smith10\"/>\n\nIn 1932\u201333, Barnes joined the [[Petersham, New South Wales|Petersham]] club, and began playing in the third XI.

I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [sic] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence&nbsp;...

He was worried that having played as a professional in the Lancashire League would damage his chance of further Test cricket, but at the same time suggested that he had offers from other Lancashire League teams to fall back on should he not be picked. There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers.<ref>Barnes, pp. 151\u2013158.</ref> In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career. Arriving back with several state games having already been played, he failed to make runs for New South Wales and was not picked for the first two Tests against [[Indian cricket team in Australia in 1947-48|the Indian tourists]], Bill Brown taking over as opener with Morris.\n\nThe match between Victoria and New South Wales was Barnes's chance to redeem himself.

This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.<ref>Smith, p. 130.</ref>\n\nBarnes played in Bradman's testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948, but otherwise made himself unavailable for first-class cricket, preferring to pursue business interests. He wrote a regular column for Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', prosaically titled \"Like It or Lump It\", in which he often criticised the administration of the game and the amounts paid to Australia's leading cricketers.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\">Haigh and Frith, pp. 107\u2013111.</ref> Barnes was one of a number of cricket writers of the immediate post-war era who adopted a confrontational [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] style of journalism, in contrast to the more sedate reporting of the 1930s.<ref>Harte, pp. 401\u2013402.</ref>\n\n===Libel case===\n[[File:Barnes and lawyer.jpg|thumb|Barnes and his legal representative outside the venue of their libel case]]\nAt the beginning of the 1951\u201352 season, Barnes had a change of heart and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again.

Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\nDuring his absence from the Test team, the Australian selectors had been unsuccessful in their attempts to find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.<ref name=\"Harte1\">Harte, pp. 422\u2013423.</ref>\n\nThe Board of Control had granted themselves the power to exclude a player from the national team \"on grounds other than cricket ability\" following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England.<ref>Harte, p. 256.</ref> They had a secret dossier, compiled during the season, documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> Publicly, the Board remained silent on their policy and how it related to Barnes. On the field, Barnes responded with an innings of 128 in three hours against Queensland;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/20/20052.html\n|title= New South Wales v Queensland, Sheffield Shield 1951\u201352\n|date=1 January 1952\n|accessdate=3 December 2007}}</ref> off the field, he sought answers from the administrators, but was frustrated by their evasiveness. His form tapered off during the closing stages of the season and he finished with 433 first-class runs at an average of 39.36.<ref name=\"seasonbyseason\"/>\n\nJust as the furore appeared to have died down, in April 1952 Sydney's ''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|Daily Mirror]]'' published a letter from a reader, Jacob Raith.<ref>Smith, p. 155. \"Jacob Raith, a master baker, cricket lover from Sid's own suburb of Stanmore and a former president of Petersham Cricket Club&nbsp;...\" It continues down the same page, \"Rather than support the player, whom he did not know despite their associations with the same area, he decided to back the board.\"</ref> Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to blame for the omission.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for [[Defamation|libel]] and engaged Sydney's leading [[barrister]], Jack Shand KC, as counsel.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Slee\n|first= John\n|year=2002\n|title=Shand, John Wentworth (1897\u20131959)'\n|journal= Australian Dictionary of Biography\n|volume=16\n|pages=216\u2013217\n|location= Melbourne\n|publisher=Melbourne University Press\n|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160257b.htm?hilite=Jack%3BShand\n|accessdate=4 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe case began in Sydney's District Court on 21 August 1952. Shand's examination of the various Board members appearing for the defendant revealed the Board's maladministration, pettiness and its acceptance of rumour as fact. No firm reason was put forward for the omission of Barnes and a division within the Board was evident when several of its members spoke highly of him.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> As Barnes began his testimony on the second day of proceedings, Raith's counsel announced settlement of the case and commented to the court, \"seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly\".<ref name=\"Harte1\"/> Barnes was vindicated with a full public apology.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\nAlthough the court case portrayed \"an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered\", it did little to alter the Board's culture. The next major court case involving Australian cricket, the [[World Series Cricket]] challenges of 1977\u201378 demonstrated that the Board was still run as a \"closed shop\", over 25 years later.<ref name=\"Harte1\"/> In an analysis of the Barnes libel case, [[Gideon Haigh]] wrote, \"far from becoming a watershed in player-administrator relations, it may even have discouraged players contemplating defiance of the Board but lacking the wherewithal to retain a hotshot criminal barrister.\"<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\n===Twelfth man incident===\n[[File:Sid Barnes, Adelaide Oval 1952.jpg|thumb|right|Barnes as twelfth man, dressed in suit and tie and carrying cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush]]\nResuming for New South Wales in 1952\u201353, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 1952-53|Test series against South Africa]]. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the [[Adelaide Oval]], Barnes offered to act as [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] to provide an opportunity for a younger player, [[Ray Flockton]]. During a drinks break on the second day of the match, he appeared on the ground in a suit and tie, (rather than [[Flannels|'whites']]) carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush. The crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector [[Phil Ridings]], officially complained to the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\nBarnes appeared just once more for New South Wales, against South Africa at New Year 1953, then made himself unavailable for selection, conceding that \"his card had been marked\".<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|Australian team]] toured England in 1953 and lost the [[List of cricket terms#A|Ashes]] after holding them for 19 years. Barnes wrote ''Eyes on the Ashes'', a book about the tour that included trenchant criticism of the behaviour of the Australian team, which did not go down well with some of his former team-mates.<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\n==Style and personality==\nBarnes gripped the bat very low on the handle and bent over so far in his stance that the knuckles of his right hand were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary.<ref>Robinson, p. 78.</ref> His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.<ref>All of these terms are included in the [[List of cricket terms]].</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]] called Barnes the [[Artful Dodger]] of cricket, alluding to both his batting style and his off-field business dealings, and wrote that he \"would rather steal a run like a pickpocket than hit an honest four with a straightforward stroke.\"<ref>Robinson, p. 76.</ref> Robinson summarised his safety-first approach in going so far back as the bowler delivered:\n<blockquote>Though this routine made his play air-tight in one way, it simplified opposing captains' field-placing to curb his scoring, it left him with a back-foot addict's liability to go leg-before-wicket or be caught behind on either side, and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length&nbsp;... he could have made more runs since the war as a stroke-player, and won popular backing as a candidate for the title of world's best batsman, instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out.<ref>Robinson, p. 79.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[David Frith]] wrote of [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown's]] memories of Barnes as a person, and his controversial fielding:\n<blockquote>\n'Bagga' Barnes was also Bill's room-mate, and his affection for his late lamented pal, a lovable rogue, was obvious. He recalled the furore over Barnes's provocative field positioning, extremely close at silly mid-on, and how criticism of his foot being too close to the mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a couple of feet into the forbidden territory \u2013 and a couple of feet more when the English crowd roared at him.<ref name=\"grandpa\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe was a part-time [[leg spin|leg break]] bowler, taking 57&nbsp;wickets in first-class cricket at a useful average of 32.21.<ref name=\"az\">Cashman, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Barnes's leg break spun very little, but he had a [[topspinner]] which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets.<ref name=\"az\"/> Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]] was turned down by umpire [[Alec Skelding]], he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: \"Now all you want is a white stick\".<ref name=\"cricinfo\"/> A complex character, Barnes, \"rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer\".<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\n==Life outside cricket==\n[[File:SidBarnesLaterLife.jpg|thumb|Barnes in later life]]\nBarnes married a schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward, on 11 June 1942. Alison was the daughter of Kenneth Edward, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Professor]] of [[Theology]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, on his way back from an [[exhibition match]] in [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]], was bet the price of the meal that he could not get the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.<ref>Smith, p. 44.</ref>\n\nOutside of cricket, Barnes followed his mother into [[real-estate developer|property development]] (see [[Sid Barnes#Early years|above]]) and at various times entered into partnerships with [[Keith Miller]] and [[Norman Von Nida]]. His suspicious nature, which grew as time passed, saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations. While Barnes was not a millionaire, he was a successful and organised businessman.<ref>Smith, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref>\n\nAs a writer, Barnes had no claims to literary talent; his copy was [[ghostwriter|ghost-written]], in all likelihood by his friend Jack Tier and later by former professional [[rugby league]] footballer [[Peter Peters]].<ref>Smith, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref> His writing was of a provocative tone; his column in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' during the 1953 tour was called \"The Aussie They Couldn't Gag\". His forthright opinions certainly cost him friends and hardened the opinions of others about him.<ref>Smith, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> At the end of the 1953 tour, he published ''Eyes on the Ashes'', and his autobiography, ''It Isn't Cricket''. He also wrote ''The Ashes Ablaze'' in 1955, and turned to full-time writing, mostly for Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''. His columns were perceived as being deliberately controversial, and, as time went by, increasingly regarded as carping.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nIn later life, Barnes suffered from depressive illness. He was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] and treated with a combination of medication, mainly [[diazepam]], and [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. He spent much of his last years in and out of clinics seeking treatment for his condition.<ref>Smith, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref> In 1973, Barnes died at his home in [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]], one of Sydney's northern beach suburbs, from [[barbiturate]] and [[bromide]] poisoning. Although the medications were certainly self-administered, the [[coroner]] could not \"determine intent\".<ref name=\"adb\"/> \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Statistical analysis==\n{{Cricket batting averages (10 innings)}}\nOnly six players with ten or more completed innings have achieved an end of career average in excess of 60. Barnes's 63.05 in 19&nbsp;innings ranks him as number three in the history of Test cricket, behind Sir [[Donald Bradman]] (99.94, 80&nbsp;innings) and [[Stewie Dempster]] (65.72, 15&nbsp;innings).<ref>There is no consensus within cricket on what is the appropriate minimum number of innings required when comparing career averages, to avoid statistical quirks caused by players of very short careers. [[Andy Ganteaume]], for example, played just one Test and scored a century. In Cricinfo's statistical analysis of leading career averages, ([http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282910.html]) Barnes is omitted for having played just 19 (rather than the minimum of 20) innings. Likewise, there is no consensus on omitting current players, something which is done because when comparing career performances, most players experience a fall-off in average toward the end of their career; Cricinfo includes current players, including one ([[Mike Hussey]]) whose career average in December 2007 exceeded that of Barnes.</ref>\n\nBarnes's short career was dominated by his monumental double hundred, but he was a consistent performer, as the chart (left) reveals. Age did not seem to diminish his abilities; in his last eight Test innings, aged 31\u201332, he passed 50 five times and scored two of his three Test hundreds.<ref name=\"testlist\">{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/player/4098.html?class=1;template=results;type=allround;view=match |title= Statsguru \u2013 SG Barnes \u2013 Test matches \u2013 All-round analysis |accessdate=15 April 2008| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> [[File:Sid Barnes graph.png|thumb|left|300px|Sid Barnes's Test batting performances.

However, a useful comparison can be made between Barnes and Bradman because they were contemporaries in the same team.

Able to [[Batting order (cricket)#Opening batsmen|open the innings]] or [[Batting order (cricket)#Top order|bat down the order]], Barnes was regarded as one of Australia's finest batsmen in the period immediately following the [[World War II|Second World War]]. He helped create an enduring record when scoring 234&nbsp;in the second Test against England at Sydney in December 1946; exactly the same score as his captain, [[Donald Bradman|Don Bradman]], in the process setting a world-record 405-run [[wicket#Partnership|fifth wicket]] [[partnership (cricket)|partnership]]. Barnes averaged 63.05 over 19 innings in a career that, like those of most of his contemporaries, was interrupted by the Second World War.\n\nHe made his [[First-class cricket|first-class]] debut at the end of the 1936\u201337 season when selected for [[New South Wales cricket team|New South Wales]], and he was later included in the team for the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1938|1938 Australian tour of England]], making his Test debut in the final international of the series. On the resumption of Test cricket after the war, he was picked as the opening partner to [[Arthur Morris]]. Barnes was a member of [[Australian cricket team in England in 1948|''The Invincibles'']], the 1948 Australian team that toured England without losing a single match. Retiring from cricket at the end of that tour, Barnes attempted a comeback to Test cricket in the 1951\u201352 season that was ultimately and controversially unsuccessful.<ref>As a convention, cricket seasons are denoted as a single year to represent northern hemisphere summer, or dashed for southern hemisphere. See [[Cricket season]] for more information.</ref>\n\nBarnes had a reputation as an eccentric and was frequently the subject of controversy. This included a celebrated [[Defamation|libel]] case, following his exclusion from the national team in 1951\u201352 for \"reasons other than cricket ability\". He was later involved in an incident where, acting as [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]], he performed his duties on the ground in a suit and tie (rather than [[Flannels|'whites']]), carrying a bizarre range of superfluous items. Despite this reputation, Barnes was a shrewd businessman who used the opportunities afforded by cricket to supplement his income through trading, journalism and [[Real-estate developer|property development]]. Increasing [[paranoia]] brought about by [[bipolar disorder]] saw Barnes lose many of the friends he had made through the game as he sought treatment for his depression. On 16 December 1973, he was found dead at his home in the Sydney suburb of [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]]; he had ingested [[barbiturate]]s and [[bromide]] in a probable suicide.\n\n==Early years==\nBarnes was born in 1916 in [[Annandale, New South Wales|Annandale]], an inner suburb of Sydney.<ref>Smith, p.3. \"was born in Annandale on 5 June 1916. She christened him Sidney George after the city of his birth and his maternal grandfather. Sid's place of birth would remain a problem for many years to come. He always thought it was [[Charters Towers, Queensland|Charters Towers]] in [[Queensland]] and said so in his autobiography.

Those English eyes certainly did stand out.<ref>Barnes, p. 117.</ref></blockquote>\n\nBradman had words with Barnes after this match about his new role as an opener. Barnes later wrote: <blockquote>He asked me how I liked it. I said it suited me. 'You batted very well in this game,' he said, 'but not quite as an opener. You were looking for runs all the time. I think what you want to watch as an opener is not getting out&nbsp;... What is needed from my openers, and is most important, is patience and plenty of it.' I was completely willing to be guided by anything that Bradman wanted me to do.<ref>Barnes, p. 118.</ref></blockquote>\n\nYears later, Barnes wrote about the effect this had on his batting style. <blockquote>There was one angle about this change of batting position that didn't appeal to me. I am, by nature, a forcing batsman. I like to take the shine out of a bowler [sic] and I love to hear the ball rattling the pickets, or soaring over the fence&nbsp;... My footwork was quick and I often caused delight by stepping back feet outside the leg stump and square-cutting&nbsp;...

After the series Barnes said on radio:\n<blockquote>\nWe could have played on, but it was a Test match and we just had to win. I realised something drastic had to be done or three wickets might be lost. So I appealed after every second ball.

There was also concern that, with his wife now living in Scotland, he would breach the Australian rule that wives were not allowed to travel with Test cricketers.<ref>Barnes, pp. 151\u2013158.</ref> In fact, lack of form and opportunity were greater threats to Barnes's continued Test career.

The report of the tour in the 1949 edition of [[Wisden Cricketers' Almanack]], stated that Barnes's fielding was as important a factor as his batting in ''The Invincibles''' success: <blockquote>Probably a number of batsmen were sufficiently affected by his close attendance to cause them to lose concentration on the bowler running up, but equally important was the fact that the knowledge of his presence influenced opponents to avoid strokes in that direction.

D. G. Leveson-Gower]] XI at the [[Scarborough Festival|Scarborough cricket festival]] came in just 25 minutes.<ref>Preston, 1949: p. 258.</ref>\n\n==Later playing career==\n[[File:BarnesMiniatureBat.jpg|thumb|Barnes plays a practical joke by using a miniature bat in [[Donald Bradman|Bradman]]'s testimonial match.]]\nAn important concern for Barnes, when returning from the United Kingdom to Australia, was to avoid paying customs [[Duty (economics)|duties]] on the enormous amount of goods he acquired through various deals during the tour. This included good quality English cloth, in very short supply in Australia at this time. Hearing a rumour that Customs officials were waiting in Sydney for him, Barnes disembarked at Melbourne and travelled to Sydney by train. The move worked and he sold his stock at a substantial profit, conservatively estimated to be equal to his tour fee.<ref>Smith, p. 130.</ref>\n\nBarnes played in Bradman's testimonial match at the MCG in December 1948, but otherwise made himself unavailable for first-class cricket, preferring to pursue business interests. He wrote a regular column for Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]'', prosaically titled \"Like It or Lump It\", in which he often criticised the administration of the game and the amounts paid to Australia's leading cricketers.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\">Haigh and Frith, pp. 107\u2013111.</ref> Barnes was one of a number of cricket writers of the immediate post-war era who adopted a confrontational [[tabloid (newspaper format)|tabloid]] style of journalism, in contrast to the more sedate reporting of the 1930s.<ref>Harte, pp. 401\u2013402.</ref>\n\n===Libel case===\n[[File:Barnes and lawyer.jpg|thumb|Barnes and his legal representative outside the venue of their libel case]]\nAt the beginning of the 1951\u201352 season, Barnes had a change of heart and returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to play Test cricket again. He approached [[Aubrey Oxlade]], the chairman of Australian cricket's [[Cricket Australia|Board of Control]], to ask if there was any impediment to his return to the Australian team. Oxlade told Barnes that he would be judged solely on his batting performances.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\nDuring his absence from the Test team, the Australian selectors had been unsuccessful in their attempts to find a reliable partner for Arthur Morris to open the batting. Barnes started the season solidly and, in the last match before the team for the third Test against the [[West Indies cricket team|West Indies]] was chosen, he hit 107 against Victoria. The selectors duly picked him for the match, then passed the team list to the Board of Control for ratification. The Board vetoed the inclusion of Barnes and requested the nomination of a replacement player. Unwilling to accept the blame for Barnes's omission, the selectors deliberately deferred their decision on the replacement.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> When the team was not announced at the scheduled time, journalists uncovered the story and Barnes became a ''[[cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre]]'' for many weeks, missing all of the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass; insulting the Royal Family; theft from team-mates; drunkenness; and stealing a car.<ref name=\"Harte1\">Harte, pp. 422\u2013423.</ref>\n\nThe Board of Control had granted themselves the power to exclude a player from the national team \"on grounds other than cricket ability\" following the poor behaviour of some members of the 1912 team that toured England.<ref>Harte, p. 256.</ref> They had a secret dossier, compiled during the season, documenting Barnes's behaviour and they doctored the minutes of the meeting at which they discussed his selection.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> Publicly, the Board remained silent on their policy and how it related to Barnes. On the field, Barnes responded with an innings of 128 in three hours against Queensland;<ref>{{cite web |url=https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Scorecards/20/20052.html\n|title= New South Wales v Queensland, Sheffield Shield 1951\u201352\n|date=1 January 1952\n|accessdate=3 December 2007}}</ref> off the field, he sought answers from the administrators, but was frustrated by their evasiveness. His form tapered off during the closing stages of the season and he finished with 433 first-class runs at an average of 39.36.<ref name=\"seasonbyseason\"/>\n\nJust as the furore appeared to have died down, in April 1952 Sydney's ''[[The Daily Mirror (Australia)|Daily Mirror]]'' published a letter from a reader, Jacob Raith.<ref>Smith, p. 155. \"Jacob Raith, a master baker, cricket lover from Sid's own suburb of Stanmore and a former president of Petersham Cricket Club&nbsp;...\" It continues down the same page, \"Rather than support the player, whom he did not know despite their associations with the same area, he decided to back the board.\"</ref> Responding to a letter in support of Barnes, Raith sided with the Board and suggested that his character was to blame for the omission.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> Acting on legal advice, Barnes sued Raith for [[Defamation|libel]] and engaged Sydney's leading [[barrister]], Jack Shand KC, as counsel.<ref>{{cite journal\n|last= Slee\n|first= John\n|year=2002\n|title=Shand, John Wentworth (1897\u20131959)'\n|journal= Australian Dictionary of Biography\n|volume=16\n|pages=216\u2013217\n|location= Melbourne\n|publisher=Melbourne University Press\n|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A160257b.htm?hilite=Jack%3BShand\n|accessdate=4 December 2007}}</ref>\n\nThe case began in Sydney's District Court on 21 August 1952. Shand's examination of the various Board members appearing for the defendant revealed the Board's maladministration, pettiness and its acceptance of rumour as fact. No firm reason was put forward for the omission of Barnes and a division within the Board was evident when several of its members spoke highly of him.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> As Barnes began his testimony on the second day of proceedings, Raith's counsel announced settlement of the case and commented to the court, \"seldom in the history of libel actions has such a plea failed so completely and utterly\".<ref name=\"Harte1\"/> Barnes was vindicated with a full public apology.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\nAlthough the court case portrayed \"an awful image of the chaos and bigotry under which Australian cricket was administered\", it did little to alter the Board's culture. The next major court case involving Australian cricket, the [[World Series Cricket]] challenges of 1977\u201378 demonstrated that the Board was still run as a \"closed shop\", over 25 years later.<ref name=\"Harte1\"/> In an analysis of the Barnes libel case, [[Gideon Haigh]] wrote, \"far from becoming a watershed in player-administrator relations, it may even have discouraged players contemplating defiance of the Board but lacking the wherewithal to retain a hotshot criminal barrister.\"<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\n===Twelfth man incident===\n[[File:Sid Barnes, Adelaide Oval 1952.jpg|thumb|right|Barnes as twelfth man, dressed in suit and tie and carrying cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush]]\nResuming for New South Wales in 1952\u201353, Barnes scored 152 against Victoria in the last match before the beginning of the [[South African cricket team in Australia in 1952-53|Test series against South Africa]]. Nevertheless, the selectors overlooked him for the first Test and in the following state match, against South Australia at the [[Adelaide Oval]], Barnes offered to act as [[List of cricket terms#T|twelfth man]] to provide an opportunity for a younger player, [[Ray Flockton]]. During a drinks break on the second day of the match, he appeared on the ground in a suit and tie, (rather than [[Flannels|'whites']]) carrying superfluous items such as cigars, iced towels, a mirror and comb, a radio and a clothes brush. The crowd initially responded well to the joke, but their mood soured when the interval extended beyond its scheduled time and Barnes received criticism for delaying the game.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> The South Australian team, captained by Australian selector [[Phil Ridings]], officially complained to the [[New South Wales Cricket Association]] (NSWCA), which asked Barnes to express regret over the incident. Despite the association's support for Barnes during his problems of the previous season, he prevaricated. Eventually, the NSWCA forwarded a written apology on his behalf.<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/>\n\nBarnes appeared just once more for New South Wales, against South Africa at New Year 1953, then made himself unavailable for selection, conceding that \"his card had been marked\".<ref name=\"Haigh&Frith\"/> The [[Australian cricket team in England in 1953|Australian team]] toured England in 1953 and lost the [[List of cricket terms#A|Ashes]] after holding them for 19 years. Barnes wrote ''Eyes on the Ashes'', a book about the tour that included trenchant criticism of the behaviour of the Australian team, which did not go down well with some of his former team-mates.<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\n==Style and personality==\nBarnes gripped the bat very low on the handle and bent over so far in his stance that the knuckles of his right hand were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary.<ref>Robinson, p. 78.</ref> His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.<ref>All of these terms are included in the [[List of cricket terms]].</ref>\n\nJournalist [[Ray Robinson (cricket writer)|Ray Robinson]] called Barnes the [[Artful Dodger]] of cricket, alluding to both his batting style and his off-field business dealings, and wrote that he \"would rather steal a run like a pickpocket than hit an honest four with a straightforward stroke.\"<ref>Robinson, p. 76.</ref> Robinson summarised his safety-first approach in going so far back as the bowler delivered:\n<blockquote>Though this routine made his play air-tight in one way, it simplified opposing captains' field-placing to curb his scoring, it left him with a back-foot addict's liability to go leg-before-wicket or be caught behind on either side, and it allowed his attackers to bowl their most awkward length&nbsp;... he could have made more runs since the war as a stroke-player, and won popular backing as a candidate for the title of world's best batsman, instead of the austere distinction of looking the hardest Australian to get out.<ref>Robinson, p. 79.</ref>\n</blockquote>\n[[David Frith]] wrote of [[Bill Brown (cricketer)|Bill Brown's]] memories of Barnes as a person, and his controversial fielding:\n<blockquote>\n'Bagga' Barnes was also Bill's room-mate, and his affection for his late lamented pal, a lovable rogue, was obvious. He recalled the furore over Barnes's provocative field positioning, extremely close at silly mid-on, and how criticism of his foot being too close to the mown pitch prompted him to plonk his boot a couple of feet into the forbidden territory \u2013 and a couple of feet more when the English crowd roared at him.<ref name=\"grandpa\"/></blockquote>\n\nHe was a part-time [[leg spin|leg break]] bowler, taking 57&nbsp;wickets in first-class cricket at a useful average of 32.21.<ref name=\"az\">Cashman, pp. 14\u201315.</ref> Barnes's leg break spun very little, but he had a [[topspinner]] which hurried onto the batsman and yielded him many wickets.<ref name=\"az\"/> Barnes was also a substitute wicket-keeper and a versatile fieldsman. During his career, he was noted for his disaffection for cricket administrators and umpires. On the 1948 tour of England, after an Australian [[appeal (cricket)|appeal]] was turned down by umpire [[Alec Skelding]], he grabbed a stray dog and presented it to Skelding, stating: \"Now all you want is a white stick\".<ref name=\"cricinfo\"/> A complex character, Barnes, \"rarely forgave a slight or forgot a good turn. Stocky, with blue eyes and powerful wrists, he had a passion for physical fitness, and was an enthusiastic big-game fisherman and golfer\".<ref name=\"adb\"/>\n\n==Life outside cricket==\n[[File:SidBarnesLaterLife.jpg|thumb|Barnes in later life]]\nBarnes married a schoolteacher, Alison Margaret Edward, on 11 June 1942. Alison was the daughter of Kenneth Edward, a [[Scottish people|Scottish]] [[Professor]] of [[Theology]] at the [[University of Sydney]]. The couple met at a country dance, when Barnes, on his way back from an [[exhibition match]] in [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]], was bet the price of the meal that he could not get the young girl to dance with him. Within twelve months the pair were married.<ref>Smith, p. 44.</ref>\n\nOutside of cricket, Barnes followed his mother into [[real-estate developer|property development]] (see [[Sid Barnes#Early years|above]]) and at various times entered into partnerships with [[Keith Miller]] and [[Norman Von Nida]]. His suspicious nature, which grew as time passed, saw these partnerships and developments end in arguments and recriminations. While Barnes was not a millionaire, he was a successful and organised businessman.<ref>Smith, pp. 195\u2013196.</ref>\n\nAs a writer, Barnes had no claims to literary talent; his copy was [[ghostwriter|ghost-written]], in all likelihood by his friend Jack Tier and later by former professional [[rugby league]] footballer [[Peter Peters]].<ref>Smith, pp. 185\u2013186.</ref> His writing was of a provocative tone; his column in the ''[[Daily Express]]'' during the 1953 tour was called \"The Aussie They Couldn't Gag\". His forthright opinions certainly cost him friends and hardened the opinions of others about him.<ref>Smith, pp. 183\u2013184.</ref> At the end of the 1953 tour, he published ''Eyes on the Ashes'', and his autobiography, ''It Isn't Cricket''. He also wrote ''The Ashes Ablaze'' in 1955, and turned to full-time writing, mostly for Sydney's ''[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]''. His columns were perceived as being deliberately controversial, and, as time went by, increasingly regarded as carping.<ref name=\"az\"/>\n\nIn later life, Barnes suffered from depressive illness. He was diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] and treated with a combination of medication, mainly [[diazepam]], and [[electroconvulsive therapy]]. He spent much of his last years in and out of clinics seeking treatment for his condition.<ref>Smith, pp. 204\u2013205.</ref> In 1973, Barnes died at his home in [[Collaroy, New South Wales|Collaroy]], one of Sydney's northern beach suburbs, from [[barbiturate]] and [[bromide]] poisoning. Although the medications were certainly self-administered, the [[coroner]] could not \"determine intent\".<ref name=\"adb\"/> \n{{Clear}}\n\n==Statistical analysis==\n{{Cricket batting averages (10 innings)}}\nOnly six players with ten or more completed innings have achieved an end of career average in excess of 60. Barnes's 63.05 in 19&nbsp;innings ranks him as number three in the history of Test cricket, behind Sir [[Donald Bradman]] (99.94, 80&nbsp;innings) and [[Stewie Dempster]] (65.72, 15&nbsp;innings).<ref>There is no consensus within cricket on what is the appropriate minimum number of innings required when comparing career averages, to avoid statistical quirks caused by players of very short careers. [[Andy Ganteaume]], for example, played just one Test and scored a century. In Cricinfo's statistical analysis of leading career averages, ([http://stats.cricinfo.com/ci/content/records/282910.html]) Barnes is omitted for having played just 19 (rather than the minimum of 20) innings. Likewise, there is no consensus on omitting current players, something which is done because when comparing career performances, most players experience a fall-off in average toward the end of their career; Cricinfo includes current players, including one ([[Mike Hussey]]) whose career average in December 2007 exceeded that of Barnes.</ref>\n\nBarnes's short career was dominated by his monumental double hundred, but he was a consistent performer, as the chart (left) reveals. Age did not seem to diminish his abilities; in his last eight Test innings, aged 31\u201332, he passed 50 five times and scored two of his three Test hundreds.<ref name=\"testlist\">{{cite web|url=http://stats.cricinfo.com/statsguru/engine/player/4098.html?class=1;template=results;type=allround;view=match |title= Statsguru \u2013 SG Barnes \u2013 Test matches \u2013 All-round analysis |accessdate=15 April 2008| publisher=[[Cricinfo]]}}</ref> [[File:Sid Barnes graph.png|thumb|left|300px|Sid Barnes's Test batting performances.

The remaining mass was discarded in the process of transport and landing.\n* '''Dimensions''': ''Curiosity'' has a mass of {{convert|899|kg|lb|abbr=on}} including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of scientific instruments.<ref name=\"MSLUSAToday\" /> The rover is {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.<ref name=\"cnes\" />\n[[File:Fueling of the MSL MMRTG 001.jpg|thumb|Radioisotope pellet within a graphite shell that fuels the generator]]\n* '''Power source''': ''Curiosity'' is powered by a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG), like the successful ''[[Viking 1]]'' and ''[[Viking 2]]'' Mars landers in 1976.<ref name=\"MMRTG\" /><ref name=\"MarsExplorationMMRTG\" />\n:Radioisotope power systems (RPSs) are generators that produce electricity from the decay of [[radioactive isotopes]], such as [[plutonium-238]], which is a non-[[fissile]] isotope of plutonium. Heat given off by the decay of this isotope is converted into electric voltage by [[thermocouple]]s, providing constant power during all seasons and through the day and night. [[Waste heat]] is also used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments.<ref name=\"MMRTG\" /><ref name=\"MarsExplorationMMRTG\" /> ''Curiosity''{{'s}} RTG is fueled by {{convert|4.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[Plutonium(IV) oxide|plutonium-238 dioxide]] supplied by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].<ref name=\"sfnow20111117\" />\n\n:''Curiosity'''s RTG is the [[Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator]] (MMRTG), designed and built by [[Rocketdyne]] and [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne Energy Systems]] under contract to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]],<ref name=\"Ritz2004\" /> and assembled and tested by the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Idaho2011\" /> Based on legacy RTG technology, it represents a more flexible and compact development step,<ref name=\"MSLPower\" /> and is designed to produce 110 watts of electrical power and about 2,000 watts of thermal power at the start of the mission.<ref name=\"MMRTG\" /><ref name=\"MarsExplorationMMRTG\" /> The MMRTG produces less power over time as its plutonium fuel decays: at its minimum lifetime of 14 years, electrical power output is down to 100 watts.<ref name=\"Mars Science Laboratory \u2013 Technologies of Broad Benefit: Power\" /><ref name=\"Overview of NASA Program on Development of Radioisotope Power Systems with High Specific Power\" /> The power source generates {{convert|9|MJ|kWh|abbr=on|lk=on}} of electrical energy each day, much more than the solar panels of the now retired [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, which generated about {{convert|2.1|MJ|kWh|abbr=on}} each day. The electrical output from the MMRTG charges two rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. This enables the power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the generator's steady output level. Each battery has a capacity of about 42&nbsp;[[ampere-hour]]s.\n* '''Heat rejection system''': The temperatures at the landing site can vary from {{convert|-127|to|40|C|F}}; therefore, the thermal system warms the rover for most of the Martian year. The thermal system does so in several ways: passively, through the dissipation to internal components; by electrical heaters strategically placed on key components; and by using the rover heat rejection system (HRS).<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> It uses fluid pumped through {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} of tubing in the rover body so that sensitive components are kept at optimal temperatures.<ref name=\"HRS\" /> The fluid loop serves the additional purpose of rejecting heat when the rover has become too warm, and it can also gather waste heat from the power source by pumping fluid through two heat exchangers that are mounted alongside the RTG. The HRS also has the ability to cool components if necessary.<ref name=\"HRS\" />\n* '''Computers''': The two identical on-board rover computers, called Rover Compute Element (RCE) contain [[Radiation hardening|radiation hardened]] memory to tolerate the extreme radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. The computers run the [[VxWorks]] [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS). Each computer's memory includes 256 [[Kilobyte|kB]] of [[EEPROM]], 256 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]], and 2 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[flash memory]].<ref name=\"Brains\" /> For comparison, the Mars Exploration Rovers used 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory.<ref name=\"ieeecomputer\" />\n\n:The RCE computers use the [[RAD750]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], which is a successor to the [[IBM RAD6000|RAD6000]] CPU of the Mars Exploration Rovers.<ref name=\"BAE Systems Computers to Manage Data Processing and Command For Upcoming Satellite Missions\" /><ref name=\"E&ISNow \u2014 Media gets closer look at Manassas\" /> The RAD750 CPU, a radiation-hardened version of the [[PowerPC 750]], can execute up to 400&nbsp;[[Million instructions per second|MIPS]], while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to only 35&nbsp;MIPS.<ref name=\"RAD750brochure\" /><ref name=\"RAD6000brochure\" /> Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup computer due to a problem with the active computer's flash memory, which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The backup computer was turned on in [[safe mode]] and subsequently returned to active status on March 4.<ref name=\"NASA-20130304\" /> The same problem happened in late March, resuming full operations on March 25, 2013.<ref name=\"NASA-20130325\" />\n:The rover has an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> The rover installed its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers did not have sufficient main memory available during flight. The new software essentially replaced the flight software.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n:The rover has four processors. One of them is a [[SPARC]] processor that runs the rover's thrusters and descent-stage motors as it descended through the Martian atmosphere. Two others are [[PowerPC]] processors: the main processor, which handles nearly all of the rover's ground functions, and that processor's backup. The fourth one, another [[SPARC]] processor, commands the rover's movement and is part of its [[motor controller]] box. All four processors are [[single-core|single core]].<ref name=\"Gaudin\" />\n\n[[File:PIA16106 - Curiosity speaks and orbiters listen.jpg|thumb|350px|''Curiosity'' transmits to Earth directly or via three relay satellites in Mars orbit.]]\n*'''Communications''': ''Curiosity'' is equipped with significant telecommunication redundancy by several means: an [[X band]] [[transponder (satellite communications)|transmitter and receiver]] that can communicate directly with Earth, and a UHF [[Electra (radio)|Electra]]-Lite [[software-defined radio]] for communicating with Mars orbiters.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> Communication with orbiters is the main path for data return to Earth, since the orbiters have both more power and larger antennas than the lander, allowing for faster transmission speeds.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> Telecommunication included a small deep space transponder on the descent stage and a solid-state power amplifier on the rover for [[X band]]. The rover also has two [[UHF]] radios,<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> the signals of which orbiting relay satellites are capable of relaying back to Earth. Signals between Earth and Mars take an average of 14 minutes, 6 seconds.<ref name=\"Mars-Earth distance in light minutes\" /> ''Curiosity'' can communicate with Earth directly at speeds up to 32&nbsp;kbit/s, but the bulk of the data transfer is being relayed through the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] and [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Odyssey orbiter]]. Data transfer speeds between ''Curiosity'' and each orbiter may reach 2000&nbsp;kbit/s and 256&nbsp;kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is able to communicate with ''Curiosity'' for only about eight minutes per day (0.56% of the time).<ref name=\"Curiosity's data communication with Earth\" /> Communication from and to ''Curiosity'' relies on internationally agreed space data [[communications protocol]]s as defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems.<ref name=\"aiaa.13350\" />\n\n:[[JPL]] is the central data distribution hub where selected data products are provided to remote science operations sites as needed. JPL is also the central hub for the uplink process, though participants are distributed at their respective home institutions.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> At landing, telemetry was monitored by three orbiters, depending on their dynamic location: the [[2001 Mars Odyssey]], [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] and ESA's [[Mars Express]] satellite.<ref name=\"ESA spacecraft records crucial NASA signals from Mars\" /> As of February 2019, the [[MAVEN]] orbiter is being positioned to serve as a relay orbiter while continuing its science mission.<ref name=\"relay orbit\" /> \n* '''Mobility systems''': ''Curiosity'' is equipped with six {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter wheels in a [[rocker-bogie]] suspension. The suspension system also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors.<ref name=\"new wheels\" /><ref name=\"nasa.build\" /> Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks.

Wind [[erosion]] then scoured out the sediments, leaving an isolated {{convert|5.5|km|mi|adj=mid|-high|sp=us}} mountain, [[Aeolis Mons]] (\"Mount Sharp\"), at the center of the {{convert|154|km|abbr=on}} wide crater. Thus, it is believed that the rover may have the opportunity to study two billion years of Martian history in the sediments exposed in the mountain. Additionally, its landing site is near an [[alluvial fan]], which is hypothesized to be the result of a flow of ground water, either before the deposition of the eroded sediments or else in relatively recent geologic history.<ref name=\"Crater mound a prize and puzzle for Mars rover\" /><ref name=\"themis\" />\n\nAccording to NASA, an estimated 20,000 to 40,000 heat-resistant [[bacterial spores]] were on ''Curiosity'' at launch, and as much as 1,000 times that number may not have been counted.<ref name=\"NYT-20151005-kc\" />\n\n{{wide image|PIA16056hl.jpg|1600px|align-cap=center|''Curiosity'' and surrounding area as viewed by [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter|MRO]]/[[HiRISE]]. North is left. (August 14, 2012; [[Mars surface color|enhanced colors]])}}\n\n=== Rover's role in the landing system ===\n<!--- This section is only about the rover-related aspects of the landing. The full entry, descent, and landing were accomplished by the MSL spacecraft descent stage, covered in the Mars Science Laboratory article.\n--->\n{{Main|Mars Science Laboratory#Entry, descent and landing (EDL)|l1=Mars Science Laboratory\u2013Landing}}\n[[File:Curiosity's Seven Minutes of Terror.ogv|thumb|NASA video describing the landing procedure. NASA dubbed the landing as \"Seven Minutes of Terror\".]]\n\nPrevious NASA [[Mars rovers]] became active only after the successful entry, descent and landing on the Martian surface. ''Curiosity'', on the other hand, was active when it touched down on the surface of Mars, employing the rover suspension system for the final set-down.<ref name=\"cnes3\" />\n\n''Curiosity'' transformed from its stowed flight configuration to a landing configuration while the MSL spacecraft simultaneously lowered it beneath the spacecraft descent stage with a {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} tether from the \"sky crane\" system to a soft landing\u2014wheels down\u2014on the surface of Mars.<ref name=\"EntryDescentLanding\" /><ref name=\"Sky Crane \u2013 how to land Curiosity on the surface of Mars\" /><ref name=\"Mars rover lands on Xbox Live\" /><ref name=\"Mars Science Laboratory: Entry, Descent, and Landing System Performance\" /> After the rover touched down it waited 2 seconds to confirm that it was on solid ground then fired several [[pyrotechnic fastener]]s activating cable cutters on the bridle to free itself from the spacecraft descent stage. The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing, and the rover prepared itself to begin the science portion of the mission.<ref name=\"ellipse\" />\n\n== Typical Day ==\nThe rover will stop and spend extended periods of time at major science waypoints. As of April 17, 2020, the rover has been driven on less than 800 out of 2736 [[Sol (day on Mars)|sols]] (Martian days).\n\nThe rover spends a lot of its time idle. \n\nCommunication with the rover is not instantaneous. There is a delay in transmitting commands to the rover, and there is a delay receiving imagery back from the rover. As a result, navigation is done by sending a command such as \"drive forward X distance\" or \"drive toward X place\", and the rover will use its cameras and computers to drive to those locations autonomously.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the rover was located 13.66 miles away from the landing site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://an.rsl.wustl.edu/msl/mslbrowser/an3.aspx|title=MSL Notebook - Curiosity Mars Rover data|website=an.rsl.wustl.edu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n== Coverage, cultural impact and legacy ==\n[[File:Cheering-full-br2.jpg|thumb|Celebration erupts at NASA with the rover's successful landing on Mars (August 6, 2012).]]\n[[File:President Obama Phones Mars Rover Team.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] congratulates NASA's ''Curiosity'' team (August 13, 2012).<ref name=\"NYT-20120813\" />]]\n\nLive video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available at [[NASA TV]], during the late hours of August 6, 2012 PDT, including interviews with the mission team.

Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. CheMin directs a beam of [[X-ray]]s at particles as small as {{convert|400|\u00b5m|sp=us}}<ref name=\"inxitu\" /> and reads the [[radiation]] [[scattering|scattered]] back to determine the composition of the artifact in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version named the ''X-Duetto''. Fitting into a few [[briefcase]]-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum [[antique]]s and the Roman ruins of [[Herculaneum]], Italy.<ref name=\"NS-201208\" />\n\nPrior to the landing, NASA and [[Microsoft]] released ''Mars Rover Landing'', a free downloadable game on [[Xbox Live]] that uses [[Kinect]] to capture body motions, which allows users to simulate the landing sequence.<ref name=\"newsday\" />\n\nNASA gave the general public the opportunity from 2009 until 2011 to submit their names to be sent to Mars. More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched into [[silicon]] using an electron-beam machine used for fabricating micro devices at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], and this plaque is now installed on the deck of ''Curiosity''.<ref name=\"Send Your Name to Mars\" /> In keeping with a 40-year tradition, a plaque with the signatures of President Barack Obama and [[Joe Biden|Vice President Joe Biden]] was also installed. Elsewhere on the rover is the [[autograph]] of Clara Ma, the 12-year-old girl from [[Kansas]] who gave ''Curiosity'' its name in an essay contest, writing in part that \"curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives.\"<ref name=\"collect\" />\n\nOn August 6, 2013, ''Curiosity'' audibly played \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" in honor of the one Earth year mark of its Martian landing, the first time for a song to be played on another planet. This was also the first time music was transmitted between two planets.<ref name=\"WP-20130806\" />\n\nOn June 24, 2014, ''Curiosity'' completed a [[Martian year]]\u2014687 Earth days\u2014after finding that Mars once had [[Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory#Evidence for ancient habitability|environmental conditions favorable for microbial life]].<ref name=\"NASA-20140623\" /> ''Curiosity'' serves as the basis for the design of the [[Mars 2020 rover mission]] that is planned to be launched to Mars in 2020.

This data would be important for a future [[Human mission to Mars|crewed mission]].<ref name=\"double\" />\n</li>\n</ol>\n\nAbout one year into the surface mission, and having assessed that ancient Mars could have been hospitable to microbial life, the MSL mission objectives evolved to developing predictive models for the preservation process of [[organic compound]]s and [[biomolecules]]; a branch of paleontology called [[taphonomy]].<ref name=\"Science 01-24-2014\" />\n\n== Specifications ==\n''Curiosity'' comprised 23% of the mass of the {{convert|3893|kg|lb|abbr=on}} spacecraft at launch. The remaining mass was discarded in the process of transport and landing.\n* '''Dimensions''': ''Curiosity'' has a mass of {{convert|899|kg|lb|abbr=on}} including {{convert|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of scientific instruments.<ref name=\"MSLUSAToday\" /> The rover is {{convert|2.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} long by {{convert|2.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} wide by {{convert|2.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} in height.<ref name=\"cnes\" />\n[[File:Fueling of the MSL MMRTG 001.jpg|thumb|Radioisotope pellet within a graphite shell that fuels the generator]]\n* '''Power source''': ''Curiosity'' is powered by a [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]] (RTG), like the successful ''[[Viking 1]]'' and ''[[Viking 2]]'' Mars landers in 1976.<ref name=\"MMRTG\" /><ref name=\"MarsExplorationMMRTG\" />\n:Radioisotope power systems (RPSs) are generators that produce electricity from the decay of [[radioactive isotopes]], such as [[plutonium-238]], which is a non-[[fissile]] isotope of plutonium. Heat given off by the decay of this isotope is converted into electric voltage by [[thermocouple]]s, providing constant power during all seasons and through the day and night. [[Waste heat]] is also used via pipes to warm systems, freeing electrical power for the operation of the vehicle and instruments.<ref name=\"MMRTG\" /><ref name=\"MarsExplorationMMRTG\" /> ''Curiosity''{{'s}} RTG is fueled by {{convert|4.8|kg|lb|abbr=on}} of [[Plutonium(IV) oxide|plutonium-238 dioxide]] supplied by the [[U.S. Department of Energy]].<ref name=\"sfnow20111117\" />\n\n:''Curiosity'''s RTG is the [[Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator]] (MMRTG), designed and built by [[Rocketdyne]] and [[Teledyne Technologies|Teledyne Energy Systems]] under contract to the [[United States Department of Energy|U.S. Department of Energy]],<ref name=\"Ritz2004\" /> and assembled and tested by the [[Idaho National Laboratory]].<ref name=\"Idaho2011\" /> Based on legacy RTG technology, it represents a more flexible and compact development step,<ref name=\"MSLPower\" /> and is designed to produce 110 watts of electrical power and about 2,000 watts of thermal power at the start of the mission.<ref name=\"MMRTG\" /><ref name=\"MarsExplorationMMRTG\" /> The MMRTG produces less power over time as its plutonium fuel decays: at its minimum lifetime of 14 years, electrical power output is down to 100 watts.<ref name=\"Mars Science Laboratory \u2013 Technologies of Broad Benefit: Power\" /><ref name=\"Overview of NASA Program on Development of Radioisotope Power Systems with High Specific Power\" /> The power source generates {{convert|9|MJ|kWh|abbr=on|lk=on}} of electrical energy each day, much more than the solar panels of the now retired [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, which generated about {{convert|2.1|MJ|kWh|abbr=on}} each day. The electrical output from the MMRTG charges two rechargeable [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. This enables the power subsystem to meet peak power demands of rover activities when the demand temporarily exceeds the generator's steady output level. Each battery has a capacity of about 42&nbsp;[[ampere-hour]]s.\n* '''Heat rejection system''': The temperatures at the landing site can vary from {{convert|-127|to|40|C|F}}; therefore, the thermal system warms the rover for most of the Martian year. The thermal system does so in several ways: passively, through the dissipation to internal components; by electrical heaters strategically placed on key components; and by using the rover heat rejection system (HRS).<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> It uses fluid pumped through {{convert|60|m|ft|abbr=on}} of tubing in the rover body so that sensitive components are kept at optimal temperatures.<ref name=\"HRS\" /> The fluid loop serves the additional purpose of rejecting heat when the rover has become too warm, and it can also gather waste heat from the power source by pumping fluid through two heat exchangers that are mounted alongside the RTG. The HRS also has the ability to cool components if necessary.<ref name=\"HRS\" />\n* '''Computers''': The two identical on-board rover computers, called Rover Compute Element (RCE) contain [[Radiation hardening|radiation hardened]] memory to tolerate the extreme radiation from space and to safeguard against power-off cycles. The computers run the [[VxWorks]] [[real-time operating system]] (RTOS). Each computer's memory includes 256 [[Kilobyte|kB]] of [[EEPROM]], 256 [[Megabyte|MB]] of [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]], and 2 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[flash memory]].<ref name=\"Brains\" /> For comparison, the Mars Exploration Rovers used 3 MB of EEPROM, 128 MB of DRAM, and 256 MB of flash memory.<ref name=\"ieeecomputer\" />\n\n:The RCE computers use the [[RAD750]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]], which is a successor to the [[IBM RAD6000|RAD6000]] CPU of the Mars Exploration Rovers.<ref name=\"BAE Systems Computers to Manage Data Processing and Command For Upcoming Satellite Missions\" /><ref name=\"E&ISNow \u2014 Media gets closer look at Manassas\" /> The RAD750 CPU, a radiation-hardened version of the [[PowerPC 750]], can execute up to 400&nbsp;[[Million instructions per second|MIPS]], while the RAD6000 CPU is capable of up to only 35&nbsp;MIPS.<ref name=\"RAD750brochure\" /><ref name=\"RAD6000brochure\" /> Of the two on-board computers, one is configured as backup and will take over in the event of problems with the main computer.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> On February 28, 2013, NASA was forced to switch to the backup computer due to a problem with the active computer's flash memory, which resulted in the computer continuously rebooting in a loop. The backup computer was turned on in [[safe mode]] and subsequently returned to active status on March 4.<ref name=\"NASA-20130304\" /> The same problem happened in late March, resuming full operations on March 25, 2013.<ref name=\"NASA-20130325\" />\n:The rover has an [[inertial measurement unit]] (IMU) that provides 3-axis information on its position, which is used in rover navigation.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> The rover's computers are constantly self-monitoring to keep the rover operational, such as by regulating the rover's temperature.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> Activities such as taking pictures, driving, and operating the instruments are performed in a command sequence that is sent from the flight team to the rover.<ref name=\"Brains\" /> The rover installed its full surface operations software after the landing because its computers did not have sufficient main memory available during flight. The new software essentially replaced the flight software.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" />\n:The rover has four processors. One of them is a [[SPARC]] processor that runs the rover's thrusters and descent-stage motors as it descended through the Martian atmosphere. Two others are [[PowerPC]] processors: the main processor, which handles nearly all of the rover's ground functions, and that processor's backup. The fourth one, another [[SPARC]] processor, commands the rover's movement and is part of its [[motor controller]] box. All four processors are [[single-core|single core]].<ref name=\"Gaudin\" />\n\n[[File:PIA16106 - Curiosity speaks and orbiters listen.jpg|thumb|350px|''Curiosity'' transmits to Earth directly or via three relay satellites in Mars orbit.]]\n*'''Communications''': ''Curiosity'' is equipped with significant telecommunication redundancy by several means: an [[X band]] [[transponder (satellite communications)|transmitter and receiver]] that can communicate directly with Earth, and a UHF [[Electra (radio)|Electra]]-Lite [[software-defined radio]] for communicating with Mars orbiters.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> Communication with orbiters is the main path for data return to Earth, since the orbiters have both more power and larger antennas than the lander, allowing for faster transmission speeds.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> Telecommunication included a small deep space transponder on the descent stage and a solid-state power amplifier on the rover for [[X band]]. The rover also has two [[UHF]] radios,<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> the signals of which orbiting relay satellites are capable of relaying back to Earth. Signals between Earth and Mars take an average of 14 minutes, 6 seconds.<ref name=\"Mars-Earth distance in light minutes\" /> ''Curiosity'' can communicate with Earth directly at speeds up to 32&nbsp;kbit/s, but the bulk of the data transfer is being relayed through the [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] and [[2001 Mars Odyssey|Odyssey orbiter]]. Data transfer speeds between ''Curiosity'' and each orbiter may reach 2000&nbsp;kbit/s and 256&nbsp;kbit/s, respectively, but each orbiter is able to communicate with ''Curiosity'' for only about eight minutes per day (0.56% of the time).<ref name=\"Curiosity's data communication with Earth\" /> Communication from and to ''Curiosity'' relies on internationally agreed space data [[communications protocol]]s as defined by the Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems.<ref name=\"aiaa.13350\" />\n\n:[[JPL]] is the central data distribution hub where selected data products are provided to remote science operations sites as needed. JPL is also the central hub for the uplink process, though participants are distributed at their respective home institutions.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> At landing, telemetry was monitored by three orbiters, depending on their dynamic location: the [[2001 Mars Odyssey]], [[Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter]] and ESA's [[Mars Express]] satellite.<ref name=\"ESA spacecraft records crucial NASA signals from Mars\" /> As of February 2019, the [[MAVEN]] orbiter is being positioned to serve as a relay orbiter while continuing its science mission.<ref name=\"relay orbit\" /> \n* '''Mobility systems''': ''Curiosity'' is equipped with six {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}} diameter wheels in a [[rocker-bogie]] suspension. The suspension system also served as landing gear for the vehicle, unlike its smaller predecessors.<ref name=\"new wheels\" /><ref name=\"nasa.build\" /> Each wheel has cleats and is independently actuated and geared, providing for climbing in soft sand and scrambling over rocks. Each front and rear wheel can be independently steered, allowing the vehicle to turn in place as well as execute arcing turns.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> Each wheel has a pattern that helps it maintain traction but also leaves patterned tracks in the sandy surface of Mars. That pattern is used by on-board cameras to estimate the distance traveled. The pattern itself is [[Morse code]] for \"JPL\" (\u00b7--- \u00b7--\u00b7 \u00b7-\u00b7\u00b7).<ref name=\"aarlmorse\" /> The rover is capable of climbing sand dunes with slopes up to 12.5\u00b0.<ref name=\"nasa.249\" /> Based on the [[center of mass]], the vehicle can withstand a tilt of at least 50\u00b0 in any direction without overturning, but automatic sensors limit the rover from exceeding 30\u00b0 tilts.<ref name=\"DESCANSO\" /> After six years of use, the wheels are visibly worn with punctures and tears.<ref name=\"planetary20140819\" />\n\n:''Curiosity'' can roll over obstacles approaching {{convert|65|cm|in|abbr=on}} in height,<ref name=\"facts\" /> and it has a ground clearance of {{convert|60|cm|in|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"first drive\" /> Based on variables including power levels, terrain difficulty, slippage and visibility, the maximum terrain-traverse speed is estimated to be {{convert|200|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day by automatic navigation.<ref name=\"facts\" /> The rover landed about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} from the base of Mount Sharp,<ref name=\"stuff-7437621\" /> (officially named [[Aeolis Mons]]) and it is expected to traverse a minimum of {{convert|19|km|mi|abbr=on}} during its primary two-year mission.<ref name=\"home\" /> It can travel up to {{convert|90|m|ft|abbr=on}} per hour but average speed is about {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} per hour.<ref name=\"home\" /> The vehicle is 'driven' by several operators led by [[Vandi Verma]], group leader of Autonomous Systems, Mobility and Robotic Systems at JPL,<ref name=\"rg2019\" /><ref name=\"jpl2019\" /> who also cowrote the [[PLEXIL]] language used to operate the rover.<ref name=\"ntrs2019\" /><ref name=\"plex2019\" /><ref name=\"nasaapps\" />\n\n== Instruments ==\n[[File:Drawing-of-the-Mars-Science Laboratory.png|thumb|350px|Instrument location diagram]]\nThe general sample analysis strategy begins with high-resolution cameras to look for features of interest.

The descent stage then flew away to a crash landing, and the rover prepared itself to begin the science portion of the mission.<ref name=\"ellipse\" />\n\n== Typical Day ==\nThe rover will stop and spend extended periods of time at major science waypoints. As of April 17, 2020, the rover has been driven on less than 800 out of 2736 [[Sol (day on Mars)|sols]] (Martian days).\n\nThe rover spends a lot of its time idle. \n\nCommunication with the rover is not instantaneous. There is a delay in transmitting commands to the rover, and there is a delay receiving imagery back from the rover. As a result, navigation is done by sending a command such as \"drive forward X distance\" or \"drive toward X place\", and the rover will use its cameras and computers to drive to those locations autonomously.\n\nOn April 16, 2020, the rover was located 13.66 miles away from the landing site.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://an.rsl.wustl.edu/msl/mslbrowser/an3.aspx|title=MSL Notebook - Curiosity Mars Rover data|website=an.rsl.wustl.edu|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref>\n\n== Coverage, cultural impact and legacy ==\n[[File:Cheering-full-br2.jpg|thumb|Celebration erupts at NASA with the rover's successful landing on Mars (August 6, 2012).]]\n[[File:President Obama Phones Mars Rover Team.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] congratulates NASA's ''Curiosity'' team (August 13, 2012).<ref name=\"NYT-20120813\" />]]\n\nLive video showing the first footage from the surface of Mars was available at [[NASA TV]], during the late hours of August 6, 2012 PDT, including interviews with the mission team.

Until recently, only a few instruments were available to determine the composition without cutting out physical samples large enough to potentially damage the artifacts. CheMin directs a beam of [[X-ray]]s at particles as small as {{convert|400|\u00b5m|sp=us}}<ref name=\"inxitu\" /> and reads the [[radiation]] [[scattering|scattered]] back to determine the composition of the artifact in minutes. Engineers created a smaller, portable version named the ''X-Duetto''. Fitting into a few [[briefcase]]-sized boxes, it can examine objects on site, while preserving their physical integrity. It is now being used by Getty scientists to analyze a large collection of museum [[antique]]s and the Roman ruins of [[Herculaneum]], Italy.<ref name=\"NS-201208\" />\n\nPrior to the landing, NASA and [[Microsoft]] released ''Mars Rover Landing'', a free downloadable game on [[Xbox Live]] that uses [[Kinect]] to capture body motions, which allows users to simulate the landing sequence.<ref name=\"newsday\" />\n\nNASA gave the general public the opportunity from 2009 until 2011 to submit their names to be sent to Mars. More than 1.2 million people from the international community participated, and their names were etched into [[silicon]] using an electron-beam machine used for fabricating micro devices at [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory|JPL]], and this plaque is now installed on the deck of ''Curiosity''.<ref name=\"Send Your Name to Mars\" /> In keeping with a 40-year tradition, a plaque with the signatures of President Barack Obama and [[Joe Biden|Vice President Joe Biden]] was also installed. Elsewhere on the rover is the [[autograph]] of Clara Ma, the 12-year-old girl from [[Kansas]] who gave ''Curiosity'' its name in an essay contest, writing in part that \"curiosity is the passion that drives us through our everyday lives.\"<ref name=\"collect\" />\n\nOn August 6, 2013, ''Curiosity'' audibly played \"[[Happy Birthday to You]]\" in honor of the one Earth year mark of its Martian landing, the first time for a song to be played on another planet. This was also the first time music was transmitted between two planets.<ref name=\"WP-20130806\" />\n\nOn June 24, 2014, ''Curiosity'' completed a [[Martian year]]\u2014687 Earth days\u2014after finding that Mars once had [[Timeline of Mars Science Laboratory#Evidence for ancient habitability|environmental conditions favorable for microbial life]].<ref name=\"NASA-20140623\" /> ''Curiosity'' serves as the basis for the design of the [[Mars 2020 rover mission]] that is planned to be launched to Mars in 2020.

{"title_page": "Colony cheese", "text_new": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Colony cheese.jpg|thumb|Colony cheese]]\n'''Colony cheese''' ({{lang-pt|'''queijo de col\u00f4nia'''}}, {{IPA-pt|\u02c8kej\u0292u d\u0292i ko\u02c8l\u00f5nj\u0250|pron}}) is a type of cheese made in the highlands of the Brazilian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]]. It is one of the icons of southern Brazilian cuisine, also being produced in [[Santa Catarina (state)|Santa Catarina]], despite being originally from Uruguay.\n\n== Production ==\n\nThis cheese is made by artisan production, usually in rural areas of the highlands, especially in regions settled by [[German-Brazilian|German]] and Italian immigrants who starting almost two hundred years ago brought with them their cheese-making traditions. It has low production cost, due to its simple manufacturing process, consisting mainly of [[milk]], salt and milk enzymes. It typically goes through a maturation process that can take several months. The aging gives the cheese its most striking feature: a soft, slightly spicy inside, complex flavor and surrounded by a solid yellow crust. The older the cheese gets, bigger and harder its crust get, making the taste of this product more pungent and striking.\n\nThere can be a formation of small white [[Mold (fungus)|mold]] in its external part, but that does not affect the quality of the product. This problem can be solved by storing it in environments of low relative humidity. Usually this cheese is consumed accompanied by red [[wine]]s, or it can also be used for cooking, especially in [[pizza]]s, lasagnas and other [[pasta]]s.\n\n==Features==\n\nDescription: mildly spicy, lactic-tasting, close dough, pale yellow colour. Produced without the use of dyes or [[preservative]]s.\nConsistency: hard or semi-hard outside. Soft, fairly creamy inside, showing good elasticity. Easily sliced and well melted when subjected to heat.\n\nShape: cylindrical and flat, weighing from {{convert|800|g|abbr=on}} to {{convert|4|kg|abbr=on}}.\n\n==History==\n\nJuan Te\u00f3filo Karlen originally brought this cheese to the Swiss colony [[Nueva Helvecia]], located [[Colonia Department|Colonia]] Uruguay, therefore its name.\n\n== See also ==\n*[[German-Brazilian]]\n*[[List of Brazilian dishes]]\n*[[Riograndenser Hunsr\u00fcckisch]]\n* [[List of cheeses]]\n\n==Sources==\n* https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q28777824\n\n{{Brazilian cheeses}}\n\n[[Category:Brazilian cheeses]]\n[[Category:Cow's-milk cheeses]]\n\n\n{{Brazil-cuisine-stub}}\n", "text_old": "{{unreferenced|date=October 2011}}\n[[File:Colony cheese.jpg|thumb|Colony cheese]]\n'''Colony cheese''' ({{lang-pt|'''queijo de col\u00f4nia'''}}, {{IPA-pt|\u02c8kej\u0292u d\u0292i ko\u02c8l\u00f5nj\u0250|pron}}) is a type of cheese made in the highlands of the Brazilian state of [[Rio Grande do Sul]].
