Nature abounds with organosulfur compounds\u2014sulfur is essential for life. Of the 20 common [[amino acids]], two ([[cysteine]] and [[methionine]]) are organosulfur compounds, and the antibiotics [[penicillin]] and [[sulfa drugs]] both contain sulfur. While sulfur-containing antibiotics save many lives, [[sulfur mustard]] is a deadly chemical warfare agent. Fossil fuels, [[coal]], [[petroleum]], and [[natural gas]], which are derived from ancient organisms, necessarily contain organosulfur compounds, [[Desulfurization|the removal]] of which is a [[Claus process|major focus]] of [[oil refineries]].\n\nSulfur shares the [[chalcogen]] group with [[oxygen]], [[selenium]], and [[tellurium]], and it is expected that organosulfur compounds have similarities with carbon\u2013oxygen, carbon\u2013selenium, and carbon\u2013tellurium compounds.\n\nA classical [[chemical test]] for the detection of sulfur compounds is the [[Carius halogen method]].\n\n==Classes==\nOrganosulfur compounds can be classified according to the sulfur-containing [[functional group]]s, which are listed (approximately) in decreasing order of their occurrence.\n<gallery caption=\"Illustrative organosulfur compounds\" perrow=\"6\">\nImage:R-allicin-2D-skeletal.png|[[Allicin]], the active flavor compound in crushed garlic\nImage:Cysteine.svg| (''R'')-[[Cysteine]], an [[amino acid]] containing a thiol group\nImage:Methionin - Methionine.svg|[[Methionine]], an [[amino acid]] containing a sulfide\nImage:Diphenyl disulfide.png|[[Diphenyl disulfide]], a representative disulfide\nImage:Dibenzothiophen - Dibenzothiophene.svg|[[Dibenzothiophene]], a component of crude oil \nImage:Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid.png|[[Perfluorooctanesulfonic acid]], a controversial surfactant\nImage:Lipoic-acid-2D-skeletal.png|[[Lipoic acid]], an essential cofactor of four mitochondrial enzyme complexes.\nImage:Penicillin core.svg|[[Penicillin]] core structure, where \"R\" is the variable group.\nimage:Sulfanilamide-skeletal.svg|[[Sulfanilamide]], a [[sulfonamide (chemistry)|sulfonamide]] [[antibacterial]], called a [[sulfa drug]].\nImage:Sulfur-mustard-2D-skeletal.png|[[Sulfur mustard]], a type of sulfide used as a [[chemical warfare agent]].\nImage:MartinSulfurane.svg|[[Martin's sulfurane]] with a see-saw structure, like that of SF<sub>4</sub><ref>{{OrgSynth|first1=J.

Representative [[bond length]]s in sulfur compounds are 183&nbsp;[[picometer|pm]] for the S\u2212C single bond in [[methanethiol]] and 173&nbsp;pm in [[thiophene]]. The C\u2212S [[bond dissociation energy]] for thiomethane is 89&nbsp;kcal/mol (370&nbsp;kJ/mol) compared to methane's 100&nbsp;kcal/mol (420&nbsp;kJ/mol) and when hydrogen is replaced by a methyl group the energy decreases to 73&nbsp;kcal/mol (305&nbsp;kJ/mol).<ref>{{cite book|title=[[Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]|edition=81st|publisher=CRC Press|ISBN=0-8493-0481-4}}</ref> The single [[carbon\u2013oxygen bond|carbon to oxygen bond]] is shorter than that of the C\u2212C bond. The [[bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]] for [[dimethyl sulfide]] and [[dimethyl ether]] are respectively 73 and 77&nbsp;kcal/mol (305 and 322&nbsp;kJ/mol).\n\nSulfides are typically prepared by [[alkylation]] of thiols. They can also be prepared via the [[Pummerer rearrangement]]. In one [[named reaction]] called the '''Ferrario reaction''' [[phenyl ether]] is converted to ''phenoxathiin'' by action of elemental sulfur and [[aluminium chloride]].<ref>{{OrgSynth|title=Phenoxthin [Phenoxathiin]|last1=Suter|first1=C. M.|last2=Maxwell|first2=Charles E.|collvol=2|collvolpages=485|volume=18|page=64|date=1938|prep=CV2P0485|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.018.0064}}</ref>\n\n:[[File:FerrarioReaction.png|400px|Ferrario reaction]]\n\n[[Thioacetal]]s and [[thioketal]]s feature C\u2212S\u2212C\u2212S\u2212C bond sequence. They represent a subclass of sulfides. The thioacetals are useful in \"[[umpolung]]\" of carbonyl groups. Thioacetals and thioketals can also be used to protect a carbonyl group in organic syntheses.\n\nThe above classes of sulfur compounds also exist in saturated and unsaturated [[heterocyclic]] structures, often in combination with other [[heteroatoms]], as illustrated by [[thiirane]]s, [[thiirene]]s, [[thietane]]s, [[thiete]]s, [[dithietane]]s, [[thiolane]]s, [[thiane]]s, [[dithiane]]s, [[thiepane]]s, [[thiepine]]s, [[thiazole]]s, [[isothiazole]]s, and [[thiophene]]s, among others. The latter three compounds represent a special class of sulfur-containing heterocycles that are [[aromatic]]. The [[resonance stabilization]] of [[thiophene]] is 29&nbsp;kcal/mol (121&nbsp;kJ/mol) compared to 20&nbsp;kcal/mol (84&nbsp;kJ/mol) for the oxygen analogue [[furan]]. The reason for this difference is the higher [[electronegativity]] for oxygen drawing away electrons to itself at the expense of the aromatic ring current. Yet as an aromatic [[substituent]] the thio group is less electron-releasing than the alkoxy group. [[Dibenzothiophene]]s (see drawing), tricyclic heterocycles consisting of two benzene rings fused to a central thiophene ring, occurs widely in heavier fractions of petroleum.\n\n===Thiols, disulfides, polysulfides===\n[[Thiol]] group contain the functionality R\u2212SH. Thiols are structurally similar to the [[alcohol]] group, but these functionalities are very different in their chemical properties. Thiols are more [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]], more acidic, and more readily oxidized. This acidity can differ by 5 [[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] units.<ref>{{cite book|first=R. J.|last=Cremlyn|title=An Introduction to Organosulfur Chemistry|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Chichester|date=1996|ISBN=0-471-95512-4}}</ref>\n\nThe difference in [[electronegativity]] between sulfur (2.58) and hydrogen (2.20) is small and therefore [[hydrogen bonding]] in thiols is not prominent. Aliphatic thiols form [[monolayer]]s on [[gold]], which are topical in [[nanotechnology]].\n\nCertain aromatic thiols can be accessed through a [[Herz reaction]].\n\n[[Disulfide bond|Disulfides]] R\u2212S\u2212S\u2212R with a covalent sulfur to sulfur bond are important for [[Cross-link|crosslinking]]: in [[biochemistry]] for the folding and stability of some proteins and in [[polymer chemistry]] for the crosslinking of rubber.\n\nLonger sulfur chains are also known, such as in the natural product [[varacin]] which contains an unusual pentathiepin ring (5-sulfur chain cyclised onto a benzene ring).\n\n===Thioesters===\n[[Thioester]]s have general structure R\u2212C(O)\u2212S\u2212R. They are related to regular esters (R\u2212C(O)\u2212O\u2212R) but are more susceptible to hydrolysis and related reactions.  Thioesters are prominent in biochemistry, especially in [[fatty acid]] synthesis.\n\n===Sulfoxides, sulfones and thiosulfinates===\nA [[sulfoxide]], R\u2212S(O)\u2212R, is the ''S''-oxide of a sulfide (\"sulfide oxide\"), a [[sulfone]], R\u2212S(O)<sub>2</sub>\u2212R, is the ''S'',''S''-dioxide of a sulfide, a [[thiosulfinate]], R\u2212S(O)\u2212S\u2212R, is the ''S''-oxide of a disulfide, and a thiosulfonate, R\u2212S(O)<sub>2</sub>\u2212S\u2212R, is the ''S'',''S''-dioxide of a disulfide. All of these compounds are well known with extensive chemistry, e.g., [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], [[dimethyl sulfone]], and [[allicin]] (see drawing).\n\n===Sulfimides, sulfoximides, sulfonediimines===\nSulfimides (also called a sulfilimines) are sulfur\u2013nitrogen compounds of structure R<sub>2</sub>S=NR\u2032, the nitrogen analog of sulfoxides.

Compounds like [[allicin]] and [[ajoene]] are responsible for the odor of [[garlic]], and [[lenthionine]] contributes to the flavor of [[shiitake mushrooms]]. Volatile organosulfur compounds also contribute subtle flavor characteristics to [[wine]], nuts, [[cheddar cheese]], [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], and tropical fruit flavors.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Qian|editor1-first= M.

In this latter context, organosulfur compounds may be said to account for the pollutants in sulfurous [[acid rain]], or equivalently, said to be pollutants within most common fossil fuels, especially [[coal]].\n\nThe most common organosulfur compound present in all petroleum fractions is [[thiophene]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>S), a cyclic and aromatic liquid. In addition, the heavy fractions of oil contain [[benzothiophene]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>S, thianaphtene) and [[dibenzothiophene]]. Most of the last compounds are solids and smell like naphthalene. Many methylated, dimethyl, diethyl benzothiophene derivatives are present in diesel and fuel oils which make fuel oils very difficult to clean.\n\nAll these heterocyclic sulfides account for 200\u2013500&nbsp;ppm of natural fuel, the heavily substituted dibenzothiophenes remain after HDS and account for 10\u201320&nbsp;ppm. These molecules are also found in coals and they must be eliminated before consumption.\n\nReduced molybdenum together with nickel is currently used to eliminate thiophenes from petroleum (HDS) due to its great affinity towards sulfur.\nIn addition tungsten together with nickel and cobalt is used for [[hydrodesulfurization]] (HDS) in large refineries. The adsorption mechanism of thiophene to transition metals is proposed to occur through the \u03c0 system, where the organosulfur compound lies almost parallel to the metal surface.\nMany researchers focus their efforts in optimizing the oxidation state of the transition metals for HDS, like Cu(I) and Ag(II) which together with Pd(0) have proven to be more specific for \u03c0 bonding with thiophenes of all kinds.\n\n===Basis for odor===\nHumans and other animals have an exquisitely sensitive sense of smell toward the [[odor]] of low-valent organosulfur compounds such as thiols, sulfides, and disulfides. Malodorous volatile thiols are protein-degradation products found in putrid food, so sensitive identification of these compounds is crucial to avoiding intoxication. Low-valent volatile sulfur compounds are also found in areas where oxygen levels in the air are low, posing a risk of suffocation. It has been found that copper is required for the highly sensitive detection of certain volatile thiols and related organosulfur compounds by olfactory receptors in mice. Whether humans, too, require copper for sensitive detection of thiols is not yet known.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Duan | first1 = X. | last2 = Block | first2 = E. | last3 = Li | first3 = Z. | last4 = Connelly | first4 = T. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = J. | last6 = Huang | first6 = Z. | last7 = Su | first7 = X. | last8 = Pan | first8 = Y. | last9 = Wu | first9 = L. | last10 = Chi | first10 = Q. | last11 = Thomas | first11 = S. | last12 = Zhang | first12 = S. | last13 = Ma | first13 = M. | last14 = Matsunami | first14 = H. | last15 = Chen | first15 = G.-Q. | last16 = Zhang | first16 = H. | title = Crucial role of copper in detection of metal-coordinating odorants. | url = | journal = Proc.

Nature abounds with organosulfur compounds\u2014sulfur is essential for life. Of the 20 common [[amino acids]], two ([[cysteine]] and [[methionine]]) are organosulfur compounds, and the antibiotics [[penicillin]] and [[sulfa drugs]] both contain sulfur. While sulfur-containing antibiotics save many lives, [[sulfur mustard]] is a deadly chemical warfare agent.

The [[bond dissociation energy|bond dissociation energies]] for [[dimethyl sulfide]] and [[dimethyl ether]] are respectively 73 and 77&nbsp;kcal/mol (305 and 322&nbsp;kJ/mol).\n\nSulfides are typically prepared by [[alkylation]] of thiols. They can also be prepared via the [[Pummerer rearrangement]]. In one [[named reaction]] called the '''Ferrario reaction''' [[phenyl ether]] is converted to ''phenoxathiin'' by action of elemental sulfur and [[aluminium chloride]].<ref>{{OrgSynth|title=Phenoxthin [Phenoxathiin]|last1=Suter|first1=C. M.|last2=Maxwell|first2=Charles E.|collvol=2|collvolpages=485|volume=18|page=64|date=1938|prep=CV2P0485|doi=10.15227/orgsyn.018.0064}}</ref>\n\n:[[File:FerrarioReaction.png|400px|Ferrario reaction]]\n\n[[Thioacetal]]s and [[thioketal]]s feature C\u2212S\u2212C\u2212S\u2212C bond sequence. They represent a subclass of sulfides. The thioacetals are useful in \"[[umpolung]]\" of carbonyl groups. Thioacetals and thioketals can also be used to protect a carbonyl group in organic syntheses.\n\nThe above classes of sulfur compounds also exist in saturated and unsaturated [[heterocyclic]] structures, often in combination with other [[heteroatoms]], as illustrated by [[thiirane]]s, [[thiirene]]s, [[thietane]]s, [[thiete]]s, [[dithietane]]s, [[thiolane]]s, [[thiane]]s, [[dithiane]]s, [[thiepane]]s, [[thiepine]]s, [[thiazole]]s, [[isothiazole]]s, and [[thiophene]]s, among others. The latter three compounds represent a special class of sulfur-containing heterocycles that are [[aromatic]]. The [[resonance stabilization]] of [[thiophene]] is 29&nbsp;kcal/mol (121&nbsp;kJ/mol) compared to 20&nbsp;kcal/mol (84&nbsp;kJ/mol) for the oxygen analogue [[furan]]. The reason for this difference is the higher [[electronegativity]] for oxygen drawing away electrons to itself at the expense of the aromatic ring current. Yet as an aromatic [[substituent]] the thio group is less electron-releasing than the alkoxy group. [[Dibenzothiophene]]s (see drawing), tricyclic heterocycles consisting of two benzene rings fused to a central thiophene ring, occurs widely in heavier fractions of petroleum.\n\n===Thiols, disulfides, polysulfides===\n[[Thiol]] group contain the functionality R\u2212SH. Thiols are structurally similar to the [[alcohol]] group, but these functionalities are very different in their chemical properties. Thiols are more [[nucleophile|nucleophilic]], more acidic, and more readily oxidized. This acidity can differ by 5 [[pKa|p''K''<sub>a</sub>]] units.<ref>{{cite book|first=R. J.|last=Cremlyn|title=An Introduction to Organosulfur Chemistry|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Chichester|date=1996|ISBN=0-471-95512-4}}</ref>\n\nThe difference in [[electronegativity]] between sulfur (2.58) and hydrogen (2.20) is small and therefore [[hydrogen bonding]] in thiols is not prominent. Aliphatic thiols form [[monolayer]]s on [[gold]], which are topical in [[nanotechnology]].\n\nCertain aromatic thiols can be accessed through a [[Herz reaction]].\n\n[[Disulfide bond|Disulfides]] R\u2212S\u2212S\u2212R with a covalent sulfur to sulfur bond are important for [[Cross-link|crosslinking]]: in [[biochemistry]] for the folding and stability of some proteins and in [[polymer chemistry]] for the crosslinking of rubber.\n\nLonger sulfur chains are also known, such as in the natural product [[varacin]] which contains an unusual pentathiepin ring (5-sulfur chain cyclised onto a benzene ring).\n\n===Thioesters===\n[[Thioester]]s have general structure R\u2212C(O)\u2212S\u2212R. They are related to regular esters (R\u2212C(O)\u2212O\u2212R) but are more susceptible to hydrolysis and related reactions.  Thioesters are prominent in biochemistry, especially in [[fatty acid]] synthesis.\n\n===Sulfoxides, sulfones and thiosulfinates===\nA [[sulfoxide]], R\u2212S(O)\u2212R, is the ''S''-oxide of a sulfide (\"sulfide oxide\"), a [[sulfone]], R\u2212S(O)<sub>2</sub>\u2212R, is the ''S'',''S''-dioxide of a sulfide, a [[thiosulfinate]], R\u2212S(O)\u2212S\u2212R, is the ''S''-oxide of a disulfide, and a thiosulfonate, R\u2212S(O)<sub>2</sub>\u2212S\u2212R, is the ''S'',''S''-dioxide of a disulfide. All of these compounds are well known with extensive chemistry, e.g., [[dimethyl sulfoxide]], [[dimethyl sulfone]], and [[allicin]] (see drawing).\n\n===Sulfimides, sulfoximides, sulfonediimines===\nSulfimides (also called a sulfilimines) are sulfur\u2013nitrogen compounds of structure R<sub>2</sub>S=NR\u2032, the nitrogen analog of sulfoxides.

In the series sulfonic\u2014sulfinic\u2014sulfenic acids, both the acid strength and stability diminish in that order.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last=Braverman |first=S. |last2=Cherkinsky|first2= M.| editor-last = Kambe|editor-first= N. |last3=Levinger|first3= S. |title=Alkanesulfinic Acids and Salts |encyclopedia=Science of Synthesis|publisher=Thieme |year=2008 |volume=39 |pages=196\u2013211|isbn = 978-1-58890-530-7}}</ref><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|last1=Drabowicz|first1= J. |last2=Kie\u0142basi\u0144ski|first2= P. |last3=\u0141y\u017cwa|first3= P. |last4=Zaj\u0105c|first4= A. |last5=Miko\u0142ajczyk|first5= M. | editor-last = Kambe|editor-first= N. | year = 2008 | title = Alkanesulfenic Acids | encyclopedia=Science of Synthesis|publisher=Thieme | volume = 39 | pages = 550\u2013557 | isbn = 978-1-58890-530-7}}</ref> Sulfonamides, [[sulfinamide]]s and [[sulfenamide]]s, with formulas R\u2212SO<sub>2</sub>NR\u2032<sub>2</sub>, R\u2212S(O)NR\u2032<sub>2</sub>, and R\u2212SNR\u2032<sub>2</sub>, respectively, each have a rich chemistry. For example, [[sulfa drug]]s are sulfonamides derived from [[aromatic sulfonation]]. Chiral sulfinamides are used in asymmetric synthesis, while sulfenamides are used extensively in the vulcanization process to assist cross-linking. [[Thiocyanate]]s, R\u2212S\u2212CN, are related to sulfenyl halides and esters in terms of reactivity.\n\n===Sulfonium, oxosulfonium and related salts===\nA [[sulfonium ion]] is a positively charged ion featuring three organic substituents attached to sulfur, with the formula [R<sub>3</sub>S]<sup>+</sup>. Together with their negatively charged counterpart, the anion, the compounds are called sulfonium salts. An oxosulfonium ion is a positively charged ion featuring three organic substituents and an oxygen attached to sulfur, with the formula [R<sub>3</sub>S=O]<sup>+</sup>. Together with their negatively charged counterpart, the anion, the compounds are called oxosulfonium salts.

While [[sulfonium ylide]]s, for instance in the [[Johnson\u2013Corey\u2013Chaykovsky reaction]] used to synthesize [[oxirane]]s, are sometimes drawn with a C=S double bond, e.g., R<sub>2</sub>S=CR\u2032<sub>2</sub>, the ylidic carbon\u2013sulfur bond is highly polarized and is better described as being ionic. Sulfonium ylides are key intermediates in the synthetically useful [[Stevens rearrangement]]. Thiocarbonyl ylides (RR\u2032C=S<sup>+</sup>\u2212C<sup>\u2212</sup>\u2212RR\u2032) can form by ring-opening of [[thiirane]]s, photocyclization of aryl vinyl sulfides,<ref>{{cite journal|title=Thiocarbonyl ylides.

[[Gliotoxin]] is a sulfur-containing [[mycotoxin]] produced by several species of fungi under investigation as an [[antiviral drug|antiviral]] agent. Compounds like [[allicin]] and [[ajoene]] are responsible for the odor of [[garlic]], and [[lenthionine]] contributes to the flavor of [[shiitake mushrooms]]. Volatile organosulfur compounds also contribute subtle flavor characteristics to [[wine]], nuts, [[cheddar cheese]], [[chocolate]], [[coffee]], and tropical fruit flavors.<ref>{{cite book|editor1-last=Qian|editor1-first= M.

In this latter context, organosulfur compounds may be said to account for the pollutants in sulfurous [[acid rain]], or equivalently, said to be pollutants within most common fossil fuels, especially [[coal]].\n\nThe most common organosulfur compound present in all petroleum fractions is [[thiophene]] (C<sub>4</sub>H<sub>4</sub>S), a cyclic and aromatic liquid. In addition, the heavy fractions of oil contain [[benzothiophene]] (C<sub>8</sub>H<sub>6</sub>S, thianaphtene) and [[dibenzothiophene]]. Most of the last compounds are solids and smell like naphthalene. Many methylated, dimethyl, diethyl benzothiophene derivatives are present in diesel and fuel oils which make fuel oils very difficult to clean.\n\nAll these heterocyclic sulfides account for 200\u2013500&nbsp;ppm of natural fuel, the heavily substituted dibenzothiophenes remain after HDS and account for 10\u201320&nbsp;ppm. These molecules are also found in coals and they must be eliminated before consumption.\n\nReduced molybdenum together with nickel is currently used to eliminate thiophenes from petroleum (HDS) due to its great affinity towards sulfur.\nIn addition tungsten together with nickel and cobalt is used for hydrodesulfurization (HDS) in large refineries. The adsorption mechanism of thiophene to transition metals is proposed to occur through the \u03c0 system, where the organosulfur compound lies almost parallel to the metal surface.\nMany researchers focus their efforts in optimizing the oxidation state of the transition metals for HDS, like Cu(I) and Ag(II) which together with Pd(0) have proven to be more specific for \u03c0 bonding with thiophenes of all kinds.\n\n===Basis for odor===\nHumans and other animals have an exquisitely sensitive sense of smell toward the [[odor]] of low-valent organosulfur compounds such as thiols, sulfides, and disulfides. Malodorous volatile thiols are protein-degradation products found in putrid food, so sensitive identification of these compounds is crucial to avoiding intoxication. Low-valent volatile sulfur compounds are also found in areas where oxygen levels in the air are low, posing a risk of suffocation. It has been found that copper is required for the highly sensitive detection of certain volatile thiols and related organosulfur compounds by olfactory receptors in mice. Whether humans, too, require copper for sensitive detection of thiols is not yet known.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Duan | first1 = X. | last2 = Block | first2 = E. | last3 = Li | first3 = Z. | last4 = Connelly | first4 = T. | last5 = Zhang | first5 = J. | last6 = Huang | first6 = Z. | last7 = Su | first7 = X. | last8 = Pan | first8 = Y. | last9 = Wu | first9 = L. | last10 = Chi | first10 = Q. | last11 = Thomas | first11 = S. | last12 = Zhang | first12 = S. | last13 = Ma | first13 = M. | last14 = Matsunami | first14 = H. | last15 = Chen | first15 = G.-Q. | last16 = Zhang | first16 = H. | title = Crucial role of copper in detection of metal-coordinating odorants. | url = | journal = Proc.

The season contains 17 episodes (with the last two made into one long episode) and concluded airing on May 6, 2004.\n\n==Season synopsis==\nThe season premiere opens in Barbados following on from the season 9 finale. [[Ross Geller|Ross]] and Charlie, a fellow paleontologist and [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]]'s ex-girlfriend, are kissing. Joey sees this and goes to [[Rachel Green|Rachel]]'s room, where the two of them also kiss. However, they both decide to talk to Ross about the situation to make sure he is okay with it. After they return from Barbados, Ross finds them kissing. He tries to hide the fact that he is hurt, but they realize he is when he starts acting all weird around them. Joey eventually talks to Ross about the situation and Ross says that he will be okay with their relationship. After several obstacles that prevent Joey and Rachel from consummating their relationship, they decide to just remain friends. By the sixth episode of this season, Ross becomes single again after Charlie decides to get back together with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n[[Mike Hannigan|Mike]] proposes to [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] and they get married mid-season. [[Monica Geller|Monica]] and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] decide to try to adopt a child after finding out that they are infertile. They are eventually selected by a woman named Erica. Following this, they decide that they want to move to a house in Westchester. Rachel is head-hunted for a job with Gucci, but in the restaurant where she is being interviewed, her boss (Mr. Zelner) is seated at the next table. She gets fired from Ralph Lauren and also doesn't get the job with Gucci, which leaves her unemployed. While departing her old job, she runs into Mark, her old colleague from Bloomingdale's in Season 3, who offers her a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross, still being secretly in love with her, doesn't want her to leave and tries to make her get her old job at Ralph Lauren back by convincing her boss to increase her salary. Rachel decides she wants to go to Paris and says goodbyes to everyone personally except Ross. Ross reacts harshly and tells her that it's not fair. When Rachel goes to Ross' apartment to explain, they end up kissing and spending the night together. Ross expects Rachel to cancel her plans, but she still wants to go to Paris.\n\nIn the season's (and series') final episode, Erica delivers Monica's and Chandler's baby, although, to their surprise, she had twins, a boy and a girl. Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but they end up going to the wrong airport. After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards. Ross goes back home only to find a message from Rachel saying she made a mistake. As she is hindered by a stewardess from getting off the plane, the connection breaks. Ross frantically tries to fix the machine, wondering if she got off the plane. Rachel enters Ross' apartment and says \"I got off the plane\". They kiss and declare their love for each other. The last scene of the series is everyone putting their keys on the table in Monica's apartment. When Rachel asks if they want to go for one last coffee, Chandler replies with the last sarcastic word of the show, \"Where?\". The camera then pans across the empty apartment, before landing on the door. The show then fades to black. The tag scene pans around New York.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Collider (website)|Collider]] ranked it #6 on their ranking of the ten ''Friends'' seasons, and picked \"[[The Last One (Friends)|The Last One]]\" as its highlight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/friends-seasons-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|title='Friends' Seasons Ranked from Worst to Best|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> The final episode was watched by over 52.46 million people and is the 4th most watched show in TV history.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n:''See also: [[List of Friends characters]], [[List of Friends characters#Introduced in season 10|Introduced in season 10]]''\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as [[Rachel Green]]\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as [[Monica Geller|Monica Geller-Bing]]\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan]]\n* [[Matt LeBlanc]] as [[Joey Tribbiani]]\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as [[Chandler Bing]]\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as [[Ross Geller]]\n\n\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Mike Hannigan]]\n* [[Aisha Tyler]] as [[Charlie Wheeler]]\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Erica \n* [[James Michael Tyler]] as [[Gunther (Friends)|Gunther]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as [[Janice Hosenstein|Janice Litman-Goralnik]]\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as [[Jack Geller]]\n* [[Christina Pickles]] as [[Judy Geller]]\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as [[Frank Buffay, Jr.]]\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as [[Amy Green]]\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as [[Benjamin Hobart]]\n* [[Ron Leibman]] as [[Leonard Green (Friends)|Leonard Green]]\n* [[Ellen Pompeo]] as [[Missy Goldberg]]\n* [[Donny Osmond]] as himself \n* [[Danny DeVito]] as the stripper\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Mackenzie\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Ellen\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Amanda Buffamonteezi\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of Friends episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#A4273E\n|overall=\n|season=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|viewers=\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Friends (season 10)\n|EpisodeNumber=219\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|ProdCode=176251\n|Viewers=24.54<ref name=\"tripodS10\">{{cite web|title=Friends Nielsen Ratings Archive \u2013 Season Ten|url=http://newmusicandmore.tripod.com/friendsratings10.html|publisher=Newmusicandmore.tripod.com|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref>\n|Title=[[The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|9|25}}\n|WrittenBy=Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen\n|DirectedBy=[[Kevin Bright|Kevin S.

''Friends'' was produced by [[Bright/Kauffman/Crane Productions]], in association with [[Warner Bros. Television]]. The season contains 17 episodes (with the last two made into one long episode) and concluded airing on May 6, 2004.\n\n==Season synopsis==\nThe season premiere opens in Barbados following on from the season 9 finale. [[Ross Geller|Ross]] and Charlie, a fellow paleontologist and [[Joey Tribbiani|Joey]]'s ex-girlfriend, are kissing. Joey sees this and goes to [[Rachel Green|Rachel]]'s room, where the two of them also kiss. However, they both decide to talk to Ross about the situation to make sure he is okay with it. After they return from Barbados, Ross finds them kissing. He tries to hide the fact that he is hurt, but they realize he is when he starts acting all weird around them. Joey eventually talks to Ross about the situation and Ross says that he will be okay with their relationship. After several obstacles that prevent Joey and Rachel from consummating their relationship, they decide to just remain friends. By the sixth episode of this season, Ross becomes single again after Charlie decides to get back together with her ex-boyfriend.\n\n[[Mike Hannigan|Mike]] proposes to [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe]] and they get married mid-season. [[Monica Geller|Monica]] and [[Chandler Bing|Chandler]] decide to try to adopt a child after finding out that they are infertile. They are eventually selected by a woman named Erica. Following this, they decide that they want to move to a house in Westchester. Rachel is head-hunted for a job with Gucci, but in the restaurant where she is being interviewed, her boss (Mr. Zelner) is seated at the next table. She gets fired from Ralph Lauren and also doesn't get the job with Gucci, which leaves her unemployed. While departing her old job, she runs into Mark, her old colleague from Bloomingdale's in Season 3, who offers her a job with Louis Vuitton in Paris. Ross, still being secretly in love with her, doesn't want her to leave and tries to make her get her old job at Ralph Lauren back by convincing her boss to increase her salary. Rachel decides she wants to go to Paris and says goodbyes to everyone personally except Ross. Ross reacts harshly and tells her that it's not fair. When Rachel goes to Ross' apartment to explain, they end up kissing and spending the night together. Ross expects Rachel to cancel her plans, but she still wants to go to Paris.\n\nIn the season's (and series') final episode, Erica delivers Monica's and Chandler's baby, although, to their surprise, she had twins, a boy and a girl. Phoebe and Ross go to the airport to try to convince Rachel to stay, but they end up going to the wrong airport. After Phoebe causes a delay in the departure, they meet Rachel at the gate before she boards, but even though Ross tells her how he feels, Rachel still boards. Ross goes back home only to find a message from Rachel saying she made a mistake. As she is hindered by a stewardess from getting off the plane, the connection breaks. Ross frantically tries to fix the machine, wondering if she got off the plane. Rachel enters Ross' apartment and says \"I got off the plane\". They kiss and declare their love for each other. The last scene of the series is everyone putting their keys on the table in Monica's apartment. When Rachel asks if they want to go for one last coffee, Chandler replies with the last sarcastic word of the show, \"Where?\". The camera then pans across the empty apartment, before landing on the door. The show then fades to black. The tag scene pans around New York.\n\n==Reception==\n[[Collider (website)|Collider]] ranked it #6 on their ranking of the ten ''Friends'' seasons, and picked \"[[The Last One (Friends)|The Last One]]\" as its highlight.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://collider.com/friends-seasons-ranked-from-worst-to-best/|title='Friends' Seasons Ranked from Worst to Best|first=Adam|last=Chitwood|date=December 26, 2019}}</ref> The final episode was watched by over 52.46 million people and is the 4th most watched show in TV history.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n:''See also: [[List of Friends characters]], [[List of Friends characters#Introduced in season 10|Introduced in season 10]]''\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Main cast===\n* [[Jennifer Aniston]] as [[Rachel Green]]\n* [[Courteney Cox]] as [[Monica Geller|Monica Geller-Bing]]\n* [[Lisa Kudrow]] as [[Phoebe Buffay|Phoebe Buffay-Hannigan]]\n* [[Matt LeBlanc]] as [[Joey Tribbiani]]\n* [[Matthew Perry]] as [[Chandler Bing]]\n* [[David Schwimmer]] as [[Ross Geller]]\n\n\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Recurring cast===\n* [[Paul Rudd]] as [[Mike Hannigan]]\n* [[Aisha Tyler]] as [[Charlie Wheeler]]\n* [[Anna Faris]] as Erica \n* [[James Michael Tyler]] as [[Gunther (Friends)|Gunther]]\n\n{{col-3}}\n\n===Guest stars===\n* [[Maggie Wheeler]] as [[Janice Hosenstein|Janice Litman-Goralnik]]\n* [[Elliott Gould]] as [[Jack Geller]]\n* [[Christina Pickles]] as [[Judy Geller]]\n* [[Giovanni Ribisi]] as [[Frank Buffay, Jr.]]\n* [[Christina Applegate]] as [[Amy Green]]\n* [[Greg Kinnear]] as [[Benjamin Hobart]]\n* [[Ron Leibman]] as [[Leonard Green (Friends)|Leonard Green]]\n* [[Ellen Pompeo]] as [[Missy Goldberg]]\n* [[Donny Osmond]] as himself \n* [[Danny DeVito]] as the stripper\n* [[Dakota Fanning]] as Mackenzie\n* [[Jane Lynch]] as Ellen\n* [[Jennifer Coolidge]] as Amanda Buffamonteezi\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of Friends episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table\n|background=#A4273E\n|overall=\n|season=\n|title=\n|director=\n|writer=\n|airdate=\n|prodcode=\n|country=US\n|viewers=\n|episodes=\n\n{{Episode list/sublist|Friends (season 10)\n|EpisodeNumber=219\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|ProdCode=176251\n|Viewers=24.54<ref name=\"tripodS10\">{{cite web|title=Friends Nielsen Ratings Archive \u2013 Season Ten|url=http://newmusicandmore.tripod.com/friendsratings10.html|publisher=Newmusicandmore.tripod.com|accessdate=July 31, 2014}}</ref>\n|Title=[[The One After Joey and Rachel Kiss]]\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2003|9|25}}\n|WrittenBy=Andrew Reich & Ted Cohen\n|DirectedBy=[[Kevin Bright|Kevin S.

Phoebe and Joey pack Monica and Chandler's belongings as the couple accompany Erica to the hospital. Ross and Phoebe race to the airport to tell Rachel of his feelings \u2013 but she gets on the plane anyway. Meanwhile, Erica gives birth to twins which Chandler and Monica name Jack and Erica. Still on the plane, contemplating Ross' plea, Rachel has a change of heart. She leaves the plane and goes to Ross' apartment to tell him that she loves him. After years of separation, the two finally get back together for good, saying \"this is it\", hinting they will marry after the series (which is revealed to be true in the spin-off, ''[[Joey (TV series)|Joey]]''). Back in Monica's apartment, the friends turn in their keys and go out for their last cup of coffee together as a group.

After Henderson posted the letter on his website, it became an internet phenomenon and was featured in many large newspapers, which caught the attention of book publishers.

Henderson uses satire to show flaws with [[creationism]] and prove the Flying Spaghetti Monster, offering an alternative to the [[intelligent design movement]] in the process.
