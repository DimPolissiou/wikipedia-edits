This marked the beginning of the worshipping of the snake Lebe. Each of the tribes then carried a fragment of this first altar and dispersed along the cliff to find their respective villages. In each newly founded village, a Lebe altar was built from that fragment of the original altar,<ref name=\"dogon\" /> and the execution of religious rites left under the control of the [[Hogon]]  (Dogon priests and elders).\n\nThe Dogon worship both Nemmo and Lebe Seru.  In their religious rituals, they start by sacrificing a goat on Lebe's alter, and disclaim: \n:''May Nommo and Lebe never ceased to be the same good thing, may they never separate themselves from the state of being the same thing.'<ref>Griaule (1948), p. 73</ref>'<ref name=\"Heusch\"/>\n\nThe sacrifice of Nommo and Lebe are complimentary.  The first \"serves a cosmogonic purpose; it creates the universal machine and starts it up\"; whilst the second ensures the soil is fertilised.

The Dogons thought thus of transporting on the one hand a sort of ferment which would communicate its qualities to the new [[terrain]], and on the other hand, a material which, if not the sought after bones, would be impregnated with the very substance of the ancestor.<ref name=\"Persee\"/>\n\nOnce they arrived in the [[Bandiagara]] region, they made an altar by mixing the soil collected in the Mande and that of their new home. This marked the beginning of the worshipping of the snake Lebe. Each of the tribes then carried a fragment of this first altar and dispersed along the cliff to find their respective villages. In each newly founded village, a Lebe altar was built from that fragment of the original altar,<ref name=\"dogon\" /> and the execution of religious rites left under the control of the [[Hogon]]  (Dogon priests and elders).\n\nThe Dogon worship both Nemmo and Lebe Seru.  In their religious rituals, they start by sacrificing a goat on Lebe's alter, and disclaim: \n:''May Nommo and Lebe never ceased to be the same good thing, may they never separate themselves from the state of being the same thing.'<ref>Griaule (1948), p. 73</ref>'<ref name=\"Heusch\"/>\n\nThe sacrifice of Nommo and Lebe are complimentary.  The first \"serves a cosmogonic purpose; it creates the universal machine and starts it up\"; whilst the second ensures the soil is fertilised. In essence, Lebe Seru was \"originally responsible for the integrity of [[Agriculture|cultivated land]].\"<ref>Griaule and Dieterien, (1964), p, 25</ref><ref name=\"Heusch\"/>\n\nThe Lebe order is linked to several [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] religious ceremonies dedicated to the glory and resurrection of the Nommo. Public places in each Dogon village has an alter dedicated to Lebe. The Hogon, the Dogons' spiritual elders and high priests presides over Lebe ceremonies. According to Dogon believe, they (Hogon) are the \"oldest direct descendent of the original ancestor.\"<ref name=\"Velton and Jolijn\">Velton, Ross; Geels, Jolijn; (edited, illustrated and compiled by Jolijn Geels)  [[Bradt Travel Guides]], 2004), pp. 181\u20143, {{ISBN|9781841620770}} (retrieved March 17, 2020)  [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=DLs1WaRmXBQC&pg=PA181#v=onepage&q&f=false]</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Pangool]]\n*[[Mand\u00e9 creation myth]]\n*[[Samay (mythology)]]\n*[[Zin (water spirits)]]\n{{portal|Traditional African religion|Mali}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n*[[Marcel Griaule|Griaule, Marcel]], ''Conversations with Ogotemm\u00eali: An Introduction to Dogon Religious Ideas'' (contribution: [[Germaine Dieterlen|Dieterlen, Germaine]], [[International African Institute]]), International African Institute (1965), {{ISBN|9780195198218}} (Originally published in 1948 as ''Dieu d'Eau'', pp. 25, 61, 71\u20143)\n*[[Luc de Heusch|Heusch, Luc de]], ''Sacrifice in Africa: A Structuralist Approach'', (trans.

In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays. After a narrow popular vote the city merged with the town of [[Ballarat East]] in 1921, ending a long-standing rivalry.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Location==\nWhile officially a part of the Central Highlands of Victoria, Ballarat is part of the Midlands geological region.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\". Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\". In some dialects, ''balla'' means \"bent elbow\", which is translated to mean reclining or resting and ''arat'' meaning \"place\".<ref>{{cite web|title=City of Ballarat: community profile|url=http://profile.id.com.au/ballarat/about|access-date=8 April 2017}}</ref> Another claim is that the name derives from Yuille's native Gaelic Baile Ararat (Town of Ararat), alluding to the resting place of [[Noah's Ark]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}} The present spelling was officially adopted by the City of Ballarat in 1996.\n\n=== 1850s: Gold rush ===\n[[File:Ballarat 1853-54 von guerard.jpg|thumb|Painting by [[Eugene von Guerard]] of Ballarat's tent city in the summer of 1853\u201354]]\n\nThe first publicised discovery of gold in the region was by [[Thomas Hiscock]] on 2 August 1851 in the Buninyong region to the south.<ref>Griffiths Peter M, \"Three Times Blest A History of Buninyong 1737\u20131901\", Ballarat Historical Society pp13</ref> The find brought other prospectors to the area and on 19 August 1851 John Dunlop and James Regan struck gold at Poverty Point with a few ounces.<ref name=\"The Courier 1851-11-05\">{{cite news |title = Victoria |date = 5 November 1851 |work = The Courier |page = 2}}</ref> Within days of the announcement of Dunlop and Regan's find a gold rush began, bringing thousands of prospectors to the Yarrowee valley which became known as the Ballarat diggings.

The interwar period proved a period of recovery for Ballarat with a number of major infrastructure projects well underway including a new sewerage system. In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.<ref>Geelong Ousts Ballarat.

In 1942, Ballarat became connected to the state electricity grid by a 66,000 kV line.<ref name=\"autogenerated2\"/> Prior to this, power supply was generated locally.\n\nIn the [[post-war]] era, Ballarat's growth continued. In response to an acute housing shortage, significant suburban expansion occurred. An extensive [[Housing Commission of Victoria]] estate was built on the former Ballarat Common (today known as [[Wendouree West, Victoria|Wendouree West]]).<ref>{{cite web|title=Wendouree West Profile and History|url=http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|work=Wendouree West Community Renewal|accessdate=19 August 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100709075704/http://www.wendoureewest.com/renewal/wendwest.htm#history|archivedate=9 July 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> The estate was originally planned to contain over 750 prefabricated houses. While planning for the estate began in 1949, main construction occurred between 1951 and 1962.\n\nThe 1950s brought a new optimism to the city. On 17 April 1952 it was announced that Lake Wendouree was to be the venue for rowing events of the 1956 Summer Olympics,<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/> and work soon began on an Olympic village in Gillies Street. A new prefabricted power terminal substation at Norman Street Ballarat North was constructed between 1951 and 1953 by the State Electricity Commission.<ref>Ballarat 'B' Power Station.

In 1964, the Ballarat City Council passed laws banning pillar-supported verandahs in the CBD, which threatened the removal of historic cast iron verandahs in the city. The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city. [[Charles, Prince of Wales]] visited Ballarat on 28 October 1974 during which he toured Sovereign Hill, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education's new Mt Helen Campus and the White Swan Reservoir and spoke at Civic Hall.<ref>City of Ballarat Mayors Report 1974 \u2013 1975</ref>\n\nThe city continued to grow at the national average throughout the late 20th century and early 21st century. In 2008 the City of Ballarat released a plan directing that growth of the city over the next 30 years is to be concentrated to the west of the city centre. The Ballarat West Growth Area Plan was approved by the city and state government in 2010, planning an extensive fringe development consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents including new activity centres and employment zones.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan|accessdate=16 May 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723152436/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/57489/ballarat%20city%20council%20-%20tract%20expert%20evidence.pdf|archive-date=23 July 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web |url=http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |title=Ballarat West Local Structure Plan |publisher=Business Ballarat |accessdate=18 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818045405/http://www.businessballarat.com/?id=ballaratwestlocalstr |archivedate=18 August 2010 |url-status=dead  }}</ref>\n\n====Catholic Church Sexual Abuse====\n{{see also|Roman Catholic Diocese of Ballarat}}\nThe [[Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse#Catholic Church authorities in Ballarat|Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse]] final report published on 15 December 2017 found that 139 people made a claim of child sexual abuse to the Diocese of Ballarat between 1980 and 2015 and that there was 21 alleged perpetrators identified in claims.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex. Almost all of the other numerous bodies of water have been created artificially and include several reservoirs, the largest being the White Swan Reservoir and smaller suburban lakes such as Lake Esmond.\n\nThe contiguous urban area of Ballarat covers approximately {{convert|90|km2|0|abbr=on}} of the local government area's {{convert|740|km2|0|abbr=on}}.<ref name=\"Land Use\">{{cite web |url = http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |title = Ballarat Planning Scheme \u2013 Land Use |accessdate = 14 May 2012 |date = 18 March 2010 |work = City of Ballarat |publisher = City of Ballarat |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20120420101928/http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/media/550102/bps_c151_clause_21_04_final.pdf |archive-date = 20 April 2012 |url-status = dead |df = dmy-all }}</ref> Approximately 90% of the urban area's land use is residential and suburban.<ref name=\"Land Use\"/> From the city centre this area extends approximately {{convert|6|km|0|abbr=off}} north to the hills around Invermay, approximately {{convert|7.5|km|1|abbr=on}} east to Leigh Creek in the foothills of Mount Warrenheip, approximately {{convert|7|km|0|abbr=on}} west along the plains to Lucas and approximately {{convert|8.5|km|1|abbr=on}} south along the Yarrowee River and Canadian Creek valley to the fringe of Buninyong.<ref name=\"HIS 2011-10\"/> The central city is situated low in the valley of the Yarrowee River and surrounded by hills such that the city skyline is visible only from the hills and the lower lying inner eastern suburbs.

In response to this event the first male [[suffrage in Australia]] was instituted and as such Eureka is interpreted by some as the origin of [[democracy in Australia]]. The rebellion's symbol, the [[Eureka Flag]], has become a national symbol and is held at the [[Museum of Australian Democracy at Eureka]] in Ballarat.\n\nProclaimed a city in 1871, its prosperity continued until late in the 19th century, after which its importance relative to both [[Melbourne]] and [[Geelong]] rapidly faded with the slowing of gold extraction. It has endured as a major regional centre hosting the rowing and kayaking events from the [[1956 Summer Olympics]]. It is the commercial capital of the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]] and its largest city, as well as a significant tourist destination. Ballarat is known for its history, culture and its well-preserved Victorian era heritage, with much of the city subject to heritage overlays.

The party scaled [[Mount Buninyong]]; among them were Somerville's brother [[Thomas Livingstone Learmonth]], William Cross Yuille and Henry Anderson, all three of whom later claimed land in what is now Ballarat.\n\nThe Yuille family, Scottish settlers Archibald Buchanan Yuille and his brother William Cross Yuille, arrived in 1837 and squatted a {{convert|10000|acre|ha|adj=on}} sheep run. The first houses were built near Woolshed Creek by William Yuille and Anderson (Sebastopol), while Yuille erected a hut at Black Swamp (Lake Wendouree) in 1838. Outsiders originally knew of the settlement as Yuille's Station and Yuille's Swamp. Archibald Yuille named the area \"Ballaarat\". Some claim the name is derived from a local [[Wathaurong]] [[Indigenous Australian|Aboriginal]] word for the area, ''balla arat''. The meaning of this word is not certain; however several translations have been made and it is generally thought to mean \"resting place\".

In 1930, [[Ballarat Airport]] was established. By 1931, Ballarat's economy and population was recovering strongly with further diversification of industry, although in 1936 Geelong displaced it as the state's second largest city.<ref>Geelong Ousts Ballarat.

The by-law was met by staunch opposition from the National Trust, which had begun campaigning to protect some of the city's most historic buildings.<ref name=\"Speak Out Boldly\"/>{{rp|58}} By the 1970s, Ballarat began to officially recognise its substantial heritage, and the first heritage controls were recommended to ensure its preservation. With the opening of [[Sovereign Hill]], the city made a rapid shift to become a major cultural tourist destination, visited by thousands each year.\n\nDuring the 1970s, a further 300 houses were constructed at Wendouree West. Private housing in the adjacent suburb of [[Wendouree, Victoria|Wendouree]] closely matched and eventually eclipsed this by the mid-1960s. The suburb of greater Wendouree and Wendouree West had evolved as the suburban middle-class heart of the city.

Also known as the [[Central Highlands (Victoria)|Central Highlands]], it is named so because of its gentle hills and lack of any significant mountains that are more common in the eastern sections of the Great Dividing Range. The city lies within a mostly gently undulating section of the midland plains which stretch from Creswick in the north, to Rokewood in the south, and from Lal Lal in the south-east to Pittong in the west.\n\nGeologically, the area consists of alluvial sediment and volcanic flows originating from now-extinct volcanoes such as nearby Buninyong and Warrenheip, which are the area's tallest peaks. As a result, the basin contains large areas of fertile agricultural soil.<ref>City of Ballarat (Maps, Population & Location \u2013 http://www.ballarat.vic.gov.au/Global/Maps/index.aspx) {{Dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref> Ballarat itself is situated on an alluvial basin of the Yarrowee catchment and its tributary creeks, penetrated by sub-ranges of schists composed of granites and quartz. Along with the visible river and creeks, the catchment basin has numerous active and inactive aquifers and natural wetlands, which are used for urban water supply, agriculture and recreation.\n\nThere are numerous densely forested areas around Ballarat; however due to historic wood milling and land clearing there remain no old-growth forests. The major natural bodies of water are in the west and include the former shallow swamps of [[Lake Wendouree]] which is central to the city's western suburbs and beyond Winter's Swamp and the large [[Lake Burrumbeet]] wetland complex.

It can handle graphics and standard features of [[programming language]]s such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain.\n\nOften, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.\n* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.\n* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied and included).\n\n== Technical overview ==\n=== File structure ===\nA PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as <code>%PDF-1.7</code>. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/ |title = In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML |first = Jim |last = Pravetz |website = jimpravetz.com }}</ref> A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p.&nbsp;51.</ref>\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''\n* Numbers\n* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (<code>(...)</code>), may contain 8-bit characters.\n* Names, starting with a forward slash (<code>/</code>)\n* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (<code>[...]</code>)\n* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>)\n* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary, between the <code>stream</code> and <code>endstream</code> keywords, preceded by a dictionary\n* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (<code>%</code>). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the <code>obj</code> and <code>endobj</code> keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects (except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams'' (marked <code>/Type /ObjStm</code>). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''. Object streams do not support specifying an object's ''generation number'' (other than 0).\n\nAn index table, also called the cross-reference table, is typically located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Before PDF version 1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the <code>xref</code> keyword, and follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional ''cross-reference streams'', which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification (using the <code>/W</code> array), so that for example a document not exceeding 64&nbsp;[[KiB]] in size may dedicate only 2&nbsp;bytes for object offsets.\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a footer containing:\n* The <code>startxref</code> keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table (starting with the <code>xref</code> keyword) or the cross-reference stream object\n* And the <code>%%EOF</code> [[end-of-file]] marker.\n\nIf a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the <code>trailer</code> keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross-reference stream object's dictionary:\n* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog'' (<code>/Root</code>)\n* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (<code>/Size</code>)\n* And other optional information.\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name=\"pdf-ref\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].\n\n=== Imaging model ===\nThe basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system\n* The ''[[clipping path]]''\n* The ''[[color space]]''\n* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\nAs in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->\n\n==== Raster images ====\n[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]\n* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact\n* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})\n* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification\n* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters\n* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard\n* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6\n* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4\n* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.\n\n==== Text ====\nText in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.\n\n===== Fonts =====\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->\n\n===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====\nFourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:\n* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)\n* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n* [[Zapf Dingbats]]\nThese fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts \u2013 Definition|last=Howard|first=Jacci|work=About.com Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614134144/http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.<ref name=\"aquarium\">[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\n===== Encodings =====\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref> The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\n==== Transparency ====\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model.\n\n=== Interactive elements ===\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\n'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\n'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:<ref name=\"iso32000\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management \u2013 Portable Document Format \u2013 Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF \u2013 PDF Knowledge \u2013 Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733|title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm?|last=Demling|first=Peter|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>\n* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.\n* [[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action's ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)\n* Forms Data Format (FDF)\n* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the \"XML\" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4)\n* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values, as was defined in PDF 1.4.)\n\nAcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs. The external files may use Forms Data Format (FDF) and XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) files.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kb2.adobe.com/cps/325/325874.html |title=Using Acrobat forms and form data on the web |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref name=\"xfdf\">{{citation|title=XML Forms Data Format Specification, version 2|date=September 2007|url=https://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/TECH/ADOBE/A070914X.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180730100811/https://www.immagic.com/eLibrary/ARCHIVES/TECH/ADOBE/A070914X.pdf|url-status=dead|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-02-19|archivedate=2009-12-23}}</ref><ref name=\"fdf-exchange\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/fdf_data_exchange.pdf |format=PDF |title=FDF Data Exchange Specification |date=2007-02-08 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref> The usage rights (UR) signatures define rights for import form data files in FDF, XFDF and text ([[comma-separated values|CSV]]/[[delimiter-separated values|TSV]]) formats, and export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n===== Forms Data Format (FDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name = Forms Data Format (FDF)\n| icon = \n| logo = \n| screenshot = \n| caption = \n| extension = .fdf\n| mime = application/vnd.fdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/ |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 vnd.fdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code = 'FDF'\n| uniform type = \n| magic = \n| owner = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| genre = \n| released = {{Start date|1996}}<!-- {{Start date|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} --> (PDF 1.2)\n| latest release version = \n| latest release date = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|mm|dd|df=yes}} -->\n| container for = \n| contained by = \n| extended from = PDF\n| extended to = XFDF\n| standard = ISO 32000-2:2017\n| free = Yes\n| url = \n}}\n\nThe Forms Data Format (FDF) is based on PDF, it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file structure, but is much simpler than PDF, since the body of an FDF document consists of only one required object. Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n===== XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name                   = XML Forms Data Format (XFDF)\n| icon                   =\n| logo                   =\n| screenshot             =\n| caption                =\n| extension              = .xfdf\n| mime                   = application/vnd.adobe.xfdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.adobe.xfdf |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 Vendor Tree \u2013 vnd.adobe.xfdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code              = 'XFDF'\n| uniform type           =\n| magic                  =\n| owner                  = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| released               = {{Start date|2003|07|df=yes}} (referenced in PDF 1.5)\n| latest release version = 3.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2009|08|df=yes}}\n| genre                  =\n| container for          =\n| contained by           =\n| extended from          = PDF, FDF, [[XML]]\n| extended to            =\n| standard               = ISO 19444-1<ref name=\"iso-xfdf\">{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=240&ics3=30&csnumber=64911 |title=ISO/CD 19444-1 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0) |accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>)\n| free                   =\n| url                    = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160408204348/https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/XFDF_Spec_3.0.pdf XFDF 3.0 specification]\n}}\n\nXML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary \u2013 such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.<ref name=\"xfdf\" /> The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====\n{{main|XFA}}\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; [[Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\n=== Logical structure and accessibility ===\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and [[accessibility]]. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.<ref>Duff Johnson, April 22, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20040807132851/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]</ref>\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including [[assistive technology]] (AT), is uneven at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}</ref> ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate further adoption.\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.\n\n===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\n=== Security and signatures ===\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://freemypdf.com/ |title = FreeMyPDF.com \u2013 Removes passwords from viewable PDFs |website = freemypdf.com }}</ref> Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html|title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker|author=Jeremy Kirk|date=December 5, 2008|website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage rights ====\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data\n* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats\n* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats\n* Submit form data\n* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates\n* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field\n* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n=== File attachments ===\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\n=== Metadata ===\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\n=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===\nPDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\n=== Default display settings ===\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 |title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|website=adobe.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Technical issues ==\n=== Accessibility ===\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more.

Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\n[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289\u20131 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\n=== Viruses and exploits ===\n{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus \"Peachy\"], 15 August 2001.</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson \u2013 SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|last=|first=|date=|work=PCMAG|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404034752/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|archive-date=4 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nA PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])\n* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines\n* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image\n* Multimedia objects in the document\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF \u2013 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name=\"3d#1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/supported-file-formats-acrobat-reader.html#main_2D_and_3D_formats__Acrobat_9_Pro_Extended__Adobe_3D_Reviewer_|title=Supported file formats in Acrobat and Reader|website=helpx.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript_acrobt_3d.html|title=JavaScript for Acrobat 3D {{!}} Adobe Acrobat Developer Center|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high-resolution raster image takes more space than a low-resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main list|List of PDF software}}\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429212434/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|archive-date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\n[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws\u00ae 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}</ref> and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].\n\n=== Conversions ===\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be [[data conversion|converted]] back and forth from many other formats such as:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}</ref>\n* Microsoft Office formats, \n* Rich Text Format, \n* Open office,\n* WordPerfect, \n* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, \n* Windows Metafile,\n* Enhanced Metafile,\n* Graphics Interchange Format,\n* Microsoft HD Photo File,\n* JPEG File Interchange,\n* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,\n* Portable Network Graphics,\n* Tagged Image File,\n* HyperText Markup Language,\n* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,\n* Scalable Vector Graphics,\n* Microsoft Outlook, Text,\n* XML Paper Specification,\n* Extensible Markup Language,\n* Silverlight XPS Document,\n* Extensible Application Markup Language \n\nCompanies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]] libraries for developers to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides the [[Adobe PDF Library]], there are other [[List of PDF software#Development libraries|development libraries]] available.\n\n=== Annotation ===\n{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}\n\n[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs. The [[Text Verification Tool]] exports differences in documents as annotations and markups.\n\nThere are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.\n\n=== Other ===\nExamples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip |title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205151505/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] \"For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs.\" (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.\n\nIn 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the [[Open Source Development Labs]] Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the [[CUPS|Common Unix Printing System]] and desktop application projects such as [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.<ref>{{cite web |title = PDF as Standard Print Job Format |url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format |website=The Linux Foundation |publisher=[[Linux Foundation]] |accessdate=21 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. \n\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] once thought of as one of their [[High priority free software projects|high priority projects]] to be \"developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard.\"<ref>On 2014-04-02, a note dated 2009-02-10 referred to [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] as a source.

It can handle graphics and standard features of [[programming language]]s such as <code>if</code> and <code>loop</code> commands. PDF is largely based on PostScript but simplified to remove flow control features like these, while graphics commands such as <code>lineto</code> remain.\n\nOften, the PostScript-like PDF code is generated from a source PostScript file. The graphics commands that are output by the PostScript code are collected and [[Lexical analysis|tokenized]]. Any files, graphics, or fonts to which the document refers also are collected. Then, everything is compressed to a single file. Therefore, the entire PostScript world (fonts, layout, measurements) remains intact.\n\nAs a document format, PDF has several advantages over PostScript:\n* PDF contains tokenized and interpreted results of the PostScript source code, for direct correspondence between changes to items in the PDF page description and changes to the resulting page appearance.\n* PDF (from version 1.4) supports [[transparency (graphic)|graphic transparency]]; PostScript does not.\n* PostScript is an [[interpreted programming language]] with an implicit global state, so instructions accompanying the description of one page can affect the appearance of any following page. Therefore, all preceding pages in a PostScript document must be processed to determine the correct appearance of a given page, whereas each page in a PDF document is unaffected by the others. As a result, PDF viewers allow the user to quickly jump to the final pages of a long document, whereas a PostScript viewer needs to process all pages sequentially before being able to display the destination page (unless the optional PostScript [[Document Structuring Conventions]] have been carefully complied and included).\n\n== Technical overview ==\n=== File structure ===\nA PDF file is a 7-bit [[ASCII]] file, except for certain elements that may have binary content.\nA PDF file starts with a header containing the [[File format#Magic number|magic number]] and the version of the format such as <code>%PDF-1.7</code>. The format is a subset of a COS (\"Carousel\" Object Structure) format.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://jimpravetz.com/blog/2012/12/in-defense-of-cos/ |title = In Defense of COS, or Why I Love JSON and Hate XML |first = Jim |last = Pravetz |website = jimpravetz.com }}</ref> A COS tree file consists primarily of ''objects'', of which there are eight types:<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, p.&nbsp;51.</ref>\n* [[Boolean data type|Boolean]] values, representing ''true'' or ''false''\n* Numbers\n* [[String (computer science)|Strings]], enclosed within parentheses (<code>(...)</code>), may contain 8-bit characters.\n* Names, starting with a forward slash (<code>/</code>)\n* [[Array data type|Arrays]], ordered collections of objects enclosed within square brackets (<code>[...]</code>)\n* [[Dictionary (data structure)|Dictionaries]], collections of objects indexed by Names enclosed within double pointy brackets (<code>&lt;&lt;...&gt;&gt;</code>)\n* [[Stream (computing)|Streams]], usually containing large amounts of data, which can be compressed and binary, between the <code>stream</code> and <code>endstream</code> keywords, preceded by a dictionary\n* The [[Pointer (computer programming)|null]] object\nFurthermore, there may be comments, introduced with the percent sign (<code>%</code>). Comments may contain 8-bit characters.\n\nObjects may be either ''direct'' (embedded in another object) or ''indirect''. Indirect objects are numbered with an ''object number'' and a ''generation number'' and defined between the <code>obj</code> and <code>endobj</code> keywords if residing in the document root. Beginning with PDF version 1.5, indirect objects (except other streams) may also be located in special streams known as ''object streams'' (marked <code>/Type /ObjStm</code>). This technique enables non-stream objects to have standard stream filters applied to them, reduces the size of files that have large numbers of small indirect objects and is especially useful for ''Tagged PDF''. Object streams do not support specifying an object's ''generation number'' (other than 0).\n\nAn index table, also called the cross-reference table, is typically located near the end of the file and gives the byte offset of each indirect object from the start of the file.<ref>Adobe Systems, PDF Reference, pp. 39\u201340.</ref> This design allows for efficient [[random access]] to the objects in the file, and also allows for small changes to be made without rewriting the entire file (''incremental update''). Before PDF version 1.5, the table would always be in a special ASCII format, be marked with the <code>xref</code> keyword, and follow the main body composed of indirect objects. Version 1.5 introduced optional ''cross-reference streams'', which have the form of a standard stream object, possibly with filters applied. Such a stream may be used instead of the ASCII cross-reference table and contains the offsets and other information in binary format. The format is flexible in that it allows for integer width specification (using the <code>/W</code> array), so that for example a document not exceeding 64&nbsp;[[KiB]] in size may dedicate only 2&nbsp;bytes for object offsets.\n\nAt the end of a PDF file is a footer containing:\n* The <code>startxref</code> keyword followed by an offset to the start of the cross-reference table (starting with the <code>xref</code> keyword) or the cross-reference stream object\n* And the <code>%%EOF</code> [[end-of-file]] marker.\n\nIf a cross-reference stream is not being used, the footer is preceded by the <code>trailer</code> keyword followed by a dictionary containing information that would otherwise be contained in the cross-reference stream object's dictionary:\n* A reference to the root object of the tree structure, also known as the ''catalog'' (<code>/Root</code>)\n* The count of indirect objects in the cross-reference table (<code>/Size</code>)\n* And other optional information.\n\nThere are two layouts to the PDF files: non-linear (not \"optimized\") and linear (\"optimized\"). Non-linear PDF files consume less disk space than their linear counterparts, though they are slower to access because portions of the data required to assemble pages of the document are scattered throughout the PDF file. Linear PDF files (also called \"optimized\" or \"web optimized\" PDF files) are constructed in a manner that enables them to be read in a Web browser plugin without waiting for the entire file to download, since they are written to disk in a linear (as in page order) fashion.<ref name=\"pdf-ref\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html |title=Adobe Developer Connection: PDF Reference and Adobe Extensions to the PDF Specification |publisher=Adobe Systems |accessdate=2010-12-13}}</ref> PDF files may be optimized using [[Adobe Acrobat]] software or [[QPDF]].\n\n=== Imaging model ===\nThe basic design of how [[graphics]] are represented in PDF is very similar to that of PostScript, except for the use of [[transparency (graphic)|transparency]], which was added in PDF 1.4.\n\nPDF graphics use a [[device independence|device-independent]] [[Cartesian coordinate system]] to describe the surface of a page. A PDF page description can use a [[matrix (mathematics)|matrix]] to [[scale (ratio)|scale]], [[rotate]], or [[Shear mapping|skew]] graphical elements. A key concept in PDF is that of the ''graphics state'', which is a collection of graphical parameters that may be changed, saved, and restored by a ''page description''. PDF has (as of version 1.6) 24 graphics state properties, of which some of the most important are:\n* The ''current transformation matrix'' (CTM), which determines the coordinate system\n* The ''[[clipping path]]''\n* The ''[[color space]]''\n* The ''[[alpha compositing|alpha constant]]'', which is a key component of transparency\n\n==== Vector graphics ====\nAs in PostScript, [[vector graphics]] in PDF are constructed with ''paths''. Paths are usually composed of lines and cubic [[B\u00e9zier curve]]s, but can also be constructed from the outlines of text. Unlike PostScript, PDF does not allow a single path to mix text outlines with lines and curves. Paths can be stroked, filled, [[clipping path|clipping]]. Strokes and fills can use any color set in the graphics state, including ''patterns''.\n\nPDF supports several types of patterns. The simplest is the ''tiling pattern'' in which a piece of artwork is specified to be drawn repeatedly. This may be a ''colored tiling pattern'', with the colors specified in the pattern object, or an ''uncolored tiling pattern'', which defers color specification to the time the pattern is drawn. Beginning with PDF 1.3 there is also a ''shading pattern'', which draws continuously varying colors. There are seven types of shading pattern of which the simplest are the ''axial shade'' (Type 2) and ''radial shade'' (Type 3). <!-- Pictures desperately needed here! -->\n\n==== Raster images ====\n[[Raster graphics|Raster images]] in PDF (called ''Image XObjects'') are represented by dictionaries with an associated stream. The dictionary describes properties of the image, and the stream contains the image data. (Less commonly, a raster image may be embedded directly in a page description as an ''inline image''.) Images are typically ''filtered'' for compression purposes. Image filters supported in PDF include the general purpose filters\n* '''ASCII85Decode''' a filter used to put the stream into 7-bit [[ASCII]]\n* '''ASCIIHexDecode''' similar to ASCII85Decode but less compact\n* '''FlateDecode''' a commonly used filter based on the [[deflate]] algorithm defined in {{IETF RFC|1951}} (deflate is also used in the [[gzip]], [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]], and [[ZIP (file format)|zip]] file formats among others); introduced in PDF 1.2; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact zlib/deflate compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the [[TIFF]] 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] specification ({{IETF RFC|2083}})\n* '''LZWDecode''' a filter based on [[LZW]] Compression; it can use one of two groups of predictor functions for more compact LZW compression: ''Predictor 2'' from the TIFF 6.0 specification and predictors (filters) from the PNG specification\n* '''RunLengthDecode''' a simple compression method for streams with repetitive data using the [[run-length encoding]] algorithm and the image-specific filters\n* '''DCTDecode''' a [[lossy]] filter based on the [[JPEG]] standard\n* '''CCITTFaxDecode''' a [[lossless]] [[bi-level image|bi-level]] (black/white) filter based on the Group 3 or [[Group 4 compression|Group 4]] [[CCITT]] (ITU-T) [[fax]] compression standard defined in ITU-T [[T.4]] and T.6\n* '''JBIG2Decode''' a lossy or lossless bi-level (black/white) filter based on the [[JBIG2]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.4\n* '''JPXDecode''' a lossy or lossless filter based on the [[JPEG 2000]] standard, introduced in PDF 1.5\n\nNormally all image content in a PDF is embedded in the file. But PDF allows image data to be stored in external files by the use of ''external streams'' or ''Alternate Images''. Standardized subsets of PDF, including [[PDF/A]] and [[PDF/X]], prohibit these features.\n\n==== Text ====\nText in PDF is represented by ''text elements'' in page content streams. A text element specifies that ''characters'' should be drawn at certain positions. The characters are specified using the ''encoding'' of a selected ''font resource''.\n\n===== Fonts =====\nA font object in PDF is a description of a digital [[typeface]]. It may either describe the characteristics of a typeface, or it may include an embedded ''font file''. The latter case is called an ''embedded font'' while the former is called an ''unembedded font''. The font files that may be embedded are based on widely used standard digital font formats: '''[[PostScript fonts|Type 1]]''' (and its compressed variant '''CFF'''), '''[[TrueType]]''', and (beginning with PDF 1.6) '''[[OpenType]]'''. Additionally PDF supports the '''Type 3''' variant in which the components of the font are described by PDF graphic operators. <!--- Type 3 bit is awkward and should be cleaned up --->\n\n===== Standard Type 1 Fonts (Standard 14 Fonts) =====\nFourteen typefaces, known as the ''standard 14 fonts'', have a special significance in PDF documents:\n* [[Times Roman|Times]] (v3) (in regular, italic, bold, and bold italic)\n* [[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Helvetica]] (v3) (in regular, oblique, bold and bold oblique)\n* [[Symbol (typeface)|Symbol]]\n* [[Zapf Dingbats]]\nThese fonts are sometimes called the ''base fourteen fonts''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|title=Desktop Publishing: Base 14 Fonts \u2013 Definition|last=Howard|first=Jacci|work=About.com Tech|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160614134144/http://desktoppub.about.com/od/glossary/g/base14fonts.htm|archive-date=June 14, 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref> These fonts, or suitable substitute fonts with the same metrics, should be available in most PDF readers, but they are not ''guaranteed'' to be available in the reader, and may only display correctly if the system has them installed.<ref name=\"aquarium\">[http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/03e/merz_fontaquarium.pdf The PDF Font Aquarium]</ref> Fonts may be substituted if they are not embedded in a PDF.\n\n===== Encodings =====\nWithin text strings, characters are shown using ''character codes'' (integers) that map to glyphs in the current font using an ''encoding''. There are a number of predefined encodings, including ''WinAnsi'', ''MacRoman'', and a large number of encodings for East Asian languages, and a font can have its own built-in encoding. (Although the WinAnsi and MacRoman encodings are derived from the historical properties of the [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]] and [[Macintosh]] operating systems, fonts using these encodings work equally well on any platform.) PDF can specify a predefined encoding to use, the font's built-in encoding or provide a lookup table of differences to a predefined or built-in encoding (not recommended with TrueType fonts).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf |title=PDF Reference Sixth Edition, version 1.7, table 5.11}}</ref> The encoding mechanisms in PDF were designed for Type 1 fonts, and the rules for applying them to TrueType fonts are complex.\n\nFor large fonts or fonts with non-standard glyphs, the special encodings ''Identity-H'' (for horizontal writing) and ''Identity-V'' (for vertical) are used. With such fonts it is necessary to provide a ''ToUnicode'' table if semantic information about the characters is to be preserved.\n\n==== Transparency ====\nThe original imaging model of PDF was, like PostScript's, ''opaque'': each object drawn on the page completely replaced anything previously marked in the same location. In PDF 1.4 the imaging model was extended to allow transparency. When transparency is used, new objects interact with previously marked objects to produce blending effects. The addition of transparency to PDF was done by means of new extensions that were designed to be ignored in products written to the PDF 1.3 and earlier specifications. As a result, files that use a small amount of transparency might view acceptably in older viewers, but files making extensive use of transparency could be viewed incorrectly in an older viewer without warning.\n\nThe transparency extensions are based on the key concepts of ''transparency groups'', ''blending modes'', ''shape'', and ''alpha''. The model is closely aligned with the features of [[Adobe Illustrator]] version 9. The blend modes were based on those used by [[Adobe Photoshop]] at the time. When the PDF 1.4 specification was published, the formulas for calculating blend modes were kept secret by Adobe. They have since been published.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/pdf/pdfs/pdf_reference_archives/blend_modes.pdf PDF Blend Modes Addendum]</ref>\n\nThe concept of a transparency group in PDF specification is independent of existing notions of \"group\" or \"layer\" in applications such as Adobe Illustrator. Those groupings reflect logical relationships among objects that are meaningful when editing those objects, but they are not part of the imaging model.\n\n=== Interactive elements ===\nPDF files may contain interactive elements such as annotations, form fields, video, 3D and rich media.\n\n'''Rich Media PDF''' is a PDF file including interactive content that can be embedded or linked within the file.\n\n'''Interactive Forms''' is a mechanism to add forms to the PDF file format.\n\nPDF currently supports two different methods for integrating data and PDF forms. Both formats today coexist in the PDF specification:<ref name=\"iso32000\">{{citation |url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/PDF32000_2008.pdf |title=Document Management \u2013 Portable Document Format \u2013 Part 1: PDF 1.7, First Edition |author=Adobe Systems Incorporated |date=2008-07-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |title=Gnu PDF \u2013 PDF Knowledge \u2013 Forms Data Format |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130101054615/http://www.gnupdf.org/Forms_Data_Format |archivedate=2013-01-01 |accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |title=About PDF forms |accessdate=2010-02-19 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429032948/http://livedocs.adobe.com/coldfusion/8/htmldocs/help.html?content=formsPDF_02.html |archivedate=2011-04-29 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://forums.adobe.com/thread/301733|title=Convert XFA Form to AcroForm?|last=Demling|first=Peter|date=July 1, 2008|accessdate=2010-02-19}}</ref>\n* '''AcroForms''' (also known as '''Acrobat forms'''), introduced in the PDF 1.2 format specification and included in all later PDF specifications.\n* [[XML Forms Architecture|Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA) forms, introduced in the PDF 1.5 format specification.

AcroForms permit using objects (''e.g.'' [[text box]]es, [[Radio button]]s, ''etc.'') and some code (''e.g.'' [[JavaScript]]).\n\nAlongside the standard PDF action types, interactive forms (AcroForms) support submitting, resetting, and importing data. The \"submit\" action transmits the names and values of selected interactive form fields to a specified uniform resource locator (URL). Interactive form field names and values may be submitted in any of the following formats, (depending on the settings of the action's ExportFormat, SubmitPDF, and XFDF flags):<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* HTML Form format (HTML 4.01 Specification since PDF 1.5; HTML 2.0 since 1.2)\n* Forms Data Format (FDF)\n* XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) (external XML Forms Data Format Specification, Version 2.0; supported since PDF 1.5; it replaced the \"XML\" form submission format defined in PDF 1.4)\n* PDF (the entire document can be submitted rather than individual fields and values, as was defined in PDF 1.4.)\n\nAcroForms can keep form field values in external stand-alone files containing key:value pairs.

Forms Data Format is defined in the PDF specification (since PDF 1.2). The Forms Data Format can be used when submitting form data to a server, receiving the response, and incorporating into the interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n===== XML Forms Data Format (XFDF) =====\n{{Infobox file format\n| name                   = XML Forms Data Format (XFDF)\n| icon                   =\n| logo                   =\n| screenshot             =\n| caption                =\n| extension              = .xfdf\n| mime                   = application/vnd.adobe.xfdf<ref>{{citation |url=http://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/vnd.adobe.xfdf |title=IANA Application Media Types \u2013 Vendor Tree \u2013 vnd.adobe.xfdf |accessdate=2010-02-22}}</ref>\n| type code              = 'XFDF'\n| uniform type           =\n| magic                  =\n| owner                  = [[Adobe Systems]]\n| released               = {{Start date|2003|07|df=yes}} (referenced in PDF 1.5)\n| latest release version = 3.0\n| latest release date    = {{Start date and age|2009|08|df=yes}}\n| genre                  =\n| container for          =\n| contained by           =\n| extended from          = PDF, FDF, [[XML]]\n| extended to            =\n| standard               = ISO 19444-1<ref name=\"iso-xfdf\">{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?ics1=35&ics2=240&ics3=30&csnumber=64911 |title=ISO/CD 19444-1 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0) |accessdate=2017-05-28}}</ref>)\n| free                   =\n| url                    = [https://web.archive.org/web/20160408204348/https://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/en/xml/XFDF_Spec_3.0.pdf XFDF 3.0 specification]\n}}\n\nXML Forms Data Format (XFDF) is the XML version of Forms Data Format, but the XFDF implements only a subset of FDF containing forms and annotations. There are not XFDF equivalents for some entries in the FDF dictionary \u2013 such as the Status, Encoding, JavaScript, Pages keys, EmbeddedFDFs, Differences and Target. In addition, XFDF does not allow the spawning, or addition, of new pages based on the given data; as can be done when using an FDF file. The XFDF specification is referenced (but not included) in PDF 1.5 specification (and in later versions). It is described separately in ''XML Forms Data Format Specification''.<ref name=\"xfdf\" /> The PDF 1.4 specification allowed form submissions in XML format, but this was replaced by submissions in XFDF format in the PDF 1.5 specification. XFDF conforms to the XML standard.\n\nAs of December 2016, XFDF 3.0 is an ISO/IEC standard under the formal name ''ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management \u2013 XML Forms Data Format \u2013 Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/64911.html|title=ISO 19444-1:2016 \u2013 Document management -- XML Forms Data Format -- Part 1: Use of ISO 32000-2 (XFDF 3.0)|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2017-02-28}}</ref> This standard is a normative reference of ISO 32000-2.\n\nXFDF can be used in the same way as FDF; e.g., form data is submitted to a server, modifications are made, then sent back and the new form data is imported in an interactive form. It can also be used to export form data to stand-alone files that can be imported back into the corresponding PDF interactive form.\n\n==== Adobe XML Forms Architecture (XFA) ====\n{{main|XFA}}\nIn PDF 1.5, Adobe Systems introduced a proprietary format for forms; [[Adobe XML Forms Architecture]] (XFA). Adobe XFA Forms are not compatible with ISO 32000's AcroForms feature, and most PDF processors do not handle XFA content. The XFA specification is referenced from ISO 32000-1/PDF 1.7 as an external proprietary specification, and was entirely deprecated from PDF with ISO 32000-2 (PDF 2.0).\n\n=== Logical structure and accessibility ===\nA \"tagged\" PDF (see clause 14.8 in ISO 32000) includes document structure and semantics information to enable reliable text extraction and [[accessibility]]. Technically speaking, tagged PDF is a stylized use of the format that builds on the logical structure framework introduced in PDF 1.3. Tagged PDF defines a set of standard structure types and attributes that allow page content (text, graphics, and images) to be extracted and reused for other purposes.<ref>Duff Johnson, April 22, 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20040807132851/http://www.planetpdf.com/enterprise/article.asp?ContentID=6067 What is Tagged PDF?]</ref>\n\nTagged PDF is not required in situations where a PDF file is intended only for print. Since the feature is optional, and since the rules for Tagged PDF were relatively vague in ISO 32000-1, support for tagged PDF amongst consuming devices, including [[assistive technology]] (AT), is uneven at this time.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washington.edu/doit/Stem/articles?1002|title=Is PDF accessible?|work=washington.edu}}</ref> ISO 32000-2, however, includes an improved discussion of tagged PDF which is anticipated to facilitate further adoption.\n\nAn ISO-standardized subset of PDF specifically targeted at accessibility; [[PDF/UA]], was first published in 2012.\n\n===Optional Content Groups (layers of it) ===\nWith the introduction of PDF version, 1.5 (2003) came the concept of Layers. Layers, or as they are more formally known Optional Content Groups (OCGs), refer to sections of content in a PDF document that can be selectively viewed or hidden by document authors or consumers. This capability is useful in CAD drawings, layered artwork, maps, multi-language documents etc.\nBasically, it consists of an Optional Content Properties Dictionary added to the document root. This dictionary contains an array of Optional Content Groups (OCGs), each describing a set of information and each of which may be individually displayed or suppressed, plus a set of Optional Content Configuration Dictionaries, which give the status (Displayed or Suppressed) of the given OCGs.\n\n=== Security and signatures ===\nA PDF file may be encrypted for security, or digitally signed for authentication.\n\nThe standard security provided by Acrobat PDF consists of two different methods and two different passwords: a ''user password'', which encrypts the file and prevents opening, and an ''owner password'', which specifies operations that should be restricted even when the document is decrypted, which can include modifying, printing, or copying text and graphics out of the document, or adding or modifying text notes and [[#AcroForms|AcroForm]] fields. The user password encrypts the file, while the owner password does not, instead relying on client software to respect these restrictions. An owner password can easily be removed by software, including some free online services.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://freemypdf.com/ |title = FreeMyPDF.com \u2013 Removes passwords from viewable PDFs |website = freemypdf.com }}</ref> Thus, the use restrictions that a document author places on a PDF document are not secure, and cannot be assured once the file is distributed; this warning is displayed when applying such restrictions using Adobe Acrobat software to create or edit PDF files.\n\nEven without removing the password, most freeware or open source PDF readers ignore the permission \"protections\" and allow the user to print or make copy of excerpts of the text as if the document were not limited by password protection.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.macworld.com/article/1137343/pdf.html|title=Adobe admits new PDF password protection is weaker|author=Jeremy Kirk|date=December 5, 2008|website=[[Macworld]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~dst/Adobe/Gallery/PDFsecurity.pdf  |title= How secure is PDF |author=Bryan Guignard}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.planetpdf.com/planetpdf/pdfs/pdf2k/01W/merz_securitykeynote.pdf |title= PDF Security Overview: Strengths and Weaknesses }}</ref>\n\nThere are a number of commercial solutions that offer more robust means of [[information rights management]]. Not only can they restrict document access but they also reliably enforce [[File system permissions|permissions]] in ways that the standard security handler does not.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.locklizard.com/pdf_security_drm/ |title=PDF DRM Security Software for Adobe Document Protection}}</ref>\n\n==== Usage rights ====\nBeginning with PDF 1.5, Usage rights (UR) signatures are used to enable additional interactive features that are not available by default in a particular PDF viewer application. The signature is used to validate that the permissions have been granted by a [[bona fide]] granting authority. For example, it can be used to allow a user:<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n* To save the PDF document along with modified form and/or annotation data\n* Import form data files in FDF, XFDF, and text (CSV/TSV) formats\n* Export form data files in FDF and XFDF formats\n* Submit form data\n* [[wikt:instantiate|Instantiate]] new pages from named page templates\n* Apply a [[digital signature]] to existing digital signature form field\n* Create, delete, modify, copy, import, and export annotations\n\nFor example, Adobe Systems grants permissions to enable additional features in Adobe Reader, using [[public-key cryptography]]. Adobe Reader verifies that the signature uses a [[Public key certificate|certificate]] from an Adobe-authorized certificate authority. Any PDF application can use this same mechanism for its own purposes.<ref name=\"iso32000\" />\n\n=== File attachments ===\nPDF files can have file attachments which processors may access and open or save to a local filesystem.\n\n=== Metadata ===\nPDF files can contain two types of metadata.<ref>[https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/pdfs/pdf_reference_1-7.pdf Adobe PDF reference version 1.7], section 10.2</ref> The first is the Document Information Dictionary, a set of key/value fields such as author, title, subject, creation and update dates. This is stored in the optional Info trailer of the file. A small set of fields is defined, and can be extended with additional text values if required. This method is deprecated in PDF 2.0.\n\nIn PDF 1.4, support was added for Metadata Streams, using the [[Extensible Metadata Platform]] (XMP) to add XML standards-based extensible metadata as used in other file formats. This allows metadata to be attached to any stream in the document, such as information about embedded illustrations, as well as the whole document (attaching to the document catalog), using an extensible schema.\n\n=== Usage restrictions and monitoring ===\nPDFs may be [[encrypted]] so that a password is needed to view or edit the contents. PDF 2.0 defines 256-bit AES encryption as standard for PDF 2.0 files. The PDF Reference also defines ways that third parties can define their own encryption systems for PDF.\n\nPDF files may be digitally signed; complete details on implementing digital signatures in PDF is provided in ISO 32000-2.\n\nPDF files may also contain embedded [[digital rights management|DRM]] restrictions that provide further controls that limit copying, editing or printing. These restrictions depend on the reader software to obey them, so the security they provide is limited.\n\n=== Default display settings ===\nPDF documents can contain display settings, including the page display layout and zoom level. Adobe Reader uses these settings to override the user's default settings when opening the document.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.adobepress.com/articles/article.asp?p=412914 |title=Getting Familiar with Adobe Reader &gt; Understanding Preferences|accessdate=2009-04-22 }}</ref> The free Adobe Reader cannot remove these settings.\n\n== Intellectual property ==\nAnyone may create applications that can read and write PDF files without having to pay royalties to [[Adobe Systems]]; Adobe holds patents to PDF, but licenses them for [[royalty-free]] use in developing software complying with its PDF specification.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|title=Developer Resources|website=adobe.com|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160227041714/http://partners.adobe.com/public/developer/support/topic_legal_notices.html|archivedate=2016-02-27}}</ref>\n\n== Technical issues ==\n=== Accessibility ===\nPDF files can be created specifically to be accessible for disabled people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.webaim.org/techniques/acrobat/ |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=WebAIM |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.alistapart.com/articles/pdf_accessibility |title=Facts and Opinions About PDF Accessibility |author=Joe Clark |date=2005-08-22 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |title=Accessibility and PDF documents |publisher=Web Accessibility Center |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100427062242/http://wac.osu.edu/pdf/ |archivedate=2010-04-27 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/guidelines/futuremedia/accessibility/accessible_pdf.shtml |title=PDF Accessibility Standards v1.2 |accessdate=2010-04-24}}</ref><ref>{{citation |url=http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |format=PDF |title=PDF Accessibility |publisher=California State University |accessdate=2010-04-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527215445/http://www.csus.edu/training/handouts/workshops/creating_accessible_pdfs.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-27 }}</ref> PDF file formats in use {{As of|2014|lc=on}} can include tags, text equivalents, captions, audio descriptions, and more.

Adding tags to older PDFs and those that are generated from scanned documents can present some challenges.\n\nOne of the significant challenges with PDF accessibility is that PDF documents have three distinct views, which, depending on the document's creation, can be inconsistent with each other. The three views are (i) the physical view, (ii) the tags view, and (iii) the content view. The physical view is displayed and printed (what most people consider a PDF document). The tags view is what screen readers and other assistive technologies use to deliver a high-quality navigation and reading experience to users with disabilities. The content view is based on the physical order of objects within the PDF's content stream and may be displayed by software that does not fully support the tags view, such as the Reflow feature in Adobe's Reader.\n\n[[PDF/UA]], the International Standard for accessible PDF based on ISO 32000-1 was first published as ISO 14289\u20131 in 2012, and establishes normative language for accessible PDF technology.\n\n=== Viruses and exploits ===\n{{See also|Adobe Acrobat#Security}}\n\nPDF attachments carrying viruses were first discovered in 2001. The virus, named ''OUTLOOK.PDFWorm'' or ''Peachy'', uses [[Microsoft Outlook]] to send itself as an attachment to an Adobe PDF file. It was activated with Adobe Acrobat, but not with Acrobat Reader.<ref>Adobe Forums, [https://forums.adobe.com/thread/302989 Announcement: PDF Attachment Virus \"Peachy\"], 15 August 2001.</ref>\n\nFrom time to time, new vulnerabilities are discovered in various versions of Adobe Reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/support/security/#readerwin |title=Security bulletins and advisories |publisher=Adobe |date= |accessdate=2010-02-21}}</ref> prompting the company to issue security fixes. Other PDF readers are also susceptible. One aggravating factor is that a PDF reader can be configured to start automatically if a web page has an embedded PDF file, providing a vector for attack. If a malicious web page contains an infected PDF file that takes advantage of a vulnerability in the PDF reader, the system may be compromised even if the browser is secure. Some of these vulnerabilities are a result of the PDF standard allowing PDF documents to be scripted with JavaScript. Disabling JavaScript execution in the PDF reader can help mitigate such future exploits, although it does not protect against exploits in other parts of the PDF viewing software. Security experts say that JavaScript is not essential for a PDF reader, and that the security benefit that comes from disabling JavaScript outweighs any compatibility issues caused.<ref>[http://www.grc.com/sn/sn-187.txt Steve Gibson \u2013 SecurityNow Podcast]</ref> One way of avoiding PDF file exploits is to have a local or web service convert files to another format before viewing.\n\nOn March 30, 2010 security researcher Didier Stevens reported an Adobe Reader and Foxit Reader exploit that runs a malicious executable if the user allows it to launch when asked.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|title=Malicious PDFs Execute Code Without a Vulnerability|last=|first=|date=|work=PCMAG|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100404034752/http://blogs.pcmag.com/securitywatch/2010/03/malicious_pdfs_execute_code_wi.php|archive-date=4 April 2010|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n== Content ==\nA PDF file is often a combination of [[vector graphics]], text, and [[bitmap graphics]]. The basic types of content in a PDF are:\n* Text stored as content streams (i.e., not encoded in [[plain text]])\n* Vector graphics for illustrations and designs that consist of shapes and lines\n* Raster graphics for photographs and other types of image\n* Multimedia objects in the document\n\nIn later PDF revisions, a PDF document can also support links (inside document or web page), forms, JavaScript (initially available as plugin for Acrobat 3.0), or any other types of embedded contents that can be handled using plug-ins.\n\nPDF 1.6 supports interactive 3D documents embedded in the PDF \u2013 3D drawings can be embedded using [[U3D]] or [[PRC (file format)|PRC]] and various other data formats.<ref name=\"3d#1\">{{cite web |url=https://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |title=3D supported formats |publisher=Adobe |date=2009-07-14 |accessdate=2010-02-21 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100212072951/http://www.adobe.com/manufacturing/resources/3dformats/ |archivedate=2010-02-12 }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://helpx.adobe.com/acrobat/kb/supported-file-formats-acrobat-reader.html#main_2D_and_3D_formats__Acrobat_9_Pro_Extended__Adobe_3D_Reviewer_|title=Supported file formats in Acrobat and Reader|website=helpx.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/devnet/acrobat/javascript_acrobt_3d.html|title=JavaScript for Acrobat 3D {{!}} Adobe Acrobat Developer Center|website=www.adobe.com|access-date=2020-03-22}}</ref>\n\nTwo PDF files that look similar on a computer screen may be of very different sizes. For example, a high-resolution raster image takes more space than a low-resolution one. Typically higher resolution is needed for printing documents than for displaying them on screen. Other things that may increase the size of a file is embedding full fonts, especially for Asiatic scripts, and storing text as graphics.\n\n== Software ==\n{{Main list|List of PDF software}}\n\nPDF viewers are generally provided free of charge, and many versions are available from a variety of sources.\n\nThere are many software options for creating PDFs, including the PDF printing capabilities built into [[macOS]], [[iOS]],<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.iphonehacks.com/2017/10/how-to-create-pdf-web-page-safari-iphone-ipad-ios-11.html|title=How to Create a PDF from Web Page on iPhone and iPad in iOS 11|last=Pathak|first=Khamosh|date=October 7, 2017|website=iPhone Hacks|access-date=February 2, 2018}}</ref> and most [[Linux]] distributions, [[LibreOffice]], [[Microsoft Office 2007]] (if updated to [[Office 2007#Service Pack 2|SP2]]) and later,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|title=Description of 2007 Microsoft Office Suite Service Pack 2 (SP2)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Microsoft]]|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429212434/http://support.microsoft.com/kb/953195|archive-date=29 April 2009|accessdate=2009-05-09}}</ref> [[WordPerfect]] 9, [[Scribus]], numerous PDF print drivers for [[Microsoft Windows]], the [[pdfTeX]] typesetting system, the [[DocBook]] PDF tools, applications developed around [[Ghostscript]] and [[Adobe Acrobat]] itself as well as [[Adobe InDesign]], [[Adobe FrameMaker]], [[Adobe Illustrator]], [[Adobe Photoshop]]. [[Google]]'s online office suite [[Google Docs]] also allows for uploading and saving to PDF.\n\n[[Raster image processor]]s (RIPs) are used to convert PDF files into a [[raster graphics|raster format]] suitable for imaging onto paper and other media in printers, digital production presses and [[prepress]] in a process known as [[rasterisation]]. RIPs capable of processing PDF directly include the Adobe PDF Print Engine<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.adobe.com/products/pdfprintengine/overview.html|title=Adobe PDF Print Engine|work=adobe.com}}</ref> from [[Adobe Systems]] and Jaws<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/jaws_rip/|title=Jaws\u00ae 3.0 PDF and PostScript RIP SDK|work=globalgraphics.com}}</ref> and the [[Harlequin RIP]] from [[Global Graphics]].\n\n=== Conversions ===\nDocuments saved in PDF (Portable Document Format, Portable Document Format for Archiving, Forms Data Format, any printable document) could be [[data conversion|converted]] back and forth from many other formats such as:<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pdftron.com/pdf-sdk/supported-file-formats|title=Supported File Formats|publisher=[[PDFTron Systems]]}}</ref>\n* Microsoft Office formats, \n* Rich Text Format, \n* Open office,\n* WordPerfect, \n* Microsoft Windows Bitmap, \n* Windows Metafile,\n* Enhanced Metafile,\n* Graphics Interchange Format,\n* Microsoft HD Photo File,\n* JPEG File Interchange,\n* JPEG 2000 File Format and Code Stream,\n* Portable Network Graphics,\n* Tagged Image File,\n* HyperText Markup Language,\n* MIME Encapsulation of Aggregate HTML Documents,\n* Scalable Vector Graphics,\n* Microsoft Outlook, Text,\n* XML Paper Specification,\n* Extensible Markup Language,\n* Silverlight XPS Document,\n* Extensible Application Markup Language \n\nCompanies such as [[Adobe Acrobat]] provide [[Software development kit|SDK]] libraries for developers to add and create PDF features in any software. Besides the [[Adobe PDF Library]], there are other [[List of PDF software#Development libraries|development libraries]] available.\n\n=== Annotation ===\n{{See also|Comparison of notetaking software}}\n\n[[Adobe Acrobat]] is one example of proprietary software that allows the user to annotate, highlight, and add notes to already created PDF files. One UNIX application available as [[free software]] (under the [[GNU General Public License]]) is [[PDFedit]]. The [[freeware]] [[Foxit Reader]], available for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS]] and [[Linux]], allows annotating documents. Tracker Software's [[PDF-XChange Viewer]] allows annotations and markups without restrictions in its freeware alternative. [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s [[macOS]]'s integrated PDF viewer, Preview, does also enable annotations as does the open source software [[Skim (software)|Skim]], with the latter supporting interaction with [[LaTeX]], SyncTeX, and PDFSync and integration with [[BibDesk]] reference management software. Freeware [[Qiqqa]] can create an annotation report that summarizes all the annotations and notes one has made across their library of PDFs. The [[Text Verification Tool]] exports differences in documents as annotations and markups.\n\nThere are also [[web annotation]] systems that support annotation in pdf and other documents formats. In cases where PDFs are expected to have all of the functionality of paper documents, ink annotation is required.\n\n=== Other ===\nExamples of PDF software as online services including [[Scribd]] for viewing and storing, [[Pdfvue]] for online editing, and [[ThinkFree Office|Thinkfree]], [[Zamzar]] for conversion.\n\nIn 1993 the Jaws [[raster image processor]] from [[Global Graphics]] became the first shipping prepress RIP that interpreted PDF natively without conversion to another format. The company released an upgrade to their Harlequin RIP with the same capability in 1997.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip |title=Harlequin MultiRIP|accessdate=2014-03-02|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209215413/http://www.globalgraphics.com/products/harlequin-multi-rip/|archivedate=2014-02-09 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agfa-Gevaert]] introduced and shipped Apogee, the first prepress workflow system based on PDF, in 1997.\n\nMany commercial offset printers have accepted the submission of press-ready PDF files as a print source, specifically the PDF/X-1a subset and variations of the same.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20090205151505/http://www.prepressx.com/ Press-Ready PDF Files] \"For anyone interested in having their graphic project commercially printed directly from digital files or PDFs.\" (last checked on 2009-02-10).</ref> The submission of press-ready PDF files are a replacement for the problematic need for receiving collected native working files.\n\nPDF was selected as the \"native\" [[metafile]] format for [[macOS|Mac OS X]], replacing the [[PICT]] format of the earlier [[classic Mac OS]]. The imaging model of the [[Quartz (graphics layer)|Quartz]] graphics layer is based on the model common to [[Display PostScript]] and PDF, leading to the nickname ''Display PDF''. The Preview application can display PDF files, as can version 2.0 and later of the [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] web browser. System-level support for PDF allows Mac OS X applications to create PDF documents automatically, provided they support the OS-standard printing architecture. The files are then exported in PDF 1.3 format according to the file header. When taking a screenshot under Mac OS X versions 10.0 through 10.3, the image was also captured as a PDF; later versions save screen captures as a [[Portable Network Graphics|PNG]] file, though this behaviour can be set back to PDF if desired.\n\nIn 2006 PDF was widely accepted as the standard print job format at the [[Open Source Development Labs]] Printing Summit. It is supported as a print job format by the [[CUPS|Common Unix Printing System]] and desktop application projects such as [[GNOME]], [[KDE]], [[Firefox]], [[Mozilla Thunderbird|Thunderbird]], [[LibreOffice]] and [[OpenOffice.org|OpenOffice]] have switched to emit print jobs in PDF.<ref>{{cite web |title = PDF as Standard Print Job Format |url = http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/pdf_as_standard_print_job_format |website=The Linux Foundation |publisher=[[Linux Foundation]] |accessdate=21 June 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome desktop printers also support direct PDF printing, which can interpret PDF data without external help. \n\nThe [[Free Software Foundation]] once thought of as one of their [[High priority free software projects|high priority projects]] to be \"developing a free, high-quality and fully functional set of libraries and programs that implement the PDF file format and associated technologies to the ISO 32000 standard.\"<ref>On 2014-04-02, a note dated 2009-02-10 referred to [http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/priority.html Current FSF High Priority Free Software Projects] as a source.

He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at [[West Kildonan Collegiate]]. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either \"flunked or dropped out and came back\", and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had \"discipline and determination\" because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his \"lack of studiousness\", and finished his schooling at [[Garden City Collegiate]]. He went on to study business administration at what is now [[Red River College]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mbteach.org/extras/teacher%20appreciation/randy%20bachman.html|title=randy bachman|publisher=The Manitoba Teachers' Society|date=January 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Profession musical career==\n===The Guess Who===\nIn 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to record and tour until the end of the decade, after Randy agreed to sell the rights to the \"BTO\" name to the remaining band members.\n\n===1979-1980===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other parts of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After Bachman-Turner Overdrive broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988 they reformed and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]]. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called \"Every Song Tells A Story\", where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] performed throughout Canada as [[Bachman & Cummings (band)|Bachman & Cummings]] in the summer of 2006, while on tour with [[The Carpet Frogs]]. Bachman and Fred Turner completed a new [[Bachman & Turner]] album that was released in September 2010. The album's single titled \"Rollin' Along\", was released in June 2010 on iTunes. The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010\u201311) under their Bachman & Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

The album was influenced by classic 1960s [[blues rock]] and features musical contributions from other musicians including: [[Neil Young]], [[Joe Bonamassa]], [[Peter Frampton]], [[Robert Randolph and the Family Band|Robert Randolph]], and [[Jeff Healey]]. Later in March 2018, Randy Bachman released a tribute to George Harrison containing cover version of the latter's hits. The album featured one original song titled \"Between Two Mountains\", and also featured [[Walter Trout]] on  the album's version of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\n==Guitar style==\nBachman has stated that his guitar sound was influenced by his early violin studies, saying \"when I wanted to play a rock solo, I played like it was violin...

He passed Grade 9 at Edmund Partridge Junior High School, but repeated both the 10th and 11th grades, initially at [[West Kildonan Collegiate]]. In his second year of Grade 11, he was placed in a class of students who mostly either \"flunked or dropped out and came back\", and was asked to be class president by the teacher, who thought he had \"discipline and determination\" because he had been playing violin since the age of five. He was expelled from West Kildonan in the middle of that year because of his \"lack of studiousness\", and finished his schooling at [[Garden City Collegiate]]. He went on to study business administration at what is now [[Red River College]], but did not graduate.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.mbteach.org/extras/teacher%20appreciation/randy%20bachman.html|title=randy bachman|publisher=The Manitoba Teachers' Society|date=January 2006|accessdate=May 5, 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Profession musical career==\n===The Guess Who===\nIn 1960, Bachman and Chad Allan co-founded Al and The Silvertones in Winnipeg. By 1962, the band changed their name to Chad Allan and the Expressions and later to [[The Guess Who]]. In 1965, the Guess Who had a #1 hit in Canada with their cover of [[Johnny Kidd & the Pirates|Johnny Kidd's]] \"[[Shakin' All Over]]\", which also charted in the US at #22. In 1966, Chad Allan left the band and [[Burton Cummings]] became the primary vocalist. Between 1966 and 1968, The Guess Who laboured mostly in their home country, releasing a few singles that managed to crack the Top 40 in Canada. In early 1969, the group finally broke through internationally with the hit song \"[[These Eyes]]\", co-written by Bachman and Cummings. The Guess Who released three successful albums over the next two years: ''[[Wheatfield Soul]]'' (1969), ''[[Canned Wheat]]'' (1969), and ''[[American Woman (album)|American Woman]]'' (1970), which brought them mainstream attention. Bachman wrote or cowrote (primarily with Cummings) most of the group's songs during this period.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nIn early 1970, the single \"[[American Woman]]\" hit #1 on the US Hot 100 charts, a first for a band from Canada. A group composition, the song critiques the \"ghetto scenes\" and \"war machines\" of the US, reflecting the Guess Who's experiences of extensive touring in large American cities. With the [[Vietnam War]] at its peak, many American men went to Canada to escape [[US military|US Military]] service. Bachman left the band at the height of its popularity, shortly after the release of ''American Woman''. He has been quoted as leaving due to the other band members' lifestyle choices conflicting with his beliefs upon converting to [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], in addition to wanting to spend more time with his family members.<ref name=\"Bachman bio at CBC.ca\">{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/lifeandtimes/bachman.html |title=Bachman bio at |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=January 20, 2004 |accessdate=February 28, 2012}}</ref> He was also suffering health problems related to his gall bladder and needed to be under a doctor's care, something that was difficult to do while on the road.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.startribune.com/american-woman-hitmaker-randy-bachman-recalls-1960s-winnipeg-rock-scene/504180862/ |title='American Woman' hitmaker Randy Bachman recalls 1960s Winnipeg rock scene |last=Bream |first=Jon |website=StarTribune.com |date=January 11, 2019 |accessdate=September 12, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Brave Belt and Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive===\nBefore his departure from The Guess Who in May 1970, Bachman recorded an instrumental solo album for [[RCA Records]], ''Axe'', over three days in March 1970. The following year, he formed the [[country rock]] band [[Brave Belt]] with Chad Allan. Brave Belt released its first self-titled [[LP record|LP]] in 1971. [[Robbie Bachman]] was the drummer for Brave Belt, at barely 18 years-old. [[Fred Turner (musician)|Fred Turner]] subsequently joined Brave Belt on bass and vocals, resulting in the band evolving into a heavier sound, which led to the departure of Chad Allan.\n\nLeft with a three-member line-up, [[Tim Bachman]] joined as a second guitarist before Brave Belt disbanded for its members to form another band. With this lineup, the members formed a new band, [[Bachman-Turner Overdrive]] and signed a record deal with [[Mercury Records]]. Often referred to as \"B.T.O.\" for short, they released their first self-titled album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1973 album)|Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive]]'' in May 1973.\n\nIn December 1973, the band released their second album, ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive II]]''. This album brought the band a greater commercial success than their debut, with hits such as \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\" and \"[[Let It Ride (Bachman-Turner Overdrive song)|Let It Ride]]\", which charted at #12 and #23 in the US, respectively. In 1974, they released their third album titled, ''[[Not Fragile]]''. The release hit #1 on the album charts in both Canada and the United States. The album contained the hits, \"[[Roll On Down the Highway]]\" and \"[[You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet (song)|You Ain't Seen Nothin' Yet]]\", which charted at #14 and #1, respectively. With the latter, Randy had the rare accomplishment of recording an American chart-topper for two different Canadian bands; the other being \"American Woman\" while he was in The Guess Who.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\nThe band remained on the charts through the mid-1970s with their next two albums, ''[[Four Wheel Drive (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Four Wheel Drive]]'' and ''[[Head On (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive album)|Head On]]''. With these albums, they successfully had additional hit songs with \"[[Hey You (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Hey You]]\", \"[[Take It Like a Man (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Take It Like a Man]]\", and the jazz-oriented \"[[Lookin\u2019 Out for No. 1 (Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive song)|Lookin' Out For No. 1]]\". In late-1976, during the recording of their sixth studio album ''[[Freeways (album)|Freeways]]'', some disagreements surfaced within the band. Bachman wrote all but one song and sang on every song but two, while some of the other band members felt that they didn't have enough good material to record and wanted to delay the release. Upon its release, the album charted at #70 in the US, but had no hit singles. Randy Bachman officially quit the band in mid-March 1977. The rest of the band would continue to record and tour until the end of the decade, after Randy agreed to sell the rights to the \"BTO\" name to the remaining band members.\n\n===1979-1980===\nAfter his departure from Bachman-Turner Overdrive, Bachman recorded a second solo album titled, ''[[Survivor (Randy Bachman album)|Survivor]]''. This release failed to chart in the US. Following the release, he formed a new hard rock band with bassist/singer Tom Sparks, called [[Ironhorse]]. Ironhorse released their debut self-titled album in 1979. It contained the single \"Sweet Lui-Louise\", which charted at #36 in the US and #26 in Canada, and performed well in other pars of Europe including Italy. After the tour for this album, Tom Sparks left the band and was replaced by Frank Ludwig. The band released a second album in 1980 titled, ''Everything Is Grey''. The release contained [[pop rock]] influences with greater use of [[keyboard instrument|keyboards]] than the first album. After Bachman-Turner Overdrive broke up in early-1980, Fred Turner and Randy formed a new band called Union, and released only one album titled, ''On Strike'' in 1981.\n\nLater in the documentary ''From Rags to Riches and Back'', Randy recalled building up a net worth of close to $10 million by 1977, only to go broke within four years. He credits these events to his divorce from his first wife Lorayne Stevenson and the court battles over custody of their children, as well as heavy investment in musical projects that did not become fruitful.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.loudersound.com/features/the-turbulent-history-of-bachman-turner-overdrive|title=From rags to riches and back: The turbulent story of Bachman-Turner Overdrive|website=loudersound.com|date=December 17, 2016|accessdate=September 13, 2019}}</ref>\n\n===1980s-1990s & Reunions===\nBachman rejoined The Guess Who in 1983 with Burton Cummings and other members of the ''American Woman'' era, for a publicized reunion. The band toured Canada and released a video of live performances. After The Guess Who reunion ended, Bachman rejoined Bachman-Turner Overdrive with Fred Turner, Tim Bachman, and Garry Peterson of The Guess Who taking over on drums. The reformed band released the self-titled ''[[Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive (1984 album)|Bachman-Turner Overdrive]]'' in 1984, as well as a [[Live Live Live|live album]] in 1986, after which they opened for [[Van Halen]] during the ''[[5150 (album)|5150]]'' tour in 1986. By 1987, Randy left the band.<ref>http://www.vhnd.com/2014/12/27/randy-bachman-recalls-bto-opening-for-van-halen-on-5150-tour/</ref>\n\nBy 1988 they reformed and toured together until 1991, when Randy again left the band. Randy returned to The Guess Who for a reunion performance in August 1999, in Winnipeg at the end of the [[1999 Pan American Games|XIII Pan Am Games]].<ref name=\"cbc-news\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|title='Best ever' Pan Am Games end|date=August 9, 1999|publisher=CBC News|accessdate=July 27, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080510130040/http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/1999/08/09/panam990809.html|archivedate=May 10, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===2000s===\nBachman continued as a member of The Guess Who, and played with them on several tours. In 2000, he made a guest appearance on ''[[The Simpsons]]'' in an episode as himself, in a fictionalized reunion with his former Bachman\u2013Turner Overdrive band-mates, [[C.F. Turner]] and [[Robin Bachman]]. Series creator [[Matt Groening]], whose father is originally from Winnipeg, is a self-professed fan of the band. During their performance in the episode, [[Homer Simpson]] humorously yells \"get to the working overtime part\" while they perform \"[[Takin' Care of Business (song)|Takin' Care of Business]]\".\n\nIn 2001, Bachman received an honorary [[Doctor of Music|Doctorate of Music]] from [[Brandon University]] in [[Brandon, Manitoba]], along with the other members of The Guess Who.

By July 2003, Bachman left The Guess Who with singer Burton Cummings, only to form a new project called, [[Bachman Cummings]].\n\nIn 2004, Bachman helped [[Kalan Porter]] on his debut album, ''[[219 Days]]''. He reportedly suggested that Kalan do a drone on the violin during, \"In Spite of It All\". He was also featured performing a guitar solo near the end of the song, \"And We Drive\". During this period, Bachman has also released an album of original melodic-jazz songs titled, ''Jazz Thing''. By the summer of 2005, Bachman began hosting the coast-to-coast radio show ''[[Vinyl Tap]]'' on [[CBC Radio One]]. For the show, he played audio recordings, while reminiscing about personal encounters with famous artists and musicians from his 50-year career in rock music. On July 2, 2005, Bachman performed at the Canadian leg of the global [[Live 8]] mega-concert organized by [[Bob Geldof]]. In 2008, he was made an Officer of the [[Order of Canada]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|title=Governor General Announces New Appointments to the Order of Canada|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908213224/http://www.gg.ca/media/doc.asp?lang=e&DocID=5447|archivedate=September 8, 2009}}</ref>\n\nBachman continued his career touring with the Randy Bachman Band, as well as the [[Bachman-Cummings Band]]. During this time he featured in a theater-styled show called \"Every Song Tells A Story\", where he performed live and unplugged with his band, often telling the stories behind writing his most famous from the 1960s and 1970s. Bachman and [[Burton Cummings]] performed throughout Canada as [[Bachman & Cummings (band)|Bachman & Cummings]] in the summer of 2006, while on tour with [[The Carpet Frogs]].

The pair launched a two-year world tour (2010\u201311) under their Bachman & Turner moniker, beginning at the Sweden Rock Festival in June 2010. Other confirmed dates included the High Voltage Festival in London, UK, in July 2010 and the Manitoba Homecoming Event in Winnipeg, Manitoba.

Later in March 2018, Randy Bachman released a tribute to George Harrison containing cover version of the latter's hits. The album featured one original song titled \"Between Two Mountains\", and also featured [[Walter Trout]] on  the album's version of \"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\".\n\n==Guitar style==\nBachman has stated that his guitar sound was influenced by his early violin studies, saying \"when I wanted to play a rock solo, I played like it was violin... Violin is mostly slow, [[Melody|melodic]] stuff. So my guitar solos tend to be smooth, slow lines.\"<ref>{{cite web |url=http://mixonline.com/news/audio_secrets_randy_bachmans/ |title=Secrets of Randy Bachman's Guitar Sound |publisher=mixonline.com |accessdate=November 11, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629142147/http://mixonline.com/news/audio_secrets_randy_bachmans/ |archivedate=June 29, 2011  }}</ref>\n\nGuitar influences he has mentioned in interviews include [[Lenny Breau]], [[Leslie West]], [[Wes Montgomery]],<ref>{{cite interview |last=Bachman |first=Randy |subjectlink=Randy Bachman |title=Bachman-Turner Overdrive: King Biscuit |year=1998}}</ref> [https://www.mixonline.com/recording/secrets-randy-bachmans-guitar-sound-375443 George Peterson], and [[Hank Marvin]].{{citation needed|date=October 2019}}\n\n==Personal life==\nBachman's first marriage was to Lorayne Stevenson (1966 to 1977).

Produced by Graphic Films for the Central Office of Information (COI) for the Health and Safety Executive (HSE), it was shown extensively in the [[Southern Television|Southern]], [[Westward Television|Westward]], [[Anglia Television|Anglia]] and [[Associated Television|ATV]] regions, before being shown either on film or videocassette in primary schools. It was shot on 16mm film at a [[Home Counties]] farm in February 1977, and child actors were selected from a school in [[Maidenhead, Berkshire]]. The 26-minute-long film deals with the subject of the dangers to children on [[farm]]s, and has been seen in schools all over Britain, as well as Canada, Australia and the United States. The timeframe of the film is somewhat confusing, giving a [[Surrealism|surreal]] feeling to the events portrayed. \n\nThe film was directed by [[John Mackenzie (film director)|John Mackenzie]], written by [[Neville Smith (actor)|Neville Smith]] and produced by John Arnold and Leon Clore. ''Apaches'' is now one of the most notorious public information films of all time.{{according to whom?|date=September 2018}}\n\nThe film, which dovetails the narrative conventions of the [[Western (genre)|western]] with PIFs, follows the misadventures of a group of six young children (Kim, Sharon, Michael, Danny, Tom and Robert) in a rural British village who enjoy playing on a nearby farm. Throughout the film the children play at being \"[[Apache]] warriors\", hence the film's title. All but one die in various shocking accidents, largely due to the children's carelessness, suggesting that the children would still be alive if they had known what dangers lay ahead. It is narrated in-character by Danny (Robbie Oubridge).\n\n==Plot==\nSeveral children play on a farm while a [[tea party (social gathering)|tea party]] is prepared. As the farmer drives his [[tractor]] through the field where the children are playing, while her friends follow behind, Kim jumps up onto the trailer, pretends the tractor is a train, and shoots at it. The tractor makes a turn, and she falls off and is run over, to the horror of the other children. At their school, the teacher removes Kim's name tag from a storage peg.\n\nThe children play in the fields again as their parents leave for the tea party. The boys want to play [[Association Football|football]], but the game changes to [[kick the can]] instead. While hiding from Danny, Tom decides to balance on the top of a fence overlooking a [[slurry pit]] and falls in. Nobody hears his cries for help, and he suffers a quick death by [[drowning]]. The village children are given a day off because of his death, and the class teacher removes the items from Tom's desk.\n\nAs their parents prepare the children's party, they play at being cavalry and later Apaches. When the game concludes, the children wander into an equipment shed and find a bottle that contains an unnamed chemical. Danny suggests they drink it to celebrate their victories. Michael points out that the can may contain a dangerous chemical (implied to be [[Paraquat]]), and they discuss whether it is poisonous. They agree to mime-drink the liquid, but Sharon accidentally swallows some of it. She seems fine once she spits it out, but later she becomes sick. In the middle of that night, she wakes up in excruciating pain, screaming and crying and calling for her mother. In the next scene, her mother is seen clearing out her now-dead daughter's bedroom with a close-up of her now empty bed. Danny comments that he does not understand why adults drink, and his parents pour whisky from a bottle identical to that of the poisonous chemical.\n\nThe remaining children play in the fields, and Michael narrowly avoids being run over by a tractor like Kim. As they pretend to be the stars of ''[[Starsky and Hutch]]'', Michael accidentally dislodges a heavy iron gate that crushes Robert. The remaining two children stare at the lifeless body, shocked, as more people arrive for the party. Danny sets off on his own to find more children, and finds farm workers on their break. Danny requests to sit on their tractor, and they agree as long as he is careful. As he pretends to drive a racing car, he accidentally releases the handbrake and crashes the tractor into a ditch, dying instantly as a result. His parents mourn his loss in his empty bedroom.\n\nDanny's coffin is buried as the [[vicar]] commits him to the ground, and the mourners move on to the [[Wake (ceremony)|wake]]. Danny continues his narration after his death, and talks calmly about his family all arriving for the \"party\" being prepared earlier in the film. Michael, also present, is revealed to be Danny's cousin \u2013 the only child not to have been killed by his own reckless behavior, despite Danny having described Michael as \"daft\". Danny's voice fades into a ghostly echo as he sadly says he wishes he could have gone to the party.\n\nClosing credits show a long list of real children who had died in actual farm accidents in the year before the film was made.\n\n== Cast ==\n* Robbie Oubridge as Danny\n* Ian Scrace as  Michael\n* Wayne Tapsfield as Robert\n* Sharon Smart as Sharon\n* Fion Smith as Tom\n* Louise O'Hara as Kim\n\n==Home viewing availability==\n''Apaches'' was made available for home viewing by the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] in 2010, along with other such Public Information Films of the time such as ''[[Building Sites Bite]]'', on the compilation DVD ''COI Collection Vol 4: Stop!
