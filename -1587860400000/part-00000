Bon Jovi was welcomed back, one year later, to see Bon Jovi Boulevard, and to unveil it to its future residents.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Solo===\n\n* ''[[Netherworld (film)|Netherworld]]'' soundtrack (1992)<ref>{{cite web|title=David Bryan Discography|url=http://www.davidbryan.com/Discography/Netherworld|accessdate=October 3, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n* ''[[On a Full Moon]]'' (1995)<ref>{{cite web|title=David Bryan Discography|url=http://www.davidbryan.com/Discography/On-a-Full-Moon|accessdate=October 3, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n* ''[[Lunar Eclipse (album)|Lunar Eclipse]]'' (2000)<ref>{{cite web|title=David Bryan Discography|url=http://www.davidbryan.com/Discography/Lunar-Eclipse|accessdate=October 3, 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n===With Bon Jovi===\n{{Main|Bon Jovi discography}}\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-3}}\n;'''Studio albums'''\n\n*''[[Bon Jovi (album)|Bon Jovi]]'' (1984)\n*''[[7800\u00b0 Fahrenheit]]'' (1985)\n*''[[Slippery When Wet]]'' (1986)\n*''[[New Jersey (album)|New Jersey]]'' (1988)\n*''[[Keep the Faith]]'' (1992)\n*''[[These Days (Bon Jovi album)|These Days]]'' (1995)\n*''[[Crush (Bon Jovi album)|Crush]]'' (2000)\n*''[[Bounce (Bon Jovi album)|Bounce]]'' (2002)\n*''[[Have a Nice Day (Bon Jovi album)|Have a Nice Day]]'' (2005)\n*''[[Lost Highway (Bon Jovi album)|Lost Highway]]'' (2007)\n*''[[The Circle (Bon Jovi album)|The Circle]]'' (2009)\n*''[[What About Now (album)|What About Now]]'' (2013)\n*''[[This House Is Not for Sale]]'' (2016)\n\n{{col-3}}\n;'''Compilation albums'''\n\n*''[[Hard & Hot (Best of Bon Jovi)|Hard & Hot]]'' (1991)\n*''[[Cross Road (album)|Cross Road]]'' (1994)\n*''[[Tokyo Road: Best of Bon Jovi]]'' (2001)\n*''[[This Left Feels Right]]'' (2003)\n*''[[Greatest Hits (Bon Jovi album)|Greatest Hits]]'' (2010)\n*''[[Burning Bridges (Bon Jovi album)|Burning Bridges]]'' (2015)\n\n;'''Live albums'''\n*''[[One Wild Night Live 1985-2001]]'' (2001)\n*''[[Inside Out (Bon Jovi album)|Inside Out]]'' (2012)\n*''[[This House Is Not for Sale \u2013 Live from the London Palladium]]'' (2016)\n\n;'''Box sets'''\n*''[[100,000,000 Bon Jovi Fans Can't Be Wrong]]'' (2004)\n{{col-3}}\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Contributions===\n*''[[Stranger in This Town]]'' (1991) - Songwriter, keyboards, string arrangements\n*''[[Netherworld (film)|Netherworld Soundtrack]]'' (1992) \u2013 Original Score<ref name = \"test\">{{cite web|url=http://www.davidbryan.com/disc.asp#|title=Discography|publisher=}}</ref><ref>https://musicbrainz.org/release/ee5491d5-f767-4e9c-b3de-915c661a67c1</ref>\n*\"Time Was\" \u2013 [[Curtis Stigers]] (1995) \u2013 wrote \"This Time\"<ref name = \"test\" />\n*''[[Destination Anywhere]]'' (1997) - Accordion, piano\n*''[[Undiscovered Soul]]'' (1998) - Songwriter\n*''The Toxic Avenger'' (2009) - Musical Soundtrack<ref>https://musicbrainz.org/release/2c2e60ba-06d5-4a6d-b121-3b83c4c97479</ref>\n*''[[Memphis (musical)|Memphis: A New Musical]]'' (2009) - Musical Soundtrack<ref>https://musicbrainz.org/release/bac17090-c02a-45d7-b083-b6da9c786dc2</ref>\n*''[[Memphis (musical)|Memphis: The Musical]]'' - (2015) - Musical Soundtrack<ref>https://musicbrainz.org/release/65e589c2-5602-4999-a5b1-b4bd1bcc9623</ref>\n\n==Further reading==\n* Larkin, Colin.

He has made a significant contribution towards imparting an exclusive Sri Lankan identity to the Sinhalese music. He was a musician, artist, poet and a photographer blended in to one. He also devoted more than 20 years of his life to uplifting musical standards in radio broadcasting.\n\n== Early life ==\n{{no sources |section}}\nDunstan was born the eldest of nine children to businessman Abraham de Silva and Jane Kurukulasekara. In his childhood, he had cultivated a habit of visiting the [[Weligama]] beach and playing a flute he had crafted himself, to the melodies he heard over the gramophone at home. His father was not happy with this practice but his mother was more sympathetic.\n\nHe started his primary education at Sidhdhartha College [[Weligama]] in 1930 and moved to [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College Colombo]], a leading school in Sri Lanka for his secondary education in 1936. Dunstan successfully completed his Senior School Certificate in the English Medium from [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]] offering English Language and Literature, Latin, Mathematics, Physics and Visual Arts. During this time he wrote poems to the school magazine and also contributed his visual arts to the school magazine. During this period he also learnt to play the violin from the renowned musician Don Vincent Peiris.\n\nAfter completing early studies at Nalanda College, Dunstan moved to [[Ananda College]] Colombo, another leading school in Sri Lanka and successfully completed the London matriculation examination in 1939.\n\nHis mother wanted her elder son Dunstan to be an Engineer. In order to fulfil his mother's aspirations Dunstan entered the [[Maradana College of Technology|Ceylon Technical College]] to pursue Engineering studies. Though he had chosen engineering studies to make his mother happy, his interest and passion was in music and arts. After successfully completing the Intermediate examination at the Ceylon Technical College, Dunstan quit engineering to pursue a career in music and arts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Tertiary Education ==\n{{no sources|section}}\nIn 1945, Dunstan received a government scholarship to study music at the prestigious [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], in Lucknow, India. Distinguished scholar, Professor [[S N Ratanjankar]] was one of his teachers at the Bhatkhande Music Institute.\n\nDuring his term there, Dunstan participated in many music concerts produced by Bhatkhande Music Institute. He sang a Sinhalese song with his ''contemporary, a Bengali Student Bokul Dhaar in'' ''Malathi Maadhawa ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dd3 \u0db8\u0dcf\u0db0\u0dc0 ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bc0 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb5 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935'' )  concert produced by  Kalyan Pakar''. As'' published in the [[Lankadeepa|Lankaadeepa]] newspaper 1952 March 17 this was supposedly the first ever Sinhalese song sung in a concert in India. At this concert Dunstan and Bokul sang the song P''udamu meakusum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:''\u00a0''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7 \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi|Hindi:]] \u092a\u0941\u0926\u092e\u0941 \u092e\u0915\u0941\u0938\u0941\u092e'' ) composed by [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakoo]]<nowiki/>n.\n\nDunstan was one of the five best students selected by the Bhatkhande Music Institute to sing the [[Indian National Anthem]] at the first independence celebrations in India on the 15 August 1947. After successfully completing seven years of music studies Dunstan returned to Sri Lanka with a Sangeet Visharad degree. Since then he was known publicly as Visharad P Dunstan de Silva. He was the third Sri Lankan to obtain the music Visharad degree with the legendary musicians [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and [[Sunil Shantha]] being the first two.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Teacher ===\nAfter giving up engineering studies, Dunstan joined his Alma mater\u00a0 Nalanda College as the resident Arts Teacher. The famous songwriter [[Karunaratne Abeysekera]] and [[Ridgeway Thilakeratne]] a one-time Director General of Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation were two of his students at [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]].\n\n=== Photographer ===\nAfter completing his music studies in India he returned to Sri Lanka in 1951 and pursued his third passion, Photography. Dunstan opened a Colour Photo Studio under the name Studio Colour at No 453 [[Union Place]], Colombo 2 which was supposedly the first colour studio in Sri Lanka. Within two years he opened up another branch of Studio Colour at No 259/1, Colombo 4.\n\nPrime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R Premadasa]] was a good friend of Dunstan. Because of this trust as a good friend and in recognition of his photography skills the Prime Minister Premadasa bestowed an honorary position on Dunstan as his personal photographer when he was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. This was a prestigious position where Dunstan had to work in a high security environment having access to personal events in the Prime Minister's life.\n\nWhile being engaged in music, he continued simultaneously with his photography too. In 1978 he produced all colour photos for a 213-page publication titled, An Album of Buddhist Paintings published by the National Archives compiled by Professor [[Siri Gunasinghe]]. Dunstan provided photos of 40 Temple Wall Paintings for this publication covering the ancient sites of Gadaladeniya, Maulgampola, Hanguranketha, Degaldoru, Madawala, Kotagala and [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla Rock Temple]].\n\n=== Musician ===\nDustan grew up listening to gramophone music at home. His passion for music was conceived and evolved over the gramophone music he was exposed to at home as a child that took him through a music career placing him finally as the Head of Sinhalese Music Division at the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).\n\nWhile engaging in his engineering studies at the Technical College, he followed two other passions that dearly touched his heart - Photography and Music. During this time an opportunity to play the flute for music programs in the [[Radio Ceylon]] came his way. He played the flute for the music programs of accomplished musicians [[Ananda Samarakoon]], Surya Shankar Molligoda and Anangalal Athukorala. The enticing lead accompaniment on the flute in Ananda Samarakoon's popular song of that vintage \"Punchi Suda Sudukatiya\" ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0dd4\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe; [[Hindi]]:\u092a\u0902\u091a \u0938\u0941\u0926\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e) is credited to de Silva.\n\nWhile being engaged in the photography business Dunstan continued to work on his prime passion of Music, which he studied at the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music Institute]]. In 1952 he composed music for the Opera Pushpa Shrungara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dca\u0db4 \u0dc1\u0dd8\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baa \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb1 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093e'' ) directed by [[Shesha Palihakkara]] dancer, film actor, and producer. Dunstan made his debut as a music composer for Pushpa Shrungara.\n\nDuring a period of 21 years from 1954 to 1975 as the Head of Sinhalese Music at [[Radio Ceylon]] and [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] Dunstan produced many popular programs such as\n\n*''Rasadhara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] :\u0dbb\u0dc3\u0db0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bbe ; [[Hindi]]:\u0930\u0938 \u0927\u0930\u093e )''\n*''Guwanviduli Geetha Nataka ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad \u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7\u0d9a; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0b95 ; [[Hindi]]: \u0917\u0941\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915  )''\n*''Vijaya Geetha ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4; [[Hindi]]: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e )''\n*''Raaga Rasa Vindhana ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db1; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95 \u00a0 \u0bb0\u0b9a \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9;  [[Hindi]]: \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0930\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e )''\n*''Sath Piyum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u00a0 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0920 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0941\u092e )''\n\nIn addition to being the producer he also composed music for these.\n\n=== Artist ===\nDespite spending his professional life mostly in music, he continued to engage in art which he practised since the time that he was the art teacher at Nalanda College. Dunstan designed the cover page of the significant publication called Sangeetha Sanhithaa<ref>{{Cite book|last=Abayasundara|first=Wimal|title=Sangeetha Sanhitha|publisher=S Godage Saha Sahodarayo|year=|isbn=9552055008|location=|pages=}}</ref> written by Eminent Sinhala poet and lyricist and Kalakeerthi Pundit Wimal Abeysundara.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Abeysundara|first=Wimal|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/06/13/news19.html|title=Wimal Abeysundara no more|date=|work=The Island|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Poet ===\n[[File:Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon.jpg|thumb|Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon Orchestra]]\nDunstan continued to write poems another-pastime that he had developed during his school years. He was a regular poet featured in leading English newspapers of Sri Lanka. There remain more than 50 unpublished poems written by Dunstan to date. One of those is \"The Flute\", which was the most sacred music instrument to him which he excelled in since early childhood. He used the flute to create his music compositions.\n\n\"The Flute\" is a beautiful poem Dunstan wrote about his beloved flute instrument which accompanied him from early life to the end of the life. He learnt music over the flute, his first job as a musician was to play the flute in [[Radio Ceylon]] orchestra and later he composed music using a flute.\n\n=== Visiting lecturer ===\n[[Lionel Edirisinghe]] Founder Principal of the Government Music College which later matured into the [[University of the Visual and Performing Arts]], offered a visiting lecturer position to Dunstan.\n\nWhen Dunstan became busy with his work at the Radio Ceylon producing music programs and working as a visiting lecture he didn't have enough time to spend on his photography business.\n\nThese dual engagements with the Radio Ceylon and the University competing for most of his time the simultaneous management of his photography business became untenable.\u00a0Consequently, he handed over his successful Studio Colour business to his brother Rohitha to continue.\n\n== Compositions ==\nFew of his compositions are;\n\n*Obata mathaka naa\u00a0 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd1\n*Sudu piruwata andalaa \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf\n*Wanamal piyali salaa  \u0dc0\u0db1\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dcf\n*Prakgna Pradeepa Dalwaa \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da5\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4 \u0daf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf\n*Oba dakumen yali jeewath wannata \u0d94\u0db6 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7\n*Pipunu malea ruwa \u0db4\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc5\u0dda \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\n*Kahawan goyamata \u0d9a\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dba\u0db8\u0da7\n\n== Mentor ==\n{{no sources|section}}\nDunstan was a mentor to many upcoming singers at his time in the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]]. When [[Sanath Nandasiri|Sanath Nanadasiri]] a stalwart of Sri Lankan music in later years returned to the country in 1965, conferred with a Visharad degree from the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhatkande Music Institute]], Dunstan extended him an opportunity to participate with a debut rendition as a new artist for the Navadali Hena radio musical. Dunstan called upon Somathilaka Jayamaha another musician who reached the top rungs later who worked as an admin officer in [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to the free music classes he conducted at YMBA Colombo. When Somathilaka finished the course Dunstan recruited him to the choir in his programs. Over time Somathilaka was promoted as an A-Grade singer and reached the upper echelons as an accomplished singer. Devananda Waidyasekara was also another talent Dunstan picked and groomed at [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to turn into an accomplished singer.\n\n== Two Milestones ==\nThe year 1954 marked two important milestones in his life. One was in his personal life and the other was in his professional life. On 24 February 1954 he married Hilda Fonseka from [[Wadduwa]]. Dunstan had met Hilda when she came to see her music teacher during the time she was a student at Sri Sumangala Girls School, Panadura. Gunaseana de Silva who studied at [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music institute]] with Dunstan proposed Hilda to Dunstan.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, Dunstan and Hilda were blessed with a precious daughter Ayanthi Manjula.\n\nIn the same year Dunstan got married, he received an invitation from the then Director General of the Radio Ceylon, [[M. J. Perera|M J Perera]], to join the Radio Ceylon. In 1954 Dunstan joined the Radio Ceylon as the Head of Sinhalese Music Programs.\n\nOn the 5th January 1967 Radio Ceylon was instituted as a public corporation as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He continued to serve as the head of Sinhalese Music Programs with the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n== Service to Sinhalese Music ==\nDuring his 21 years of service in the national broadcasting corporation, he dedicated his time to uplifting musical standards and developing Sinhalese music to evolve towards a Sri Lankan identity, moving away from the dependence on foreign tunes. His good friend Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva|W D Amaradeva]] contributed immensely to this endeavour with his own research efforts in this arena. \u00a0\n\nDunstan organised many classical music concerts inviting reputed singers and musicians from India affording Sri Lankan music lovers a chance to listen to them. He brought over his good friend legendary sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] five times to Sri Lanka. [[Lakshmi Shankar]], Ustad [[Alla Rakha|Allarakha]] Qureshi, [[V. G. Jog|Vishnu Govind Jog]], Pandit Dinkar Kaikini <ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaikini|first=Dinkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-events/A-tribute-to-Pandit-Dinkar-Kaikini/articleshow/7309862.cms|title=ETIMES|date=18 April 2020|work=Entertainment Times|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and Dipali Nag were other accomplished musicians he brought from India. \n[[File:Dunstan--Edit.jpg|thumb|L to R- Dunstan, his daughter and wife, Ravi Shankar, Laxmie Shankar and Ustad Allarakha Qureshi]]\nNone of those concerts were for commercial benefit. He organised those only to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan music lovers to listen to the music of those legends. There were times that he had to pocket out shortfalls in organising these concerts.\n\nDunstan was the founding secretary of the music subcommittee of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka which was a branch of the then [[Ministry of Higher Education and Highways|Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs]]. In 1959 he was appointed the President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1964 he represented Sri Lanka in the International Classical Music conference in Germany. \n[[File:Dunstan 4 lihgtroom.jpg|center|thumb|Dunstan representing Sri Lanka in International Classical Music Conference in Germany in 1964]]\n\n=== Head of Music at the Ministry of Education ===\nIn 1975 Dunstan left the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC) to take up an appointment as the Head of Music at the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry Of Education (Sri Lanka)]]. His main task was to improve standards and develop the Music Syllabus for the schools and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka.\n\n== End of Career ==\nAfter two years of service at the Ministry of Education, he was called upon to the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] to take up office as the head of the Sinhalese Music Division. He served in this position till he retired in 1983.\n\nIn appreciation of the services he rendered to Sri Lankan Music, the Tower Hall Foundation honoured him by bestowing him with the most coveted Kalamanya award.\n\nOn the 16th November 1986, Dunstan received the Kalamanya award from the President of Sri Lanka, Hon [[J. R. Jayewardene|J.R Jayawardene]] and the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R. Premadasa]].\n\nIn 1986 the National Television, [[Sri Lanka Rupavahini Corporation|Sri Lanka Rupavahini]] produced a two-year program called Pada Saraniiya\u00a0([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0daf \u0dc3\u0dbb\u0dab\u0dd2\u0dba; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0ba4 \u0b9a\u0bb0\u0ba3\u0bbf\u0baf; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u093e\u0927\u093e \u0938\u0930\u0928\u093f\u092f\u093e ) comprising of music composed by Dunstan de Silva.

He has made a significant contribution towards imparting an exclusive Sri Lankan identity to the Sinhalese music. He was a musician, artist, poet and a photographer blended in to one. He also devoted more than 20 years of his life to uplifting musical standards in radio broadcasting.\n\n== Early life ==\n{{no sources |section}}\nDunstan was born the eldest of nine children to businessman Abraham de Silva and Jane Kurukulasekara. In his childhood, he had cultivated a habit of visiting the [[Weligama]] beach and playing a flute he had crafted himself, to the melodies he heard over the gramophone at home. His father was not happy with this practice but his mother was more sympathetic.\n\nHe started his primary education at Sidhdhartha College [[Weligama]] in 1930 and moved to [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College Colombo]], a leading school in Sri Lanka for his secondary education in 1936. Dunstan successfully completed his Senior School Certificate in the English Medium from [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]] offering English Language and Literature, Latin, Mathematics, Physics and Visual Arts. During this time he wrote poems to the school magazine and also contributed his visual arts to the school magazine. During this period he also learnt to play the violin from the renowned musician Don Vincent Peiris.\n\nAfter completing early studies at Nalanda College, Dunstan moved to [[Ananda College]] Colombo, another leading school in Sri Lanka and successfully completed the London matriculation examination in 1939.\n\nHis mother wanted her elder son Dunstan to be an Engineer. In order to fulfil his mother's aspirations Dunstan entered the [[Maradana College of Technology|Ceylon Technical College]] to pursue Engineering studies. Though he had chosen engineering studies to make his mother happy, his interest and passion was in music and arts. After successfully completing the Intermediate examination at the Ceylon Technical College, Dunstan quit engineering to pursue a career in music and arts.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n== Tertiary Education ==\n{{no sources|section}}\nIn 1945, Dunstan received a government scholarship to study music at the prestigious [[Bhatkhande Music Institute]], in Lucknow, India. Distinguished scholar, Professor [[S N Ratanjankar]] was one of his teachers at the Bhatkhande Music Institute.\n\nDuring his term there, Dunstan participated in many music concerts produced by Bhatkhande Music Institute. He sang a Sinhalese song with his ''contemporary, a Bengali Student Bokul Dhaar in'' ''Malathi Maadhawa ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db8\u0dcf\u0dbd\u0dad\u0dd3 \u0db8\u0dcf\u0db0\u0dc0 ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bae\u0bbe\u0bb2\u0ba4\u0bc0 \u0bae\u0bbe\u0ba4\u0bb5 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092e\u093e\u0932\u0924\u0940 \u092e\u093e\u0927\u0935'' )  concert produced by  Kalyan Pakar''. As'' published in the [[Lankadeepa|Lankaadeepa]] newspaper 1952 March 17 this was supposedly the first ever Sinhalese song sung in a concert in India. At this concert Dunstan and Bokul sang the song P''udamu meakusum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:''\u00a0''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0daf\u0db8\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dda \u0d9a\u0dd4\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca ; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bae\u0bc1 \u0bae\u0bc7 \u0b95\u0bc1\u0b9a\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi|Hindi:]] \u092a\u0941\u0926\u092e\u0941 \u092e\u0915\u0941\u0938\u0941\u092e'' ) composed by [[Ananda Samarakoon|Ananda Samarakoo]]<nowiki/>n.\n\nDunstan was one of the five best students selected by the Bhatkhande Music Institute to sing the [[Indian National Anthem]] at the first independence celebrations in India on the 15 August 1947. After successfully completing seven years of music studies Dunstan returned to Sri Lanka with a Sangeet Visharad degree. Since then he was known publicly as Visharad P Dunstan de Silva. He was the third Sri Lankan to obtain the music Visharad degree with the legendary musicians [[Lionel Edirisinghe]] and [[Sunil Shantha]] being the first two.\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Teacher ===\nAfter giving up engineering studies, Dunstan joined his Alma mater\u00a0 Nalanda College as the resident Arts Teacher. The famous songwriter [[Karunaratne Abeysekera]] and [[Ridgeway Thilakeratne]] a one-time Director General of Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation were two of his students at [[Nalanda College, Colombo|Nalanda College]].\n\n=== Photographer ===\nAfter completing his music studies in India he returned to Sri Lanka in 1951 and pursued his third passion, Photography. Dunstan opened a Colour Photo Studio under the name Studio Colour at No 453 [[Union Place]], Colombo 2 which was supposedly the first colour studio in Sri Lanka. Within two years he opened up another branch of Studio Colour at No 259/1, Colombo 4.\n\nPrime Minister [[Ranasinghe Premadasa|R Premadasa]] was a good friend of Dunstan. Because of this trust as a good friend and in recognition of his photography skills the Prime Minister Premadasa bestowed an honorary position on Dunstan as his personal photographer when he was the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka. This was a prestigious position where Dunstan had to work in a high security environment having access to personal events in the Prime Minister's life.\n\nWhile being engaged in music, he continued simultaneously with his photography too. In 1978 he produced all colour photos for a 213-page publication titled, An Album of Buddhist Paintings published by the National Archives compiled by Professor [[Siri Gunasinghe]]. Dunstan provided photos of 40 Temple Wall Paintings for this publication covering the ancient sites of Gadaladeniya, Maulgampola, Hanguranketha, Degaldoru, Madawala, Kotagala and [[Dambulla cave temple|Dambulla Rock Temple]].\n\n=== Musician ===\nDustan grew up listening to gramophone music at home. His passion for music was conceived and evolved over the gramophone music he was exposed to at home as a child that took him through a music career placing him finally as the Head of Sinhalese Music Division at the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC).\n\nWhile engaging in his engineering studies at the Technical College, he followed two other passions that dearly touched his heart - Photography and Music. During this time an opportunity to play the flute for music programs in the [[Radio Ceylon]] came his way. He played the flute for the music programs of accomplished musicians [[Ananda Samarakoon]], Surya Shankar Molligoda and Anangalal Athukorala. The enticing lead accompaniment on the flute in Ananda Samarakoon's popular song of that vintage \"Punchi Suda Sudukatiya\" ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0db4\u0dd4\u0d82\u0da0\u0dd2\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dcf \u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4\u0d9a\u0dd0\u0da7\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0b9e\u0bcd\u0b9a\u0bbf \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bbe \u0b9a\u0bc1\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0b95\u0b9f\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bbe; [[Hindi]]:\u092a\u0902\u091a \u0938\u0941\u0926\u093e \u0938\u0941\u0915\u0943\u0924\u093f\u092f\u093e) is credited to de Silva.\n\nWhile being engaged in the photography business Dunstan continued to work on his prime passion of Music, which he studied at the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music Institute]]. In 1952 he composed music for the Opera Pushpa Shrungara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: ''\u0db4\u0dd4\u0dc2\u0dca\u0db4 \u0dc1\u0dd8\u0db1\u0dca\u0d9c\u0dcf\u0dbb; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0baa\u0bc1\u0bb8\u0bcd\u0baa \u0bb8\u0bcd\u0bb1\u0bc1\u0b99\u0bcd\u0b95\u0bbe\u0bb1 ; [[Hindi]]: \u092a\u0941\u0937\u094d\u092a\u093e \u0936\u094d\u0930\u0902\u0917\u093e\u0930\u093e'' ) directed by [[Shesha Palihakkara]] dancer, film actor, and producer. Dunstan made his debut as a music composer for Pushpa Shrungara.\n\nDuring a period of 21 years from 1954 to 1975 as the Head of Sinhalese Music at [[Radio Ceylon]] and [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] Dunstan produced many popular programs such as\n\n*''Rasadhara ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]] :\u0dbb\u0dc3\u0db0\u0dcf\u0dbb\u0dcf; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bbe\u0bb1\u0bbe ; [[Hindi]]:\u0930\u0938 \u0927\u0930\u093e )''\n*''Guwanviduli Geetha Nataka ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0d9c\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0daf\u0dd4\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad \u0db1\u0dcf\u0da7\u0d9a; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b95\u0bc1\u0bb5\u0ba3\u0bcd \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba4\u0bc1\u0bb2\u0bbf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4 \u0ba8\u0bbe\u0b9f\u0b95 ; [[Hindi]]: \u0917\u0941\u0935\u0928\u0935\u093f\u0926\u0941\u0932\u0940 \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e \u0928\u093e\u091f\u0915  )''\n*''Vijaya Geetha ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dc0\u0dd2\u0da2\u0dba \u0d9c\u0dd3\u0dad; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0b9c\u0baf \u0b95\u0bc0\u0ba4; [[Hindi]]: \u0935\u093f\u091c\u092f\u093e \u0917\u0940\u0924\u093e )''\n*''Raaga Rasa Vindhana ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]:\u0dbb\u0dcf\u0d9c \u0dbb\u0dc3 \u0dc0\u0dd2\u0db1\u0dca\u0daf\u0db1; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0bb0\u0bbe\u0b95 \u00a0 \u0bb0\u0b9a \u0bb5\u0bbf\u0ba8\u0bcd\u0ba4\u0ba9;  [[Hindi]]: \u0930\u093e\u0917 \u0930\u0938 \u0935\u093f\u0926\u093e\u0928\u093e )''\n*''Sath Piyum ([[Sinhala language|Sinhala]]: \u0dc3\u0dad\u0dca\u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dca; [[Tamil language|Tamil]]: \u0b9a\u0ba4\u0bcd\u00a0 \u0baa\u0bbf\u0baf\u0bc1\u0bae\u0bcd ; [[Hindi]]: \u0938\u0920 \u092a\u093f\u092f\u0941\u092e )''\n\nIn addition to being the producer he also composed music for these.\n\n=== Artist ===\nDespite spending his professional life mostly in music, he continued to engage in art which he practised since the time that he was the art teacher at Nalanda College. Dunstan designed the cover page of the significant publication called Sangeetha Sanhithaa<ref>{{Cite book|last=Abayasundara|first=Wimal|title=Sangeetha Sanhitha|publisher=S Godage Saha Sahodarayo|year=|isbn=9552055008|location=|pages=}}</ref> written by Eminent Sinhala poet and lyricist and Kalakeerthi Pundit Wimal Abeysundara.<ref>{{Cite news|last=Abeysundara|first=Wimal|url=http://www.island.lk/2008/06/13/news19.html|title=Wimal Abeysundara no more|date=|work=The Island|access-date=17 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Poet ===\n[[File:Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon.jpg|thumb|Young Dunstan as a Flautist in Radio Ceylon Orchestra]]\nDunstan continued to write poems another-pastime that he had developed during his school years. He was a regular poet featured in leading English newspapers of Sri Lanka. There remain more than 50 unpublished poems written by Dunstan to date. One of those is \"The Flute\", which was the most sacred music instrument to him which he excelled in since early childhood. He used the flute to create his music compositions.\n\n\"The Flute\" is a beautiful poem Dunstan wrote about his beloved flute instrument which accompanied him from early life to the end of the life. He learnt music over the flute, his first job as a musician was to play the flute in [[Radio Ceylon]] orchestra and later he composed music using a flute.\n\n=== Visiting lecturer ===\n[[Lionel Edirisinghe]] Founder Principal of the Government Music College which later matured into the [[University of the Visual and Performing Arts]], offered a visiting lecturer position to Dunstan.\n\nWhen Dunstan became busy with his work at the Radio Ceylon producing music programs and working as a visiting lecture he didn't have enough time to spend on his photography business.\n\nThese dual engagements with the Radio Ceylon and the University competing for most of his time the simultaneous management of his photography business became untenable.\u00a0Consequently, he handed over his successful Studio Colour business to his brother Rohitha to continue.\n\n== Compositions ==\nFew of his compositions are;\n\n*\"Obata mathaka naa\"\u00a0 \u0d94\u0db6\u0da7 \u0db8\u0dad\u0d9a \u0db1\u0dd1]\n*\"Sudu piruwata andalaa\" (\u0dc3\u0dd4\u0daf\u0dd4 \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0\u0da7 \u0d87\u0db3\u0dbd\u0dcf)\n*\"Wanamal piyali salaa\" (\u0dc0\u0db1\u0db8\u0dbd\u0dca \u0db4\u0dd2\u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0dc3\u0dbd\u0dcf)\n*\"Prakgna Pradeepa Dalwaa\" (\u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0da5\u0dcf \u0db4\u0dca\u200d\u0dbb\u0daf\u0dd3\u0db4 \u0daf\u0dbd\u0dca\u0dc0\u0dcf)\n*\"Oba dakumen yali jeewath wannata\" (\u0d94\u0db6 \u0daf\u0dd0\u0d9a\u0dd4\u0db8\u0dd9\u0db1\u0dca \u0dba\u0dbd\u0dd2 \u0da2\u0dd3\u0dc0\u0dad\u0dca \u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca\u0db1\u0da7)\n*\"Pipunu malea ruwa\" (\u0db4\u0dd2\u0db4\u0dd4\u0db1\u0dd4 \u0db8\u0dc5\u0dda \u0dbb\u0dd4\u0dc0)\n*\"Kahawan goyamata\" (\u0d9a\u0dc4\u0dc0\u0db1\u0dca \u0d9c\u0ddc\u0dba\u0db8\u0da7)\n\n== Mentor ==\n{{no sources|section}}\nDunstan was a mentor to many upcoming singers at his time in the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]]. When [[Sanath Nandasiri|Sanath Nanadasiri]] a stalwart of Sri Lankan music in later years returned to the country in 1965, conferred with a Visharad degree from the [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhatkande Music Institute]], Dunstan extended him an opportunity to participate with a debut rendition as a new artist for the Navadali Hena radio musical. Dunstan called upon Somathilaka Jayamaha another musician who reached the top rungs later who worked as an admin officer in [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to the free music classes he conducted at YMBA Colombo. When Somathilaka finished the course Dunstan recruited him to the choir in his programs. Over time Somathilaka was promoted as an A-Grade singer and reached the upper echelons as an accomplished singer. Devananda Waidyasekara was also another talent Dunstan picked and groomed at [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation|SLBC]] to turn into an accomplished singer.\n\n== Two Milestones ==\nThe year 1954 marked two important milestones in his life. One was in his personal life and the other was in his professional life. On 24 February 1954 he married Hilda Fonseka from [[Wadduwa]]. Dunstan had met Hilda when she came to see her music teacher during the time she was a student at Sri Sumangala Girls School, Panadura. Gunaseana de Silva who studied at [[Bhatkhande Music Institute Deemed University|Bhathkande Music institute]] with Dunstan proposed Hilda to Dunstan.\n\nOn 5 March 1955, Dunstan and Hilda were blessed with a precious daughter Ayanthi Manjula.\n\nIn the same year Dunstan got married, he received an invitation from the then Director General of the Radio Ceylon, [[M. J. Perera|M J Perera]], to join the Radio Ceylon. In 1954 Dunstan joined the Radio Ceylon as the Head of Sinhalese Music Programs.\n\nOn the 5th January 1967 Radio Ceylon was instituted as a public corporation as the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation. He continued to serve as the head of Sinhalese Music Programs with the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]].\n\n== Service to Sinhalese Music ==\nDuring his 21 years of service in the national broadcasting corporation, he dedicated his time to uplifting musical standards and developing Sinhalese music to evolve towards a Sri Lankan identity, moving away from the dependence on foreign tunes. His good friend Pandit [[W. D. Amaradeva|W D Amaradeva]] contributed immensely to this endeavour with his own research efforts in this arena. \u00a0\n\nDunstan organised many classical music concerts inviting reputed singers and musicians from India affording Sri Lankan music lovers a chance to listen to them. He brought over his good friend legendary sitar player [[Ravi Shankar]] five times to Sri Lanka. [[Lakshmi Shankar]], Ustad [[Alla Rakha|Allarakha]] Qureshi, [[V. G. Jog|Vishnu Govind Jog]], Pandit Dinkar Kaikini <ref>{{Cite news|last=Kaikini|first=Dinkar|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/hindi/music/music-events/A-tribute-to-Pandit-Dinkar-Kaikini/articleshow/7309862.cms|title=ETIMES|date=18 April 2020|work=Entertainment Times|access-date=18 April 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and Dipali Nag were other accomplished musicians he brought from India. \n[[File:Dunstan--Edit.jpg|thumb|L to R- Dunstan, his daughter and wife, Ravi Shankar, Laxmie Shankar and Ustad Allarakha Qureshi]]\nNone of those concerts were for commercial benefit. He organised those only to provide an opportunity for the Sri Lankan music lovers to listen to the music of those legends. There were times that he had to pocket out shortfalls in organising these concerts.\n\nDunstan was the founding secretary of the music subcommittee of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka which was a branch of the then [[Ministry of Higher Education and Highways|Ministry of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs]]. In 1959 he was appointed the President of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.\n\nIn 1964 he represented Sri Lanka in the International Classical Music conference in Germany. \n[[File:Dunstan 4 lihgtroom.jpg|center|thumb|Dunstan representing Sri Lanka in International Classical Music Conference in Germany in 1964]]\n\n=== Head of Music at the Ministry of Education ===\nIn 1975 Dunstan left the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] (SLBC) to take up an appointment as the Head of Music at the [[Ministry of Education (Sri Lanka)|Ministry Of Education (Sri Lanka)]]. His main task was to improve standards and develop the Music Syllabus for the schools and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka.\n\n== End of Career ==\nAfter two years of service at the Ministry of Education, he was called upon to the [[Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation]] to take up office as the head of the Sinhalese Music Division. He served in this position till he retired in 1983.\n\nIn appreciation of the services he rendered to Sri Lankan Music, the Tower Hall Foundation honoured him by bestowing him with the most coveted Kalamanya award.\n\nOn the 16th November 1986, Dunstan received the Kalamanya award from the President of Sri Lanka, Hon [[J.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade<ref name=\"OoB\">Official Records of the American Civil War of the Union and Confederate Armies, U.S. War Department</ref> of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref><ref name=\"Dyer\">Dyer</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=\"Cities\">[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863<ref name=\"Dyer\" />.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=\"Lightning\">Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Sunderland</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.<br>\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=\"ABT1\" />\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=\"Lightning\" />\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=\"SunSpencer\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

Its regiments were nominally the 1st Brigade<ref name=\"OoB\">Official Records of the American Civil War of the Union and Confederate Armies, U.S. War Department</ref> of MGEN [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] 4th Division of [[George Henry Thomas|Thomas']] [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]]. Operationally, they were detached from the division and serving as a mobile mounted infantry to support any of the army's corps. Col [[John T. Wilder]] was its commander. As initially organized. the brigade had the following regiments:|<ref>Baumgartner, p. 70</ref><ref name=\"Dyer\">Dyer</ref>\n* [[92nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment|92nd Illinois Mounted Infantry]]: Col Smith D.

Miller\n* [[18th Independent Battery Indiana Light Artillery]]\n[[File:John T Wilder monument Chickamauga.jpg|thumb|Monument to Wilder and his Lightning Brigade at [[Chickamauga and Chattanooga National Military Park]]]]\n\n==Formation==\nIn response to [[John Hunt Morgan]]\u2019s October 1862 raid, the brigade was sent by Major General [[William Rosecrans|William S. Rosecrans]] in pursuit. In an effort move faster, the brigade mounted in mule wagons. The brigade nearly caught Morgan, but when they entered the last rebel bivouac, Morgan had escaped. In this effort, John T. Wilder served as the commander of the 17th Indiana, one of the component regiments in the brigade.\n\nOn 22 December, 1862 in Gallatin, Tennessee, [[John T. Wilder]] took over command of the brigade which at that time consisted of the 92nd and 98th Illinois Infantry Regiments, the 17th, 72nd, and [[75th Indiana Infantry Regiment]]s, and the 18th Indiana Battery of Light Artillery. His initial combat mission was to pursue another of Morgan\u2019s raids into Kentucky intended to sever the Army of the Cumberland's primary supply line. Lacking sufficient cavalry to screen his army as he moved south toward what would be the [[Second Battle of Murfreesboro|Battle of Stones River]] as part of the [[Stones River Campaign]], Rosecrans again had to use infantry to chase off Morgan. Trying to speed their movement, these infantry units deployed partially by rail. Wilder also unsuccessfully tried to replicate the use of mule-drawn wagons with the addition of men mounting the mules pulling the wagons<ref name=\"Cities\">[https://www.oocities.org/wildersbrigade/history.html Wilder's Brigade Mounted Infantry Living History Society]</ref>. Unfortunately, they still traveled the majority of the pursuit on foot over unimproved, that is unpaved, roads. Despite the use of rail and wagons to speed up the pursuit, the mission was a failure with Morgan's command escaping at the Rolling Fork River.<ref>Duke, p. 71, Thomas, p. 150</ref>The difference in speed between cavalry and infantry was too much from the start.\n\nAs a result of the failure, Rosecrans and his subordinates revisited the experiment with wagons from the October events and realized the solution to their problems was the early role of dragoons as mounted infantrymen<ref name=\"Dyer\" />. Several times, Rosecrans wrote to the Union General-in-Chief Major General [[Henry Wager Halleck]] stating his intention to convert/establish units of mounted infantry. He also felt that he needed to outfit all of his cavalry with repeating weapons. When he felt he was not being heard, he went over Halleck directly to War Secretary Edward M Stanton. In a dispatch from 2 February, he explained his reasons to Secretary Stanton:\n{{Quote\n|text=I telegraphed the General-in-Chief that 2,000 carbines or revolving rifles were required to arm our cavalry.\nHe replied as though he thought it a complaint.\nOne rebel cavalryman takes on an average three of our infantry to watch our communications, while our progress is made slow and cautious, and we command the forage of the country only be sending large train guards.\nIt is of prime necessity, in every point of view, to master their cavalry.  I propose to do this, first, by so arming our cavalry as to give it its maximum strength.  Second, by having animals and saddles temporarily to mount infantry brigades for marches and enterprises.<ref name=Cities/>\n}}\n\nWilder, an innovative and creative man, was an eager advocate to Rosecrans for mounted infantry as a solution. On 12 February 1863, Rosecrans ordered Wilder to find mounts for his brigade. The regiments also voted on whether to convert to mounted infantry.  All but the 75th Indiana voted to change to mounted infantry. The 123rd Illinois who had wanted to become mounted infantry transferred from the 1st Brigade of the 5th Division of XIV Corps to replace them<ref name=OoB1>[http://cdl.library.cornell.edu/moa/browse.monographs/waro.html \"Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1)\" United States. War Department], pages 411\u2013424</ref>\n. Through February 1863, Wilder he obtained around a thousand mules to mount his command. Due to the obstinacy of the mules, horses were frequently seized from local stocks in Tennessee as contraband and replaced the mules.\n\nIn theory and in practice, the brigade would use their mounts to travel rapidly to contact, but upon engagement, the soldiers would fight dismounted. Due to this speed of deployment, the unit earned the nickname, \u201cThe Lightning Brigade,\u201d and it would prove the validity of its conversion in the campaign in the Western theater. They were also sometimes known as the \"Hatchet Brigade\" because they received long-handled [[hatchet]]s to carry instead of [[cavalry]] [[Sabre|saber]]s.\n\nAs well as mounting the command for faster deployment, Wilder felt that muzzle-loaded rifles were too difficult to use traveling on horseback. Like Rosecrans, he also believed that the superiority of repeating rifles were worth their price in return for the great increase in firepower. The repeating rifles also had the standoff range similar to the standard infantry [[Lorenz rifle|Lorenzes]], [[Springfield Model 1861|Springfields]], and [[Pattern 1853 Enfield|Enfields]] in use by the Army of the Cumberland. He felt the repeating and breech loading carbines in use by the Federal cavalry that lacked the accuracy at long range that his brigade would need. \n\nWhile Rosecrans looked at the regiment's five-shot [[Colt revolving rifle]] that would equip other units in the Army of the Cumberland (particularly seeing action with the [[21st Ohio Infantry|21st Ohio Volunteer Infantry]] Union forces at [[Snodgrass Hill]] during the [[Battle of Chickamauga]]), Wilder was initially opting for the [[Henry rifle|Henry]] repeating rifle as the proper weapon to arm his brigade. In early March, Wilder arranged a proposal for [[New Haven Arms Company]] (which later became famous as Winchester Repeating Arms) to supply his brigade with the sixteen-shot Henry if the soldiers paid for the weapons out of pocket. He had received backing from banks in Indiana on loans to be signed by each soldier and cosigned by Wilder. New Haven could come agreement with Wilder despite the financing.<ref name=Leigh>[https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/12/25/colonel-wilders-lightning-brigade/ \"Colonel Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade,\" Phil Leigh, ''New York Times'' 25 Dec 2012]</ref><ref name=Disaster>[https://www.historynet.com/battle-of-chickamauga-colonel-john-wilders-lightning-brigade-prevented-total-disaster.htm \"Battle of Chickamauga: Colonel John Wilder\u2019s Lightning Brigade Prevented Total Disaster,\" Hubert Jordan, ''America\u2019s Civil War'', Jul 1997]</ref>\n\nAfter attending a promotional demonstration by [[Christopher Spencer]] for the Army of the Cumberland of his [[Spencer repeating rifle]]<ref>[http://www.civilwar.si.edu/weapons_spencer.html A Spencer at the Smithsonian Institution]</ref>, Wilder proposed the Henry arrangement to Spencer. Spencer agreed and got the Ordnance Department to send a shipment to the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Korn, p. 21.</ref>The majority of the shipment armed all men of the brigade.\n\nThe brigade\u2019s new weapon used a seven rimfire-cartridge tubular magazine that came through the butt. This rifle's increase in firepower would quickly make it most effective, deadly weapons in the Civil War. With new mounts and new weapons, the brigade worked out new tactics. Alongside the Army of the Cumberland's other mounted infantry units, Wilder developed new training and tactics through May and June 1863<ref name=\"Dyer\" />.\n\n== Tullahoma Campaign ==\n{{main|Tullahoma Campaign}}\n[[Image:Tullahoma Campaign.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Tullahoma campaign\n{{legend|#ff0000|Confederate}}\n{{legend|#0000ff|Union}}\n]]\n===Hoover's Gap===\n{{main|Battle of Hoover's Gap}}\nOn June 23, 1863, Rosecrans deployed forces to feign an attack on [[Shelbyville, Tennessee|Shelbyville]] while massing forces against Bragg's right<ref>Frisby</ref>. His troops moved out toward Liberty, Bellbuckle, and Hoover's Gaps through the [[Highland Rim]] (near [[Beechgrove, Coffee County, Tennessee|Beechgrove, Tennessee]])<ref name=\"Lightning\">Lightning at Hoover's Gap: the Story of Wilder's Brigade, Sunderland</ref>. On June 24 in pouring rain that would persist for 17 days (Union soldiers spread the humorous rumor during the campaign that the name Tullahoma was a combination of the Greek words \"tulla\", meaning \"mud\", and \"homa\", meaning \"more mud\".)<ref>Eicher, p. 496; Korn, p. 29.</ref>, Maj. Gen. [[George Henry Thomas|George H. Thomas's]] men, spearheaded by Colonel [[John T. Wilder]]'s \"Lightning Brigade\", made for [[Battle of Hoover's Gap|Hoover's Gap]]. The brigade showed the advantage of their speed despite the weather by reaching the gap nearly 9 miles ahead of Thomas's main body.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\">Kennedy, p. 225.</ref> Despite orders from the divisional commander, General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] to fall back to his infantry, which was still six miles away, Wilder decided to take and hold the position. \n\nThe command surprised Confederate Colonel J. Russell Butler's 1st (3rd) Kentucky Cavalry Regiment at the entrance of the gap<ref name=\"NPS\">[https://www.nps.gov/chch/planyourvisit/tullahoma-campaign-bus-tour.htm NPS Hoover's Gap]</ref>. After skirmishing briefly and withdrawing under pressure, the rebels were unable to reach the gap before the better-fed horses of the Lightning Brigade. The Kentuckians fell apart as a unit and, unluckily for the Confederates, failed in their cavalry mission to provide intelligence of the Union movement to their higher headquarters. Although Wilder's main infantry support was well behind his mounted brigade and his division commander Major General [[Joseph J. Reynolds]] had directed him to fall back to the main force after contact, he determined to continue pushing through to seize and hold the Gap before the Confederate reinforcements could prevent him. The brigade drove the 1st Kentucky through the entire seven mile length of Hoover's Gap. At the other end, they were met with artillery fire and found out that the brigade and its one battery were outnumbered four-to-one <ref name=ABT1>[https://www.battlefields.org/learn/primary-sources/battle-hoovers-gap \"The Road to Chickamauga,\" James Connolly, ''Primary Sources'', American Battlefield Trust]</ref><ref name=Lightning/>. The brigade had met Brig. Gen. [[William B. Bate]]'s brigade of Maj. Gen. [[Alexander P. Stewart]]'s division.\n\nWilder entrenched on the hills south of the gap and determined to hold this extremely advanced position.<ref name=\"Kennedy225\"/>. The Bate's brigade, supported by Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod Johnson]]'s brigade and some artillery, assaulted Wilder's position, but was driven back by the concentrated fire of the Spencers, losing 146 killed and wounded (almost a quarter of his force) to Wilder's 61. Colonel James Connolly, commander of the 123rd Illinois, wrote:\n{{Quote\n|text=As soon as the enemy opened on us with their artillery we dismounted and formed line of battle on a hill just at the south entrance to the \"Gap,\" and our battery of light artillery was opened on them, a courier was dispatched to the rear to hurry up reinforcements, our horses were sent back some distance out of the way of bursting shells, our regiment was assigned to support the battery, the other three regiments were properly disposed, and not a moment too soon, for these preparations were scarcely completed when the enemy opened on us a terrific fire of shot and shell from five different points, and their masses of infantry, with flags flying, moved out of the woods on our right in splendid style; there were three or four times our number already in sight and still others came pouring out of the woods beyond. Our regiment lay on the hill side in mud and water, the rain pouring down in torrents, while each shell screamed so close to us as to make it seem that the next would tear us to pieces.<br>\n\nPresently the enemy got near enough to us to make a charge on our battery, and on they came; our men are on their feet in an instant and a terrible fire from the \"Spencers\" causes the advancing regiment to reel and its colors fall to the ground, but in an instant their colors are up again and on they come, thinking to reach the battery before our guns can be reloaded, but they \"reckoned without their host,\" they didn't know we had the \"Spencers,\" and their charging yell was answered by another terrible volley, and another and another without cessation, until the poor regiment was literally cut to pieces, and but few men of that 20th Tennessee that attempted the charge will ever charge again. During all the rest of the fight at \"Hoover's Gap\" they never again attempted to take that battery. After the charge they moved four regiments around to our right and attempted to get in our rear, but they were met by two of our regiments posted in the woods, and in five minutes were driven back in the greatest disorder, with a loss of 250 killed and wounded.<ref>Connolly, p. 92.</ref><ref name=ABT1/>\n}} \nAfter a long day of combat at 1900, the brigade's morale was uplifted by the arrival of a fresh battery at the gallop which meant the XIV Corps were close behind. A half hour, the Corps' the main infantry units arrived to secure the position against any further assaults. The corps commander, General Thomas, shook Wilder's hand and told him, \"You have saved the lives of a thousand men by your gallant conduct today. I didn't expect to get to this gap for three days.\"<ref>Woodworth, pp. 21\u201324; Connelly, pp. 126\u201327; Korn, pp. 24\u201326.</ref> Rosecrans also arrived on the scene.  Rather than reprimand Wilder for disobeying orders, he congratulated him for doing so, telling him it would have cost thousands of lives to take the position if he had abandoned it.<ref>Cozzens, p. 27</ref> <ref name=Lightning/>\n\nOn June 25, Bate and Johnson renewed their attempts to drive the Union men out of Hoover's Gap but failed against the Lightning Brigade now with its parent division and corps. Rosecrans brought the forward movement of the Army of the Cumberland to a halt as the roads had become quagmires. Bragg took no effective action to counter Rosecrans because his cavalry commanders were not relaying intelligence to him reliably\u2014Forrest was not informing of the weak nature of the Union right flank attack and Wheeler failed to report the movement of Crittenden's corps through Bradyville and toward Bragg's rear.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 28\u201330; Connelly, p. 127; Korn, p. 28.</ref>\n\nAs the Lighting Brigade and the 5th Division held at Hoover's Gap, Bragg soon came to realize the threat of Thomas. Meanwhile, Rosecrans shifted his forces to reinforce Thomas at the gap.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 31\u201333; Connelly, pp. 127\u201328; Korn, p. 28.</ref> Unfortunately for Bragg, infrequent direct communication with [[William J. Hardee]], his corps commander who commanded Stewart left an ignorance of Bragg's campaign strategy. That ignorance coupled with a low opinion of his commander's intellect, led Hardee to do what \"he deemed best for saving an army whose commander was an idiot.\"<ref>Woodworth, p. 33.</ref> That course was to order his battered troops under Stewart at Hoover's Gap to retreat towards Wartrace. His retreat served to only make Thomas's breakout more effective, leaving Bragg with his right flank gone. To keep his army together, he had to order Polk and Hardee to withdraw to Tullahoma on June 27.<ref>Woodworth, p. 34; Connelly, pp. 128\u201329; Lamers, pp. 280\u201382.</ref>\n\n===The Raid ===\n[[Image:John T Wilder.jpg|thumb|left|John T. Wilder]]\nThe Lightning Brigade reached Manchester at 0800 on June 27, and the remainder of the division occupied the town by noon. On June 28, the brigade left on a raid to damage the railroad infrastructure in Bragg's rear, heading south toward Decherd, a small town on the [[Nashville, Chattanooga and St. Louis Railway|Nashville & Chattanooga Railroad]]. The rain-swollen [[Elk River (Tennessee)|Elk River]] proved a significant obstacle, but they disassembled a nearby mill and constructed a raft to float their [[howitzer]]s across. They defeated a small garrison of Confederates in Decherd, tore up 300 yards of track and a burned the railroad depot filled with Confederate rations. The next morning they rode into the foothills of the Cumberland Mountains, reaching the town of [[Sewanee, Tennessee|Sewanee]] where they destroyed a branch rail line. Although pursued by a larger Confederate force, the Lightning Brigade was back in Manchester by noon, June 30. They had not lost a single man on their raid.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 36\u201338.</ref>\n\nThe effectiveness of the brigade led to an operational detachment from the division command while maintaining an administrative link to Reynold's division. Operationally, the brigade would act independently as a mobile reserve for the army.\n\nWith his corps commanders unnerved by the Lightning Brigade's raid, at 3 p.m. on June 30, Bragg issued orders for a nighttime withdrawal from fortifications in Tullahoma across the Elk River. By leaving before the Union assault, Bragg gave up an opportunity to inflict potentially serious damage on the Army of the Cumberland.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 38\u201340; Connelly, pp. 130\u201332; Lamers, pp. 284\u201385; Korn, p. 30.</ref> Initially positioned below the Elk River, Hardee and Polk felt they should retreat farther south, to the town of Cowan. In turn, their loss of nerve passed to Bragg who deemed Cowan indefensible on July 2. Without consulting his corps commanders, on July 3 Bragg ordered a retreat to Chattanooga. The army crossed the Tennessee River on July 4; a cavalry pursuit under Phil Sheridan was not successful in trapping the rear guard of Bragg's army before they crossed the river. All the Confederate units had encamped near [[Lookout Mountain]] by July 7.<ref>Woodworth, pp. 40\u201342; Connelly, p. 133; Lamers, pp. 285\u201388.</ref>\n\n== Chickamauga Campaign ==\n{{Main|Chickamauga Campaign}}\n===Second Battle of Chattanooga===\n{{Main|Second Battle of Chattanooga}} (August 21 \u2013 September 8, 1863)\n[[File:Chattanooga_II_Battlefield_Tennessee.jpg|thumb|Map of Chattanooga II Battlefield core and study areas by the [[American Battlefield Protection Program]]]]\nHaving driven Confederate forces from middle Tennessee, the Army of the Cumberland paused to refit and replenish their units. Rosecrans did not immediately pursue Bragg and \"give the finishing blow to the rebellion\" as Stanton urged. He paused to regroup and study the difficult choices of pursuit into mountainous regions. \n\nOn August 16, 1863, Rosecrans launched his campaign to take [[Chattanooga, Tennessee]]. The Lighting Brigade played a crucial role in this campaign. Rosecrans ordered the  brigade to shell Chattanooga from the western side of the Tennessee River and skirmish with the main Confederate force in the city to divert attention away from the flanking column sent southwest of the city. The Lightning Brigade marched to a location northeast of Chattanooga where the Confederates could see them, reinforcing [[General (CSA)|Gen.]] [[Braxton Bragg]]'s expectations of a Union attack on the town from that direction.<ref name=NPS2>[http://www.nps.gov/history/hps/abpp/battles/tn018.htm NPS Chickamauga]</ref> By August 21, the brigade had deployed along the [[Tennessee River]] to the east opposite Chattanooga. Wilder ordered the 18th Indiana Light Artillery ([[Captain (U.S. Army)|Capt.]] [[Colonel Eli Lilly|Eli Lilly]]'s battery) to begin shelling the town. The shells caught many soldiers and civilians in town in church observing a day of prayer and fasting. The bombardment sank two steamers docked at the landing and created a great deal of consternation amongst the Confederates.<ref name=NPS2/>\n\nContinuing periodically over the next two weeks, the shelling helped keep Bragg's attention to the northeast while the bulk of Rosecrans's army crossed the Tennessee River well west and south of Chattanooga. The diversion was successful, with Bragg concentrating his army east of Chattanooga. When Bragg learned on September 8 that the Union army was in force southwest of the city, he abandoned Chattanooga and marched his [[Army of Tennessee]] into [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Bragg's army marched down the [[LaFayette Road]] and camped in the city of [[LaFayette, Georgia|LaFayette]].<ref name=NPS2/>\n\n===Skirmish at Ringgold===\n(September 11\u201312, 1863)\nAs Rosecrans moved his forces south and west, the heavily wooded and hilly terrain soon had 60 miles of separation between his three making mutual support nearly impossible. It gradually dawned on him that Bragg's Army was neither demoralized nor in disarray. It was not defeated.\nBragg attacked General [[James S. Negley]]'s isolated division of the Union [[XIV Corps (Union Army)|XIV Corps]], commanded by George H. Thomas, before Rosecrans could concentrate the rest of his army across Chickamauga Creek near Davis' Cross Roads. Negley retreated and met up with the rest of the XIV Corps. Thomas confirmed to Rosecrans that the rebels were not falling back as they had previously believed but instead seemed to be massing for an imminent attack. Concerned about mutual support, Thomas and McCook made plans to shift their corps closer together to the north.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 65\u201375.</ref>\n\nMeanwhile on 11 September, the Lightning Brigade, attached to [[Thomas Leonidas Crittenden|Crittenden's]] [[XXI Corps (Union Army)|XXI Corps]]<ref name=\"OoB2\">Tullahoma Campaign Union order of battle, organization and strength (Official Records, Series I, Volume XXIII, Part 1, pages 585\u2013586</ref> advanced from Lee and Gordon\u2019s Mill to Ringgold, GA. There it skirmished with and defeated Col John S. Scott's brigade of [[John Pegram (general)|John Pegram's]] Division of [[Forrest's Cavalry Corps]] and then drove off Confederate reinforcements. It returned to the mill by nightfall. The following morning, it was again ordered to advance to Ringgold. Four miles short of the town, it again ran into elements of Pegram's Division. After dispersing these units, Wilder found that [[Otho F. Strahl|Strahl's Brigade]] of Cheatham's Division of Polk's Corps had cut the brigade's route back to the mill. Although the Lightning Brigade was surrounded, the rebels unsure of its identity, size, and strength, did not press home an attack.<ref name=Disaster/>\n\nAt nightfall, the Wilder deceived the Confederates by spreading campfires over a large area to make the Confederates believe his force was much larger. He formed four of his regiments and the battery into a defensive perimeter and had the fifth, the 72nd Indiana look for an escape route. After successfully locating an exit, the brigade withdrew back to XXI Corps without the loss of a man.<ref name=\"SunSpencer\">Wilder's Lightning Brigade and Its Spencer Repeaters, Sunderland</ref>\n\n===Chickamauga===\n{{main|Battle of Chickamauga}} (September 19\u201320, 1863)\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep18.png|thumb|upright=1.5|September 18 movements on the eve of the Battle of Chickamauga]]\n\nRealizing that part of his force had narrowly escaped a Confederate trap, Rosecrans abandoned his plans for a pursuit and began to concentrate his scattered forces near Stevens Gap.<ref name=Lamers313>Lamers, p. 313.</ref> For the next four days, both armies attempted to improve their dispositions. Rosecrans continued to concentrate his forces, intending to withdraw as a single body to Chattanooga. By September 17, the three Union corps were now much less vulnerable to individual defeat. Reinforced with two divisions arriving from Virginia under Lt. Gen. [[James Longstreet]], and a division from Mississippi under Brig. Gen. [[Bushrod R. Johnson]], Bragg decided to move his army northward on the morning of 18th and advance toward Chattanooga, forcing Rosecrans's army to fight or to withdraw. If Rosecrans fought, he risked being driven back into McLemore's Cove. \n\nThe Lightning Brigade was sent to defend Alexander's Bridge over the Chickamauga on 17 September. The 92nd Illinois detached to protect the army's line if communication back to Chattanooga. The next day, 18 September, the Lightning Brigade blocked the crossing against the approach of [[William H. T. Walker|W.H.T. Walker]]'s Corps. Armed with [[Spencer repeating rifle]]s and Capt. Lilly's four guns of the 18th Indiana Battery, the brigade held off a brigade of Brig. Gen. [[St. John Richardson Liddell|St. John Liddell's]] division, which suffered 105 casualties against Wilder's superior firepower. Walker moved his men downstream a mile to Lambert's Ford, an unguarded crossing, and was able to cross around 1630, considerably behind schedule. Wilder, concerned about his left flank after Minty's loss of Reed's Bridge, withdrew the brigade to a new blocking position near the Viniard farm.<ref>Woodworth, p. 83; Cozzens, p. 198; Tucker, pp. 112\u201317; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 46\u201347.</ref> By dark, Bushrod Johnson's division had halted in front of Wilder's position. Walker had crossed the creek, but his troops were well scattered along the road behind Johnson. <ref>Cozzens, pp. 199\u2013200; Kennedy, p. 230; Robertson (Fall 2007), pp. 49\u201350; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112.</ref>\n\nAlthough Bragg had achieved some degree of surprise, he failed to exploit it strongly. Rosecrans, observing the dust raised by the marching Confederates in the morning, anticipated Bragg's plan. He ordered Thomas and McCook to Crittenden's support, and while the Confederates were crossing the creek, Thomas began to arrive in Crittenden's rear area.<ref>Woodworth, p. 85; Lamers, p. 322; Tucker, p. 118; Eicher, p. 581; Esposito, map 112; Robertson (Fall 2007), p. 43.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, early afternoon of September 19]]\nThrough the morning to midday of 19 September, the Lightning Brigade held its position as a reserve near Viniard farm as the battle began. As the battle progressed, the front developed in a north south direction just west of Chickamauga Creek. Viniard farm was just right of the Union Center held by Maj. Gen. [[Alexander McDowell McCook]]'s XX Corps. \n \nAt around 2 p.m, the Johnson's division (Hood's corps) forced Union Brig. Gen. [[Jefferson C. Davis]]'s two brigade division of the XX corps back across the LaFayette Road. Johnson to continue the advance with two brigades in line and one in reserve. On the right, Col. John Fulton's brigade routed King's brigade and linked up with Bate at Brotherton field. On the left, the Lighting Brigade in its reserve position repulsed Brig. Gen. John Gregg's brigade with heavy losses. Gregg was seriously wounded and his brigade advance halted. The brigade also repulsed Brig. Gen. Evander McNair's brigade, called up from the rear, when they attacked.<ref>Cozzens, pp. 196, 199\u2013200, 214; Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 44\u201345; Woodworth, p. 92; Tucker, pp. 166, 172\u201373; Korn, p. 48; Eicher, pp. 582\u201383.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep19 3.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Actions, late afternoon to dark, September 19]]\nAs the battle continued, the Union line was pushed back north to the Viniard house with elements of the XXI Corps attacked by Hood's corps on the brigade's left. These units were pushed behind the brigade's line. Hood's Corps advanced so close to Rosecrans's new headquarters at the Glenn Cabin leading to a significant risk of a Federal rout in this part of the line. At this point the Lighting Brigade's superior firepower from their Spencers eventually held back the Confederate advance, fighting from behind a drainage ditch.<ref>Robertson (Spring 2008), pp. 45\u201346; Cozzens, pp. 218\u201324, 259\u201362; Tucker, pp. 170\u201372, 174; Woodworth, p. 93; Korn, p. 48; Lamers, p. 331.</ref>\n\n[[File:Chickamauga Sep20 2.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Longstreet's Left Wing assaults, mid-day September 20]]\n\nStarting about 0930 on 20 September, the battle resumed primarily to the left (north) of the brigade. Bragg soon ordered his entire line to advance. By 1100, Longstreet had assembled a column of 10,00 men to attack the Union center. The attack succeeded aided by a gap left by a rearranged Union line. \nAs the attack rapidly turned into a Union rout in the center around 1300, the Lightning brigade was ordered to counterattack against Brig. Gen. Arthur Manigault's brigade of Hood's Division from its reserve position. It launched a strong advance with its superior firepower, driving the enemy around and through what became known as \"Bloody Pond\". Having blunted the Confederate advance, Wilder planned to capitalize on this success by attacking the flank of Hood's column. Unfortunately, the opportunity was lost when Wilder had to see to Assistant Secretary of War [[Charles Anderson Dana|Charles A. Dana]] who proclaimed that the battle was lost and demanded to be escorted to Chattanooga. In the time that Wilder took to arrange a small detachment to escort him back to safety, the opportunity for a successful attack was lost and he ordered his men to withdraw to the west.<ref>Lamers, p. 352; Robertson (Summer 2008), pp. 41\u201342; Eicher, 589; Tucker, pp. 288\u201399, 315\u201317; Cozzens, pp. 376\u201390, 392\u201396; Woodworth, pp. 118\u201319.</ref>\n\nThe brigade remained cut off on the other side of Dyer Road south of Thomas's final position on Horsesho Ridge. At 1630, Wilder received the order to retreat to Chattanooga. After darkness, the brigade mounted and retreated north.\n\nThrough the battle, the brigade had performed exceedingly well making good use of their Spencers. They were one of the few units south of Horseshoe Ridge that did not panic and retreat but successfully attacked. They departed the field intact and in good order.\n\n==Reorganization/Disestablishment==\n\nOn September 21, Rosecrans's army withdrew to the city of Chattanooga and took advantage of previous Confederate works to erect strong defensive positions. However, the supply lines into Chattanooga were at risk, and the Confederates soon occupied the surrounding heights and laid siege upon the Union forces. \n\nThe Union forces were quickly reorganized. Maj. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] was appointed commander of the newly created [[Military Division of the Mississippi]], bringing all of the territory from the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to the [[Mississippi River]] (and much of the state of [[Arkansas]]) under a single commander for the first time. On 19 October, Grant relieved the demoralized Rosecrans. He selected Thomas to command the Army of the Cumberland.\n\nIn October, the Army of the Cumberland reorganized. In this shuffle, the Lightning Brigade was gradually shifted into the cavalry of the army<ref>Starr</ref>. The 98th Illinois and the 17th Indiana were assigned to the 2nd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 123rd Illinois and the 75th Indiana were transferred to the 3rd Brigade of the 2nd Division of the Cavalry Corps. The 92nd Illinois was used as an army asset with its companies serving as supply line security and command escorts.<ref name=SunSpencer/>\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/blue-lightning-wilders-mounted-infantry-brigade-in-the-battle-of-chickamauga/oclc/232639520?loc=02333\n| title       = Blue Lightning: Wilder's Mounted Brigade in the Battle of Chickamauga\n| author      = Baumgartner, Richard A.\n| publisher   = Blue Acorn Press\n| location    = Huntington WV\n| year        = 2007\n| isbn        = 978-1-885033-35-2\n| asin        = \n| oclc        = \n| url-access  = \n}}\n*{{ cite book\n| url         = https://www.worldcat.org/title/three-years-in-the-army-of-the-cumberland-the-letters-and-diary-of-major-james-a-connolly/oclc/906602437&referer=brief_results\n| title       = Three Years in the Army of the Cumberland: The Letters and Diary of Major James A.

There have been a number of particularly significant epidemics that deserve mention above the \"mere\" destruction of cities:\n* [[Plague of Athens]] (430 to 426 BCE): During the [[Peloponnesian War]], [[Typhoid fever]] killed a quarter of the Athenian troops, and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years. In January 2006, researchers from the [[University of Athens]] analyzed [[teeth]] recovered from a [[mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[bacteria]] responsible for typhoid.<ref>[http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&ref=sciam&chanID=sa003 \"Ancient Athenian Plague Proves to Be Typhoid\"].

Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is six feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties, and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528, the French lost 18,000 troops in [[Italy]], and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish.

A new strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) causes [[Coronavirus disease 2019]], or COVID-19.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McArdleColumnistBioBioFollowFollowColumnist |first1=Megan McArdle closeMegan |title=Opinion {{!}} When a danger is growing exponentially, everything looks fine until it doesn't |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2020/03/10/coronavirus-what-matters-isnt-what-you-can-see-what-you-cant/?utm_campaign=wp_week_in_ideas&utm_medium=email&utm_source=newsletter&wpisrc=nl_ideas |website=Washington Post |accessdate=15 March 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\n[[COVID-19]] was declared a pandemic by the WHO on 11 March 2020. \n\nSome coronaviruses are [[zoonotic]], meaning they are transmitted between animals and people. Detailed investigations found that SARS-CoV was transmitted from [[Masked palm civet|civet cats]] to humans, and MERS-CoV from dromedary camels to humans. Several known coronaviruses are circulating in animals that have not yet infected humans. Common signs of infection include respiratory symptoms, [[fever]], [[cough]], shortness of breath, and breathing difficulties. In more severe cases, infection can cause pneumonia, severe acute respiratory syndrome, kidney failure and even death. Standard recommendations to prevent the spread of infection include regular hand washing, covering mouth and nose when coughing and sneezing, thoroughly cooking meat and eggs, and avoiding close contact with anyone showing symptoms of respiratory illness such as coughing and sneezing. The recommended distance from other people is six feet, a practice more commonly called social distancing.\n\n==== Severe acute respiratory syndrome ====\n\nIn 2003 the Italian physician [[Carlo Urbani]] (1956\u20132003) was the first to identify severe acute respiratory syndrome ([[SARS]]) as a new and dangerously contagious disease, although he became infected and died. It is caused by a [[coronavirus]] dubbed [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]]. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[World Health Organization]] helped to slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, which ended the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. However, the disease has not been eradicated and could re-emerge. This warrants monitoring and reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2003/pr56/en/|title=WHO &#124; SARS outbreak contained worldwide|website=WHO}}\nbe safe be active</ref>\n\n=== Influenza ===\n\n{{Main|Influenza pandemic}}\n[[File:Barack Obama being briefed on swine flu oubreak 4-29.jpg|thumb|President [[Barack Obama]] is briefed in the Situation Room about the [[2009 flu pandemic]], which killed as many as 17,000 Americans<ref>{{cite news |title=Swine flu has killed up to 17,000 in U.S.: report |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-flu-usa/swine-flu-has-killed-up-to-17000-in-u-s-report-idUSN1223579720100212 |agency=Reuters |date=12 February 2010}}</ref>]]\nWild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[influenza]] A viruses.

It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[Spanish flu]] or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[Asian Flu]] and the [[Hong Kong Flu]].\n\nFrom October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the U.S.<ref>{{cite web |author=MacKenzie, D |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn7261 |title=Pandemic-causing 'Asian flu' accidentally released |date=13 April 2005 |work=New Scientist }}</ref>\n\nIn May 2005, scientists urgently called upon nations to prepare for a global influenza pandemic that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/may/25/birdflu |title=Flu pandemic 'could hit 20% of world's population' |work=guardian.co.uk |date=25 May 2005 | location=London | accessdate=21 May 2010}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: \"We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China.\" Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[Romania]], and then [[Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[Croatia]], [[Bulgaria]] and the United Kingdom.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm |title=Bird flu is confirmed in Greece |work=BBC News |date=17 October 2005 | accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref>\n\nBy November 2007, numerous confirmed cases of the [[H5N1]] strain had been identified across Europe.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm |title=Bird Flu Map |work=BBC News | accessdate=3 January 2010}}</ref> However, by the end of October, only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1, which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.\n\nAvian flu cannot be categorized as a \"pandemic\" because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006 there had been few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission.<ref>WHO (2005).

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Located in the southeastern corner of Tennessee, small portions of the basin extend into [[Fannin County, Georgia]] and [[Cherokee County, North Carolina]]. The basin is surrounded by the [[Cherokee National Forest]] and the cities of [[Ducktown, Tennessee|Ducktown]] and [[Copperhill, Tennessee]] and [[McCaysville, Georgia]] are located in the basin.\n\nCopper was first discovered in the basin in 1843, and by the 1850s large mining operations, spearheaded by German-born businessman [[Julius Eckhardt Raht]], were taking place. The mines were seized by the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] during the [[American Civil War]] and were the source of about 90% of the copper used by the Confederate Army. After the Civil War, smelting operations, which were used to separate [[sulfur]] from the copper ore, resulted in [[acid rain]] in the area, and, combined with the logging of nearby forests to fuel the smelters, resulted in a massive [[environmental disaster]] that left the surrounding landscape barren for decades. Several different mines, the largest of which was the [[Burra Burra Mine (Tennessee)|Burra Burra Mine]], operated in the basin.\n\nBy the 1950s, mining operations in the Copper Basin began to decline, with the final mine closing in 1987. Today, the [[Ducktown Basin Museum]] chronicles the geological record and history of the mining operations in the basin.\n\n==Geography and geology==\n[[Image:Copper-ore-ducktown-tn1.jpg|right|210px|thumb|Copper ore]]\nThe Copper Basin is located in a broad valley in the [[Blue Ridge Mountains]], part of the southern [[Appalachian Mountains]] near the borders of [[Tennessee]], [[North Carolina]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. The basin, actually an area of low hills rather than a true [[Structural basin|basin]], is surrounded on all sides by mountains, including Pack Mountain to the east, Stansbury Mountain to the north, Little Frog Mountain to the northwest, and [[Big Frog Mountain]] to the southwest, some more than {{convert|4,000|ft|m}} above sea level. A series of hills rise above the basin to the south. The basin has an average elevation of {{convert|1,650|ft|m}} above sea level.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}{{sfn|Emmons & Laney|1926|p=13}}\n\nThe [[Ocoee River]] flows through the southwestern section of the Copper Basin, entering from Georgia, where it is known as the Toccoa, and exiting via a scenic gorge between Big Frog Mountain and Little Frog Mountain to the west. The river's Copper Basin segment is located at just over {{convert|35|mi|km}} upstream from the river's mouth along the [[Hiwassee River]] near [[Benton, Tennessee]]. The [[Tennessee Valley Authority]]'s [[Ocoee Dam No. 3|Ocoee Dam Number 3]] created a reservoir that extends into the Copper Basin.{{sfn|Ross|1935|p=95-96}}\n\nDucktown is located in the center of the Copper Basin near the juncture of [[Tennessee State Route 68]] and [[U.S. Route 64 in Tennessee|U.S. Route 64]]. The city of [[Copperhill, Tennessee|Copperhill]] is located on the southern portion of the basin near the Tennessee-Georgia border, and directly borders [[McCaysville, Georgia]].

Ducktown Sulphur, Copper & Iron Company'', the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]] reversed an [[injunction]] that would have forced a cessation of the mining operations until the pollution was mitigated.<ref>{{cite court|litigants=Madison v.
