OpenAM has the flexibility to chain methods together along with Adaptive Risk scoring, or to create custom authentication modules based on the [[Java Authentication and Authorization Service|JAAS]] (Java Authentication and Authorization Service) open standard. [[Integrated Windows Authentication]] is supported to enable a completely seamless heterogeneous OS and Web application SSO environment.\n; [[Authorization]]: OpenAM provides authorization policy from basic, simple, coarse-grained rules to highly advanced, fine-grained entitlements based on [[XACML]] (eXtensible Access Control Mark-Up Language). Authorization policies are abstracted from the application, allowing developers to quickly add or change policy as needed without modification to the underlying application.\n; [[Risk-based authentication|Adaptive risk authentication]]: The adaptive risk authentication module is used to assess risks during the authentication process, and to determine whether to require that the user complete further authentication steps. Adaptive risk authentication determines, based on risk scoring, whether more information from a user is required when they login. For example, a risk score can be calculated based on an IP address range, access from a new device, account idle time, etc., and applied to the authentication chain.\n; [[Federation (information technology)|Federation]]: Federation services securely share identity information across heterogeneous systems or domain boundaries using standard identity protocols ([[Security Assertion Markup Language|SAML]], [[WS-Federation]], [[OpenID Connect]]). Quickly set up and configure service provider or cloud service connections through the Fedlet, [[OAuth2]] Client, OAuth2 Provider, or OpenIG Federation Gateway. The OpenIG Federation Gateway is a component of OpenAM providing a [[SAML2]] compliant enforcement point and allows businesses to quickly add SAML2 support to their applications with little to no knowledge of the standard. In addition, there is no need to modify the application or install any plugin or agent on the application container. Out-of the-box tools enable simple task-based configuration of [[G Suite]], ADFS2, along with many other integration targets. OpenAM can also act as a multi-protocol hub, translating for providers who rely on other, older standards. OAuth2 support is an open standard for modern federation and authorization, allowing users to share their private resources with tokens instead of credentials.\n; [[Single sign-on]] (SSO): OpenAM provides multiple mechanisms for SSO, whether the requirement is enabling cross-domain SSO for a single organization, or SSO across multiple organizations through the Federation Service. OpenAM supports multiple options for enforcing policy and protecting resources, including policy agents that reside on web or application servers, a proxy server, or the OpenIG (Identity Gateway). OpenIG runs as a self-contained gateway and protects web applications where installing a policy agent is not possible.\n; [[High availability]]: To enable high availability for large-scale and mission-critical deployments, OpenAM provides both system failover and session failover. These two key features help to ensure that no [[single point of failure]] exists in the deployment, and that the OpenAM service is always available to end-users. Redundant OpenAM servers, policy agents, and load balancers prevent a single point of failure. Session failover ensures the user's session continues uninterrupted, and no user data is lost.\n; Developer access: OpenAM provides client application programming interfaces with Java and C APIs and a RESTful API that can return JSON or XML over HTTP, allowing users to access authentication, authorization, and identity services from web applications using REST clients in their language of choice. [[OAuth2]] also provides a [[REST]] Interface for the modern, lightweight federation and authorization protocol.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Computer programming}}\n\n* [[GlassFish]]\n* [[OpenDS]]\n* [[OpenDJ]]\n* [[OpenIDM]]\n* [[List of single sign-on implementations]]\n\n== References ==\n\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n* [http://www.forgerock.com/ Forgerock Official Website (proprietary)]\n* {{Openhub|id=openam|name=OpenAM}}\n* [http://java.net/projects/opensso OpenSSO (inactive) project page]\n* {{Openhub|id=opensso|name=OpenSSO}}\n* {{Freecode|id=opensso|name=OpenSSO}}\n\n{{Sun Microsystems}}\n\n[[Category:Federated identity]]\n[[Category:Free software]]\n[[Category:Identity management]]\n[[Category:Java enterprise platform]]\n[[Category:Software forks]]\n[[Category:Sun Microsystems software]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox software\n| title = OpenAM\n| name = OpenAM\n| logo = OpenAM Community Logo.png\n| screenshot = OpenAM Community Admin Console.png\n| caption = OpenAM Admin Console\n| released = {{release date|mf=yes|2008|11|11}} (OpenSSO)<br />{{release date|mf=yes|2010|02|07}} (Forgerock OpenAM)<br />{{release date|mf=yes|2018|03|01}} (OpenAM Community)\n| latest release version = Release 14.4.1 <ref>{{cite web|url=https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/releases|title=OpenAM Downloads}}</ref>\n| latest release date = {{release date|mf=yes|2019|7|30}}\n| repo = https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM\n| programming language = [[Java (programming language)|Java]]\n| operating system = Linux, Solaris, Windows, Mac OS, AIX\n| language = English, French, German, Spanish, Japanese, Korean, Simplified Chinese and Traditional Chinese\n| genre = [[Identity and access management]]\n| license = [[Common Development and Distribution License|CDDL]]\n| website = {{URL|https://github.com/OpenIdentityPlatform/OpenAM/}}\n}}\n\n'''OpenAM''' is an [[open-source software|open-source]] access management, entitlements and [[Federated identity|federation]] server platform.

In the early 1990s other teams followed suit and [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic gearboxes]] and [[traction control system|traction control]] were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for {{F1|1994}}.

The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\n\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from {{F1|1984}} to {{F1|2008}}.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically. This increased financial burdens, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive, but to stay in business, and forced several teams to withdraw.

Marussia returned under the Manor name in {{F1|2015}}, a season in which Ferrari were the only challenger to Mercedes, with Vettel taking victory in the three Grands Prix Mercedes did not win.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/features/2015/3/everything-to-play-for---2015-season-preview.html |title=Everything to play for \u2013 2015 Season Preview |website=Formula1.com |accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the {{F1|2016}} season, [[Haas F1 Team|Haas]] joined the grid. The season began in dominant fashion for Nico Rosberg, winning the first 4 Grands Prix. His charge was halted by [[Max Verstappen]], who took his maiden win in [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] in his debut race for Red Bull. After that, the reigning champion Lewis Hamilton decreased the point gap between him and Rosberg to only one point, before taking the championship lead heading into the summer break. Following the break, the 1\u20132 positioning remained constant until an engine failure for Hamilton in [[2016 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] left Rosberg in a commanding lead that he would not relinquish in the 5 remaining races. Having won the title by a mere 5 points, Rosberg retired from Formula One at season's end, becoming the first driver since [[Alain Prost]] in 1993 to retire after winning the Drivers' Championship. The final team remaining from the 2010 new entries process, [[Manor Racing]], withdrew from the sport following the 2016 season, having lost 10th in the Constructors' Championship to Sauber with one race remaining, leaving the grid at 20 cars as Liberty Media took control of the series in the off-season.\n[[File:Jolyon Palmer - Renault F1 RS16 (29463209074).jpg|thumb|right|Renault returned to the sport in 2016 (pictured with [[Jolyon Palmer|Palmer]])]]\nRecent years have seen an increase in manufacturer presence in the sport. In 2016, Renault came back to the sport after buying back the [[Lotus F1]] team. In 2018, [[Aston Martin]] and [[Alfa Romeo]] became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively, with the latter officially entering the 2019 season as [[Alfa Romeo Racing]] and the former due to enter the 2021 season as [[Aston Martin F1 Team]].\n\n===Political disputes===\n\n====FISA\u2013FOCA war====\n{{Main|FISA\u2013FOCA war}}\n\nThe battle for control of Formula One was contested between the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA), at the time an autonomous subcommittee of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], and [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]] (the Formula One Constructors' Association).\n\nThe beginnings of the dispute are numerous, and many of the underlying reasons may be lost in history. The teams (excepting [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and the other major manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] and [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in particular) were of the opinion that their rights and ability to compete against the larger and better funded teams were being negatively affected by a perceived bias on the part of the controlling organisation (FISA) toward the major manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the battle revolved around the commercial aspects of the sport (the FOCA teams were unhappy with the disbursement of proceeds from the races) and the technical regulations which, in FOCA's opinion, tended to be malleable according to the nature of the transgressor more than the nature of the transgression.\n\nThe war culminated in a [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]] boycott of the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]] months later. In theory, all FOCA teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the [[Formula One regulations|regulations]] and financial compensation (and extreme opposition to the accession of Balestre to the position of FISA president: both Colin Chapman of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] of [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] stated clearly that they would not continue in Formula One with Balestre as its governor).{{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} In practice, several of the FOCA teams backed out of the boycott, citing \"sponsor obligations\". Notable among these were the Tyrrell and Toleman teams.\n\n====FIA\u2013FOTA dispute====\n{{Main|FIA\u2013FOTA dispute}}\nDuring the {{F1|2009}} season of Formula One, the sport was gripped in a governance crisis. The FIA President Max Mosley proposed numerous cost-cutting measures for the following season, including an optional budget cap for the teams;<ref name=budgetcap>{{cite news| title = \u00a340&nbsp;million budget cap and 13 teams for 2010| publisher=Formula1.com| date = 30 April 2009| url = http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2009/4/9290.html| accessdate =21 March 2010}}</ref> teams electing to take the budget cap would be granted greater technical freedom, adjustable front and rear wings and an engine not subject to a [[rev limiter]].<ref name=budgetcap/> The [[Formula One Teams Association]] (FOTA) believed that allowing some teams to have such technical freedom would have created a 'two-tier' championship, and thus requested urgent talks with the FIA.

These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship, and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.<ref name=LastnonchampF1 />\n\n===European non-championship racing===\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in {{f1|1950}} a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.<ref name=ESPN/> In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\n\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]], [[Oulton Park International Gold Cup]] and the [[International Trophy]], were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the [[Syracuse Grand Prix|Syracuse]] and [[Danish Grand Prix|Danish]] Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid.<ref name=LastnonchampF1 /> These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the [[1983 Race of Champions]] at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]] in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American [[Danny Sullivan]].<ref name=LastnonchampF1 />\n\n===South African Formula One championship===\n{{Main|South African Formula One Championship}}\n\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines. Frontrunning drivers from the series usually contested their local World Championship Grand Prix, as well as occasional European events, although they had little success at that level.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n===British Formula One Championship===\n{{Main|British Formula One Championship}}\n\nThe [[Cosworth DFV|DFV]] helped make the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980. As in South Africa a decade before, second hand cars from manufacturers like Lotus and Fittipaldi Automotive were the order of the day, although some, such as the March 781, were built specifically for the series.

It begins with two free practice sessions on Friday (except in Monaco, where Friday practices are moved to Thursday), and one free practice on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as [[third driver]]s) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up his seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.<ref name=\"QDetail2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8686/|title=Practice and qualifying|publisher=Formula One|accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"DriveChang\">{{cite web|title=Driver changes and additional drivers|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8694/|publisher=[[Formula One Group|Formula One World Championship]]|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Tyre rules===\nThe new rule for F1 tyres that was introduced in 2016 was that Pirelli could select three different tyres for each race, and each team could choose the tyre from those three depending on the strategies. This concept also continued in 2017 and in 2018 but with Pirelli's thicker and wider tyres that were tested extensively last year.\n\nTyre selections are announced over a month before each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select 10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force each driver to stick to the same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the new tyre.\n\nThat means for the opening five races, drivers will have seven of the softest compound, four of the middle compound and two of the hardest compound available. Pirelli has backup compounds for introduction later in the season, if its initial batch proves to be too conservative in terms of performance or leads to greater levels of degradation than expected.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 Grand Prix tyre compound selections|url=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/18451342/2017-grand-prix-tyre-compound-selections|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Qualifying===\n[[File:BAR pitwall.jpg|thumb|left|A typical pitwall control centre, allowing team managers and strategists to communicate with their drivers and engineers]]\n\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on [[pole position]]. Grids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a [[Pre-qualification (Formula One)|pre-qualifying]] session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\n[[File:2011 Brazil GP - Lotus pitstop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Jarno Trulli]] pit-stop, for [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|Lotus]] at the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.<ref name=Qual>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Practice and qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than [[107% rule|107%]] of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.<ref name=Qual />\n\nEach car taking part in Q3 receives an 'extra' set of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1 or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather requires the use of wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed.<ref name=Tyres>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Tyres|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8680/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Tyres_and_Wheels.html|title=Tyres|website=Formula1.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> All of the drivers that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.\n\n===Race===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided they have fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve (Sauber) qualifying at US Grand Prix 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] qualifying at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[Sauber C24]]]]\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the {{F1|2019}} season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |title=F1 race starting regulations |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race.\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The maximum race length was reduced to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1966 and {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current {{convert|305|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1989. However, street races like [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a back marker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag<ref>{{cite web|title=Flags |publisher=Formula One |date=21 June 2003 |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |accessdate=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120809/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |archivedate=2 July 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is said to have retired from the race and is \"Not Classified\" in the results. However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, s/he will be classified.\n\n[[File:Safety Car with Sebastian Vettel 2015 Malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mercedes-AMG GT]] [[safety car]] leading the field around the circuit at reduced speed]]\nThroughout the race, drivers may make [[pit stop]]s to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have [[Formula One tyres#Tyre summary|different colours on their sidewalls]]; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.\n\n; Race director\n: This role involves generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in [[parc ferm\u00e9]] before a race, enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes amongst teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations. Up to 2019, the race director in Formula One was [[Charlie Whiting]], who died in March 2019.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2019|title=Charlie Whiting: F1 race director dies aged 66 on eve of season-opener in Melbourne|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/47564762|author=Andrew Benson|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Safety car\n: In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside [[Motorsport marshal|race marshals]], race officials may choose to deploy the [[safety car]]. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. [[Mercedes-Benz]] supplies [[Mercedes-AMG]] models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. Since 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|title=New safety car driver announced|publisher=GPUpdate.net|date=8 March 2000|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver [[Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder]]. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line, which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n=== Flags ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Flag\n!Meaning\n|-\n!SC Board\n(Safety Car)\n|Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the&nbsp;[[Safety Car]]&nbsp;is on track.

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem\u2014in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. Since the 2010 season, refuelling\u2014which was reintroduced in 1994\u2014has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n===Points system===\n{{Main|List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n!9th\n!10th\n!{{tooltip|FL|Fastest lap}}*\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ffffbf\"|25\n|style=\"background-color:#dfdfdf\"|18\n|style=\"background-color:#ffdf9f\"|15\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|12\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|10\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|8\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|6\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|4\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|2\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|1\n|1\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race.

The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. If both cars of a team finish in the points, they both receive Constructors' Championship points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by him count for the Drivers' Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Points|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8681/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA driver must be classified to receive points.

This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the {{F1|1984}} season. The last occurrence was at the [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix]] when the race was called off after 31 laps due to torrential rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL513282820090405|title=Button wins Malaysian GP cut short by rain|last=Baldwin|first=Alan|date=5 April 2009|agency=Reuters  |publisher=Thomas Reuters Corporate|accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Constructors==\n{{See also|List of Formula One constructors|List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions}}\n[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2017 Malaysia FP1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] (pictured with [[Sebastian Vettel]]) have competed in every season]]\nSince {{F1|1981}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/fiasco-introduction-timeline.html |title=Poachers turned gamekeepers: how the FOCA became the new FIA ''Part 1: Introduction and timeline'' |last=Diepraam |first=Mattijs |date=21 November 2007 |website=8W |publisher=FORIX/[[Autosport]].com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became more or less interchangeable. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the [[IndyCar Series]] which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"[[spec racing|spec series]]\" such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateers]], which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\n\nThe sport's debut season, {{F1|1950}}, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids.  Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\n[[File:Ayrton Senna 1988 Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[McLaren]] (pictured with [[Ayrton Senna]]) won all but one race in {{F1|1988}} with engine partner [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]]]]\n[[File:Niko Hulkenberg-Test Days 2018 Circuit Barcelona (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] (pictured here with [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]]) has had an active role in Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier since {{F1|1977}}]]\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"[[works team#Motorsport|works team]]\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. After having virtually disappeared by the early 1980s, factory teams made a comeback in the 1990s and 2000s and formed up to half the grid with Ferrari, Jaguar, BMW, Renault, Toyota, and Honda either setting up their own teams or buying out existing ones.  Mercedes-Benz owned 40% of the McLaren team and manufactured the team's engines. Factory teams make up the top competitive teams; in 2008 wholly owned factory teams took four of the top five positions in the Constructors' Championship, and McLaren the other. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen). However, by the end of the 2000s factory teams were once again on the decline with only Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Renault lodging entries to the {{F1|2010}} championship.\n\nCompanies such as [[Coventry Climax|Climax]], [[Repco]], [[Cosworth]], [[Hart Racing Engines|Hart]], [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] and [[Supertec]], which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.  Beginning in 2007, the manufacturers' deep pockets and engineering ability took over, eliminating the last of the independent engine manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosworth return unlikely says Stewart |url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |website=F1-Live.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331163340/http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |archivedate=31 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200&nbsp;million ($125\u2013$225&nbsp;million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Adam|title=Mosley Stands Firm on Engine Freeze|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|publisher=Speed TV|accessdate=1 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105224446/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|archivedate=5 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams.

Although throughout the first decades of the world championship there were no more than eleven Grands Prix a season, a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of sixteen/seventeen by the late 1970s; simultaneously non-championship events ended by 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 19 races. In {{F1|2016}} the calendar peaked at twenty-one events, the highest number of world championship races in one season.\n\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the [[Indianapolis 500]], which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the [[United States Grand Prix]]. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in {{F1|1953}}, and [[Moroccan Grand Prix|Morocco]] hosted the first African World Championship race in {{F1|1958}}.

If a single country hosts multiple Grands Prix in a year they receive different names. In European countries, the second event has often been titled the [[European Grand Prix]], or named after a neighbouring state without a race. The United States has held six separate Grands Prix, including the Indianapolis 500, with the additional events named after the host city. Grands Prix are not always held at the same circuit each year, and may switch locations due to the suitability of the track or the financial status of the race organisers.

The ''[[pit stop|pit lane]]'', where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal. A single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least 5,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |title=Sport : F-1 race at Sohna or Greater Noida |work=The Hindu |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]], [[Albert Park Circuit|Melbourne]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]], [[Sochi International Street Circuit|Sochi]] and [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]] although races in other urban locations come and go ([[Las Vegas]] and [[Detroit]], for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed\u2014most recently [[Grand Prix of America|New Jersey]]. Several circuits have been completely laid out on public roads in the past, such as [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] in Spain, though Monaco is the only one that remains. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks. Three-time World champion [[Nelson Piquet]] famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/2011/05/24/monaco-challenge-remains-unique |title=Monaco challenge remains unique \u2013 Formula 1 |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the new [[Bahrain International Circuit]], added in {{F1|2004}} and designed\u2014like most of F1's new circuits\u2014by [[Hermann Tilke]]. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n\nOld favourites the [[\u00d6sterreichring]] (today the Red Bull Ring) and the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]], returned to the calendar in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Sochi Autodrom]] in [[Sochi]] and the [[Baku City Circuit]] in [[Azerbaijan]] have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012.

This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance and the current generation of cars sport a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\n\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the [[tire|tyres]]. From {{F1|1998}} to {{F1|2008}}, the tyres in Formula One were not \"[[slick tyre|slicks]]\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |title=Tyres |accessdate=4 July 2008 |publisher=Formula One |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218202246/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the {{F1|2009}} season.

The cumulative figure, which exceeds the total population of the planet by many times, counts all viewers who watch F1 on any programme at any time during the year.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1990s, [[Formula One Group]] created a number of trademarks, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it a corporate identity. Ecclestone experimented with a digital television package (known colloquially as [[Bernievision]]) which was launched at the [[1996 German Grand Prix]] in co-operation with German digital television service \"DF1\", 30 years after the first GP colour TV broadcast, the [[1967 German Grand Prix]]. This service offered the viewer several simultaneous feeds (such as super signal, on board, top of field, backfield, highlights, pit lane, timing) which were produced with cameras, technical equipment and staff different from those used for the conventional coverage - i.e.: the \"World Feed\".\n\nTV stations all take what is known as the \"World Feed\", either produced historically by the \"host broadcaster\" or by FOM (Formula One Management). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds - a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents. Where the two feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\n\nThe only station that differed from this set up was \"DF1\" (re-branded to \"Premiere\" then to \"Sky Deutschland\")\u2014a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pitlane channels. This service was obtained by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of 1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much. Prices were too high for viewers, considering they could watch both the qualifying and the races on free TV.\n\nAfter the failure of F1 Digital Plus, \"Premiere\" continued providing an interactive service, however, only the onboard and pit lane (for certain events) channels were available. This interactive service was a complete failure as the host broadcaster's director failed to recognise the onboard channel during the broadcast, leaving viewers frustrated looking at title cards rather than the action. The onboard feed slowly came back to life in 2005 and in 2007 was available for the whole season when F1 went widescreen.\n\nFurthermore, upon the commencement of its coverage for the 2009 season, the [[BBC]] reintroduced complementary features such as the \"red button\" in-car camera angles, multiple soundtracks (broadcast commentary, [[CBBC]] commentary for children, or ambient sound only) and a rolling highlights package. Different combinations of these features are available across the various digital platforms ([[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media#Virgin TV|Virgin Media cable]] and the BBC F1 web site) prior to, during, and after the race weekend. Not all services are available across all the various platforms due to technical constraints. The BBC also broadcasts a post-race programme called \"F1 Forum\" on the digital terrestrial platforms' \"red button\" interactive services.\n\n[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Vettel]] after securing pole position at the [[2011 Malaysian Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAn announcement was made on 12 January 2011, on the official Formula 1 website (Formula1.com), that F1 would adopt the [[high-definition television|HD]] format for the 2011 season offering a world feed at a data rate of 42 Megabits/second (MPEG-2).<ref>{{cite web |title=Formula One Coverage goes HD for 2011 |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/1/11634.html |publisher=Formula1.com |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref> The BBC subsequently announced later that day that their 2011 F1 coverage would be broadcast in HD<ref>{{cite news | title = New role for Eddie Jordan as BBC F1 coverage goes HD | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9359509.stm |work=BBC Sport  |date= 12 January 2011|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref> which has been made immediately possible due to SIS LIVE, the provider of the BBC's F1 outside broadcast coverage, having already upgraded their technical facilities to HD as of the 2010 Belgian Grand Prix.<ref>{{cite web | title = SIS LIVE upgrades OB coverage of Formula 1 for BBC Sport | url = http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | publisher = sislive.tv | accessdate = 12 January 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022718/http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | archivedate = 5 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that [[Sky Sports]] and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 in 2012.

So give due consideration before changing the section title.-->\nCurrently the terms 'Formula One race' and 'World Championship race' are effectively synonymous; since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been to Formula One regulations. But the two terms are not interchangeable.\n* The first Formula One race was held in 1947,<ref name=ESPN/> whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.<ref name=ESPN/>\n* In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship<ref name=silhouet>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/title.html |title=The Formula One Archives |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> (e.g., in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship).<ref name=ESPN/> The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the [[1983 Race of Champions]].<ref name=silhouet/>\n* The World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\n** The World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e., without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\n** From 1950 to 1960, the [[Indianapolis 500]] race counted towards the World Championship.<ref name=silhouet/> This race was run to [[American Automobile Association]] and [[United States Automobile Club]] regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, [[Alberto Ascari]] in [[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]], started at Indianapolis during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicracing.com/driver_detail.cfm?driverID=1061 |title=Alberto Ascari |website=historicracing.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n** From 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations.<ref name=silhouet/> Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1952/1952.html |title=1952 Non-World Championship Grands Prix |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1953/1953.html |title=1953 Non-World Championship Grands Prix |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the [[List of Formula One drivers]], [[Clemente Biondetti]] is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950,<ref name=Biondetti>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicanef1.com/query.pl?action=Submit&exact=on&driver=Clemente%20Biondetti&nc=nc |title=Clemente Biondetti Formula One race entries |publisher=ChicaneF1 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> but only one of these counted for the World Championship.

The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\n\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from {{F1|1984}} to {{F1|2008}}.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically. This increased financial burdens, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive, but to stay in business, and forced several teams to withdraw. Since {{F1|1990}}, twenty-eight teams have withdrawn from Formula One.

Starting in 2000, with Ford's creation of the largely unsuccessful [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since the departure of [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] and Renault at the end of 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams\u2014Renault, [[BMW Sauber|BMW]], [[Toyota F1|Toyota]], Honda, and Ferrari\u2014dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The sole exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Through the [[Grand Prix Manufacturers Association]] (GPMA), they negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rain Drop and Other Shades of Prosetry|first=Mandidi|last=Patrick|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q24k0gAFopcC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=Through+the+Grand+Prix+Manufacturers+Association+(GPMA),+they+negotiated+a+larger+share+of+Formula+One%27s+commercial+profit+and+a+greater+say+in+the+running+of+the+sport.#v=onepage&q=Through%20the%20Grand%20Prix%20Manufacturers%20Association%20(GPMA)%2C%20they%20negotiated%20a%20larger%20share%20of%20Formula%20One's%20commercial%20profit%20and%20a%20greater%20say%20in%20the%20running%20of%20the%20sport.|publisher=Eloquent Books|isbn=9781609113766}}</ref>\n\n===Manufacturers' decline and return of the privateers===\nIn 2008 and 2009, [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]], [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]], and [[Toyota Racing (Formula One team)|Toyota]] all withdrew from Formula One racing within the space of a year, blaming the [[Great Recession|economic recession]]. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance within the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become [[Brawn GP]] with the notable F1 designer [[Ross Brawn]] and [[Nick Fry]] running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP went through a painful size reduction, laying off hundreds of employees, but eventually won the year's world championships with [[Jenson Button]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]]. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, [[Peter Sauber]]. The [[Lotus F1 Team]]<ref>This is not the same team as the [[Team Lotus|1954\u201394]] nor [[Team Lotus (2010\u201311)|2010\u201311]] iterations.</ref> were another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] team by [[Genii Capital]] investors.

Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after its purchase of [[Brawn GP]], and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team. This left Mercedes-Benz, McLaren, and [[Ferrari]] as the only car manufacturers in the sport, although both McLaren and Ferrari began as racing teams rather than manufacturers.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Pedro de la Rosa 2012 Malaysia FP2.jpg\n| width1 = 216\n| image2 = Kamui Kobayashi 2014 Singapore FP2.jpg\n| width2 = 216\n| image3 = Esteban Ocon 2016 Malaysia FP2 1.jpg\n| width3 = 216\n| caption3 = The three teams that debuted in 2010 (Hispania Racing F1 Team/HRT Formula 1 Team, Lotus Racing/Team Lotus/Caterham F1 Team, and Virgin Racing/Marussia Virgin Racing/Marussia F1 Team/Manor Marussia F1 Team/Manor Racing MRT) all disappeared within seven years of their debuts\n}}\n\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap' (see below).

They were also joined by the [[US F1 Team]], which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams \u2013 who did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams \u2013 ran around at the back of the field until they inevitably collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, went under at the end of 2016.\n\nA rule shake-up in {{F1|2014}}, meant [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] emerged as the dominant force, with [[Lewis Hamilton]] winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, [[Nico Rosberg]], with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season (all other victories coming from [[Daniel Ricciardo]] of Red Bull). 2014 also saw a financial crisis which resulted in the backmarker [[Marussia F1|Marussia]] and [[Caterham F1|Caterham]] teams being put into [[administration (law)|administration]], alongside the uncertain futures of [[Force India]] and Sauber.

His charge was halted by [[Max Verstappen]], who took his maiden win in [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] in his debut race for Red Bull. After that, the reigning champion Lewis Hamilton decreased the point gap between him and Rosberg to only one point, before taking the championship lead heading into the summer break. Following the break, the 1\u20132 positioning remained constant until an engine failure for Hamilton in [[2016 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] left Rosberg in a commanding lead that he would not relinquish in the 5 remaining races. Having won the title by a mere 5 points, Rosberg retired from Formula One at season's end, becoming the first driver since [[Alain Prost]] in 1993 to retire after winning the Drivers' Championship. The final team remaining from the 2010 new entries process, [[Manor Racing]], withdrew from the sport following the 2016 season, having lost 10th in the Constructors' Championship to Sauber with one race remaining, leaving the grid at 20 cars as Liberty Media took control of the series in the off-season.\n[[File:Jolyon Palmer - Renault F1 RS16 (29463209074).jpg|thumb|right|Renault returned to the sport in 2016 (pictured with [[Jolyon Palmer|Palmer]])]]\nRecent years have seen an increase in manufacturer presence in the sport. In 2016, Renault came back to the sport after buying back the [[Lotus F1]] team.

The teams (excepting [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and the other major manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] and [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in particular) were of the opinion that their rights and ability to compete against the larger and better funded teams were being negatively affected by a perceived bias on the part of the controlling organisation (FISA) toward the major manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the battle revolved around the commercial aspects of the sport (the FOCA teams were unhappy with the disbursement of proceeds from the races) and the technical regulations which, in FOCA's opinion, tended to be malleable according to the nature of the transgressor more than the nature of the transgression.\n\nThe war culminated in a [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]] boycott of the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]] months later. In theory, all FOCA teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the [[Formula One regulations|regulations]] and financial compensation (and extreme opposition to the accession of Balestre to the position of FISA president: both Colin Chapman of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] of [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] stated clearly that they would not continue in Formula One with Balestre as its governor).{{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} In practice, several of the FOCA teams backed out of the boycott, citing \"sponsor obligations\".

This concept also continued in 2017 and in 2018 but with Pirelli's thicker and wider tyres that were tested extensively last year.\n\nTyre selections are announced over a month before each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select 10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force each driver to stick to the same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the new tyre.\n\nThat means for the opening five races, drivers will have seven of the softest compound, four of the middle compound and two of the hardest compound available. Pirelli has backup compounds for introduction later in the season, if its initial batch proves to be too conservative in terms of performance or leads to greater levels of degradation than expected.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 Grand Prix tyre compound selections|url=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/18451342/2017-grand-prix-tyre-compound-selections|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Qualifying===\n[[File:BAR pitwall.jpg|thumb|left|A typical pitwall control centre, allowing team managers and strategists to communicate with their drivers and engineers]]\n\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on [[pole position]]. Grids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a [[Pre-qualification (Formula One)|pre-qualifying]] session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\n[[File:2011 Brazil GP - Lotus pitstop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Jarno Trulli]] pit-stop, for [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|Lotus]] at the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.<ref name=Qual>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Practice and qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than [[107% rule|107%]] of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.<ref name=Qual />\n\nEach car taking part in Q3 receives an 'extra' set of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1 or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather requires the use of wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed.<ref name=Tyres>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Tyres|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8680/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Tyres_and_Wheels.html|title=Tyres|website=Formula1.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> All of the drivers that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.\n\n===Race===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided they have fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve (Sauber) qualifying at US Grand Prix 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] qualifying at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[Sauber C24]]]]\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the {{F1|2019}} season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |title=F1 race starting regulations |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race.\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The maximum race length was reduced to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1966 and {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current {{convert|305|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1989. However, street races like [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a back marker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag<ref>{{cite web|title=Flags |publisher=Formula One |date=21 June 2003 |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |accessdate=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120809/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |archivedate=2 July 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is said to have retired from the race and is \"Not Classified\" in the results. However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, s/he will be classified.\n\n[[File:Safety Car with Sebastian Vettel 2015 Malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mercedes-AMG GT]] [[safety car]] leading the field around the circuit at reduced speed]]\nThroughout the race, drivers may make [[pit stop]]s to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have [[Formula One tyres#Tyre summary|different colours on their sidewalls]]; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.\n\n; Race director\n: This role involves generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in [[parc ferm\u00e9]] before a race, enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes amongst teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations. Up to 2019, the race director in Formula One was [[Charlie Whiting]], who died in March 2019.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2019|title=Charlie Whiting: F1 race director dies aged 66 on eve of season-opener in Melbourne|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/47564762|author=Andrew Benson|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Safety car\n: In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside [[Motorsport marshal|race marshals]], race officials may choose to deploy the [[safety car]]. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. [[Mercedes-Benz]] supplies [[Mercedes-AMG]] models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. Since 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|title=New safety car driver announced|publisher=GPUpdate.net|date=8 March 2000|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver [[Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder]]. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line, which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n=== Flags ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Flag\n!Meaning\n|-\n!SC Board\n(Safety Car)\n|Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the&nbsp;[[Safety Car]]&nbsp;is on track.

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem\u2014in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. Since the 2010 season, refuelling\u2014which was reintroduced in 1994\u2014has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n===Points system===\n{{Main|List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n!9th\n!10th\n!{{tooltip|FL|Fastest lap}}*\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ffffbf\"|25\n|style=\"background-color:#dfdfdf\"|18\n|style=\"background-color:#ffdf9f\"|15\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|12\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|10\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|8\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|6\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|4\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|2\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|1\n|1\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race.

The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. If both cars of a team finish in the points, they both receive Constructors' Championship points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by him count for the Drivers' Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Points|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8681/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA driver must be classified to receive points.

This has happened on only five occasions in the history of the championship, and it had a notable influence on the final standing of the {{F1|1984}} season. The last occurrence was at the [[2009 Malaysian Grand Prix]] when the race was called off after 31 laps due to torrential rain.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/UKNews1/idUKL513282820090405|title=Button wins Malaysian GP cut short by rain|last=Baldwin|first=Alan|date=5 April 2009|agency=Reuters  |publisher=Thomas Reuters Corporate|accessdate=25 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Constructors==\n{{See also|List of Formula One constructors|List of Formula One World Constructors' Champions}}\n[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2017 Malaysia FP1 1.jpg|thumb|[[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] (pictured with [[Sebastian Vettel]]) have competed in every season]]\nSince {{F1|1981}},<ref>{{cite web |url=http://forix.autosport.com/8w/fiasco-introduction-timeline.html |title=Poachers turned gamekeepers: how the FOCA became the new FIA ''Part 1: Introduction and timeline'' |last=Diepraam |first=Mattijs |date=21 November 2007 |website=8W |publisher=FORIX/[[Autosport]].com |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref> Formula One teams have been required to build the chassis in which they compete, and consequently the terms \"team\" and \"constructor\" became more or less interchangeable. This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the [[IndyCar Series]] which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"[[spec racing|spec series]]\" such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateers]], which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\n\nThe sport's debut season, {{F1|1950}}, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids.  Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\n[[File:Ayrton Senna 1988 Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[McLaren]] (pictured with [[Ayrton Senna]]) won all but one race in {{F1|1988}} with engine partner [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]]]]\n[[File:Niko Hulkenberg-Test Days 2018 Circuit Barcelona (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] (pictured here with [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]]) has had an active role in Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier since {{F1|1977}}]]\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"[[works team#Motorsport|works team]]\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. After having virtually disappeared by the early 1980s, factory teams made a comeback in the 1990s and 2000s and formed up to half the grid with Ferrari, Jaguar, BMW, Renault, Toyota, and Honda either setting up their own teams or buying out existing ones.  Mercedes-Benz owned 40% of the McLaren team and manufactured the team's engines. Factory teams make up the top competitive teams; in 2008 wholly owned factory teams took four of the top five positions in the Constructors' Championship, and McLaren the other. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen). However, by the end of the 2000s factory teams were once again on the decline with only Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Renault lodging entries to the {{F1|2010}} championship.\n\nCompanies such as [[Coventry Climax|Climax]], [[Repco]], [[Cosworth]], [[Hart Racing Engines|Hart]], [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] and [[Supertec]], which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.  Beginning in 2007, the manufacturers' deep pockets and engineering ability took over, eliminating the last of the independent engine manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosworth return unlikely says Stewart |url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |website=F1-Live.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331163340/http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |archivedate=31 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200&nbsp;million ($125\u2013$225&nbsp;million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Adam|title=Mosley Stands Firm on Engine Freeze|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|publisher=Speed TV|accessdate=1 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105224446/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|archivedate=5 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams.

GP2 started in 2005, replacing [[Formula 3000]], which itself had replaced [[Formula Two]] as the last major stepping-stone into F1. GP2 was rebranded as the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]] in 2017. Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One driver's title in 2008.<ref>Jack Brabham, F1 champion in 1959, 1960 and 1966, won the French Formula Two championship in 1966, but there was no international F2 championship that year.</ref> Drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. [[British F3]] has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including [[Nigel Mansell]], [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] having moved straight from that series to Formula One. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]], who went straight from Formula Renault to F1, as well as [[Max Verstappen]], who made his debut following a single season in [[FIA Formula 3 European Championship|European F3]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Five F1 champions who wouldn't have made their debuts|url=http://www.crash.net/f1/feature/212868/1/five-f1-champions-who-wouldnt-have-made-their-debuts.html|website=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[American open-wheel car racing]] has also contributed to the Formula One grid with mixed results. [[Champ Car|CART]] champions [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] became F1 World Champions, while [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won seven races in F1. Other CART (also known as ChampCar) champions, like [[Michael Andretti]] and [[Alessandro Zanardi]] won no races in F1. Other drivers have taken different paths to F1; Damon Hill raced motorbikes, and Michael Schumacher raced in [[sports car racing|sports cars]], albeit after climbing through the junior single-seater ranks. Former F1 driver [[Paul di Resta]] raced in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] until he was signed with [[Force India]] in 2011. To race, however, the driver must hold an [[FIA Super Licence]]\u2013ensuring that the driver has the requisite skills, and will not be a danger to others. Some drivers have not had the licence when first signed to an F1 team: e.g., R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen received the licence despite having only 23 car races to his credit.\n\n===Beyond F1===\n[[File:Porsche 919 Hybrid 20.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Mans Prototype|LMP1 cars]] have become a popular destination for retired F1 drivers, in this example [[Mark Webber]]]]\n[[File:Nico Rosberg Formula E Gen2 car 2018 Berlin E-Prix on track.jpg|thumb|right|Many former F1 drivers regularly compete in [[Formula E]]]]\nMost F1 drivers retire in their mid to late 30s.

The German touring car championship, the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]], is a popular category involving ex-drivers such as two-time champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and F1 race winners [[Jean Alesi]], [[David Coulthard]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]]. In recent years, it has become common for former F1 drivers to take up factory seats driving [[LMP1]] cars in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], with notable drivers including [[Mark Webber]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Anthony Davidson]], [[Alexander Wurz]], [[Kazuki Nakajima]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Fernando Alonso]].

Some drivers, such as [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]], [[Narain Karthikeyan]] and [[Jos Verstappen]] went on to race in the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series. During its existence from 2008 to 2011, [[Superleague Formula]] attracted ex-Formula One drivers like [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]] and [[Giorgio Pantano]].\n\nOther former F1 drivers, like [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Gerhard Berger]], [[Alain Prost]] and [[Niki Lauda]] returned to F1 as team owners or managers while their former competitors have become [[colour commentator]]s for TV coverage such as [[James Hunt]] ([[BBC]]), [[Martin Brundle]] (BBC, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Sky Sports|Sky]]), [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] (NBC), [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] (BBC, [[Nine Network]] and [[Ten Network]]), David Coulthard (BBC and [[Channel 4]]), [[Luciano Burti]] for [[Globo TV|Globo]] (Brazil), and Jean Alesi for Italian national network [[RAI]].

The inaugural {{F1|1950}} world championship season comprised only seven races, while the {{F1|2019}} season contained twenty-one races. Although throughout the first decades of the world championship there were no more than eleven Grands Prix a season, a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of sixteen/seventeen by the late 1970s; simultaneously non-championship events ended by 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 19 races. In {{F1|2016}} the calendar peaked at twenty-one events, the highest number of world championship races in one season.\n\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the [[Indianapolis 500]], which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the [[United States Grand Prix]]. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in {{F1|1953}}, and [[Moroccan Grand Prix|Morocco]] hosted the first African World Championship race in {{F1|1958}}. Asia (Japan in {{F1|1976}}) and Oceania (Australia in {{F1|1985}}) followed, and the first race in the Middle East was held in {{F1|2004}}. The nineteen races of the {{F1|2014}} season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with ten Grands Prix held outside Europe.\n[[File:Formula one.jpg|thumb|Cars wind through the [[infield]] section of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]]]\n\nSome of the Grands Prix, such as the oldest recognised event the [[French Grand Prix]], pre-date the formation of the World Championship and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The [[British Grand Prix|British]] and [[Italian Grand Prix|Italian]] Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German and French Grands Prix. The [[Monaco Grand Prix]], first held in 1929 and run continuously since 1955, is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=His Serene Highness Prince Rainier of Monte Carlo awarded the first FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport|website=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|date=14 October 2004|url=http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2004/141004-01.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115023910/http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2004/141004-01.html|archivedate=15 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally each nation has hosted a single Grand Prix, which carries the name of the country. If a single country hosts multiple Grands Prix in a year they receive different names. In European countries, the second event has often been titled the [[European Grand Prix]], or named after a neighbouring state without a race. The United States has held six separate Grands Prix, including the Indianapolis 500, with the additional events named after the host city. Grands Prix are not always held at the same circuit each year, and may switch locations due to the suitability of the track or the financial status of the race organisers. The German Grand Prix formerly alternated between the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and [[Hockenheimring]] circuits, and others such as the American and French races have switched venues throughout their history.\n\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural {{f1 gp|2008|Singapore}} hosted the first Formula One night race,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6063.html |title=Singapore confirms 2008 night race |website=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Administration |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517074908/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6063.html |archivedate=17 May 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> which was followed in 2009 by the day\u2013night [[Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]] and then the [[Bahrain Grand Prix]] which converted to a night race in 2014.

The ''[[pit stop|pit lane]]'', where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal. A single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least 5,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |title=Sport : F-1 race at Sohna or Greater Noida |work=The Hindu |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]], [[Albert Park Circuit|Melbourne]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]], [[Sochi International Street Circuit|Sochi]] and [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]] although races in other urban locations come and go ([[Las Vegas]] and [[Detroit]], for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed\u2014most recently [[Grand Prix of America|New Jersey]]. Several circuits have been completely laid out on public roads in the past, such as [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] in Spain, though Monaco is the only one that remains. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks. Three-time World champion [[Nelson Piquet]] famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/2011/05/24/monaco-challenge-remains-unique |title=Monaco challenge remains unique \u2013 Formula 1 |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the new [[Bahrain International Circuit]], added in {{F1|2004}} and designed\u2014like most of F1's new circuits\u2014by [[Hermann Tilke]]. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n\nOld favourites the [[\u00d6sterreichring]] (today the Red Bull Ring) and the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]], returned to the calendar in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Sochi Autodrom]] in [[Sochi]] and the [[Baku City Circuit]] in [[Azerbaijan]] have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, [[Circuit Zandvoort]] will return to the F1 calendar as the [[Dutch Grand Prix]], having last hosted a race in 1985.\n\n==Cars and technology==\n{{Main|Formula One car|Formula One engines|Formula One tyres}}\n[[File:Button Spain 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Jenson Button]] in the [[Brawn BGP 001]]]]\n[[File:Sergio P\u00e9rez-Test Days 2018 Circuit Barcelona (4).jpg|thumb|[[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] driving the [[Force India VJM11]]]]\nModern Formula One cars are [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]], hybrid, open cockpit, [[open wheel car|open wheel]] single-seaters.

This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance and the current generation of cars sport a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\n\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the [[tire|tyres]]. From {{F1|1998}} to {{F1|2008}}, the tyres in Formula One were not \"[[slick tyre|slicks]]\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series.

Ecclestone experimented with a digital television package (known colloquially as [[Bernievision]]) which was launched at the [[1996 German Grand Prix]] in co-operation with German digital television service \"DF1\", 30 years after the first GP colour TV broadcast, the [[1967 German Grand Prix]]. This service offered the viewer several simultaneous feeds (such as super signal, on board, top of field, backfield, highlights, pit lane, timing) which were produced with cameras, technical equipment and staff different from those used for the conventional coverage - i.e.: the \"World Feed\".\n\nTV stations all take what is known as the \"World Feed\", either produced historically by the \"host broadcaster\" or by FOM (Formula One Management). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds - a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents. Where the two feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\n\nThe only station that differed from this set up was \"DF1\" (re-branded to \"Premiere\" then to \"Sky Deutschland\")\u2014a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pitlane channels. This service was obtained by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of 1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much. Prices were too high for viewers, considering they could watch both the qualifying and the races on free TV.\n\nAfter the failure of F1 Digital Plus, \"Premiere\" continued providing an interactive service, however, only the onboard and pit lane (for certain events) channels were available. This interactive service was a complete failure as the host broadcaster's director failed to recognise the onboard channel during the broadcast, leaving viewers frustrated looking at title cards rather than the action. The onboard feed slowly came back to life in 2005 and in 2007 was available for the whole season when F1 went widescreen.\n\nFurthermore, upon the commencement of its coverage for the 2009 season, the [[BBC]] reintroduced complementary features such as the \"red button\" in-car camera angles, multiple soundtracks (broadcast commentary, [[CBBC]] commentary for children, or ambient sound only) and a rolling highlights package. Different combinations of these features are available across the various digital platforms ([[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media#Virgin TV|Virgin Media cable]] and the BBC F1 web site) prior to, during, and after the race weekend. Not all services are available across all the various platforms due to technical constraints.

So give due consideration before changing the section title.-->\nCurrently the terms 'Formula One race' and 'World Championship race' are effectively synonymous; since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been to Formula One regulations. But the two terms are not interchangeable.\n* The first Formula One race was held in 1947,<ref name=ESPN/> whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.<ref name=ESPN/>\n* In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship<ref name=silhouet>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/title.html |title=The Formula One Archives |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> (e.g., in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship).<ref name=ESPN/> The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the [[1983 Race of Champions]].<ref name=silhouet/>\n* The World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\n** The World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e., without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\n** From 1950 to 1960, the [[Indianapolis 500]] race counted towards the World Championship.<ref name=silhouet/> This race was run to [[American Automobile Association]] and [[United States Automobile Club]] regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, [[Alberto Ascari]] in [[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]], started at Indianapolis during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicracing.com/driver_detail.cfm?driverID=1061 |title=Alberto Ascari |website=historicracing.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n** From 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations.<ref name=silhouet/> Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1952/1952.html |title=1952 Non-World Championship Grands Prix |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1953/1953.html |title=1953 Non-World Championship Grands Prix |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the [[List of Formula One drivers]], [[Clemente Biondetti]] is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950,<ref name=Biondetti>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicanef1.com/query.pl?action=Submit&exact=on&driver=Clemente%20Biondetti&nc=nc |title=Clemente Biondetti Formula One race entries |publisher=ChicaneF1 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> but only one of these counted for the World Championship. Similarly, several [[Indianapolis 500]] winners technically won their first World Championship race, though most record books choose to ignore this and instead only record regular World Championship participants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Responsibility towards the environment==\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework and affirmed that they would become carbon neutral by 2030. After the signing was announced, FIA President Jean Todt said: \"As an international Federation comprising 244 members in 140 countries and the leader in motor sport and mobility development, we are fully committed to global environmental protection. The signing of this UN Sports for Climate Action Framework reinforces the momentum that has been growing in our Federation for many years. Since the introduction of the hybrid power unit in F1 to the creation of the Environment and Sustainability Commission, the entire FIA community has been investing time, energy and financial resources to the benefit of environmental innovations.

Only 20% of Japan's land is suitable for [[Tillage|cultivation]], and the agricultural economy is highly subsidized.\n\n[[Agriculture]], [[forestry]], and [[fishing]] dominated the [[Economy of Japan|Japanese economy]] until the 1940s, but thereafter declined into relative unimportance (see [[Agriculture in the Empire of Japan]]). In the late 19th century ([[Meiji period]]), these sectors had accounted for more than 80% of employment. Employment in agriculture declined in the prewar period, but the sector was still the largest employer (about 50% of the [[work force]]) by the end of [[World War II]]. It was further declined to 23.5% in 1965, 11.9% in 1977, and to 7.2% in 1988. The importance of agriculture in the national economy later continued its rapid decline, with the share of net agricultural production in GNP finally reduced between 1975 and 1989 from 4.1% to 3% In the late 1980s, 85.5% of Japan's farmers were also engaged in occupations outside farming, and most of these part-time farmers earned most of their income from nonfarming activities.\n\nJapan's economic boom that began in the 1950s left farmers far behind in both income and agricultural technology. They were attracted to the government's food control policy under which high rice prices were guaranteed and farmers were encouraged to increase the output of any crops of their own choice. Farmers became mass producers of rice, even turning their own vegetable gardens into rice fields. Their output swelled to over 14 million [[metric ton]]s in the late 1960s, a direct result of greater cultivated area and increased yield per unit area, owing to improved cultivation techniques.\n\nThree types of farm households developed: those engaging exclusively in agriculture (14.5% of the 4.2 million farm households in 1988, down from 21.5% in 1965); those deriving more than half their income from the farm (14.2% down from 36.7% in 1965); and those mainly engaged in jobs other than farming (71.3% up from 41.8% in 1965). As more and more farm families turned to nonfarming activities, the farm population declined (down from 4.9 million in 1975 to 4.8 million in 1988). The rate of decrease slowed in the late 1970s and 1980s, but the average age of farmers rose to 51 years by 1980, twelve years older than the average industrial employee. Historically and today, women farmers outnumber male farmers.{{Sfn|Iijima|2015|p=1}} Government data from 2011 showed women heading more than three-quarters of new [[agribusiness]] ventures.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite news|url=http://www.ipsnews.net/2013/06/agriculture-leans-on-japanese-women/|title=Agriculture Leans on Japanese Women|last=Kakuchi|first=Suvendrini|date=26 June 2013|work=Inter Press Service|access-date=9 November 2016|via=}}</ref>\n\n==Land shortage==\nThe most striking feature of Japanese agriculture is the shortage of farmland. The {{convert|49000|km2}} under cultivation constituted just 13.2% of the total land area in 1988. However, the land is intensively cultivated. [[Paddy field|Rice paddies]] occupy most of the countryside, whether on the alluvial plains, the terraced slopes, or wetlands and coastal bays. Non-paddy farmland share the terraces and lower slopes and are planted with [[wheat]] and [[barley]] in the autumn and with [[sweet potato]]es, vegetables, and dry rice in the summer. [[Intercropping]] is common: such crops are alternated with [[bean]]s and [[pea]]s.\n\nJapanese agriculture has been characterized as a \"sick\" sector because it must contend with a variety of constraints, such as the rapidly diminishing availability of arable land and falling agricultural incomes. The problem of surplus rice was further aggravated by extensive changes in the diets of many Japanese in the 1970s and 1980s. Even a major rice crop failure did not reduce the accumulated stocks by more than 25% of the reserve. In 1990, Japan was 67% self-sufficient in agricultural products and provided for around 30% of its cereal and fodder needs.\n\nAs an attempt to consolidate farmland and increase productivity, \"Farmland Intermediary Management Organizations (n\u014dchi ch\u016bkan kanri kik\u014d),\" also known as Farmland Banks, were introduced as part of a reform package in 2014, which also included the reform of local Agricultural Committees. As Jentzsch notes, \"The reform package is supposed to rationalize farmland consolidation into the hands of ninaite [bearer] farms, including corporations.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Jentzsch|first=Hanno|date=2017|title=Abandoned land, corporate farming, and farmland banks: a local perspective on the process of deregulating and redistributing farmland in Japan|journal=Contemporary Japan|volume=29 |issue=1|pages=31\u201346|doi=10.1080/18692729.2017.1256977}}</ref>\n\n==Livestock==\nLivestock raising is a minor activity. Demand for [[beef]] rose in the 1900s, and farmers often shifted from dairy farming to production of high-quality (and high-cost) beef, such as Kobe beef. Throughout the 1980s, domestic beef production met over 2% of demand. In 1991, as a result of heavy pressure from the United States, Japan ended import quotas on potatoes as well as [[citrus fruit]]. Milk [[cow]]s are numerous in Hokkaido, where 25% of farmers run dairies, but milk cows are also raised in [[Iwate Prefecture|Iwate]], in [[T\u014dhoku region|T\u014dhoku]], and near [[Tokyo]] and [[Kobe]]. [[Beef cattle]] are mostly concentrated in western [[Honshu]], and on [[Kyushu]]. [[Hog (swine)|Hog]]s, the oldest domesticated animals raised for food, are found everywhere. [[Pork]] is the most popular meat.\n\nMost of the imported beef comes from [[Australia]], since beef from the [[United States|USA]] and [[Canada]] was banned after the first cases of [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]] in those countries. Those bans were lifted in 2006.\n\n==Forestry==\nTwo thirds of land of Japan is forest. 40% of the forests in Japan are planted forests, such as [[Cedrus|cedar]] and [[cypress]]. They are mainly planted after the [[Pacific War]], in attempt to produce construction material, but after Japan had experienced rapid economic growth, they switched construction material from wood to [[reinforced concrete]]. Moreover, cheaper import wood became more attractive, compared to domestic wood which is produced in steep mountain and high costs of labour. Nowadays, many planted forests are too dense and need [[thinning]].\n\nIn 2015, Japanese forestry industry produced 20.05 million m<sup>3</sup> volume of wood and 436.3 billion yen of production, half of it is mushroom production. Forestry composes 0.04% of Japan's GDP.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rinya.maff.go.jp/j/kikaku/hakusyo/28hakusyo/attach/pdf/index-1.pdf|title=Annual Report on Forest and Forestry in Japan|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==Fisheries==\n{{See also|Whaling in Japan}}\nAfter the [[1973 oil crisis|1973 energy crisis]], deep-sea fishing in Japan declined, with the annual catch in the 1980s averaging 2 million tons. Offshore fisheries accounted for an average of 50% of the nation's total fish catches in the late 1980s although they experienced repeated ups and downs during that period. Coastal fisheries had smaller catches than northern sea fisheries in 1986 and 1987. As a whole, Japan's fish catches registered a slower growth in the late 1980s. By contrast, Japan's import of marine products increased greatly in the 1980s, and was nearly 2 million tons in 1989.\n\nThe Japanese fishing industry, both domestic and overseas, has long been centered on the [[Tsukiji fish market]], in Tokyo, which is one of the world's largest wholesale markets for fresh, frozen, and processed seafood.\n\nJapan also has greatly advanced the techniques of [[aquaculture]] or sea farming. In this system, artificial insemination and hatching techniques are used to breed fish and [[shellfish]], which are then released into rivers or seas. These fish and shellfish are caught after they grow bigger. [[Salmon]] is raised this way.\n\nJapan has more than 2,000 fishing ports, including Nagasaki, in southwest Ky\u016bsh\u016b; Otaru, Kushiro, and Abashiri in Hokkaid\u014d. Major fishing ports on the Pacific coast of Honsh\u016b include, Hachinohe, Kesennuma, and Ishinomaki along the Sanriku coast, as well as Choshi, Yaizu, Shimizu, and Misaki to the east and south of Tokyo.\n\nJapan is also one of the world's few whaling nations. As a member of the [[International Whaling Commission]], the government pledged that its fleets would restrict their catch to international quotas, but it attracted international opprobrium for its failure to sign an agreement placing a moratorium on catching sperm whales. Currently Japan conducts \"research whaling\" for minke whales in the oceans surrounding Antarctica.\n\nTwo of the largest fishing companies in Japan are [[Nippon Suisan Kaisha]] and [[Maruha Nichiro]]; each employs more than 10,000 people and owns subsidiaries around the world.\n\n===Government position===\nThe [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] is the government agency responsible for the fishing industry. The Japanese Fisheries Agency states that the Basic Fisheries Plan was developed by the Japanese government in 2007, and claims that the government is working to establish long-standing, strong fisheries and fishery practices by promoting the overall restoration of the fishery industry. This can be accomplished by promoting surveys and research into fishery resources, the promotion of international [[resource management]] in international waters, promoting international cooperation within the international fishing grounds, and improving the living [[Natural environment|environments]] for all [[aquatic life]] in inland waters, while at the same time promoting [[aquaculture]]. This restoration consists of many different phases to include the restoration and management of high-level fishery resources.\n\nOther priorities of the Japanese government include continuing to develop new technologies to improve fishery operations, whether incorporating new workplace needed technologies, or creating and exploiting intellectual properties. Also, at the top of the list is the reorganization of the fish-labor industry organizations from the top down. The government provides support to the fishery operators groups by helping to acquire the equipment necessary to reduce fuel consumption, through the introduction of energy-saving operating systems. In order to maintain a strong work force in the fishery industry, the government has programs to encourage college students to look into the industry as a possible career path. This includes supporting activities that provide the opportunity to experience stationary net fishing and aquaculture. The government also provides the prospective employees with job information from fisheries worldwide while holding job seminars with well recognized companies in the Japanese fishery business.  There is also a government sponsored on-site training program for individuals planning to make a career in the fishery industry. The fisheries in Japan are governed by the Japanese Fisheries Agency.\n\nThe Fisheries Agency is organized into four departments: Fisheries Policy Planning Department, Resources Management Department, Resources Development Department, and Fishing Port Department.  The Fisheries Policy Planning Department is in charge of the planning of policies concerning the fisheries, and all administrative matters that go along with the organization. The Resources Management Department plans the continuous development of Japan's fisheries. The Resources Development Department is in charge of the scientific research and development in the field of fisheries. The Fishing Port Department is the base for fishery production activities and also the basis for the distribution and processing of the marine products.\n\n===Techniques===\n*[[Ayu fishing]]\n*[[Tenkara fishing]], a type of [[roach fishing]]\n*[[Factory ship]]\n*[[Artificial reef in Japan|Artificial reefs]]  are used to increase the sustainable fishing activities on the coastline.\n*[[Dolphin drive hunting]]\n\n===In literature===\nIn 2008, [[Takiji Kobayashi]]'s ''[[Kanik\u014dsen|A Crab Canning Boat]]'', a 1929 Marxist novel about a crab boat crew determined to stand up to a cruel captain under harsh conditions, became a surprise bestseller, thanks to an advertising campaign linking the novel to the [[working poor]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/12/us-japan-novel-idUST31778020080812?feedType=RSS&sp=true Japan economy angst boosts sales of Marxist novel], Reuters, Aug. 11, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1874054 KOBAYASHI, T.

By contrast, Japan's import of marine products increased greatly in the 1980s, and was nearly 2 million tons in 1989.\n\nThe Japanese fishing industry, both domestic and overseas, has long been centered on the [[Tsukiji fish market]], in Tokyo, which is one of the world's largest wholesale markets for fresh, frozen, and processed seafood.\n\nJapan also has greatly advanced the techniques of [[aquaculture]] or sea farming. In this system, artificial insemination and hatching techniques are used to breed fish and [[shellfish]], which are then released into rivers or seas. These fish and shellfish are caught after they grow bigger. [[Salmon]] is raised this way.\n\nJapan has more than 2,000 fishing ports, including Nagasaki, in southwest Ky\u016bsh\u016b; Otaru, Kushiro, and Abashiri in Hokkaid\u014d. Major fishing ports on the Pacific coast of Honsh\u016b include, Hachinohe, Kesennuma, and Ishinomaki along the Sanriku coast, as well as Choshi, Yaizu, Shimizu, and Misaki to the east and south of Tokyo.\n\nJapan is also one of the world's few whaling nations. As a member of the [[International Whaling Commission]], the government pledged that its fleets would restrict their catch to international quotas, but it attracted international opprobrium for its failure to sign an agreement placing a moratorium on catching sperm whales. Currently Japan conducts \"research whaling\" for minke whales in the oceans surrounding Antarctica.\n\nTwo of the largest fishing companies in Japan are [[Nippon Suisan Kaisha]] and [[Maruha Nichiro]]; each employs more than 10,000 people and owns subsidiaries around the world.\n\n===Government position===\nThe [[Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries (Japan)|Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries]] is the government agency responsible for the fishing industry. The Japanese Fisheries Agency states that the Basic Fisheries Plan was developed by the Japanese government in 2007, and claims that the government is working to establish long-standing, strong fisheries and fishery practices by promoting the overall restoration of the fishery industry. This can be accomplished by promoting surveys and research into fishery resources, the promotion of international [[resource management]] in international waters, promoting international cooperation within the international fishing grounds, and improving the living [[Natural environment|environments]] for all [[aquatic life]] in inland waters, while at the same time promoting [[aquaculture]]. This restoration consists of many different phases to include the restoration and management of high-level fishery resources.\n\nOther priorities of the Japanese government include continuing to develop new technologies to improve fishery operations, whether incorporating new workplace needed technologies, or creating and exploiting intellectual properties. Also, at the top of the list is the reorganization of the fish-labor industry organizations from the top down. The government provides support to the fishery operators groups by helping to acquire the equipment necessary to reduce fuel consumption, through the introduction of energy-saving operating systems. In order to maintain a strong work force in the fishery industry, the government has programs to encourage college students to look into the industry as a possible career path. This includes supporting activities that provide the opportunity to experience stationary net fishing and aquaculture. The government also provides the prospective employees with job information from fisheries worldwide while holding job seminars with well recognized companies in the Japanese fishery business.  There is also a government sponsored on-site training program for individuals planning to make a career in the fishery industry. The fisheries in Japan are governed by the Japanese Fisheries Agency.\n\nThe Fisheries Agency is organized into four departments: Fisheries Policy Planning Department, Resources Management Department, Resources Development Department, and Fishing Port Department.  The Fisheries Policy Planning Department is in charge of the planning of policies concerning the fisheries, and all administrative matters that go along with the organization. The Resources Management Department plans the continuous development of Japan's fisheries. The Resources Development Department is in charge of the scientific research and development in the field of fisheries. The Fishing Port Department is the base for fishery production activities and also the basis for the distribution and processing of the marine products.\n\n===Techniques===\n*[[Ayu fishing]]\n*[[Tenkara fishing]], a type of [[roach fishing]]\n*[[Factory ship]]\n*[[Artificial reef in Japan|Artificial reefs]]  are used to increase the sustainable fishing activities on the coastline.\n*[[Dolphin drive hunting]]\n\n===In literature===\nIn 2008, [[Takiji Kobayashi]]'s ''[[Kanik\u014dsen|A Crab Canning Boat]]'', a 1929 Marxist novel about a crab boat crew determined to stand up to a cruel captain under harsh conditions, became a surprise bestseller, thanks to an advertising campaign linking the novel to the [[working poor]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/12/us-japan-novel-idUST31778020080812?feedType=RSS&sp=true Japan economy angst boosts sales of Marxist novel], Reuters, Aug. 11, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1874054 KOBAYASHI, T.

It was later consolidated with the ''Syracuse Journal'', another Hearst newspaper in Syracuse. By 1922, Syracuse was the thirteenth city in which Hearst established a daily metropolitan newspaper. His papers had an aggregate circulation of more than 6,000,000 and consumed more than twelve percent of all the newsprint paper used in the United States.<ref name=\"firestone\"/>\n\nHearst took full advantage of the economic boom, and starting in 1921, he went on a \"buying spree\" and purchased three newspapers; the ''Times'' in Detroit, the ''Record'' in Boston, and the ''Post-Intelligencer'' in Seattle. In 1922, he added the ''Herald'' in Los Angeles, the ''Herald'' in Washington, D.C., established the ''New York Daily Mirror'' and started a new daily, the ''Oakland Post-Enquirer''<ref name=\"hearstbio\">{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/chieflifeofwilli0000nasa\n|url-access=registration\n|quote=syracuse telegram hearst.\n|title=The Chief: The Life of William Randolph Hearst |first=David|last=Nasaw|accessdate=2010-07-16|work=|publisher=First Mariner Books, Houghton Mifflin|location=New York|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/chieflifeofwilli0000nasa/page/315 315]}}</ref>\n\nHearst stepped into the political arena in [[New York State]] and by late 1922 he acquired five [[Upstate New York]] papers; the ''Syracuse Telegram'', ''Rochester Journal'', the ''Post-Express'' in Albany, the ''Albany Times Union''<ref name=\"hearstbio\"/> and the ''Oswego Daily Press'' in [[Fulton, Oswego County, New York|Fulton, New York]].<ref name=\"oswego\">{{cite news |title=Nurse Brings Suit to Clear Her Name |newspaper=Oswego Daily Palladium |location=Oswego, New York |date=February 19, 1924 }}</ref>\n\n===Established, 1922===\nHearst purchased the ''Albany Times Union'' in [[Albany, New York]] in November, 1922, soon after a failed 1923 presidential bid. \"The chief was still licking his wounds and viewed the Executive Mansion in Albany as a consolation prize.\"<ref name=\"president\">{{cite news|title=POLITICS: From cozy to critical, paper a political player |first=Paul|last=Grondahl|publisher=Capital Newspapers Division of The Hearst Corporation, Albany, N.Y., 2006}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> At the same time, he established the ''Syracuse Telegram'' and three other [[Upstate New York]] papers in order to \"broaden his name recognition across upstate as he prepared to run for governor.\"<ref name=\"president\"/>\n\nThe ''Telegram'' publishers were pleased with the decision and announced to local readers;\n\n{{Quotation|\"The decision of Mr. Hearst to establish a metropolitan newspaper here indicates his appreciation of the importance of this city and his conviction that it is a growing, prosperous and progressive center.\"<ref name=\"firestone\"/>}}\n\nThe newspaper began operation as ''Syracuse Evening Telegram'' on September 25, 1922.

Since the 1980s the Society has enjoyed [[Vice-regal]] [[Patronage]] from the incumbent [[Governor-General of Canada]].

Kane became well known for his record of interactions with the [[First Nations]] People as he travelled across western [[Canada]] with [[The North West Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. While Jacobi, Way and O'Brien and others involved themselves in the 1880 founding of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] there had long been demands, especially in [[Montreal]], for the formation of a specifically medium based society.\n\nWhile several of these early societies did survive for brief periods it was on November 11, 1925, that a group of like-minded artists met at the historic [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts & Letters Club of Toronto]] and founded the CSPWC/SCPA. Only when a working framework was proposed for membership under the honorary leadership of the noted painter R.F. Gagen did it seem possible that such a society could survive in the immense [[geographical]] reality that was Canada. Within a few years a set of [[bylaws]] had been established, a [[constitution]] approved and several [[Toronto]]-based exhibitions held. The first elected President was Fred H. Brigden (1871\u20131951) a well-connected artist and educator who created a sense of vitality within the group and who encouraged many younger artists to apply for election.\n \nThe founding members of the CSPWC/SCPA<ref>\"Aquarelle!, A history of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour 1925-1985\", Rebecca Sisler RCA, Porcupine Quill 1986</ref> were F.H.

However they did send strong letters of support and in reality should be considered \"founders\". This is significant because the inclusion of Florence H.

Rebecca Sisler RCA, Clarke Irwin Co. Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7720-1308-X}}</ref> attracting attention in its infancy, was soon having its exhibitions hung at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]) and the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. This emphasis on exhibitions was crucial at the time as there were virtually no commercial galleries in the country. The only way an individual artist could make a living was by exhibiting with such societies as the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour, the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], and the [[Royal Canadian Academy]], in a public gallery. The reality was that the emerging artist got public recognition by jury acceptance to exhibit with his or her better-known peer group, their fame adding lustre by association.\n\nIn the years between the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], [[Canada]] experienced a period of unexpected growth as demand for its agricultural products and mineral wealth made it one of the world's strongest markets. As one of the signatories of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, Canada was, unknown to itself at the time, seeking to establish its own identity separate from its earlier colonial rulers.\n\n[[File:WorldsFair1939.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Catalogue cover.|The 1939 New York World's Fair catalogue cover.]]\n\nIt was in the visual arts, initially in the area of landscape painting, that the new country found one of its strongest senses of self. As painters across the country fanned out into their respective rural, backwood and northern spaces, it was the medium of watercolour an easily transportable and light material which lent itself so readily to the newly popular subject matter.\n\nWhile many artists did use watercolours as an on-site [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] medium, many used those same paintings as source material for often larger and more highly finished works on [[canvas]] that they produced in their home studios. The resulting public perception of watercolours as a lesser medium than others such as oil is a still recurrent problem for all practitioners despite the fact that watercolour is the more demanding medium. It was this very ill-informed perception that was behind the very founding of the Society as an exhibiting body where the individual art pieces would not be compared to neighbouring work in other less challenging materials.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] was instrumental in assisting the CSPWC/SCPA with a series of high-profile international exchange exhibitions with societies in [[New Zealand]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[US]]. In addition, the National Gallery from 1933 onward sponsored a regular series of juried shows that toured across Canada. The Federal Government invited the CSPWC/SCPA to exhibit in the Canadian Pavilion at the 1938 [[British Empire Exhibition]] and at the 1939 New York [[World's Fair]]. Both of these overseas exhibitions were praised by the international art press and served to increase the prestige of the Society.\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]]  a number of members were appointed official [[war artists]] and served in various capacities at home and on the war fronts. The regular series of exhibitions was obviously affected and only fully resumed in 1946.\n\n== Times change ==\nIn 1949, the Society's annual exhibition at the [[Art Gallery of Toronto]] was reorganized to open up new rules to become the first truly \"open\", as opposed to \"invitational\", show in the Society's history. That tradition, with some amendments, has continued to the present day with the current \"Open Water\" Annual Exhibition being open internationally to any artist working in the medium.\n \nThe 1950s witnessed the creation of new areas of art scholarship with the development of both commercial art galleries and a new professional approach to art curatorships in the major public galleries. Finding that a sizeable percentage of the exhibition programme was taken up with the annual shows of regional and national arts groups, the new curatorial staff repositioned themselves. The last regular exhibition of the Society at the Art Gallery of Toronto was hosted in 1958 and subsequently there was a cooling of long treasured connections with [[National Gallery of Canada|Ottawa's National Gallery]].\n \nThe leadership within the CSPWC/SCPA sought alternate gallery space and found it in a variety of venues from coast to coast. Regional galleries, libraries and university campuses hosted the annual exhibitions and a new sense of national identity was found within the Society. While the annual search for a venue created much work for a volunteer membership it did help develop a real sense of comradeship that has continued to the present day. While a number of other media-based institutions started to falter during this difficult period the CSPWC/SCPA worked very hard to keep itself viable and the annual juried show its \"[[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]]\". Working from within its own resources and relying on elected members in far-flung communities, the regular annual exhibitions continued to take place but the cost of shipping, cataloguing and insurance were prohibitive and much of the work was performed by a small set of volunteers. It all became very draining, and as new commercial galleries sprung up, many members left to forge more lucrative connections.\n\n== Rebounding ==\nThe long history of annual juried exhibitions continued into the 1970s and with the addition of exchange exhibitions with the [[American Watercolor Society]] at the National Academy Galleries in [[New York City]]. In 1975, an invitation was accepted to exhibit at the newly renovated [[Canada House]] on [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. The same year the Art Gallery of Ontario hosted an \"in-house\" retrospective to salute the Society's 50th anniversary.<ref>\"FIFTY YEARS, The Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour, 1925-1975\". 1975 Catalogue, Art Gallery of Ontario. Katharine A. Jordan. {{ISBN|0-919876-08-0}}</ref> In 1976 the Society was able to organize a member exchange exhibition with [[Japan]]<ref>\"Watercolours Japan - Canada [An exhibition sponsored by CSPWC/SCPA and the Japanese Water Colour Society]\" 1976 Catalogue, Foreword by John Bennett. Design by [[William Rueter]], Printer: The Coach House Press, Toronto. A Wintario Project.</ref> that was exhibited at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum]]. This particular show, with the cooperation of a number of government and commercial partners was a critical success. The acclaim received gave the CSPWC/SCPA members a renewed sense of identity.\n \nWorking with Visual Arts Ontario,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> the Society was able to obtain permanent office space in the 1970s and was able to organize the first of a number of educational seminars that have evolved into today's popular National Watercolour Symposiums. These week-long events have been held in virtually every part of the country and have been responsible for a major spurt in applications for membership.\n \nWhen the time came to organize the CSPWC/SCPA 1985 [[Diamond Jubilee]] the Society found that the world of art had again gone through some major changes. First there was a burst of new interest in the whole field of painting in watercolour that was particularly evident in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]].

Kane became well known for his record of interactions with the [[First Nations]] People as he travelled across western [[Canada]] with [[The North West Company]] and the [[Hudson's Bay Company]]. While Jacobi, Way and O'Brien and others involved themselves in the 1880 founding of the [[Royal Canadian Academy of Arts]] there had long been demands, especially in [[Montreal]], for the formation of a specifically medium based society.\n\nWhile several of these early societies did survive for brief periods it was on November 11, 1925, that a group of like-minded artists met at the historic [[The Arts and Letters Club of Toronto|Arts & Letters Club of Toronto]] and founded the CSPWC/SCPA. Only when a working framework was proposed for membership under the honorary leadership of the noted painter R.F. Gagen did it seem possible that such a society could survive in the immense [[geographical]] reality that was Canada. Within a few years a set of [[bylaws]] had been established, a [[constitution]] approved and several [[Toronto]]-based exhibitions held. The first elected President was Fred H. Brigden (1871\u20131951) a well-connected artist and educator who created a sense of vitality within the group and who encouraged many younger artists to apply for election.\n \nThe founding members of the CSPWC/SCPA<ref>\"Aquarelle!, A history of the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour 1925-1985\", Rebecca Sisler RCA, Porcupine Quill 1986</ref> were F.H.

Phillips<ref name=autogenerated2 /> and F.H. McGillivray<ref name=autogenerated2 /> who, being based at distances from Toronto, were unable to attend. However they did send strong letters of support and in reality should be considered \"founders\". This is significant because the inclusion of Florence H. McGillivray<ref name=autogenerated2 /> is evidence of the new society's willingness to accept [[female]] members from its inception.\n\n== Formative years ==\nThe CSPWC/SCPA,<ref>\"Passionate Spirits (History of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, 1880-1980)\", Page 162. Rebecca Sisler RCA, Clarke Irwin Co. Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7720-1308-X}}</ref> attracting attention in its infancy, was soon having its exhibitions hung at the Art Gallery of Toronto (now the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]]) and the [[National Gallery of Canada]]. This emphasis on exhibitions was crucial at the time as there were virtually no commercial galleries in the country. The only way an individual artist could make a living was by exhibiting with such societies as the Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour, the [[Ontario Society of Artists]], and the [[Royal Canadian Academy]], in a public gallery. The reality was that the emerging artist got public recognition by jury acceptance to exhibit with his or her better-known peer group, their fame adding lustre by association.\n\nIn the years between the [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], [[Canada]] experienced a period of unexpected growth as demand for its agricultural products and mineral wealth made it one of the world's strongest markets. As one of the signatories of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919, Canada was, unknown to itself at the time, seeking to establish its own identity separate from its earlier colonial rulers.\n\n[[File:WorldsFair1939.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Catalogue cover.|The 1939 New York World's Fair catalogue cover.]]\n\nIt was in the visual arts, initially in the area of landscape painting, that the new country found one of its strongest senses of self. As painters across the country fanned out into their respective rural, backwood and northern spaces, it was the medium of watercolour an easily transportable and light material which lent itself so readily to the newly popular subject matter.\n\nWhile many artists did use watercolours as an on-site [[sketch (drawing)|sketching]] medium, many used those same paintings as source material for often larger and more highly finished works on [[canvas]] that they produced in their home studios. The resulting public perception of watercolours as a lesser medium than others such as oil is a still recurrent problem for all practitioners despite the fact that watercolour is the more demanding medium. It was this very ill-informed perception that was behind the very founding of the Society as an exhibiting body where the individual art pieces would not be compared to neighbouring work in other less challenging materials.\n\nBeginning in the 1930s, the [[National Gallery of Canada]] was instrumental in assisting the CSPWC/SCPA with a series of high-profile international exchange exhibitions with societies in [[New Zealand]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]] and the [[US]]. In addition, the National Gallery from 1933 onward sponsored a regular series of juried shows that toured across Canada. The Federal Government invited the CSPWC/SCPA to exhibit in the Canadian Pavilion at the 1938 [[British Empire Exhibition]] and at the 1939 New York [[World's Fair]]. Both of these overseas exhibitions were praised by the international art press and served to increase the prestige of the Society.\n\nWith the outbreak of [[World War II]]  a number of members were appointed official [[war artists]] and served in various capacities at home and on the war fronts. The regular series of exhibitions was obviously affected and only fully resumed in 1946.\n\n== Times change ==\nIn 1949, the Society's annual exhibition at the [[Art Gallery of Toronto]] was reorganized to open up new rules to become the first truly \"open\", as opposed to \"invitational\", show in the Society's history. That tradition, with some amendments, has continued to the present day with the current \"Open Water\" Annual Exhibition being open internationally to any artist working in the medium.\n \nThe 1950s witnessed the creation of new areas of art scholarship with the development of both commercial art galleries and a new professional approach to art curatorships in the major public galleries. Finding that a sizeable percentage of the exhibition programme was taken up with the annual shows of regional and national arts groups, the new curatorial staff repositioned themselves. The last regular exhibition of the Society at the Art Gallery of Toronto was hosted in 1958 and subsequently there was a cooling of long treasured connections with [[National Gallery of Canada|Ottawa's National Gallery]].\n \nThe leadership within the CSPWC/SCPA sought alternate gallery space and found it in a variety of venues from coast to coast. Regional galleries, libraries and university campuses hosted the annual exhibitions and a new sense of national identity was found within the Society. While the annual search for a venue created much work for a volunteer membership it did help develop a real sense of comradeship that has continued to the present day. While a number of other media-based institutions started to falter during this difficult period the CSPWC/SCPA worked very hard to keep itself viable and the annual juried show its \"[[wikt:raison d'\u00eatre|raison d'\u00eatre]]\". Working from within its own resources and relying on elected members in far-flung communities, the regular annual exhibitions continued to take place but the cost of shipping, cataloguing and insurance were prohibitive and much of the work was performed by a small set of volunteers. It all became very draining, and as new commercial galleries sprung up, many members left to forge more lucrative connections.\n\n== Rebounding ==\nThe long history of annual juried exhibitions continued into the 1970s and with the addition of exchange exhibitions with the [[American Watercolor Society]] at the National Academy Galleries in [[New York City]]. In 1975, an invitation was accepted to exhibit at the newly renovated [[Canada House]] on [[Trafalgar Square]] in [[London]]. The same year the Art Gallery of Ontario hosted an \"in-house\" retrospective to salute the Society's 50th anniversary.<ref>\"FIFTY YEARS, The Canadian Society of Painters in Water Colour, 1925-1975\". 1975 Catalogue, Art Gallery of Ontario. Katharine A. Jordan. {{ISBN|0-919876-08-0}}</ref> In 1976 the Society was able to organize a member exchange exhibition with [[Japan]]<ref>\"Watercolours Japan - Canada [An exhibition sponsored by CSPWC/SCPA and the Japanese Water Colour Society]\" 1976 Catalogue, Foreword by John Bennett. Design by [[William Rueter]], Printer: The Coach House Press, Toronto. A Wintario Project.</ref> that was exhibited at the [[Tokyo Metropolitan Art Museum]]. This particular show, with the cooperation of a number of government and commercial partners was a critical success. The acclaim received gave the CSPWC/SCPA members a renewed sense of identity.\n \nWorking with Visual Arts Ontario,<ref name=autogenerated2 /> the Society was able to obtain permanent office space in the 1970s and was able to organize the first of a number of educational seminars that have evolved into today's popular National Watercolour Symposiums. These week-long events have been held in virtually every part of the country and have been responsible for a major spurt in applications for membership.\n \nWhen the time came to organize the CSPWC/SCPA 1985 [[Diamond Jubilee]] the Society found that the world of art had again gone through some major changes. First there was a burst of new interest in the whole field of painting in watercolour that was particularly evident in [[Canada]] and the [[United States]]. There was also a realization in the art community that while there were many advantages to be found in the commercial galleries there were still other opportunities that could only be found in the context of the traditional societies. This was strongly reinforced when [[HM Queen Elizabeth II|H.M. The Queen]] accepted the 60 paintings that had been juried as the \"CSPWC Diamond Jubilee Collection\" (later known as the [[Royal Collection Project - CSPWC]], phase 1) into the fabled [[Royal Collection]] at [[Windsor Castle]] and exhibited them in 1986 in the Castle's Drawing Gallery.
