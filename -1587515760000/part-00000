It probably had mainly a browsing diet in open habitats, but also it probably fed on other moderate to soft tough food. For millions of years, the sloth did not have many enemies to bother it, so it was probably a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animal.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe giant ground sloth was a herbivore, feeding on leaves such as [[yucca]]s, [[agave]]s, and [[grass]]es.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} While it fed chiefly on terrestrial plants, it could also stand on its hind legs, using its tail as a balancing tripod, and reach for upper growth vegetation. It would pull itself upright to sit on its haunches or to stand and then tugged at plants with its feet, digging them up with the five sharp claws on each foot. The sloth used its buttcheeks to grind down food before swallowing it, and its highly developed cheek muscles helped in this process. The sloth's stomach was able to digest coarse and fibrous food.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is likely that it spent a lot of time resting to aid digestion.\n\n[[File:Megatherium cuvieri - skull.JPG|upright|thumb|left|''M. americanum'' skull]]\n[[File:Megatherium claw NMNH qrius.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The claw]]\nA recent morpho-functional analysis<ref name=\"bargo2001\"/> indicates that ''M. americanum'' was adapted for strong vertical biting. The teeth are [[hypsodont]] and [[Molar (tooth)|bilophodont]], and the sagittal section of each [[Molar (tooth)|loph]] is triangular with a sharp edge. This suggests that the teeth were used for cutting, rather than grinding, and that hard fibrous food was not the primary dietary component.\n\nWhile it has been suggested that the giant sloth may have been partly [[carnivore|carnivorous]], this is a controversial claim. Richard Fari\u00f1a and Ernesto Blanco of the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica]] in [[Montevideo]] have analysed a [[fossil]] skeleton of ''M. americanum'' and discovered that its [[olecranon]]\u2014the part of the elbow to which the [[triceps]] muscle attaches\u2014was very short. This adaptation is found in carnivores and optimises speed rather than strength. The researchers say this would have enabled ''M. americanum'' to use its claws like daggers. They suggest that to add nutrients to its diet, ''Megatherium'' may have taken over the kills of ''[[Smilodon]]''. Based on the estimated strength and [[mechanical advantage]] of its [[biceps]], it has been proposed that ''Megatherium'' could have overturned adult [[glyptodon]]ts (large, armored xenarthrans, related to armadillos) as a means of scavenging or hunting these animals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fari\u00f1a|first=R.

It probably had mainly a browsing diet in open habitats, but also it probably fed on other moderate to soft tough food. For millions of years, the sloth did not have many enemies to bother it, so it was probably a [[Diurnality|diurnal]] animal.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}}\n\nThe giant ground sloth was a herbivore, feeding on leaves such as [[yucca]]s, [[agave]]s, and [[grass]]es.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} While it fed chiefly on terrestrial plants, it could also stand on its hind legs, using its tail as a balancing tripod, and reach for upper growth vegetation. It would pull itself upright to sit on its haunches or to stand and then tugged at plants with its feet, digging them up with the five sharp claws on each foot. The sloth used its simple teeth to grind down food before swallowing it, and its highly developed cheek muscles helped in this process. The sloth's stomach was able to digest coarse and fibrous food.{{citation needed|date=January 2019}} It is likely that it spent a lot of time resting to aid digestion.\n\n[[File:Megatherium cuvieri - skull.JPG|upright|thumb|left|''M. americanum'' skull]]\n[[File:Megatherium claw NMNH qrius.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The claw]]\nA recent morpho-functional analysis<ref name=\"bargo2001\"/> indicates that ''M. americanum'' was adapted for strong vertical biting. The teeth are [[hypsodont]] and [[Molar (tooth)|bilophodont]], and the sagittal section of each [[Molar (tooth)|loph]] is triangular with a sharp edge. This suggests that the teeth were used for cutting, rather than grinding, and that hard fibrous food was not the primary dietary component.\n\nWhile it has been suggested that the giant sloth may have been partly [[carnivore|carnivorous]], this is a controversial claim. Richard Fari\u00f1a and Ernesto Blanco of the [[University of the Republic (Uruguay)|Universidad de la Rep\u00fablica]] in [[Montevideo]] have analysed a [[fossil]] skeleton of ''M. americanum'' and discovered that its [[olecranon]]\u2014the part of the elbow to which the [[triceps]] muscle attaches\u2014was very short. This adaptation is found in carnivores and optimises speed rather than strength. The researchers say this would have enabled ''M. americanum'' to use its claws like daggers. They suggest that to add nutrients to its diet, ''Megatherium'' may have taken over the kills of ''[[Smilodon]]''. Based on the estimated strength and [[mechanical advantage]] of its [[biceps]], it has been proposed that ''Megatherium'' could have overturned adult [[glyptodon]]ts (large, armored xenarthrans, related to armadillos) as a means of scavenging or hunting these animals.<ref>{{cite book|last=Fari\u00f1a|first=R.

He was the son of Ann (n\u00e9e Dillon) and [[Patrick \"Patt\" Lalor]], a landowner and [[Tithe War|supporter of the abolition of tithes]] who was a member of the [[British House of Commons|British parliament]] (MP) in 1832\u20131835; Patt Lalor was the first Catholic MP from Queen's County since the anti-Catholic [[Test Act]]s of the 17th century. He had 11 children, of whom Peter was the youngest. The eldest brother was [[James Fintan Lalor]], who was later involved in the [[Young Ireland]] movement and the [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|unsuccessful rebellion of 1848]]. Another brother, [[Richard Lalor]], also became a member of the British Parliament, representing the [[Irish National League|Parnellite nationalist]] party.  Their mother died on 4 June 1835; Patt Lalor later remarried, to Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan (with whom he had no children).\nPeter Lalor was educated at [[St. Patrick's, Carlow College|Carlow College]] and then trained as a [[civil engineering|civil engineer]] at [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]].<ref name=\"adbonline.anu.edu.au\">http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050059b.htm</ref>\n\nThree of the Lalor brothers migrated to America and fought on both sides of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. However, Peter and his brother Richard decided to go to Australia, arriving in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in October 1852. Lalor worked first in the construction of the [[Melbourne]]&ndash;[[Geelong]] railway line, but resigned to take part in the [[Victorian Gold Rush]]. He began mining in the Ovens diggings ([[Beechworth]]), then moved to the [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka Lead]] at [[Ballarat]] where he befriended [[Duncan Gillies]] (who later became Premier of Victoria). His brother Richard returned to Ireland, becoming politically active and himself a member of the House of Commons.<ref>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lalor-peter-3980/ Biography of Peter Lalor] at Australian Dictionary of Biography.\n <sub>Retrieved 8 April 2013</sub></ref>\n\n==Events leading to the Eureka Stockade==\nThe agitation against the goldfields licences (which were 30 shillings each) began at [[Bendigo]] in 1853, and was quickly taken up at Ballarat, and a [[Ballarat Reform League|Reform League]] was formed amongst the diggers on the various goldfields for the redress of grievances. In October 1854, the Government ordered the police to go out hunting for unlicensed diggers two times a week.\n\nIn the later half of 1854 a digger named [[James Scobie]] was killed in a scuffle at the Eureka Hotel, on Specimen Hill; Bentley who was the publican, was considered by the diggers to have participated in the murder. He and others were charged with the murder and arrested, but with the police court, they were discharged.\n\nAn indignation meeting was held at Ballarat on 17 October, close to the spot where Scobie was killed. At this meeting a committee was appointed, of which Peter Lalor was one. The authorities, fearing that the meeting might lead to an attack on Bentley's hotel, sent police to act as a guard over it. A youth threw a stone at the lamp in front of the building, breaking the glass. That act of violence, was the spark. With cries of \"Down with the house\" and \"Burn it.\", the angry mob stormed the hotel and set fire to it. Three people were arrested, and charged with act of incendiarism, and were committed and imprisoned.\n\nA mass meeting was held on [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]] on 11 November 1854, to demand the release of the alleged incendiaries. It also passed resolutions affirming the right of the people to full representation, manhood suffrage, the abolition of the property qualification for members, payment of members, short Parliaments, and the abolition of the [[Gold Commissioner|Gold Commission]] and the diggers' licenses. Bentley, in the meantime, had been re-arrested on the advice of the Attorney-General [[William Stawell]] for the murder of Scobie, and convicted. He was sentenced to three years on the roads.\n\nOn 29 November a meeting of about 12,000  men was held at Ballarat. This is said to be the first public meeting that Mr. Lalor addressed. He moved one of the resolutions submitted and passed. It called for a meeting of the Reform League for the following Sunday to elect a central committee. The \"insurgent flag \" was hoisted on the platform. It represented the Southern Cross constellation. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting declared the license fee to be an unjustifiable imposition. A bonfire was soon kindled and the licences burnt. At this meeting, the rebellion was formally inaugurated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6221425 |title=DEATH OF MR.

The diggers formed a barricade, where they were attacked by troops and police on 3 December. Lalor was seriously wounded in the left arm, resulting in its amputation. A warrant for Lalor's arrest on charges of sedition was initially sought, but he was taken from Ballarat and hidden by his supporters in the Young Queen Hotel at [[South Geelong, Victoria|South Geelong]]. The warrant was withdrawn in June 1855 after juries had found 13 other ringleaders not guilty of sedition.\n\nAs a result of the uprising a number of the miners' complaints were resolved. Legislation was passed to give miners the right to vote. A new form of licensing of Miners Rights costing \u00a31 per year was introduced.\nThe monthly gold tax was abolished. A general amnesty for the three miners arrested after the Bentley's Eureka Hotel fire and the 114 arrested at the Eureka Stockade was proclaimed.\n\n===Lalor's escape===\n<blockquote>While the victors of Eureka were removing them alive from the stockade, Peter Lalor, the diggers' leader, lay under the pile of slabs in which he had been hidden, bleeding from the wound in his arm. A musket ball had shattered the bone close to the shoulder, and the few who knew where he was lying saw the blood trickling from beneath the pile of slabs even while the soldiers, keen to capture him, were still in the stockade.he was angry. When the last of them had gone, Lalor was helped from his hiding place, put upon a white horse, and rode away through the bush towards Warrenheip. There he claimed shelter at the hut of a man he knew. The digger was absent, and his wife went to look for him. Lalor, however, doubted her genuineness, and believing that she had gone to communicate with the police, he took to the bush again for shelter. All that night he wandered about, with his crushed arm still swinging useless and unattended. He was greatly weakened from loss of blood, and only his indomitable pluck kept him up. Towards morning he determined to seek assistance from Stephen Cummins, an old friend whom he could trust, and who lived with his wife on Pennyweight Hill.\n\nIt was on the early morning of the Monday following the fight that Mrs. Cummins drew her husband's attention to a man walking slowly between the holes on the flat, and said, \"That is Peter Lalor; I feel sure of it\". \"As I ran down to help him\", Steve Cummins told a friend, \"his face was grey and worried. He looked like a frail old man rather than a powerful young one, so greatly had pain and loss of blood during the 24 hours weakened him. I helped him into the hut, where as well as we could, my wife and I bandaged the wounded arm. I knew that my hut was no place for him. A reward of \u00a3200 had been offered for his arrest, and there were many mean spirits keen to earn it. Our friendship was well known, and I felt sure that sooner or later my place would be searched by the police. I ran at once across the gully to the Roman Catholic Presbytery and told Father Smyth that Lalor was in my tent badly wounded and in need of surgical assistance. I told him my fears as to the police visiting us, and Father Smyth said, 'He will be safer here, I think. Bring him over after dark.' So that night we took him across to the presbytery, meeting, fortunately, not a soul upon the road.\" Steve Cummins's intuition had served him  well, for next night the police searched his hut, just at the time when he was watching Drs. Doyle and Stewart amputating Peter Lalor's arm, for the severity of the wound and the delay in treating it precluded any possibility of the arm being saved. Through the ordeal of amputation, as in every other emergency of life, he showed that fine courage which nothing could shake!\n\nA man employed about the Presbytery took the severed arm away as soon as the operation was over, and threw it down an abandoned shaft, but by Father Smyth's orders it was recovered later and properly buried. The first operation was not complete. A portion of the bullet remained lodged in the stump of the arm, and it was only after a second operation at Geelong that the wound healed properly.\n          So yars queen\n<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9523184 |title=GOLD-SEEKERS OF THE FIFTIES. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=1 July 1899 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:lalor.jpg|thumb]]\nDue to the political changes caused by the [[Eureka Stockade]],  Lalor was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] in November 1855 as Member for the new [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|district of Ballaarat]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/aatfaveao1851atitnomotlcov1084.pdf\n |title=An Act to further alter \"The Victoria Electoral Act of 1851\" and to increase the Number of Members of the Legislative Council of Victoria.\n |year=1855\n |accessdate=19 June 2013}}\n\n</ref> and remained in this role until March 1856.<ref name=pov-pl>{{cite web|title=Re-Member (Former Members): Lalor, Peter|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/re-member/bioregfull.cfm?mid=499|work=[[Parliament of Victoria]] official site|publisher=Parliament of Victoria|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated133\">''Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat 1851\u20131901'' page 133, ([[Weston Bate]], Melbourne University Press, 1978)</ref> In November 1856, under the new, more democratic constitution (featuring near-universal white male suffrage) Lalor was elected unopposed to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of North Grenville|North Grenville]] (Ballarat West).

He was the son of Ann (n\u00e9e Dillon) and [[Patrick \"Patt\" Lalor]], a landowner and [[Tithe War|supporter of the abolition of tithes]] who was a member of the [[British House of Commons|British parliament]] (MP) in 1832\u20131835; Patt Lalor was the first Catholic MP from Queen's County since the anti-Catholic [[Test Act]]s of the 17th century. He had 11 children, of whom Peter was the youngest. The eldest brother was [[James Fintan Lalor]], who was later involved in the [[Young Ireland]] movement and the [[Young Irelander Rebellion of 1848|unsuccessful rebellion of 1848]]. Another brother, [[Richard Lalor]], also became a member of the British Parliament, representing the [[Irish National League|Parnellite nationalist]] party.  Their mother died on 4 June 1835; Patt Lalor later remarried, to Ellen Mary Anne Loughnan (with whom he had no children).\nPeter Lalor was educated at [[St. Patrick's, Carlow College|Carlow College]] and then trained as a [[civil engineering|civil engineer]] at [[Trinity College Dublin|Trinity College]].<ref name=\"adbonline.anu.edu.au\">http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A050059b.htm</ref>\n\nThree of the Lalor brothers migrated to America and fought on both sides of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. However, Peter and his brother Richard decided to go to Australia, arriving in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in October 1852. Lalor worked first in the construction of the [[Melbourne]]&ndash;[[Geelong]] railway line, but resigned to take part in the [[Victorian Gold Rush]]. He began mining in the Ovens diggings ([[Beechworth]]), then moved to the [[Eureka, Victoria|Eureka Lead]] at [[Ballarat]] where he befriended [[Duncan Gillies]] (who later became Premier of Victoria). His brother Richard returned to Ireland, becoming politically active and himself a member of the House of Commons.<ref>[http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/lalor-peter-3980/ Biography of Peter Lalor] at Australian Dictionary of Biography.\n <sub>Retrieved 8 April 2013</sub></ref>\n\n==Events leading to the Eureka Stockade==\nThe agitation against the goldfields licences (which were 30 shillings each) began at [[Bendigo]] in 1853, and was quickly taken up at Ballarat, and a [[Ballarat Reform League|Reform League]] was formed amongst the diggers on the various goldfields for the redress of grievances. In October 1854, the Government ordered the police to go out hunting for unlicensed diggers two times a week.\n\nIn the later half of 1854 a digger named [[James Scobie]] was killed in a scuffle at the Eureka Hotel, on Specimen Hill; Bentley who was the publican, was considered by the diggers to have participated in the murder. He and others were charged with the murder and arrested, but with the police court, they were discharged.\n\nAn indignation meeting was held at Ballarat on 17 October, close to the spot where Scobie was killed. At this meeting a committee was appointed, of which Peter Lalor was one. The authorities, fearing that the meeting might lead to an attack on Bentley's hotel, sent police to act as a guard over it. A youth threw a stone at the lamp in front of the building, breaking the glass. That act of violence, was the spark. With cries of \"Down with the house\" and \"Burn it.\", the angry mob stormed the hotel and set fire to it. Three people were arrested, and charged with act of incendiarism, and were committed and imprisoned.\n\nA mass meeting was held on [[Bakery Hill, Victoria|Bakery Hill]] on 11 November 1854, to demand the release of the alleged incendiaries. It also passed resolutions affirming the right of the people to full representation, manhood suffrage, the abolition of the property qualification for members, payment of members, short Parliaments, and the abolition of the [[Gold Commissioner|Gold Commission]] and the diggers' licenses. Bentley, in the meantime, had been re-arrested on the advice of the Attorney-General [[William Stawell]] for the murder of Scobie, and convicted. He was sentenced to three years on the roads.\n\nOn 29 November a meeting of about 12,000  men was held at Ballarat. This is said to be the first public meeting that Mr. Lalor addressed. He moved one of the resolutions submitted and passed. It called for a meeting of the Reform League for the following Sunday to elect a central committee. The \"insurgent flag \" was hoisted on the platform. It represented the Southern Cross constellation. One of the resolutions passed at the meeting declared the license fee to be an unjustifiable imposition. A bonfire was soon kindled and the licences burnt. At this meeting, the rebellion was formally inaugurated.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article6221425 |title=DEATH OF MR.

The diggers formed a barricade, where they were attacked by troops and police on 3 December. Lalor was seriously wounded in the left arm, resulting in its amputation. A warrant for Lalor's arrest on charges of sedition was initially sought, but he was taken from Ballarat and hidden by his supporters in the Young Queen Hotel at [[South Geelong, Victoria|South Geelong]]. The warrant was withdrawn in June 1855 after juries had found 13 other ringleaders not guilty of sedition.\n\nAs a result of the uprising a number of the miners' complaints were resolved. Legislation was passed to give miners the right to vote. A new form of licensing of Miners Rights costing \u00a31 per year was introduced.\nThe monthly gold tax was abolished. A general amnesty for the three miners arrested after the Bentley's Eureka Hotel fire and the 114 arrested at the Eureka Stockade was proclaimed.\n\n===Lalor's escape===\n<blockquote>While the victors of Eureka were removing them alive from the stockade, Peter Lalor, the diggers' leader, lay under the pile of slabs in which he had been hidden, bleeding from the wound in his arm. A musket ball had shattered the bone close to the shoulder, and the few who knew where he was lying saw the blood trickling from beneath the pile of slabs even while the soldiers, keen to capture him, were still in the stockade.he was angry. When the last of them had gone, Lalor was helped from his hiding place, put upon a white horse, and rode away through the bush towards Warrenheip. There he claimed shelter at the hut of a man he knew. The digger was absent, and his wife went to look for him. Lalor, however, doubted her genuineness, and believing that she had gone to communicate with the police, he took to the bush again for shelter. All that night he wandered about, with his crushed arm still swinging useless and unattended. He was greatly weakened from loss of blood, and only his indomitable pluck kept him up. Towards morning he determined to seek assistance from Stephen Cummins, an old friend whom he could trust, and who lived with his wife on Pennyweight Hill.\n\nIt was on the early morning of the Monday following the fight that Mrs. Cummins drew her husband's attention to a man walking slowly between the holes on the flat, and said, \"That is Peter Lalor; I feel sure of it\". \"As I ran down to help him\", Steve Cummins told a friend, \"his face was grey and worried. He looked like a frail old man rather than a powerful young one, so greatly had pain and loss of blood during the 24 hours weakened him. I helped him into the hut, where as well as we could, my wife and I bandaged the wounded arm. I knew that my hut was no place for him. A reward of \u00a3200 had been offered for his arrest, and there were many mean spirits keen to earn it. Our friendship was well known, and I felt sure that sooner or later my place would be searched by the police. I ran at once across the gully to the Roman Catholic Presbytery and told Father Smyth that Lalor was in my tent badly wounded and in need of surgical assistance. I told him my fears as to the police visiting us, and Father Smyth said, 'He will be safer here, I think. Bring him over after dark.' So that night we took him across to the presbytery, meeting, fortunately, not a soul upon the road.\" Steve Cummins's intuition had served him  well, for next night the police searched his hut, just at the time when he was watching Drs. Doyle and Stewart amputating Peter Lalor's arm, for the severity of the wound and the delay in treating it precluded any possibility of the arm being saved. Through the ordeal of amputation, as in every other emergency of life, he showed that fine courage which nothing could shake!\n\nA man employed about the Presbytery took the severed arm away as soon as the operation was over, and threw it down an abandoned shaft, but by Father Smyth's orders it was recovered later and properly buried. The first operation was not complete. A portion of the bullet remained lodged in the stump of the arm, and it was only after a second operation at Geelong that the wound healed properly.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article9523184 |title=GOLD-SEEKERS OF THE FIFTIES. |newspaper=[[The Argus (Melbourne)|The Argus]] |location=Melbourne |date=1 July 1899 |accessdate=17 February 2012 |page=4 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Politics==\n[[File:lalor.jpg|thumb]]\nDue to the political changes caused by the [[Eureka Stockade]],  Lalor was elected to the [[Victorian Legislative Council]] in November 1855 as Member for the new [[Electoral district of Ballaarat|district of Ballaarat]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/hist_act/aatfaveao1851atitnomotlcov1084.pdf\n |title=An Act to further alter \"The Victoria Electoral Act of 1851\" and to increase the Number of Members of the Legislative Council of Victoria.\n |year=1855\n |accessdate=19 June 2013}}\n\n</ref> and remained in this role until March 1856.<ref name=pov-pl>{{cite web|title=Re-Member (Former Members): Lalor, Peter|url=http://www.parliament.vic.gov.au/re-member/bioregfull.cfm?mid=499|work=[[Parliament of Victoria]] official site|publisher=Parliament of Victoria|accessdate=23 February 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"autogenerated133\">''Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat 1851\u20131901'' page 133, ([[Weston Bate]], Melbourne University Press, 1978)</ref> In November 1856, under the new, more democratic constitution (featuring near-universal white male suffrage) Lalor was elected unopposed to the [[Victorian Legislative Assembly|Legislative Assembly]] seat of [[Electoral district of North Grenville|North Grenville]] (Ballarat West).

Some argue that he was ruthless in using low-paid Chinese workers to get rid of Australians seeking better and safer working conditions. In parliament he supported a repressive land Bill in 1857 which favoured the rich.

The suburb of Lalor is not in the electorate, which is pronounced \"LAW-luh\".\n\nLalor Street in [[Ballarat East]] was also named in his honour.\n\nThe [[University of Ballarat]] (now known as [[Federation University Australia]]) honoured him by naming one of the two Mt Helen campus' [[Dormitory|Halls of Residence]] after him (the other being named after [[Bella Guerin]], the first woman to graduate from an Australian university).\n\nPortrayals of Lalor's role in the Eureka Rebellion appear in film.<br>\nThe first film to have Lalor appear in is supposed to be ''[[Eureka Stockade (1907 film)]]'', but only a seven-minute fragment thereof has survived. In 1915, Lalor was portrayed by Leslie Victor in the silent film [[The Loyal Rebel]]\u2014this film is also considered [[Lost film|lost]].<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0356838/?ref_=fn_al_tt_5/ ''The Loyal Rebel'' at IMDb] <sub>Retrieved 9 April 2013</sub></ref>\nNext, he was played by [[Chips Rafferty]] in the 1949 British film ''[[Eureka Stockade (1949 film)|Eureka Stockade]]'' (released in United States of America under the title, ''Massacre Hill''.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041340/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1/ ''Eureka Stockade (1949)'' at IMDb] <sub>Retrieved 9 April 2013</sub></ref>)  He was played by Australian actor [[Bryan Brown]] in ''Eureka Stockade'', a two-part television mini-series which aired on the Seven Network in 1984.<ref>[http://colsearch.nfsa.afc.gov.au/nfsa/search/display/display.w3p;adv=;group=;groupequals=;holdingType=;page=0;parentid=;query=Eureka%20Stockade%20Media%3A%22FILM%22%20|%20Media%3A%22TELEVISION%22;querytype=;rec=6;resCount=10/ ''Eureka Stockade (1984)'' at National Film & Sound Archive]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} <sub>Retrieved 9 April 2013</sub></ref>  The last film to date to picture Lalor was the Australian documentary ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' from 2006, with Lalor played by Andrew Larkins.<ref>[http://www.parham-media.com/docos/riotorr/ror_notes.htm/ ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' notes and credits] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140906051907/http://www.parham-media.com/docos/riotorr/ror_notes.htm/ |date=6 September 2014 }} at parham-media-com <sub>Retrieved 9 April 2013</sub></ref><ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0979937/?ref_=fn_al_tt_4/ ''Riot or Revolution: Eureka Stockade 1854'' at IMDb] <sub>Retrieved 9 April 2013</sub></ref>\n\nFor further information about the various films depicting Peter Lalor, see: [[Eureka Rebellion#Film and television]].\n\nLalor has also been depicted in the commemorative [[Son et lumi\u00e8re (show)|Son et lumi\u00e8re]] \"Blood Under the Southern Cross\" at [[Sovereign Hill]] since 1992.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sovereignhill.com.au/sound-light-show/ |title=Sovereign Hill Sound and Light Show |publisher=Sovereignhill.com.au |accessdate=29 November 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111213180431/http://www.sovereignhill.com.au/sound-light-show/ |archive-date=13 December 2011 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA caricature bollard by artist [[Jan Mitchell]] depicting Peter Lalor holding the Eureka flag was erected on the Geelong foreshore in 1999 as part of the [[Waterfront Geelong]] bollard walk.\n\nHis portrait is featured on two commemorative postage stamps, a 38c Ireland stamp released on 3 May 2001 in the \"Rebel Spirit, Irish Heritage of Australia\" series and a 2004 [[AUD]]2.45 Australian stamp commemorating the Eureka Stockade.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n* {{Dictionary of Australian Biography|First=Peter|Last=Lalor|shortlink=0-dict-biogL.html#lalor1}}\n* {{Cite web |url=http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/collections/treasures/plp.html |title=Peter Lalor's pistol at the State Library of Victoria |access-date=1 July 2007 |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20090525211411/http://www.slv.vic.gov.au/collections/treasures/plp.html |archive-date=25 May 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}\n*{{cite Australasia|Lalor, Hon.

{"title_page": "Simultaneous release", "text_new": "{{good article}}\nA '''simultaneous release''' is the [[Film distribution|release]] of a [[film]] on multiple platforms\u2014most commonly [[Movie theater|theatrical]] and [[home video]]\u2014on the exact same day, or in very close proximity to each other. This is in contrast to the industry standard of having a window of exclusivity (usually 90 days) between the theatrical and home video releases.\n\nThe concept was used by several [[independent film]]s released in the 2000s. In the mid-2010s, the subscription [[streaming service]] [[Netflix]] began to perform simultaneous releases of its feature films, by means of a [[limited theatrical release]], accompanied by international availability on the Netflix service. As of ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' in 2018, Netflix began a practice of giving its films a three-week limited release before they become available on the service, which is still shorter.\n\nDue to their [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] nature, simultaneous releases have faced mixed reactions from the industry. Advocates have considered them a means of catering to [[consumer choice]] and improving the accessibility of film, and critics arguing that they dilute [[box office]] revenue by requiring cinemas to compete with premature availability of a film on home video, and are detrimental to the traditional movie-going experience. Most major cinema chains require films to have an exclusive theatrical window of a minimum length (which in some countries is also enforced by law), so films that pursue a simultaneous release or shorter window are typically screened at independent and art house cinemas only. \n\nSince 2014, two films by [[major film studio]]s, ''[[The Interview]]'' and ''[[Trolls World Tour]]'', have resorted to simultaneous releases via cinemas and digital rentals due to unforeseen circumstances inhibiting a wide theatrical release (terrorism threats against cinemas by a hacking group, and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] respectively).\n\n== Justification ==\nTypically, the release of a film is governed by staggered exclusivity \"windows\" of specific lengths, to prevent releases of a film at different outlets from having to compete directly with each other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2005/07/hollywood-s-death-spiral.html|title=Hollywood's death spiral.|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|date=2005-07-25|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11421406/hollywood-fights-screening-room-simultaneous-home-release-startup|title=Hollywood is still fighting same-day home release|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2016-04-13|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/03/6497-2/|title=Theater chain head discusses DVD release windows|last=Pollack|first=Peter|date=2006-03-31|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> Release windows are enforced primarily by major cinema chains, which usually requires distributors to agree to a 74-day window before a film is offered via [[electronic sell-through]].

This is in contrast to the industry standard of having a window of exclusivity (usually 90 days) between the theatrical and home video releases.\n\nThe concept was used by several [[independent film]]s released in the 2000s. In the mid-2010s, the subscription [[streaming service]] [[Netflix]] began to perform simultaneous releases of its feature films, by means of a [[limited theatrical release]], accompanied by international availability on the Netflix service. As of ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' in 2018, Netflix began a practice of giving its films a three-week limited release before they become available on the service, which is still shorter.\n\nDue to their [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] nature, simultaneous releases have faced mixed reactions from the industry. Advocates have considered them a means of catering to [[consumer choice]] and improving the accessibility of film, and critics arguing that they dilute [[box office]] revenue by requiring cinemas to compete with premature availability of a film on home video, and are detrimental to the traditional movie-going experience. Most major cinema chains require films to have an exclusive theatrical window of a minimum length (which in some countries is also enforced by law), so films that pursue a simultaneous release or shorter window are typically screened at independent and art house cinemas only. \n\nSince 2014, two films by [[major film studio]]s \u2014 ''[[The Interview]]'' and ''[[Trolls World Tour]]'' \u2014 have resorted to simultaneous releases via cinemas and digital rentals due to unforeseen circumstances inhibiting a wide theatrical release (terrorism threats against cinemas by a hacking group, and the [[COVID-19 pandemic]] respectively).\n\n== Justification ==\nTypically, the release of a film is governed by staggered exclusivity \"windows\" of specific lengths, to prevent releases of a film at different outlets from having to compete directly with each other.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://slate.com/culture/2005/07/hollywood-s-death-spiral.html|title=Hollywood's death spiral.|last=Epstein|first=Edward Jay|date=2005-07-25|website=Slate Magazine|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2016/4/13/11421406/hollywood-fights-screening-room-simultaneous-home-release-startup|title=Hollywood is still fighting same-day home release|last=Kastrenakes|first=Jacob|date=2016-04-13|website=The Verge|language=en|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref><ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/uncategorized/2006/03/6497-2/|title=Theater chain head discusses DVD release windows|last=Pollack|first=Peter|date=2006-03-31|website=Ars Technica|language=en-us|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> Release windows are enforced primarily by major cinema chains, which usually requires distributors to agree to a 74-day window before a film is offered via [[electronic sell-through]].

VII.</ref>\n\nHowever, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:\n{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798.

In particular, Oded Galor and Omer Moav argue that the forces of natural selection during the Malthusian epoch selected beneficial traits to the growth process and this growth enhancing change in the composition of human traits brought about the escape from the Malthusian trap, the demographic transition, and the take-off to modern growth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Galor |first=Oded |first2=Omer |last2=Moav |year=2002 |title=Natural Selection and The Origin of Economic Growth |journal=[[Quarterly Journal of Economics]] |volume=117 |issue=4 |pages=1133\u201391 |doi=10.1162/003355302320935007 |citeseerx=10.1.1.199.2634 }}</ref>\n\nSome researchers contend that a British breakout occurred due to technological improvements and structural change away from agricultural production, while coal, capital, and trade played a minor role.<ref>Tepper, Alexander and Karol J.

This in turn led to sustained \"downward mobility\": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.\n\n==Criticism==\nThere have been three main criticisms of Malthus\u2019s work. The first being Malthus only looking at the short run on an economy. While in the short run a population increase may cause for issues for the economy, in the long run these worries are put aside. When many of the new children grow up they will and develop new technology and will increase the GDP of their country. Economic growth tends to alleviate any issue in the countries infrastructure development. The second point was that Malthus did not take technology seriously. Moore\u2019s law states that the amount of chips on a transistor chip doubles every year. This is an example of technological growth. Economists have claimed that while population grows at an exponential rate, resources grow at a linear rate, but also technology is growing at en exponential rate as well. For higher technological innovation a higher population is required. The third point was that Malthus had an apocalyptic view on the world and its future. His views were doomed to begin with because of his negative outlook in the beginning.\n\n==Popular Culture==\nIn popular culture the movie Avengers: Endgame and the movie Avengers:Infinity War the main plot is based on the Malthusian trap. The main character Thanos has a goal of getting rid of half the universes population. His home world suffered from this trap when there were \u201ctoo many mouths to feed and not enough food.\u201d  So he went on a mission to get rid of half of the universe so that \u201cchildren will never have to go hungry ever again.\u201d\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=32em}}\n* [[Capitalism]]\n* [[Feudalism]]\n* [[Food technology]]\n* [[History of Economic Thought]]\n* [[Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Jevons's paradox]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Malthusian catastrophe]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n* [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)]]\n* [[Serfdom]]\n* [[Spontaneous order]]\n* [[Unified growth theory]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Malthus\n | first = Thomas Robert\n | author-link =Thomas Malthus\n | year = 1826\n | title =An Essay on the Principle of Population: A View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an Inquiry into Our Prospects Respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which It Occasions\n | edition = Sixth\n | location = London\n | publisher =John Murray }}\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Pomeranz\n | first = Kenneth\n | year = 2000\n | title =The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy\n | isbn =978-0-691-09010-8\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Rosen\n | first = William\n | year = 2010\n | title =The Most Powerful Idea in the World\n | location = New York\n | publisher =Random House\n | isbn =978-1-4000-6705-3\n}}\n\n[[Category:Human geography]]\n[[Category:Demographic economic problems]]\n[[Category:Macroeconomic theories]]\n[[Category:Theories of history]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Thomas Robert Malthus.jpg|thumb|Thomas Robert Malthus, after whom the Malthusian trap is named]]\nThe '''Malthusian trap''' or '''population trap''' is a condition whereby excess [[population]] would stop growing due to shortage of [[food supply]] leading to starvation.

VII.</ref>\n\nHowever, the propensity for population increase also leads to a natural cycle of abundance and shortages:\n{{quote|We will suppose the means of subsistence in any country just equal to the easy support of its inhabitants. The constant effort towards population...increases the number of people before the means of subsistence are increased. The food therefore which before supported seven millions, must now be divided among seven millions and a half or eight millions. The poor consequently must live much worse, and many of them be reduced to severe distress. The number of labourers also being above the proportion of the work in the market, the price of labour must tend toward a decrease; while the price of provisions would at the same time tend to rise. The labourer therefore must work harder to earn the same as he did before. During this season of distress, the discouragements to marriage, and the difficulty of rearing a family are so great, that population is at a stand. In the mean time the cheapness of labour, the plenty of labourers, and the necessity of an increased industry amongst them, encourage cultivators to employ more labour upon their land; to turn up fresh soil, and to manure and improve more completely what is already in tillage; till ultimately the means of subsistence become in the same proportion to the population as at the period from which we set out. The situation of the labourer being then again tolerably comfortable, the restraints to population are in some degree loosened; and the same retrograde and progressive movements with respect to happiness are repeated.|Thomas Malthus, 1798.

This in turn led to sustained \"downward mobility\": the descendants of the rich becoming more populous in British society and spreading [[middle-class values]] such as hard work and literacy.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Economics}}\n{{div col|colwidth=32em}}\n* [[Capitalism]]\n* [[Feudalism]]\n* [[Food technology]]\n* [[History of Economic Thought]]\n* [[Industrial Revolution]]\n* [[Jevons's paradox]]\n* [[Malthusianism]]\n* [[Malthusian catastrophe]]\n* [[Political demography]]\n* [[Productivity improving technologies (historical)]]\n* [[Serfdom]]\n* [[Spontaneous order]]\n* [[Unified growth theory]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Malthus\n | first = Thomas Robert\n | author-link =Thomas Malthus\n | year = 1826\n | title =An Essay on the Principle of Population: A View of its Past and Present Effects on Human Happiness; with an Inquiry into Our Prospects Respecting the Future Removal or Mitigation of the Evils which It Occasions\n | edition = Sixth\n | location = London\n | publisher =John Murray }}\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Pomeranz\n | first = Kenneth\n | year = 2000\n | title =The Great Divergence: China, Europe, and the Making of the Modern World Economy\n | isbn =978-0-691-09010-8\n}}\n*{{Cite book\n | last = Rosen\n | first = William\n | year = 2010\n | title =The Most Powerful Idea in the World\n | location = New York\n | publisher =Random House\n | isbn =978-1-4000-6705-3\n}}\n\n[[Category:Human geography]]\n[[Category:Demographic economic problems]]\n[[Category:Macroeconomic theories]]\n[[Category:Theories of history]]\n", "name_user": "SahirSAli", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added new criticism that were not mentioned and then added popular culture references as well", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malthusian_trap"}
