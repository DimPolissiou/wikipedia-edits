{"title_page": "Sexual slavery in Islam", "text_new": "'''Sexual slavery in Islam''' results from the permission in [[Islamic law]] for men to have sexual intercourse with the female slaves they own. Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears. She turns to her loved ones, milk pouring forth from her breast: \"Go in peace, my darlings, and may God accompany you.\"|[[Seeing Islam As Others Saw It: A Survey and Evaluation of Christian, Jewish and Zoroastrian Writings on Early Islam]], [[Robert G. Hoyland]]{{sfn|Hoyland|1997|p=262}}}}\n\n===Women of Hawazin===\nThe Banu [[Thaqif]] and Banu [[Hawazin]] tribes decided to go to war against Muhammad under the leadership of Malik ibn Awf.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} Malik had the unfortunate idea of bringing the women, children and livestock with his army.{{sfn|Saron|1986|p=266}} He believed that by bringing their women and children with the army, all his soldiers would fight more courageously to defend them.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=259}} When Muhammad was informed that the Hawazin had brought their women, children and livestock with them, he smiled and said \"Inshaa Allah, all these will become the booty of war for the Muslims.\"{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=260-261}}\n\nThe Muslim army defeated the Hawazin and captured their women and children. The pagan soldiers fled.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=262}} The war booty which the Muslims obtained was 24,000 camels, more than 40,000 goats, 160,000 dirhams worth of silver and 6,000 women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=263}} Muhammad waited ten days for the Hawazin to repent and reclaim their families and properties. However, none of them came. Finally, Muhammad distributed the war booty among the Muslim soldiers.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=264}} The Muslim soldiers initially hesitated to have sex with the married female captives, until a verse was revealed giving them permission to have sex with them:<ref>{{cite book|author=\u0623\u0628\u064a \u0627\u0644\u0641\u062f\u0627\u0621 \u0625\u0633\u0645\u0627\u0639\u064a\u0644 \u0628\u0646 \u0639\u0645\u0631/\u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u062f\u0645\u0634\u0642\u064a|title=THE EXEGESIS OF THE GRAND HOLY QUR'AN 1-4 Ibn Katheer VOL 2: \u062a\u0641\u0633\u064a\u0631 \u0627\u0628\u0646 \u0643\u062b\u064a\u0631 &#91;\u0627\u0646\u0643\u0644\u064a\u0632\u064a&#93; 1/4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MCxuDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA41|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Dar Al Kotob Al Ilmiyah \u062f\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0643\u062a\u0628 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0644\u0645\u064a\u0629|pages=40\u201341|id=GGKEY:47J6TBSZ6R8}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Imam Ahmad recorded that Abu Sa`id Al-Khudri said, \"We captured some women from the area of Awtas who were already married, and we disliked having sexual relations with them because they already had husbands. So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family. She chose her family. Likewise, the girls given to Talha, Uthman, [[Abdullah ibn Umar|Ibn Umar]] and Safwan bin Umayya were also returned to their families. However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} A purchaser could not separate the woman he bought from her child until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S. Chaudhry|title=Domestic Violence and the Islamic Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFT1AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA105|date=20 December 2013|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-166989-7|pages=105\u2013}}</ref> A prophetic hadith permitted corporal punishment and [[Ibn al-Jawzi]] stated that both slaves and wives should put up with mistreatment.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=24}} The slave owner was also encouraged to not use excessive violence. While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls.

If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies. In 1296 approximately 16,000 women committed jauhar to save themselves from [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khalj]]<nowiki/>i's army.{{sfn|Roy|2012|p=182}} Rajput women would commit it when they saw that defeat and enslavement was imminent for their people.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=143}} In 1533 in [[Chittorgarh]] nearly 13,000 women and children killed themselves instead of being taken captive by [[Bahadur Shah]]'s army.{{sfn|Kitts|2018|p=144}} For them sexual intercourse was the worst form of humiliation.

[[Jahangir]] explicitly ordered the destruction of the domain of the rebellious zamindar of [[Jaitpur State|Jaitpur]] and the capture of his women. Thus, his daughters and wives were captured and brought to the harem.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} Aurangzeb would enslave rebellious peasants.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=91}} [[Manucci]] records that, during Mughal rule, when faujdars would enter rebellious villages they would take the most attractive girls and present them to the king.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women. In the eleventh century Christians began an aggressive policy towards Muslims in Andalus. Christian military leaders captured Muslim women and included eight year old Muslim [[Virginity|virgins]] as part of their war booty.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=171}} When [[Granada]] passed from Muslim rule to Christian rule, thousands of Moorish women were enslaved and trafficked to Europe.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} Muslim families tried to ransom their daughters, mothers and wives who had been captured and enslaved.{{sfn|Salzmann|2013|p=397}} Muslim women were kept as concubines by Christian men.<ref>{{cite book|author=Margaret C.

Many women would convert to their master's religion.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} In one case an Algerian woman, Fatima, was captured and enslaved. She converted to Christianity and refused the ransom which the [[Turkish people|Turks]] had sent for her release. Other enslaved Muslim women had more \"harrowing\" experiences in being converted to [[Christianity]].{{sfn|Bekkaoui|2010|p=10}}\n\nIn India, the Hindu  elites and rulers would take revenge by taking Muslim women into their own harems.{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}} [[Rana Kumbha]] captured Muslim women. Under [[Medini Rai]] in [[Malwa]], the Rajputs took Muslim and [[Syed|Sayyid]] women as slave girls.{{sfn|Sharma|2011|p=101}} According to [[Niccolao Manucci|Manucci]], the Marathas and [[Sikhs]] would also capture Muslim women because 'the Mahomedans had interfered with Hindu women.'{{sfn|Singh|2016|p=72}}\n\n===Sexual enslavement of Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIslamic jurists had completely forbidden the enslavement of Muslims. However, Muslims have still at times enslaved Muslims from other ethnic groups.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=53}} The [[Umayyad Caliphate|Umayyad]] caliph [[Muhammad II of C\u00f3rdoba]] gave orders that the Berber houses in [[C\u00f3rdoba, Spain|Cordoba]] be looted and that Berber women be captured and sold in Dar-al Banat.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=166}} In another case the Andalusian ruler of [[M\u00e1laga|Malaga]], Ibn Hassun, unsuccessfully attempted to kill his female relatives before the Berber [[Almohad Caliphate|Almohads]] could capture them. He committed suicide but his daughters survived. These girls were then sold and some of them were taken as concubines by Almohad military commanders.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=168}}\n\nIn India attitudes towards women ignored their religious background if they belonged to enemies or rebels. [[Ferishta]] narrates that Baban captured female supporters of the rebellious noble [[Tughral Tughan Khan|Tughral]]. The atrocities of [[Alauddin Khalji|Alauddin Khilji]] on women have been documented in [[Tabaqat-i-Akbari]] by [[Nizamuddin Ahmad]].  [[Khusrau Khan]] humiliated [[Qutbuddin Mubarak Shah|Sultan Qutb ud din Mubarak]] by marrying his widow and allowing Hindus to take away his other female relatives. [[Abu'l-Fazl ibn Mubarak|Abu Fazl]] records atrocities by [[Kamran Mirza|Kamran]] on the female relatives of [[Humayun]]'s supporters. [[Sher Shah Suri|Sher Shah]] was reported to have sold the wives of rebellious zamindars.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=64}}\n\n[[Kurds]] in the Ottoman-Persian frontier would enslave both Shias and Yazidis. The Ottoman jurist [[Ebussuud Efendi|Ebu Su'ud]] upheld the permissibility of wars against the Shia but he forbade the taking of Shias as captives. In particular, he also declared that sexual intercourse with Shia female captives was unlawful. However, he endorsed enslavement of Shias in a later fatwa.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=43}} In 1786-7 an Ottoman general enslaved the wives and children of [[Mamluk]] emirs. In the region of modern day [[Chad]], Muslim women and children from [[Sultanate of Bagirmi|Bagirmi]] were enslaved by the ruler of Wadai around 1800.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=44}} \n\n==Abolition==\nMarriage was not the only legal way to have sex in Muslim societies prior to the end of slavery in the 19th and 20th centuries.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=50}} Colonial governments and independent Muslim states restricted slave raids and the slave trade in response to pressure from Western liberals and nascent Muslim abolitionist movements. Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n===Attitude of traditional ulama to abolition===\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} After 1882 the Egyptian ulama refused to prohibit slavery on the grounds that the Prophet had never forbidden it. In 1899 a scholar from  [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad al-Bulayqi defended concubinage and refuted modernist arguments.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=139}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi in Mombasa ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that in coastal Arab areas masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still enslaved under religious law even if they have been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}} [[Armenians]] and other Christian rebels who had been enslaved in [[World War I]] were considered to be \"people of the book\" who had violated their contract. Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} After 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}}\n\nA lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her.

One of its atrocities has been to enslave Shia [[Hazaras|Hazara]] women and use them for concubinage.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} The Taliban either took beautiful young women from other ethnic groups as concubines or forcibly married them.{{sfn|Claus|2003|p=7}} In 1998 eyewitnesses in [[Mazar-i-Sharif|Mazar e Sharif]] reported the abduction of hundreds of Shia girls who were used by Taliban fighters as concubines.{{sfn|Nojumi|2016|p=168}} The number of Hazara women taken as concubines by the Taliban was 400.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ahmed Rashid|title=Taliban|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dld2wJ2Z__4C&pg=PA75|year=2010|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-16484-8|pages=75\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===North Africa===\nThe evidence strongly demonstrates that the government of Sudan had revived slavery and made it as important as it was in the previous century.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=29}} The [[Sudanese army]] had a central role in the revival of slavery.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=32}} The slavery in Sudan was a result of the conflict between [[North Sudan]]'s Arab Muslims and [[South Sudan]]'s black Christians.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} Christian prisoners of war in the [[Sudanese Civil War (1983-2005)|Sudanese civil war]] were often enslaved. The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families. Slave raids continued every year after 1985.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=26}} Dinka girls kept in Arab households were used as sex-slaves.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=35}} Some of them were sold to Arab men in [[Libya]], It has been alleged that slave markets were set up in Sudan. Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran. Commentary on Chapter 4. Verse 25. Note 32|publisher=|year=1982|isbn=1567441386|location=|pages=|quote=This passage lays down in an unequivocal manner that sexual relations with female slaves are permitted only on the basis of marriage, and that in this respect there is no difference between them and free women; consequently, concubinage is ruled out.}}</ref> [[Asifa Quraishi]] personally concludes that she is \"not convinced that sex with one's slave is approved by the Quran in the first place\", claiming that reading the respective Quranic section has led her to \"different conclusions than that held by the majority of classical muslim jurists.\"{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nAsifa Quraishi-Landes also observes that most Muslims believe that sex is only permissible within marriage and they ignore the permission for keeping concubines in Islamic jurisprudence.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} Furthermore, the majority of modern Muslims are not aware that Islamic jurists had made an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} and many modern Muslims would be offended by the idea that a [[husband]] owns his wife's private parts under Islamic law.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=182}} A modern scholar on Islamic legal history made an assertion that the Quran does not allow non-consensual sex between masters and female slaves. However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}}\n\nIn response to the enslavement of [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] women by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] the [[Council on American\u2013Islamic Relations|Council on American-Islamic Relations]] and Fiqh Council of North America claimed that no scholar disputes the abolition of slavery was one of the aims of Islam. However, [[Kecia Ali]] finds this claim dishonest. While there was definitely  an \u201cemancipatory ethic\u201d (encouragement for freeing slaves) in Islamic jurisprudence, slavery was never actually abolished.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=6}} The translator of [[Ibn Kathir]]'s treatise on slaves, Umar ibn Sulayman Hafyan, felt obliged to explain why he published a slave treatise when [[slavery]] no longer exists. He states that just because slavery no longer exists does not mean that the laws about slavery have been abrogated. Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.  His comments were a reflection of the predicament modern Muslims find themselves in.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=304}} \n\n[[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam. However, he states that due to the fact that most Muslim countries have signed international treaties which prohibit enslavement, the Muslim countries should not enslave prisoners of war as long as other nations also refrain from enslavement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Usmani |first1=Muftii Taqi |title=Slavery in Islam |url=https://www.deoband.org/2013/01/hadith/hadith-commentary/slavery-in-islam/ |website=Deoband.org}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Islamic views on slavery]]\n* [[Polygamy in Islam]]\n* [[Rape in Islamic law]]\n* [[What your right hands possess]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n== Bibliography ==\n{{refbegin|30em}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Pernilla |first1=Myrne |title=Slaves for Pleasure in Arabic Sex and Slave Purchase Manuals from the Tenth to the Twelfth Centuries |journal=Journal of Global Slavery |date=2019 |volume=4|pages=196\u2013225|DOI=10.1163/2405836X-00402004| ref = {{sfnRef|Pernilla|2019}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Asifa Quraishi-Landes|title=Feminism, Law, and Religion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QfkFDAAAQBAJ|date=15 April 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-13579-1|chapter=A Meditation on Mahr, Modernity, and Muslim Marriage Contract Law| ref = {{sfnRef|Quraishi-Landes|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Kecia Ali|title=Sexual Ethics and Islam: Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith and Jurisprudence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=my4XCwAAQBAJ|date=21 December 2015|publisher=Oneworld Publications|isbn=978-1-78074-853-5| ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2015}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Ali |first1=Kecia |title=Sexual Ethics and Islam : Feminist Reflections on Qur'an, Hadith, and Jurisprudence |date=2016 |publisher=Oneworld Publications |ref = {{sfnRef|Ali|2016}}}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Saad |first1=Salma |title=The legal and social status of women in the Hadith literature |date=1990 |page=242|url=http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/508/1/uk_bl_ethos_443314.pdf| ref = {{sfnRef|Saad|1990}}}}\n*{{cite book|author=Y.

Legal and literary documents show that those slaves used for sexual service were differentiated at slave markets from those who were intended mainly for domestic services. These slave girls were called \"slaves for pleasure\" (mu\u1e6d\u02bfa, ladhdha) or \u201cslave-girls for sexual intercourse\u201d (jaw\u0101r\u012b al-wa\u1e6d). Many female slaves became concubines to their owners and bore their children. Others were just used for sex before being transferred. The allowance for men to use contraception with female slaves assisted in thwarting unwanted pregnancies.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=196\u2013197}} \n\nEarly sources indicate that [[Sexual slavery|sexual slavery]] of women was viewed as both a male privilege and a privilege for the victor over the defeated. Islamic legal texts state that sexual pleasure was a male privilege over women. Men were permitted to have as many concubines as they could afford. Some men purchased female slaves, whereas [[Muslims|Muslim]] soldiers in the [[Early Muslim conquests|early Islamic conquests]] were given female captives as a reward for military participation. As the slaves for pleasure were typically more expensive, they were a privilege for elite men.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=203}}\n==Islamic legal sanction==\nIn Islam, it is the male's ownership of a woman's [[Vagina|sexual organs]] which makes sex licit. [[Faq\u012bh|Islamic jurists]] also describe marriage as a kind of sale where the wife's private parts are purchased. However, there are some differences between the rights of a [[wife]] and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}} The term ''suriyya'' (concubine) was used for female slaves with whom masters enjoyed sexual relations. It was not a secure status as the [[Concubinage|concubine]] could be traded as long as the master had not impregnated her.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=51}}\n\nIslamic law and Sunni ulama recognise two categories of concubines:{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}}\n*War Captives: \n**These are originally free non-Muslims who are captured in battle.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Badawi|2019|p=17}} The entire population of a conquered territory can be enslaved, thus providing women who are otherwise rare on the battlefield. This paves the path for concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}} The Muslim military commander is allowed to choose between unconditionally releasing, ransoming or enslaving war captives.{{sfn|Mufti|2019|p=5}} If a person converted to Islam after being enslaved, their emancipation would be considered a pious act but not obligatory.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Islamic law does not allow enslavement of free-born Muslims.{{sfn|Gleave|2015|p=142}}\n**Islamic jurists permitted slave raiding and kidnapping of non-Muslims from Dar al Harb.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} South Asian scholars ruled that jihad was not needed to seize non-muslims nor was it necessary to invite them to Islam before seizing them. Raiders were free to take and enslave any non-muslim.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=28}} However, Shafi'i jurists held that non-muslims who had formal pacts with Muslims were to be protected from enslavement.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27-28}} \n*Slave-girls by descent: \n**These are born to slave mothers.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}}{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=22}} Owners who would marry off their female slaves to someone else, would also be the masters of any children born from that marriage.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=57}} Thus, Islamic law made slave-breeding possible.{{sfn|Erdem|1996|p=52}}\n\nThe concubines were owned by their masters. The owners could obtain the slave-girls through purchase, capture or receive them as a gift.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} Islam permits men to have sexual intercourse with them and there is no limit on the number of concubines they could keep, unlike in [[Polygyny in Islam|polygamy]] where there is a limit of four wives.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=243}} The master could also sell her or gift her to someone else. The female slave was essentially a chattel. An owner's slave could also be inherited by an heir.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245}} While she was under her master's control the slave girl could not have sex with anyone else.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}}\n\n==The issue of consent==\nThe classical Islamic jurists make an analogy between the marriage contract and sale of concubines. They state that the factor of male ownership in both is what makes sex lawful with both a wife and female slave.{{sfn|Quraishi-Landes|2016|p=178}}\n\nThe [[Hanafi]] scholars allow the husband to have sex with his wife against her will, as long as he has paid her dowry.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=83}} The [[Shafi\u2018i|Shafi'i]], [[Maliki]] and [[Hanbali]] schools do not forbid a husband from forcing his wife to have sex nor do they expressly say anything in favour of it. For all Sunni law schools the concept of marital rape is an oxymoron.{{sfn|Ali|2010|p=120}} According to the Islamic jurists, rape is either a kind of zina or a property crime, which by definition cannot be committed by a husband or master, since he is the owner of his wife and slave's sexual capacity.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149-150}}\n\nThere is no requirement in any of the Sunni law schools for the master to have his female slave's consent before he has sex with her.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}} A slave, by legal definition, does not have the capacity to refuse consent.{{sfn|Seedat|2016|p=34}} The Hanafis explicitly state that a man may force the woman to sexually satisfy him.{{sfn|Nancy|2009|quote=The followers of Imam Abu Hanifah said: \"The right of the sexual pleasure belongs to the man, not the woman, by that it is meant that the man has the right to force the woman to gratify himself sexually.}} It is mentioned in Kitab al-Maghazi that [[Uthman|Uthman ibn Affan]] had sexual intercourse with a war captive, Zaynab bint Hayyan, and that she \"detested\" him.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\n[[Muhammad]] and his Companions took for granted the allowance of having sex with female war captives. The consent of the women was irrelevant. Some modern Muslim writers seek to defend Islam by claiming that Islam permits men to have sex with female captives as a way of integrating them into society.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=60}} But in the case of the women from the [[Banu Mustaliq]] tribe who were captured by the [[Companions of the Prophet|Companions]], their captors wanted to practice [[coitus interruptus]] during sex with them because if these women became pregnant their captors would not be able to return them in exchange for ransom. According to Kecia Ali, modern Muslim scholarship is silent on the question  of what it means to accept that Muhammad implicitly permitted Muslim soldiers to rape the female captives.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=61}}\n\nAll four law schools also have a consensus that the master can marry off his female slave to someone else without her consent.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A master can also practice coitus interruptus during sex with his female slave without her permission.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=149}} A man having sex with someone else's female slave constitutes [[zina]].{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}} According to [[Imam Shafi'i]] if someone other than the master coerces a slave-girl to have sex, the rapist will be required to pay compensation to her master.{{sfn|Ali|2011|p=76}} If a man  marries off his own female slave and has sex with her even though he is then no longer allowed to have sexual intercourse with her, that sex is still considered a lesser offence than zina and the jurists say he must not be punished. It is noteworthy that while formulating this ruling, it is the slave woman's marriage and not her consent which is an issue.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=150}}\n\n==Sexual enslavement, the concept of honour and humiliation==\nEnslavement was intended both as a debt and form of [[humiliation]]. The sexual relationship between a concubine and her master was viewed as a debt of humiliation upon the woman until she gave birth to her master's child and the master's later death.{{sfn|Willis|2014}} Becoming a slave meant losing one's [[honour]] and one's rights.{{sfn|McMahon|2013|p=18}} The ulama asserted that slavery was a divine punishment for not being a Muslim. In the words of az-Aziz b.Ahmad al-Bukhari \"servitude is a vestige of obstinacy in refusing to believe in one God\". [[Al-Sharif al-Jurjani]] stated that slavery in Islamic law was a \"penalty for unbelief.\" An Algerian scholar who lived in Morocco, [[Ahmad al-Wansharisi]], described the purpose of slavery as a \"humiliation\" for previous or continuing disbelief.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=27}}\n\n==Umm Walad (slave mother)==\n''Umm walad'' (mother of child) is a title given to a woman who gave birth to her master's child.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=242}} If a female slave gave birth to her master's child she still remained a slave. However, the master would no longer be allowed to sell her. She would also become free once he died. The Sunni law schools disagree on the concubine's entitlement to this status. Many Maliki jurists ruled that the concubine becomes entitled to the status of ''umm walad'' even if her master does not acknowledge that the child is his. However, Hanafi jurists state that the ''umm walad'' status is contingent on the master acknowledging paternity of the child. If he does not accept that he is the father of the child then both the mother and child remain slaves.{{sfn|Brockopp|2000|p=195\u2013196}}\n\n==Forced conversion for concubinage==\nMost traditional scholars require the conversion of a [[Paganism|pagan]] slave-girl before sex, even through force if necessary.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176\u2013177}} The majority of jurists do not allow sexual intercourse with Zoroastrian or pagan female captives. They require a conversion of these women before sex can take place. [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Ibn Hanbal]] allowed sexual intercourse with pagan and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] female captives if they are forced to become Musim. Many traditions state that the female captives should be forced to accept Islam if they do not convert willingly. [[Hasan al-Basri]] narrates that Muslims would achieve this objective through various methods. They would order the Zoroastrian slave-girl to face the [[qibla]]h, utter the [[shahada]] and perform [[Wudu|wudhu]]. Her captor would then have sex with her after one menstrual cycle. However, others add the condition that the slave-girl must be taught to pray and purify herself before the master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=107}}\n\nThe scholars significantly lower the threshold of conversion for the girls so that the master may be able to have sex with her as soon as possible. Only a few early scholars permitted sex with pagan and Zoroastrian slaves girls without conversion.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=108}} Al-Mujahid and Safiid bin al-Musayyab say the master can still have sex with his Zoroastrian or pagan female slave even if she refuses to convert.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=176-177}}\n\n[[Al-Shafi\u2018i|Imam Shafi'i]] claims that the Companions of Muhammad did not have sexual intercourse with Arab captives until they converted to Islam.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=177}} But [[Ibn Qayyim al-Jawziyya|Ibn Qayyim]] argues that the Companions of the Prophet had sexual intercourse with Arab captives, such as the women of the Banu Mustaliq tribe, without making the sex conditional on the conversion of the women. He also asserted that no tradition required the conversion of a slave-girl before her master can have sex with her.{{sfn|Friedmann|2003|p=178}}\n\n==Sexual slavery in Pre-Islamic Arabia and Early Islam==\nThe pre-Islamic Arabs used to practice [[female infanticide]]. They would bury their daughters alive upon birth. One of the motivations for fathers burying their daughters alive was the fear that when they grew up an enemy tribe could take them captive and dishonour them.{{sfn|Giladi|1990|p=192}}{{sfn|Munir|2005|p=192}} A study of the Arab genealogical text Nasab Quraysh records the maternity of 3,000 [[Quraysh|Quraishi]] tribesmen, most of whom lived in between 500 and 750 CE.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} The data shows that there was a massive increase in the number of children born to concubines with the emergence of Islam.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=11}} An analysis of the information found that no children were born from concubines before the generation of Muhammad's grandfather.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=16}} There were a few cases of children being born from concubines before Muhammad but they were only in his father's and grandfather's generation. The analysis of the data thus showed that concubinage was not common before the time of Muhammad, but increased for men of his generation as a result of military conquests.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=17}} \n\nDue to these conquests, a large number of female slaves were available to the conquerors. Although there were more births, the attitude towards children born from slaves still remained negative.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=12}}  Some early Arab Muslims discriminated against those people who were born fron non-Arab female slaves. However, there is no indication that these attitudes were ever acted upon.{{sfn|Majied|2017|p=20-21}} One of the earliest surviving Christian texts from the Islamic period in Syria, dated by scholars to around 640 CE, describes the rise of Islam in this way: \n\n{{quote|They take the wife away from her husband and slay him like a sheep. They throw the babe from her mother and drive her into slavery; the child calls out from the ground and the mother hears, yet what is she to do?...They separate the children from the mother like the soul from within the body, and she watches as they divide her loved ones from off her lap, two of them go to two masters, herself to another[...] Her children cry out in lament, their eyes hot with tears.

So, we asked the Prophet about this matter, and this Ayah (verse) was revealed, Also (forbidden are) women already married, except those whom your right hands possess). Consequently, we had sexual relations with these women.\"</blockquote>\n\nMuhammad gave a girl called Zaynab bint Hayyan to Uthman ibn Affan. Uthman had sexual intercourse with her and she detested him. A woman was given to [['Abd al-Rahman ibn 'Awf|Abdurrahman ibn Awf]]. He resisted having sexual intercourse with her until her menses were over and then he had sex with her by virtue of her being his property. Jubayr bin Mu'tim also received a slave girl, who was not impregnated. [[Talhah|Talha ibn Ubaydullah]] had sexual intercourse with the female captive given to him. [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Abu Ubaydah ibn Jarrah]] impregnated the slave girl he was given.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=462}}\n\nA delegation from the Hawazin tribe came to Muhammad and converted to Islam. Once they had given allegiance to Muhammad they asked about their captured families and property. They said \"Those who you have brought as captives are our mothers, sisters and aunts and they alone bring disgrace to peoples. O Prophet, we ask for your kindness and gerosity. Free our women.\" Muhammad gave them a choice between reclaiming their property or their women and children.{{sfn|Mubarakpuri|1998|p=267}} The Hawazin tribesmen responded that if they had to choose between reclaiming their property or their honour, they would choose their honour (their womenfolk).{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}}\n\nMuhammad returned their women and children to them.{{sfn|Rashid|2015|p=68}} The girl who had been given to Abdurrahman ibn Awf was given a choice to stay with him or return to her family.

However, the girl who had been given to [[Sa'd ibn Abi Waqqas|Saad ibn Abi Waqas]] chose to stay with him. Uyanya had taken an old woman. Her son approached him to ransom her for 100 camels. The old woman asked her son why would he pay a 100 camels when Uyanya would leave her anyway without taking ransom. This angered Uyanya.{{sfn|Faizer|2013|p=466}}\n\n==Overview of slave-concubines' experiences==\nBecoming a concubine for her master could translate to gaining security and standing and other material benefits. If she bore her master a child and if he accepted paternity she could obtain the position of an ''umm walad''. If she bacame an umm walad her daily life would probably resemble that of a free wife, but with a lower position. There are many instances of slave concubines in Muslim history who rose to positions of great influence. However, this position did not lighten the suffering that the slaves experienced in their lives. Many of them had been forcibly taken from their homes and permanently separated from their families. They were displayed at slave markets and humiliated and subjected to forced labour, forced marriages and sex.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} A purchaser could not separate the woman he bought from her child until the stipulated age, which according to [[Ibn Abi Zayd al-Qayrawani|Ibn Abi Zayd]] was when the child became six years old.{{sfn|Bellagamba|2016|p=24}}\n\nMany slaves went through a period of distress, when they were first enslaved, which was typically a violent occasion. Between the 800s and 1200s the four main ways to enslave a person were kidnapping, slave raids, piracy, and poverty. Islamic law only gave female slaves protection from sexual exploitation by anyone who was not their owner. The owner was obliged by Islamic law to provide his female slaves with food, clothing, and shelter.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} The disciplinary hitting of the slave was considered to be for the master's own good.<ref>{{cite book|author=Ayesha S.

While some idealise the lives of elite female slaves, many in practice suffered from abuse by both their owners and others.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because bearing her master's child could lead to freedom for a slave-girl, some female slaves had a motive to have sex with their owners. This angered the master's wives who would often punish such slaves.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} The most regular opposition to concubinage came from free wives. Early moral stories depicted wives as victims of concubinage.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=81}}\n\nThe female slaves were traded as chattel.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=222\u2013223}} Because female slaves were traded among men and many of them had been owned by up to thirty men consecutively, they had a great deal of knowledge about sexual intercourse and were able to tutor elite adolescent males about sexual techniques.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=82}} Slave girls were seen as sexual commodities and were not allowed to cover themselves.{{sfn|Kamrava|2011|p=193}} Before being bought many women's bodies were examined. The Hanafis allowed potential male buyers to uncover and touch a female slave's arms, breasts and legs.{{sfn|Pernilla|2019|p=218}} [[Umar]] prohibited slave girls from resembling free women and forbade them from covering their hair.{{sfn|El Fadl|2014|p=198}} Slave women did not veil and like prostitutes were exempt from a lot of the gender restrictions upon upper-class women. If a slave fornicated she also received less punishment than a respectable woman.{{sfn|Afary|2009|p=81}}\n\nThe most fortunate female captives were women like [[Safiyya bint Huyayy|Safiyya]] and [[Juwayriyya bint al-Harith|Juwayriah]] who were freed from slavery and married Muhammad. The lives of female captives depended on whether her tribe could ransom her or if her captor chose to marry her. If neither of the two happened such women suffered because their captors owned their bodies and lives. If they were unattractive the captors would keep them as servants and if they were beautiful the captors were allowed to keep them as their concubines. The captors were also allowed to sell her. Due to this some female captives committed suicide.{{sfn|Saad|1990|p=245-246}} There is an account of a woman called Sakhra, who was a female captive from the [[Banu Amir]] tribe. She committed suicide by throwing herself to the ground from a camel.{{sfn|Jones|1981|p=16}}\n\n==Socio-economic variations in historical concubinage==\nWhile Muslim cultures acknowledged concubinage, as well as a polygamy, as a man's legal right, in reality these were usually practiced only by the royalty and elite sections of society.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203}} The most highly desired slave-concubines in the Muslim world were not African women, but white girls, typically of Circassian or Georgian origin. However, they were very expensive.{{sfn|Miers|1975|p=56}} The large-scale availability of women for sexual slavery had a strong influence on Muslim thought, even though the \"[[harem]]\" culture of the elite was not mirrored by most of the Muslim population.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=52}} \n===Abbasid Caliphate===\nThe royals and nobles during the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] kept large numbers of concubines. The Caliph [[Harun al-Rashid]] possessed hundreds of concubines. The Caliph [[al-Mutawakkil]] was reported to own 4,000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Andalusia===\nIn Muslim society in general, [[monogamy]] was common because keeping multiple wives and concubines was not affordable for many households.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=155}} The practice of keeping concubines was common in the Muslim upper class. Muslim rulers preferred having children with concubines because it helped them avoid the social and political complexities arising from marriage and kept their lineages separate from the other lineages in society.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} One Umayyad ruler, [[Abd al-Rahman III]], was known to have possessed more than 6000 concubines.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\n===Ottoman Empire===\nThe [[Ottoman Sultans|Ottoman rulers]] would keep hundreds, even thousands, of concubines. Female war captives were often turned into concubines for the Ottoman rulers. Ambitious slave families associated with the palace would also frequently offer their daughters up as concubines.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} Slave traders would abduct and sell [[Circassians|Circassian]] girls.{{sfn|Yelbasi|2019|p=14}} Circassian and [[Georgians|Georgian]] women were systematically trafficked to eastern harems. This practice lasted into the 1890s.{{sfn|Rodriguez|2011|p=203-204}} [[Fynes Moryson]] noted that some Muslim men would keep their wives in various cities while others would keep them in a single house and would keep adding as many women as their lusts permitted. He wrote that \"They buy free women to be their wives, or they buy \"conquered women\" at a lesser price to be their concubines.\"{{sfn|Witte|2015|p=283}} Ottoman society had provided avenues for men who wished to have extramarital sex. They could either marry more wives while wealthy men could possess slaves and use them for sex.{{sfn|Kia|2011|p=206}}\n\nSince the late 1300s Ottoman sultans would only permit heirs born from concubines to inherit their throne. Each concubine was only permitted to have one son. Once a concubine would bear a son she would spend the rest of her life plotting in favour of her son. If her son was to successfully become the next Sultan, she would become an unquestionable ruler. After the 1450s the Sultans stopped marrying altogether. Because of this there was great surprise when Sultan Sulayman fell in love with his concubine and married her. An Ottoman Sultan would have sexual relationships with only some women from his large collection of slave girls. This meant that a lot of the concubines were not given a family life if they were not desired by the Sultan. This effectively meant these women would have to spend the rest of their lives in virtual imprisonment. Some of these women would break the sharia by having [[Lesbian|homosexual]] relations.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=89}}\n\nResearch into Ottoman records show that polygamy was absent or rare in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.{{sfn|Irwin|2010|p=531}} Concubinage and polygamy were quite uncommon outside the elite.

However, some kept Abyssinian slaves who were less costly than maintaining a wife. While white slave-girls would be in the keep of wealthy Turks, the concubines kept by upper and middle class Egyptians were usually Abyssinians.{{sfn|Lewis|1992|p=74}}\n\n===Indian subcontinent===\nOvington, a voyager who wrote about his journey to [[Surat]], stated that Muslim men had an \"extraordinary liberty for women\" and kept as many concubines as they could afford.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=59}} [[Akbar]] had a harem of at least 5000 women and [[Aurangzeb]]'s harem was even larger.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=354}} The nobles in India could possess as many concubines as they wanted.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=357}} Ismail Quli Khan, a Mughal noble, possessed 1200 girls. Another nobleman, Said, had many wives and concubines from whom he fathered 60 sons in just four years.{{sfn|Bano|1999|p=361}} [[Francisco Pelsaert|Francisco Pelseart]] describes that noblemen would visit a different wife each night, who would welcome him along with the slave girls. If he felt attracted to any slave-girl he would call her to him for his enjoyment while the wife would not dare to show her anger. The wife would punish the slave-girl later.{{sfn|Lal|2005|p=40}}\n\nLower class Muslims were generally monogamous. Since they hardly had any rivals, women of the lower and middle class sections of society fared better than upper-class women who had to contend with their husbands' other wives, slave-girls and concubines.{{sfn|Sharma|2016|p=61}} Shireen Moosvi has discovered Muslim marriage contracts from Surat, dating back to the 1650s. One stipulation in these [[Nikah|marriage contracts]] was that the husband was not to marry a second wife. Another stipulation was that the husband would not take a slave girl. These stipulations were common among middle-class Muslims in Surat. If the husband took a second wife the first wife would gain an automatic right of divorce, thus indicating the preference for monogamy among the merchants of Surat. If the husband took a slave-girl the wife could sell, free or give away that slave-girl, thereby separating the female slave from her husband.{{sfn|Faroqhi|2019|p=244}}\n\nThere is no evidence that concubinage was practiced in [[Kashmir]] where, unlike the rest of the medieval Muslim world, slavery was abhorred and not widespread.

The descendants of these captives became known as \"Mrattas\" and their women were traditionally used as concubines by the Bugtis. They became equal citizens of [[Pakistan]] in 1947.{{sfn|Lieven|2012|p=362}}\n\n==History of sexual enslavement==\n===Sexual enslavement of non-Muslim women by Muslim men===\nIn [[Al-Andalus|Andalus]] the concubines of the Muslim elite were usually non-Muslim women from the Christian areas of the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian peninsula]]. Many of these had been captured in raids or wars and were then gifted to the elite Muslim soldiers as war booty or were sold as slaves in Muslim markets.{{sfn|Bennison|2016|p=156}} [[Berbers|Berber]] pirates trafficked [[French people|French]], [[Italians|Italian]], [[Spaniards|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] women to North Africa. Christian females were enslaved more than any other religious demographic.{{sfn|Capern|2019|p=22}} It is difficult to track down the experienced of European female slaves because they would have accounted for 5 percent of the slaves trafficked to North Africa and even fewer women were freed from slavery than men between the 16th and 19th centuries. During those centuries, at least 50,000 to 75,000 [[Europeans|European]] girls were forcibly taken and most of them never returned home.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=57}} One male [[English people|English]] slave narrated an account of a young English girl who was given as concubine to the Moroccan king, [[Ismail Ibn Sharif|Mulley Ismail]]. She tried to resist his sexual advances. He then ordered his black slaves to whip and torture her until she gave in.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=58}}\n\nEnslaved European men also narrated accounts of women who \"apostasised.\" The life stories of these women were similar to [[Hurrem Sultan|Roxelana]], who rose from being a Christian slave-girl into the chief advisor of her husband, [[Suleiman the Magnificent|Sultan Suleyman]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. There are several accounts of  such women of humble birth who associated with powerful Muslim men. While the associations were initially forced, the captivity gave women a taste for access to power. Diplomats wrote with disappointment about apostate women who wielded political influence over their masters-turned-husbands. Christian male slaves also recorded the presence of authoritative convert women in Muslim families. [[Christians|Christian]] women who converted to Islam and then became politically assertive and tyrannical were regarded by Europeans as traitors to the faith.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=59}} Enslaved Christian women lost all hope of returning home through ransom once they entered a Muslim household. The women were forced to enter a life of sexual subjugation to their new husbands. There is also evidence that many \"privileged\" female captives wanted to escape if they were given the chance. There is an account of an [[Irish people|Irish]] mother who attacked her [[Algerians|Algerian]] male captors when she learnt that her enslavement meant that she was going to be separated from her children forever. She was later subdued.{{sfn|Foster|2009|p=60}}\n\nThe [[Delhi Sultanate|Muslim Sultanates]] in India before the Mughal Empire captured large numbers of non-Muslims from the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]]. The Muslim masters would impregnate their non-Muslim slaves and the children they fathered would be raised as Muslims. Non-Muslim girls were socially ostracised by their own communities for the sexual relationships Muslim soldiers and nobles would have with them, therefore, many of them preferred to convert to Islam.{{sfn|Hardy|1972|p=9}} When Muslims would surround [[Rajput]] citadels, the Rajput women would commit [[jauhar]] (collective suicide) to save themselves from being dishonoured by their enemies.

The capture and enslavement of non-muslim women is described in a matter-of-fact way in the Muslim sources. However, the same practice was criticised when Christians captured Muslim women.

Eliminating slavery was an even more difficult task. Many Muslim governments refused to sign the international treaties against slavery which the [[League of Nations]] was co-ordinating since 1926. This refusal was also an issue at the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] and at the [[Supplementary Convention on the Abolition of Slavery|1956 Anti-Slavery Convention]].{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=11}} It was mostly because of the pressure from European colonial powers and economic changes that slavery was abolished. White the institution was eventually abolished, there was no internally well-developed Islamic narrative against slave-ownership.{{sfn|Ali|2016|p=54}}\n===Attitude of traditional ulama to abolition===\nA group of ulama led by Waji al-Din Saharanpuri gave a fatwa in the 1830s that it was lawful to enslave men and women \"who sought refuge\" after battle. Sayyed Imdad Ali Akbarabadi led ulama in publishing a lot of material in defence of traditional kinds of slavery. Sayyid Muhammad Askari condemned the idea of abolishing slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}}  In the 19th century some ulama in Cairo refused to allow slave girls, who had been freed under secular law, to marry unless they had obtained permission from their owner.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=138}} After 1882 the Egyptian ulama refused to prohibit slavery on the grounds that the Prophet had never forbidden it. In 1899 a scholar from  [[Al-Azhar University|Al-Azhar]], Shaykh Muhammad Ahmad al-Bulayqi defended concubinage and refuted modernist arguments.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=139}} Most ulama in [[West Africa]] opposed abolition.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=144-145}} They ruled that concubinage was still allowed with women of slave descent.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=145}} \n\nIn 1911 one Qadi in Mombasa ruled that no government can free a slave without the owner's permission.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=146}} [[J. Spencer Trimingham|Spencer Trimingham]] observed that in coastal Arab areas masters continued to take concubines from slave families because the descendants of slaves are still enslaved under religious law even if they have been freed according to secular law.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}} [[Armenians]] and other Christian rebels who had been enslaved in [[World War I]] were considered to be \"people of the book\" who had violated their contract. Hence, one [[Palestinian]] shaykh ruled that Muslims could buy those Christian girls from the slave markets in the Levant.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=141-142}} \n\nA conservative [[Deobandi]] scholar published a book in [[Lahore]] in 1946 in which he denied that the Prophet had ever encouraged the abolition of slavery.{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=135}} A lot of ulama in Mauritania did not recognise the legitimacy of abolishing slavery. In 1981 a group of ulama argued that only owners could free their slaves and that the Mauritanian government was breaking a fundamental religious rule. In 1997 one [[Mauritanian]] scholar stated that abolition:{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=147}}\n\n<blockquote>\"is contrary to the teachings of the fundamental text of Islamic law, the Koran... [and] amounts to the expropriation from Muslims of their gods, goods that were acquired legally. The state, if it is Islamic, does not have the right to seize my house, my wife or my slave.\"</blockquote>\n\n==Modern manifestations==\n===Middle East===\nArmenians underwent a [[Armenian Genocide|genocide]] in the Ottoman Empire, which climaxed around 1915-16. It has been accepted as the first  genocide of the 20th century by scholars of genocide and historians of the late Ottoman period.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=90}} The Ottomans had intended to destroy the Armenians.{{sfn|Eltringham|2014|p=14}} Derderuan notes that after being separated from their men who were killed, the Armenian women and children were raped, forcibly converted to Islam and subjected to sexual slavery. [[Eliz Sanasarian]] also notes the involvement of Turkish women in perpetrating violence against Armenian women by selling them into sexual slavery.{{sfn|Sjoberg|2016|p=91}} Women who were deemed beautiful were sold as sex slaves to military officials. The remaining women would be beaten and raped.{{sfn|Crawford|2017|p=13}} The women were also often forced into prostitution or forcibly married with non-Armenians.{{sfn|Demirdjian|2016|p=126}} Kidnapped Armenian girls were sorted on the basis of their age, beauty and marital status. The \"first choice\" was given to high-level Ottoman officials. Outside [[Mezre]], purchasers asked doctors to check the girls for diseases and to verify their virginity. One German reported the sale of girls in [[Ras al-Ayn]] and testified that the policemen carried out the trade in girls.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141}} A few slave markers were set up in the vicinity of government buildings while Armenian captive sex slaves were kept in the Red Crescent Hospital in Trebizond.{{sfn|Connellan|2017|p=141-142}}\n\nA large number of free [[Baloch people|Baloch]] women were kidnapped in the first half of the 20th century by slave traders and sold across the [[Persian Gulf]]. For example, Yuri bint Lapek was abducted after raiders killed her husband.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=214}} Another notable case was that of  Marzuq who was kidnapped from [[Makran]] and sold in [[Sharjah]]. Marzuq was purchased by Rashid bin Ali who had sex with her. When she became pregnant he married her off to another Baluchi to avoid taking responsibility for the child.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=218}} Many slave owners arranged  marriages for their female slaves, just so they would not have to take responsibility for impregnating their slaves.{{sfn|Suzuki|2013|p=219}}\n\n===South Asia===\nThe most widespread [[raptio]] in modern times was the [[Violence against women during the partition of India|kidnapping of tens of thousands of girls during the Partition of India]].{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} These women were kept as captives or forced wives{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=135}} and concubines.{{sfn|Khan|2007|p=39}} For instance, one account from Kirpal Singh mentions how [[Pakistan Army|Pakistani soldiers]] in Kamoke took 50 Hindu girls after killing most of their men.{{sfn|D'Costa|2010|p=57-58}} After being taken, Hindu and Sikh girls would be forcibly converted to Islam to be \"worthy\" of their captors' harems.{{sfn|Collins|1975|p=336}} [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] tribesmen captured a large number of non-Muslim girls from Kashmir and sold them as slave-girls in [[West Punjab]].{{sfn|Major|1995|p=62}} In [[Mirpur District|Mirpur]], many of the Hindu women captured by Pakistani soldiers committed jauhar, the old practice of Hindu women to escape Muslim soldiers.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bal K.

The female captives were used sexually. Their Muslim captors asserted that Islamic law allowed them.{{sfn|Ali|2015|p=53}} Sudan's Arab government had recruited Arab troops. One component consisted of millitias and the other component of their forces, called the [[Popular Defense Forces]], consisted of the Sudanese Army. This was a mainly jihadi force fighting the [[Sudan People's Liberation Army|SPLA]] which they considered to be an \"enemy of Islam and the Arabs.\"{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=24-25}} Arab raiders destroyed black Christian villages, executed all their  males and then took away the women and children as slaves.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}} \n\nRegular soldiers also abducted women and children. The Sudanese government allowed soldiers to take booty to supplement their low salaries. The first slave raid on the [[Dinka]] took place on February 1986.{{sfn|Jok|2010|p=25}} Two thousand women and children were taken. In a second raid on February 1987 one thousand women and children were taken. Once the raiders acquired enough booty they would distribute the captives between their selves and their families.

Western visitors noted that five or even more slaves could be bought for one rifle. Near the peak of the civil war in 1989 female black slaves were sold for 90 dollars at the slave markets. Several years later, when there was an abundance of slaves, the price of an average female black slave had dropped to $15. Many Western organisations traveled to Sudan with funds collected for the purpose of purchasing these slaves to emancipate them.{{sfn|Islam's Black Slaves|2001|p=138}}\n\n==Modern Muslim attitudes==\nWhile classical [[Sharia|Islamic law]] permits sexual slavery, the vast majority of Muslims today oppose it. This contradiction is demonstrated by Ahmed Hassan, a twentieth century translator of Sahih Muslim, who prefaced the translated chapter on marriage by claiming that Islam only allows sex within marriage. This was despite the fact that the same chapter included many references to Muslim men having sex with slave-girls.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=107}} Most ordinary Muslims ignore the existence of slavery and concubinage in Islamic history and texts. Most also ignore the millennia old consensus permitting it and a few writers even claim that those Islamic jurists who allowed sexual relations outside marriage with female slaves were mistaken.{{sfn|Hazelton|2010|p=108}} For example, [[Muhammad Asad]], rejected the notion of any sexual relationship outside of marriage.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Asad|first=Muhammad|title=The Message of the Quran.

However, Kecia Ali states that this view is not found anywhere in the pre-modern Islamic legal tradition.{{sfn|Ali|2017|p=148}}\n\nAfter 1947, the ulama in Pakistan called for the revival of slavery. The wish to enslave enemies and take concubines was noted in the [[Punjab Disturbances Court of Inquiry|Munir Commission Report]]. When [[Zia ul Haq]] came to power in 1977 and started applying sharia, some argued that the reward for freeing slaves meant that slavery should not be abolished \"since to do so would be to deny future generations the opportunity to commit the virtuous deed of freeing slaves.\"{{sfn|Smith|2006|p=189}} [[Muhammad Taqi Usmani|Mufti Taqi Usmani]] states that slavery and turning captives into concubines is still allowed by Islam.

Moreover, slavery was only abolished half a century ago and could return in the future.

It allows [[web server]]s to declare that [[HTTP cookie|web browsers]] (or other complying [[user agent]]s) should automatically interact with it using only [[HTTPS]] connections, which provide [[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS/SSL), unlike the insecure [[HTTP]] used alone.

The user can see that the connection is insecure, but crucially there is no way of knowing whether the connection ''should'' be secure. At the time of Marlinspike's talk, many websites did not use TLS/SSL, therefore there was no way of knowing (without prior knowledge) whether the use of plain HTTP was due to an attack, or simply because the website hadn't implemented TLS/SSL. Additionally, no warnings are presented to the user during the downgrade process, making the attack fairly subtle to all but the most vigilant. Marlinspike's sslstrip tool fully automates the attack.\n\nHSTS addresses this problem<ref name=\"hsts-threats-addressed\" /> by informing the browser that connections to the site should always use TLS/SSL. The HSTS header can be stripped by the attacker if this is the user's first visit.

The user can see that the connection is insecure, but crucially there is no way of knowing whether the connection ''should'' be secure. At the time of Marlinspike's talk, many websites did not use TLS/SSL, therefore there was no way of knowing (without prior knowledge) whether the use of plain HTTP was due to an attack, or simply because the website hadn't implemented TLS/SSL. Additionally, no warnings are presented to the user during the downgrade process, making the attack fairly subtle to all but the most vigilant. Marlinspike's sslstrip tool fully automates the attack.\n\nHSTS addresses this problem<ref name=\"hsts-threats-addressed\" /> by informing the browser that connections to the site should always use TLS/SSL. The HSTS header can be stripped by the attacker if this is the user's first visit. [[Google Chrome]], [[Firefox|Mozilla Firefox]], [[Internet Explorer]] and [[Microsoft Edge]] attempt to limit this problem by including a \"pre-loaded\" list of HSTS sites.<ref name=preloading_hsts_chromium>{{cite web\n| url = https://www.chromium.org/sts\n| author = Adam Langley\n| title = Strict Transport Security\n| work = The Chromium Projects\n| date = 8 July 2010\n| accessdate = 22 July 2010\n}}</ref><ref name=preloading_hsts_mozillla>{{cite web\n| url = https://blog.mozilla.org/security/2012/11/01/preloading-hsts/\n| author = David Keeler\n| title = Preloading HSTS\n| date = 1 November 2012\n| accessdate = 6 February 2014\n| work = Mozilla Security Blog\n}}</ref><ref name=\"iepreload\" />\nUnfortunately this solution cannot scale to include all websites on the internet.

In his graduation address on March 26, 1940 at the Rizal Memorial Stadium, he promised a new building for the school where its graduates can be recognized. Two years later, Congressman Manuel A. Alazarte together with the Department Head of the Philippine School of Commerce Luis F. Reyes, formulated a bill to this effect and present it to the [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]].

The ruins of the Normal Hall was reconstructed and the college resumed its classes there on August 4, 1946. In 1947, the Philippine Normal School converted the Normal Hall into a dormitory, resulting in the Philippine School of Commerce to resign to its former lot, where it held classes with overcrowded rooms. Because of its unbearable condition, the school made representations in the Philippine Alien Property Administrator, through Malaca\u00f1ang and the [[Department of Foreign Affairs (Philippines)|Department of Foreign Affairs]], for the acquisition of the Lepanto site in [[Sampaloc, Manila|Sampaloc]].

The most common versions of the dash are the '''en dash''' (\u2013), longer than a [[hyphen]]; the '''em dash''' (\u2014), longer than the en dash; and the '''horizontal bar''' (\u2015), whose length varies across typefaces but tends to be between those of the [[en (typography)|en]] and [[Em (typography)|em]] dashes.{{efn|In [[Cambria (typeface)|Cambria]] and many other fonts, the length of the horizontal bar is equal to \u00be\u202fem dash or 1\u00bd\u202fen dash.}}\n\nHistorically, the names of en dash and em dash came from the width of a lower-case ''n'' and upper-case ''M'', respectively, in commonly used [[font]]s.\n\n== Types of dash ==\n\nUsage varies both within English and in other languages, but the usual convention in printed English text is as follows:\n* An em dash or a spaced en dash can be used to mark a break in a sentence, and a pair can be used to set off parenthetical statements.\n<blockquote>Glitter, felt, yarn, and buttons\u2014his kitchen looked as if a clown had exploded.<br />A flock of sparrows \u2013 some of them juveniles \u2013 alighted and sang.</blockquote>\n* The en dash but not the em dash indicates spans or differentiation, where it may be considered to replace \"and\" or \"to\" (but where the expression is introduced by \"from\", \"to\" is normally used, not a dash; similarly, \"between X and Y\"):<ref>''[http://www.mhra.org.uk/style/5.2 MHRA Style Guide: A Handbook for Authors, Editors, and Writers of Theses]'', 2nd ed, ch 5 \u00a7 2.

This is true of most fonts, not only monospaced fonts.\n\nThe figure dash is used within numbers (e.g. phone number 555\u20120199), especially in columns for maintaining alignment. Its meaning is the same as a [[hyphen]], as represented by the [[hyphen-minus]] glyph. In contrast, the [[#En dash|en dash]] is more appropriately used to indicate a range of values.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Korpela|first1=Jukka|title=Unicode Explained|date=2006|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=9780596101213|page=433|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lxndiWaFMvMC&pg=PA433&dq=%22en+dash%22+%22figure+dash%22+range#v=onepage&q=%22en%20dash%22%20%22figure%20dash%22%20range&f=false|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> The [[minus sign]] (\u2212) also has a separate [[glyph]], typically set a little higher.\n\nThe figure dash is often unavailable; in this case, one may use a [[hyphen-minus]] instead. In [[Unicode]], the figure dash is {{U+|2012}} (decimal 8210). If it is otherwise unavailable, HTML authors must use the numeric forms <code>&amp;#8210;</code> or <code>&amp;#x2012;</code> to type it; there is no equivalent character entity.\n\nIn [[TeX]], the standard fonts have no figure dash; however, the digits normally all have the same width as the en dash, so an en dash can be substituted when using standard TeX fonts. In [[XeLaTeX]], one can use <code>\\char\"2012</code>.<ref>[http://b-p-i.blogspot.ro/2011/08/figure-dash-in-xelatex.html Figure dash in XeLaTeX]</ref> [[Linux Libertine]] font also has the figure dash glyph.\n\n== En dash ==\n\nThe '''en dash''', '''en rule''', or '''nut''' ('''\u2013''') is traditionally half the width of an [[#Em dash|em dash]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Practical printing: a handbook of the art of typography\n | edition = 2nd\n | first = John | last = Southward\n | author-link = John Southward\n | publisher = J.M.

It is sometimes held that, when used as an interruptor, the en dash should be \"open\" \u2013 spaced on both sides \u2013 in contrast to the em dash, which is closed.\n\n==== Ranges of values ====\n\nThe en dash is commonly used to indicate a closed range of values \u2013 a range with clearly defined and finite upper and lower boundaries \u2013 roughly signifying what might otherwise be communicated by the word \"through\".<ref>Lamb, David. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103150905/http://www.academicwritingtutor.com/hyphens-en-dashes-and-em-dashes-correct-usage/ Hyphens, En Dashes, and Em Dashes: Correct Usage]\".

For example, \"a voltage of 50&nbsp;V to 100&nbsp;V\" is preferable to using \"a voltage of 50\u2013100&nbsp;V\". Relatedly, in ranges that include negative numbers, \"to\" is used to avoid ambiguity or awkwardness (for example, \"temperatures ranged from \u221218&thinsp;\u00b0C to \u221234&thinsp;\u00b0C.\") It is also considered poor style (best avoided) to use the en dash in place of the words ''to'' or ''and'' in phrases that follow the forms ''from&nbsp;X to&nbsp;Y'' and ''between&nbsp;X and&nbsp;Y''.<ref name=\"copyeditguide\" /><ref name=\"webstersgrammar\" />\n\n==== Relationships and connections ====\n\nThe en dash is used to contrast values or illustrate a relationship between two things.<ref name=\"barronsgrammar\" /><ref name=\"texttypestyle\" /> Examples of this usage include:\n* Australia beat American Samoa [[Australia 31\u20130 American Samoa|31\u20130]].\n* Radical\u2013Unionist coalition\n* Boston\u2013Hartford route\n* New York\u2013London flight (however, it may be seen that ''New York to London flight'' is more appropriate because New York is a single name composed of two valid words; with a dash the phrase is ambiguous and could mean either ''Flight from New York to London'' or ''New flight from York to London'')<ref name=\"texttypestyle\" />\n* Mother\u2013daughter relationship\n* The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] voted 5\u20134 to uphold the decision.\n\nA distinction is often made between \"simple\" attributive compounds (written with a hyphen) and other subtypes (written with an en dash); at least one authority considers name pairs, where the paired elements carry equal weight, as in the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]] to be \"simple\",<ref name=\"copyeditguide\" /> while others consider an en dash appropriate in instances such as these<ref>{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link = Bryan A.

When an act of the U. S. Congress is named using the surnames of the senator and representative who sponsored it, the hyphen-minus is used in the [[short title]]; thus the short title of [[Dodd\u2013Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Public Law 111\u2013203]] is \"The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act\", with a hyphen-minus rather than an en dash between \"Dodd\" and \"Frank\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/PLAW-111publ203/pdf/PLAW-111publ203.pdf|publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office|title=Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|date=21 July 2010|access-date=12 August 2019}}</ref> However, there is a difference between something named for a parallel/coordinate relationship between two people (for example, [[Satyendra Nath Bose|Bose]] and [[Einstein]]) and something named for a single person who had a [[compound surname]], which may be written with a hyphen or a space but not an en dash (for example, the [[Lennard-Jones potential]] [hyphen] is named after one person (Mr. [[John Lennard-Jones]]), as are [[Bence Jones protein]]s and [[John Hughlings Jackson|Hughlings Jackson syndrome]]). Copyeditors use dictionaries (general, medical, biographical, and geographical) to confirm the [[eponym]]ity (and thus the styling) for specific terms, given that no one can know them all offhand.\n\nPreference for an en dash instead of a hyphen in these coordinate/relationship/connection types of terms is a matter of style, not inherent orthographic \"correctness\"; both are equally \"correct\", and each is the preferred style in some style guides. For example, ''[[the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'', and [[Dorland's medical reference works]] use hyphens, not en dashes, in coordinate terms (such as \"[[blood\u2013brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]]\"), in [[eponym]]s (such as \"[[Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration|Cheyne-Stokes respiration]]\", \"[[Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator|Kaplan-Meier method]]\"), and so on.\n\n==== Attributive compounds ====\n\nIn English, the en dash is usually used instead of a [[hyphen]] in [[Adjectival phrase|compound (phrasal) attributives]] in which one or both elements is itself a compound, especially when the compound element is an [[wikt:open compound|open compound]], meaning it is not itself hyphenated.

Often two hyphens are the substitute.\n\nIn Unicode, the en dash is U+2013 (decimal 8211). In HTML, one may use the numeric forms <code>&amp;#8211;</code> or <code>&amp;#x2013;</code>; there is also the HTML entity <code>&amp;ndash;</code>.\n\nThe en dash is sometimes used as a substitute for the [[minus sign]], when the minus sign character is not available since the en dash is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit [[Macintosh Character Set]] had an en dash, useful for the minus sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available. The hyphen-minus is usually too narrow to make a typographically acceptable minus sign. However, the en dash cannot be used for a minus sign in [[programming language]]s because the syntax usually requires a hyphen-minus.\n\n== Em dash ==\n\nThe '''em dash''', '''em rule''', or '''mutton'''<ref name=\"Stewart1919\">{{Citation |last=Stewart |first=A.

For example, the em dash is used this way in [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'':\n* He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom, Deirdre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees.

Because the ellipsis is the more common choice, an em dash for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as many readers would assume interruption, although it may be used to indicate great emotion in dramatic [[monologue]].\n* Long pause:\n** In [[Early Modern English]] texts and afterward, em dashes have been used to add long pauses (as noted by Joseph Robertson's 1785 ''An Essay On Punctuation''):\n:: {{Quote|''Lord Cardinal! if thou think'st on heaven's bliss, <br />Hold up thy hand, make signal of that hope.\u2014 <br />He dies, and makes no sigh!''|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], from ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]''}}\n\n==== Quotation ====\n===== Quotation mark-like use =====\n\nThis is a [[quotation dash]].

But the practice in some parts of the English-speaking world, including the style recommended by ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' for printed newspapers and the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', sets it open, separating it from its surrounding words by using spaces or [[hair space]]s (U+200A) when it is being used parenthetically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apvschicago.com/2011/05/em-dashes-and-ellipses-closed-or-spaced.html |title=Em Dashes and Ellipses: Closed or Spaced Out? |last=Yin |first=Karen |work=AP vs. Chicago |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=13 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>Yagoda, Ben. \"[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/mad-dash/ Mad Dash]\". ''The New York Times''. 22 October 2012. Accessed 31 May 2016.</ref> The ''AP Stylebook'' rejects the use of the open em dash to set off introductory items in lists. However, the \"space, en dash, space\" sequence is the predominant style in German and French [[typography]]. (See [[#En dash versus em dash|En dash versus em dash]] below.)\n\nIn Canada, ''The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing'', ''The Oxford Canadian A to Z of Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation: Guide to Canadian English Usage'' (2nd ed.), ''Editing Canadian English'', and the ''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' all specify that an em dash should be set closed when used between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals.\n\nThe Australian government's ''Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers'' (6th ed.), also specifies that em dashes inserted between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals, should be set closed. A section on the 2-em rule (\u2e3a) also explains that the 2-em can be used to mark an abrupt break in direct or reported speech, but a space is used before the 2-em if a complete word is missing, while no space is used if part of a word exists before the sudden break. Two examples of this are as follows (properly typeset 2-em and 3-em dashes should appear as a single dash, but they may show on this page as several em dashes with spaces in between):\n* I distinctly heard him say, \"Go away or I'll \u2014\u2014\".\n* It was alleged that D\u2014\u2014 had been threatened with blackmail.\n\nMonospaced fonts that mimic the look of a typewriter have the same width for all characters. Some of these fonts have em and en dashes that more or less fill the monospaced width they have available. For example, the sequence \"hyphen, en dash, em dash, minus\" shows as \"<code>- \u2013 \u2014 \u2212</code>\" in a monospace font.\n\n==== Approximating the em dash with two or three hyphens ====\n\nWhen an em dash is unavailable in a particular [[character encoding]] environment\u2014as in the [[ASCII]] character set\u2014it has usually been [[typographic approximation|approximated]] as a double&nbsp;(--) or triple&nbsp;(---) hyphen-minus. The two-hyphen em dash proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the [[typewriter|typewriting]] era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that typewritten manuscript and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen em dash proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, en dash, and em dash, respectively.\n\nBecause early comic book [[letterer]]s were not aware of the typographic convention of replacing a typewritten double hyphen with an em dash, the double hyphen became traditional in American comics. This practice has continued despite the development of computer lettering.<ref name=NatePiekos2012>{{cite web|last=Piekos |first=Nate |title=Comic Book Grammar & Tradition |url=http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml |accessdate=29 December 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221085635/http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=ToddKlein2008>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Todd|title=Punctuating Comics: Dots and Dashes|url=http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=1946|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=23 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n== En dash versus em dash ==\n\n[[File:Dash font comparison.png|thumb|right|These comparisons of the hyphen {{nowrap|(-)}}, en dash {{nowrap|(\u2013)}}, and em dash {{nowrap|(\u2014)}}, in various 12-point fonts, illustrate the typical relationship between lengths (\"- n \u2013 m \u2014\"). In some fonts, the en dash is not much longer than the hyphen, and in [[Lucida Grande]], the en dash is actually shorter than the hyphen.]]\n\nThe en dash is wider than the [[hyphen]] but not as wide as the em dash. An [[Em (typography)#Incorrect and alternate definitions|em width]] is defined as the point size of the currently used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size.<ref>{{cite web |title=A glossary of typographic terms |publisher=Adobe |accessdate=18 October 2007 |url=https://www.adobe.com/uk/type/topics/glossary.html#ememspaceemquad}}</ref> In running text, various dash conventions are employed: an em dash\u2014like so\u2014or a spaced em dash \u2014 like so \u2014 or a spaced en dash \u2013 like so \u2013 can be seen in contemporary publications.\n\nVarious style guides and national varieties of languages prescribe different guidance on dashes. Dashes have been cited as being treated differently in the US and the UK, with the former preferring the use of an em dash with no additional spacing and the latter preferring a spaced en dash.<ref name=\"Complete Typographer\">{{Cite book |first=Hill |last=Will |title = The Complete Typographer: A Foundation Course for Graphic Designers Working With Type |edition=3rd |year=2010 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn = 978-0-500-28894-8 }}</ref> As examples of the US style, ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' and ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]]'' recommend unspaced em dashes. Style guides outside the US are more variable. For example, ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' by Canadian typographer [[Robert Bringhurst]] recommends the spaced en dash \u2013 like so \u2013 and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash \"belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography\".<ref>\n{{cite book |title = The elements of typographic style |edition=third |first=Robert |last=Bringhurst |publisher = Hartley & Marks, Publishers |year=2004 |isbn = 978-0-88179-206-5 |page = 80 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=uKkQAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22belongs+to+the+padded+and+corseted+aesthetic%22&q=corseted+aesthetic#search_anchor }}</ref>\nIn the United Kingdom, the spaced en dash is the house style for certain major publishers, including the [[Penguin Group]], the [[Cambridge University Press]], and [[Routledge]]. However, this convention is not universal. The ''Oxford Guide to Style'' (2002, section 5.10.10) acknowledges that the spaced en dash is used by \"other British publishers\" but states that the [[Oxford University Press]], like \"most US publishers\", uses the unspaced em dash.\n\nThe en dash \u2013 always with spaces in running text when, as discussed in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause \u2013 and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support [[Justification (typesetting)|full justification]]. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the unspaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated by the use of [[thin space]]s, [[hair space]]s, or even [[zero-width space]]s on the sides of the em dash. This provides the appearance of an unspaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, a spaced en dash may be ambiguous when it is also used for ranges, for example, in dates or between geographical locations with internal spaces.\n\n== Horizontal bar ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Horizontal bar]] -->\n\n{{Main|Quotation mark#Quotation dash}}\n\nThe '''horizontal bar''' ({{unichar|2015|ulink=Unicode}}), also known as a '''quotation dash''', is used to introduce quoted text. This is the standard method of printing [[dialogue]] in some languages. The em dash is equally suitable if the quotation dash is unavailable or is contrary to the house style being used.\n\nThere is no support in the standard TeX fonts, but one can use <code>\\hbox{---}\\kern-.5em---</code> instead, or simply an em dash.\n\n== Swung dash ==<!-- This section is linked from Dash -->\n\n{{Main|Tilde#Punctuation}}\n\nThe '''swung dash''' ({{unichar|2053|ulink=Unicode}}) resembles a lengthened [[tilde]], and is used to separate alternatives or approximates. In [[dictionary|dictionaries]], it is frequently used to stand in for the term being defined. A dictionary entry providing an example for the term ''henceforth'' might employ the swung dash as follows:\n\n:''henceforth'' (adv.) from this time forth; from now on; \"<big><big>\u2053</big></big> she will be known as Mrs. Wales\"\n\nThere are several similar, related characters:\n* {{unichar|007E|TILDE}} (see below in [[#Similar Unicode characters|\u00a7 Similar Unicode Characters]])\n* {{unichar|02DC|SMALL TILDE}} (see below in [[#Similar Unicode characters|\u00a7 Similar Unicode Characters]])\n* {{unichar|223C|Tilde operator}}, used in mathematics.

In consequence, it became common to substitute the nearest available punctuation mark or symbol. Em dashes are often represented in British usage by a single hyphen-minus surrounded by spaces, or in American usage by two hyphen-minuses surrounded by spaces.\n\nModern computer software typically has support for many more characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and em dashes correctly\u2014albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit [[character encoding]], and when unencodable characters are entered\u2014for example by pasting from the clipboard\u2014they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to em and en dashes, even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.\n\nTechniques for generating em and en dashes in various [[operating system]]s, [[word processor]]s and [[markup language]]s are provided in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

This is true of most fonts, not only monospaced fonts.\n\nThe figure dash is used within numbers (e.g. phone number 555\u20120199), especially in columns for maintaining alignment. Its meaning is the same as a [[hyphen]], as represented by the [[hyphen-minus]] glyph. In contrast, the [[#En dash|en dash]] is more appropriately used to indicate a range of values.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Korpela|first1=Jukka|title=Unicode Explained|date=2006|publisher=O'Reilly Media|isbn=9780596101213|page=433|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lxndiWaFMvMC&pg=PA433&dq=%22en+dash%22+%22figure+dash%22+range#v=onepage&q=%22en%20dash%22%20%22figure%20dash%22%20range&f=false|accessdate=19 October 2017}}</ref> The [[minus sign]] (\u2212) also has a separate [[glyph]], typically set a little higher.\n\nThe figure dash is often unavailable; in this case, one may use a [[hyphen-minus]] instead. In [[Unicode]], the figure dash is {{U+|2012}} (decimal 8210). If it is otherwise unavailable, HTML authors must use the numeric forms <code>&amp;#8210;</code> or <code>&amp;#x2012;</code> to type it; there is no equivalent character entity.\n\nIn [[TeX]], the standard fonts have no figure dash; however, the digits normally all have the same width as the en dash, so an en dash can be substituted when using standard TeX fonts. In [[XeLaTeX]], one can use <code>\\char\"2012</code>.<ref>[http://b-p-i.blogspot.ro/2011/08/figure-dash-in-xelatex.html Figure dash in XeLaTeX]</ref> [[Linux Libertine]] font also has the figure dash glyph.\n\n== En dash ==\n\nThe '''en dash''', '''en rule''', or '''nut''' ('''\u2013''') is traditionally half the width of an [[#Em dash|em dash]].<ref>\n{{cite book\n | title = Practical printing: a handbook of the art of typography\n | edition = 2nd\n | first = John | last = Southward\n | author-link = John Southward\n | publisher = J.M.

It is sometimes held that, when used as an interruptor, the en dash should be \"open\" \u2013 spaced on both sides \u2013 in contrast to the em dash, which is closed.\n\n==== Ranges of values ====\n\nThe en dash is commonly used to indicate a closed range of values \u2013 a range with clearly defined and finite upper and lower boundaries \u2013 roughly signifying what might otherwise be communicated by the word \"through\".<ref>Lamb, David. \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20131103150905/http://www.academicwritingtutor.com/hyphens-en-dashes-and-em-dashes-correct-usage/ Hyphens, En Dashes, and Em Dashes: Correct Usage]\".

For example, \"a voltage of 50&nbsp;V to 100&nbsp;V\" is preferable to using \"a voltage of 50\u2013100&nbsp;V\". Relatedly, in ranges that include negative numbers, \"to\" is used to avoid ambiguity or awkwardness (for example, \"temperatures ranged from \u221218&thinsp;\u00b0C to \u221234&thinsp;\u00b0C.\") It is also considered poor style (best avoided) to use the en dash in place of the words ''to'' or ''and'' in phrases that follow the forms ''from&nbsp;X to&nbsp;Y'' and ''between&nbsp;X and&nbsp;Y''.<ref name=\"copyeditguide\" /><ref name=\"webstersgrammar\" />\n\n==== Relationships and connections ====\n\nThe en dash is used to contrast values or illustrate a relationship between two things.<ref name=\"barronsgrammar\" /><ref name=\"texttypestyle\" /> Examples of this usage include:\n* Australia beat American Samoa [[Australia 31\u20130 American Samoa|31\u20130]].\n* Radical\u2013Unionist coalition\n* Boston\u2013Hartford route\n* New York\u2013London flight (however, it may be seen that ''New York to London flight'' is more appropriate because New York is a single name composed of two valid words; with a dash the phrase is ambiguous and could mean either ''Flight from New York to London'' or ''New flight from York to London'')<ref name=\"texttypestyle\" />\n* Mother\u2013daughter relationship\n* The [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] voted 5\u20134 to uphold the decision.\n\nA distinction is often made between \"simple\" attributive compounds (written with a hyphen) and other subtypes (written with an en dash); at least one authority considers name pairs, where the paired elements carry equal weight, as in the [[Taft\u2013Hartley Act]] to be \"simple\",<ref name=\"copyeditguide\" /> while others consider an en dash appropriate in instances such as these<ref>{{cite book |last=Garner |first=Bryan A. |author-link = Bryan A.

When an act of the U. S.

Copyeditors use dictionaries (general, medical, biographical, and geographical) to confirm the [[eponym]]ity (and thus the styling) for specific terms, given that no one can know them all offhand.\n\nPreference for an en dash instead of a hyphen in these coordinate/relationship/connection types of terms is a matter of style, not inherent orthographic \"correctness\"; both are equally \"correct\", and each is the preferred style in some style guides. For example, ''[[the American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', the ''[[AMA Manual of Style]]'', and [[Dorland's medical reference works]] use hyphens, not en dashes, in coordinate terms (such as \"[[blood\u2013brain barrier|blood-brain barrier]]\"), in [[eponym]]s (such as \"[[Cheyne\u2013Stokes respiration|Cheyne-Stokes respiration]]\", \"[[Kaplan\u2013Meier estimator|Kaplan-Meier method]]\"), and so on.\n\n==== Attributive compounds ====\n\nIn English, the en dash is usually used instead of a [[hyphen]] in [[Adjectival phrase|compound (phrasal) attributives]] in which one or both elements is itself a compound, especially when the compound element is an [[wikt:open compound|open compound]], meaning it is not itself hyphenated.

Often two hyphens are the substitute.\n\nIn Unicode, the en dash is U+2013 (decimal 8211). In HTML, one may use the numeric forms <code>&amp;#8211;</code> or <code>&amp;#x2013;</code>; there is also the HTML entity <code>&amp;ndash;</code>.\n\nThe en dash is sometimes used as a substitute for the [[minus sign]], when the minus sign character is not available since the en dash is usually the same width as a plus sign. For example, the original 8-bit [[Macintosh Character Set]] had an en dash, useful for the minus sign, years before Unicode with a dedicated minus sign was available.

For example, the em dash is used this way in [[Joseph Heller]]'s ''[[Catch-22]]'':\n* He was Cain, Ulysses, the Flying Dutchman; he was Lot in Sodom, Deirdre of the Sorrows, Sweeney in the nightingales among trees. He was the miracle ingredient Z-147. He was\u2014 <br />\"Crazy!\" Clevinger interrupted, shrieking. \"That's what you are! Crazy!\"<br />\"\u2014immense.

Because the ellipsis is the more common choice, an em dash for this purpose may be ambiguous in expository text, as many readers would assume interruption, although it may be used to indicate great emotion in dramatic [[monologue]].\n* Long pause:\n** In [[Early Modern English]] texts and afterward, em dashes have been used to add long pauses (as noted by Joseph Robertson's 1785 ''An Essay On Punctuation''):\n:: {{Quote|''Lord Cardinal! if thou think'st on heaven's bliss, <br />Hold up thy hand, make signal of that hope.\u2014 <br />He dies, and makes no sigh!''|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]], from ''[[Henry VI, Part 2]]''}}\n\n==== Quotation ====\n===== Quotation mark-like use =====\n\nThis is a [[quotation dash]].

But the practice in some parts of the English-speaking world, including the style recommended by ''[[The New York Times Manual of Style and Usage]]'' for printed newspapers and the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'', sets it open, separating it from its surrounding words by using spaces or [[hair space]]s (U+200A) when it is being used parenthetically.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apvschicago.com/2011/05/em-dashes-and-ellipses-closed-or-spaced.html |title=Em Dashes and Ellipses: Closed or Spaced Out? |last=Yin |first=Karen |work=AP vs. Chicago |date=31 May 2016 |accessdate=13 August 2014 }}</ref><ref>Yagoda, Ben. \"[http://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/10/22/mad-dash/ Mad Dash]\". ''The New York Times''. 22 October 2012. Accessed 31 May 2016.</ref> The ''AP Stylebook'' rejects the use of the open em dash to set off introductory items in lists. However, the \"space, en dash, space\" sequence is the predominant style in German and French [[typography]]. (See [[#En dash versus em dash|En dash versus em dash]] below.)\n\nIn Canada, ''The Canadian Style: A Guide to Writing and Editing'', ''The Oxford Canadian A to Z of Grammar, Spelling & Punctuation: Guide to Canadian English Usage'' (2nd ed.), ''Editing Canadian English'', and the ''Canadian Oxford Dictionary'' all specify that an em dash should be set closed when used between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals.\n\nThe Australian government's ''Style Manual for Authors, Editors and Printers'' (6th ed.), also specifies that em dashes inserted between words, a word and numeral, or two numerals, should be set closed. A section on the 2-em rule (\u2e3a) also explains that the 2-em can be used to mark an abrupt break in direct or reported speech, but a space is used before the 2-em if a complete word is missing, while no space is used if part of a word exists before the sudden break. Two examples of this are as follows (properly typeset 2-em and 3-em dashes should appear as a single dash, but they may show on this page as several em dashes with spaces in between):\n* I distinctly heard him say, \"Go away or I'll \u2014\u2014\".\n* It was alleged that D\u2014\u2014 had been threatened with blackmail.\n\nMonospaced fonts that mimic the look of a typewriter have the same width for all characters. Some of these fonts have em and en dashes that more or less fill the monospaced width they have available. For example, the sequence \"hyphen, en dash, em dash, minus\" shows as \"<code>- \u2013 \u2014 \u2212</code>\" in a monospace font.\n\n==== Approximating the em dash with two or three hyphens ====\n\nWhen an em dash is unavailable in a particular [[character encoding]] environment\u2014as in the [[ASCII]] character set\u2014it has usually been [[typographic approximation|approximated]] as a double&nbsp;(--) or triple&nbsp;(---) hyphen-minus. The two-hyphen em dash proxy is perhaps more common, being a widespread convention in the [[typewriter|typewriting]] era. (It is still described for hard copy manuscript preparation in the ''Chicago Manual of Style'' as of the 16th edition, although the manual conveys that typewritten manuscript and copyediting on paper are now dated practices). The three-hyphen em dash proxy was popular with various publishers because the sequence of one, two, or three hyphens could then correspond to the hyphen, en dash, and em dash, respectively.\n\nBecause early comic book [[letterer]]s were not aware of the typographic convention of replacing a typewritten double hyphen with an em dash, the double hyphen became traditional in American comics. This practice has continued despite the development of computer lettering.<ref name=NatePiekos2012>{{cite web|last=Piekos |first=Nate |title=Comic Book Grammar & Tradition |url=http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml |accessdate=29 December 2012 |url-status = dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221085635/http://www.blambot.com/grammar.shtml |archivedate=21 December 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=ToddKlein2008>{{cite web|last=Klein|first=Todd|title=Punctuating Comics: Dots and Dashes|url=http://kleinletters.com/Blog/?p=1946|accessdate=29 December 2012|date=23 September 2008}}</ref>\n\n== En dash versus em dash ==\n\n[[File:Dash font comparison.png|thumb|right|These comparisons of the hyphen {{nowrap|(-)}}, en dash {{nowrap|(\u2013)}}, and em dash {{nowrap|(\u2014)}}, in various 12-point fonts, illustrate the typical relationship between lengths (\"- n \u2013 m \u2014\"). In some fonts, the en dash is not much longer than the hyphen, and in [[Lucida Grande]], the en dash is actually shorter than the hyphen.]]\n\nThe en dash is wider than the [[hyphen]] but not as wide as the em dash. An [[Em (typography)#Incorrect and alternate definitions|em width]] is defined as the point size of the currently used font, since the M character is not always the width of the point size.<ref>{{cite web |title=A glossary of typographic terms |publisher=Adobe |accessdate=18 October 2007 |url=https://www.adobe.com/uk/type/topics/glossary.html#ememspaceemquad}}</ref> In running text, various dash conventions are employed: an em dash\u2014like so\u2014or a spaced em dash \u2014 like so \u2014 or a spaced en dash \u2013 like so \u2013 can be seen in contemporary publications.\n\nVarious style guides and national varieties of languages prescribe different guidance on dashes. Dashes have been cited as being treated differently in the US and the UK, with the former preferring the use of an em dash with no additional spacing and the latter preferring a spaced en dash.<ref name=\"Complete Typographer\">{{Cite book |first=Hill |last=Will |title = The Complete Typographer: A Foundation Course for Graphic Designers Working With Type |edition=3rd |year=2010 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |isbn = 978-0-500-28894-8 }}</ref> As examples of the US style, ''The Chicago Manual of Style'' and ''[[APA style|The Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association]]'' recommend unspaced em dashes. Style guides outside the US are more variable. For example, ''[[The Elements of Typographic Style]]'' by Canadian typographer [[Robert Bringhurst]] recommends the spaced en dash \u2013 like so \u2013 and argues that the length and visual magnitude of an em dash \"belongs to the padded and corseted aesthetic of Victorian typography\".<ref>\n{{cite book |title = The elements of typographic style |edition=third |first=Robert |last=Bringhurst |publisher = Hartley & Marks, Publishers |year=2004 |isbn = 978-0-88179-206-5 |page = 80 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=uKkQAQAAMAAJ&dq=%22belongs+to+the+padded+and+corseted+aesthetic%22&q=corseted+aesthetic#search_anchor }}</ref>\nIn the United Kingdom, the spaced en dash is the house style for certain major publishers, including the [[Penguin Group]], the [[Cambridge University Press]], and [[Routledge]]. However, this convention is not universal. The ''Oxford Guide to Style'' (2002, section 5.10.10) acknowledges that the spaced en dash is used by \"other British publishers\" but states that the [[Oxford University Press]], like \"most US publishers\", uses the unspaced em dash.\n\nThe en dash \u2013 always with spaces in running text when, as discussed in this section, indicating a parenthesis or pause \u2013 and the spaced em dash both have a certain technical advantage over the unspaced em dash. Most typesetting and word processing expects word spacing to vary to support [[Justification (typesetting)|full justification]]. Alone among punctuation that marks pauses or logical relations in text, the unspaced em dash disables this for the words it falls between. This can cause uneven spacing in the text, but can be mitigated by the use of [[thin space]]s, [[hair space]]s, or even [[zero-width space]]s on the sides of the em dash. This provides the appearance of an unspaced em dash, but allows the words and dashes to break between lines. The spaced em dash risks introducing excessive separation of words. In full justification, the adjacent spaces may be stretched, and the separation of words further exaggerated. En dashes may also be preferred to em dashes when text is set in narrow columns, such as in newspapers and similar publications, since the en dash is smaller. In such cases, its use is based purely on space considerations and is not necessarily related to other typographical concerns.\n\nOn the other hand, a spaced en dash may be ambiguous when it is also used for ranges, for example, in dates or between geographical locations with internal spaces.\n\n== Horizontal bar ==<!-- This section is linked from [[Horizontal bar]] -->\n\n{{Main|Quotation mark#Quotation dash}}\n\nThe '''horizontal bar''' ({{unichar|2015|ulink=Unicode}}), also known as a '''quotation dash''', is used to introduce quoted text. This is the standard method of printing [[dialogue]] in some languages. The em dash is equally suitable if the quotation dash is unavailable or is contrary to the house style being used.\n\nThere is no support in the standard TeX fonts, but one can use <code>\\hbox{---}\\kern-.5em---</code> instead, or simply an em dash.\n\n== Swung dash ==<!-- This section is linked from Dash -->\n\n{{Main|Tilde#Punctuation}}\n\nThe '''swung dash''' ({{unichar|2053|ulink=Unicode}}) resembles a lengthened [[tilde]], and is used to separate alternatives or approximates. In [[dictionary|dictionaries]], it is frequently used to stand in for the term being defined. A dictionary entry providing an example for the term ''henceforth'' might employ the swung dash as follows:\n\n:''henceforth'' (adv.) from this time forth; from now on; \"<big><big>\u2053</big></big> she will be known as Mrs. Wales\"\n\nThere are several similar, related characters:\n* {{unichar|007E|TILDE}} (see below in [[#Similar Unicode characters|\u00a7 Similar Unicode Characters]])\n* {{unichar|02DC|SMALL TILDE}} (see below in [[#Similar Unicode characters|\u00a7 Similar Unicode Characters]])\n* {{unichar|223C|Tilde operator}}, used in mathematics. Ends less curved than regular tilde. In [[TeX]] and [[LaTeX]], this character can be expressed using the math mode command <code>$\\sim$</code>.\n* {{unichar|301C|Wave dash}}, used in East Asian typography for a variety of purposes, including [[Japanese punctuation#Wave dash|Japanese punctuation]].\n* {{unichar|FF5E|Fullwidth tilde}} is a compatibility character for a wide tilde used in East Asian typography.\n\n== Rendering dashes on computers ==\n\n{{hatnote|For insertion of dashes using their Unicode code points (U+2013 for en dash and U+2014 for em dash), see [[Unicode input]].}}\n\nTypewriters and early computers have traditionally had only a limited [[character (computing)|character]] set, often having no key that produces a dash. In consequence, it became common to substitute the nearest available punctuation mark or symbol. Em dashes are often represented in British usage by a single hyphen-minus surrounded by spaces, or in American usage by two hyphen-minuses surrounded by spaces.\n\nModern computer software typically has support for many more characters and is usually capable of rendering both the en and em dashes correctly\u2014albeit sometimes with an inconvenient input method. Some software, though, may operate in a more limited mode. Some text editors, for example, are restricted to working with a single 8-bit [[character encoding]], and when unencodable characters are entered\u2014for example by pasting from the clipboard\u2014they are often blindly converted to question marks. Sometimes this happens to em and en dashes, even when the 8-bit encoding supports them or when an alternative representation using hyphen-minuses is an option.\n\nTechniques for generating em and en dashes in various [[operating system]]s, [[word processor]]s and [[markup language]]s are provided in the following table:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]], a separate De La Salle campus where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019. This means that the institution can enjoy a lot of benefits including being allowed to launch new courses/programs in the undergraduate and/or graduate levels including doctoral programs in areas of expertise without securing a permit/authority from CHED; only informing them of the programs to be offered.<ref>{{cite web |title=CMO No. 12, Series of 2019 \u2013 Grant of Autonomous and Deregulated Status to Private HEIs |url=https://ched.gov.ph/wp-content/uploads/CMO-No-12-s-2019-Grant-of-Autonomous-and-Deregulated-Status-to-Private-HEIs.pdf |website=Commission on Higher Education |accessdate=26 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Academics==\n===Programs and Accreditations===\nDLSMHSI offers academic programs through its seven colleges and a special health sciences senior high school.

The institute consists of three service divisions: the academic division - consisting of the colleges and a senior high school (all of which are only medicine and allied health-related courses), its [[Teaching hospital|teaching hospital]] - De La Salle University Medical Center, and a [[Research institute|research facility]] - Angelo King Medical Research Center. Located in [[Dasmari\u00f1as|Dasmari\u00f1as City]], [[Cavite]], it sits only 3 kilometers from [[De La Salle University-Dasmari\u00f1as]] where it is often mistaken as part of due to its proximity but is actually a separate De La Salle campus.\n\n==History==\n\nThe De La Salle Medical and Health Sciences Institute was started by a group of doctors from the College of Medicine of the [[University of the Philippines]] and the [[Philippine General Hospital]] who, in 1976, decided to establish a [[medical school]] to support the need for a well-trained staff for the newly inaugurated Medical Center Manila. Following the national government's policy of dispersing educational facilities outside the [[capital city]] and encouraging the establishment of medical schools in various regions of the country, they decided to establish a medical school in Dasmari\u00f1as City, Cavite. Originally named Emilio Aguinaldo College of Medicine, the school opened in 1979 under the management of the University Physician\u2019s Foundation, Inc. with the Jose P. Rizal National Medical Research Center as its initial [[teaching hospital]]. Then on July 31, 1982, the Foundation inaugurated a 4-storey 180-bed teaching hospital, the University Medical Center.\n\nIn June 1987, ownership and management were acquired by the De La Salle University Inc. In 1992, the college was renamed the De La Salle University College of Medicine and the hospital, the De La Salle University Medical Center. In June 1994, the management of the College of [[Physical Therapy]] which was then part of DLSU-Aguinaldo (now [[De La Salle University - Dasmari\u00f1as|DLSU-D]]) was turned over to the De La Salle University College of Medicine. By June 1995, the complex consisting of the College of Medicine, University Medical Center, College of Physical Therapy, and Research Services was named De La Salle University \u2013 Health Sciences Campus or DLSU-HSC under the ownership and administration of the St. Bro. Miguel Febres Cordero Medical Education Foundation.\n\nIn May 2000, the colleges under the administration of the DLSU-Health Sciences Campus increased with the transfer of the Colleges of [[Radiographer|Medical Radiation Technology]] and [[Nursing]] & [[Midwifery]] (formerly under DLSU-D). Eventually, the institution\u2019s name became De La Salle Health Sciences Institute upon approval of the Board of Trustees in September 2007.\n\nIn January 2018, the term \u201cMedical\u201d was included in the institution's name as granted by the [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|Securities and Exchange Commission]].<ref>{{cite web |title=History |url=http://www.dlshsi.edu.ph/de-la-salle-medical-health-sciences-institute/history |accessdate=30 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2019, DLSMHSI became an official member of the [[ASEAN University Network]]-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) as confirmed by Banjong Ujjin, the Senior Programme Officer of the AUN Secretariat Team.<ref>{{cite web |title=AUN-QA ASSOCIATE MEMBERS |url=http://aun-qa.org/associate/current#4 |website=ASEAN University Network-Quality Assurance (AUN-QA) |accessdate=12 October 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn October 25, 2019, the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] (CHED), granted autonomous status to DLSMHSI through the CHED Memorandum Order No. 12, series of 2019.
