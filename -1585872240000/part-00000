Considered originally a junior synonym of Pachycormus, altrougth the craneal bones suggest a new genus. Among the largest fish found on the formation it is a key fossil on the transition to large filter feeding fishes. Being Coeval with another basal Pachycormiformes show the specialization of the group during the late lower jurassic. Ohmdenia is the sister taxa to group of suspension-feeding Giant Middle-Late Jurassic Fishes (Including the famous [[Leedsichthys]]), showing alterations on its dental structure, with jaw indicates a diet based on soft body prey. Its evolutionary significance is equiparable to that of the genus [[Aetiocetus]] for the modern [[Baleen whale]].<ref>M. Friedmann. 2012.

Considered originally a junior synonym of Pachycormus, altrougth the craneal bones suggest a new genus. Among the largest fish found on the formation it is a key fossil on the transition to large filter feeding fishes. Being Coeval with another basal Pachycormiformes show the specialization of the group during the late lower jurassic. Ohmdenia is the sister taxa to group of suspension-feeding Giant Middle-Late Jurassic Fishes (Including the famous [[Leedsichthys]]), showing alterations on its dental structure, with jaw indicates a diet based on soft body prey. Its evolutionary significance is equiparable to that of the genus [[Aetiocetus]] for the modern [[Baleen whale]].<ref>M. Friedmann. 2012.

The film stars [[Michael Ealy]] and [[Meagan Good]] as a couple who buy a house in the country, only to realize its previous owner ([[Dennis Quaid]]) refuses to let it go. It was released in the United States on May 3, 2019, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] and grossed $36 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nMarried couple Scott ([[Michael Ealy]]) and Annie ([[Meagan Good]]) buy a house in Napa Valley from Charlie Peck ([[Dennis Quaid]]), a deer hunter who claims he lost his wife to cancer two years prior. Charlie tells them he staying at a nearby motel while he waits to leave the state to live with his daughter Cassidy in Florida. \n\nCharlie becomes obsessed with keeping a close eye on the couple, and still sees the house, which he named Foxglove, as his own. He often shows up unannounced; Annie finds Charlie friendly and feels sorry for him, whereas Scott thinks he is annoying and becomes cold toward him. Scott regularly wakes in the night due to hearing creaking and the outside light turning on. Scott's friend Mike also suspects Charlie and is convinced Scott and Annie are being watched. A neighbour reveals to Scott that Charlie's wife killed herself using one of Charlie's guns.\n\nCharlie also develops an obsession with Annie and begins visiting her at home when Scott is at work. One morning while Scott is out jogging, a truck runs into him and drives away, which turns out to be Charlie. While in hospital, Scott asks Mike to do a background check on Charlie and his family, who finds out they were in serious debt and Charlie was forced to sell the house. He also asks Mike to check on Annie while he stays overnight in hospital. Meanwhile Charlie turns up at the house and Annie invites him inside.\n\nMike visits the house and is confronted by Charlie, who declares he has a chance to get back all that he lost but must get rid of Scott first. Charlie then kills Mike with an axe. Meanwhile Scott contacts Cassidy, who has since changed her name; she tells Scott she lives in Maine, and moved away after Charlie killed her mother and made it look like a suicide. She claims he is a \"pathological liar\" and a \"monster\". Scott also speaks with the motel Charlie claimed to be living at, and finds that he has never stayed there.\n\nUpon returning home from the hospital, Scott demands Charlie doesn't visit the house again and files for a restraining order. Later that night while Annie is alone, Charlie appears inside the house. After he leaves she discovers a secret door upstairs leading to an underground cellar where Charlie has been living the whole time, complete with a bed and cooking equipment. Annie also discovers Mike's dead body in the refrigerator. \n\nCharlie learns Annie has found his hiding place and a chase ensues around the house; Charlie prepares to rape Annie as Scott returns home.

The film stars [[Michael Ealy]] and [[Meagan Good]] as a couple who buy a house in the country, only to realize its previous owner ([[Dennis Quaid]]) refuses to let it go. It was released in the United States on May 3, 2019, by [[Sony Pictures Releasing]] and grossed $36 million worldwide.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile Scott and Annie are surveying a [[Napa Valley]] property they are interested in, they notice a deer that is frolicking in the woods near them. Then out of nowhere, a man with a rifle barges past them and kills it.\n\nScott and Annie Howard move into their new house in Napa Valley, but its previous owner, deer killer Charlie Peck, becomes obsessed with keeping an eye on the couple. Though Scott is annoyed, Annie feels sorry for him as he had told them his wife died of cancer and that he will soon be moving to [[Florida]] to live with his daughter. Scott and Annie have their friend Mike and his wife over for dinner. Mike goes outside for a smoke and senses he is being watched. He throws his cigarette on the ground. The next morning when Mike and his wife are leaving, Mike notices a cigarette burn on the seat of his luxury car that wasn't there previously.\n\nCharlie continues to show up unannounced, mowing the lawn and berating workers installing a security system. Mike suspects Charlie and insists that Scott and Annie are being watched. Scott and Annie are unconvinced, so Mike persuades Scott to accompany him behind the house, where they see an unknown vehicle that drives away.\n\nTensions rise between Scott and Annie due to Scott's coldness toward Charlie, and when Annie discovers that Scott met some clients at a bar,it is revealed that before marrying Annie, he had cheated on her with a client at a bar. At the bar, one of the clients kisses Scott, and he realizes that Annie was right to be worried. He returns home immediately but has an argument with Annie. They reconcile after they both wake in the middle of the night from a noise, and have sex on the floor, unaware Charlie is watching. A neighbor reveals to Scott that Charlie's wife killed herself with one of Charlie's shotguns. Scott asks Mike to investigate him. But Charlie has developed an obsession with Annie and begins visiting the home when Scott is gone. One morning, while Scott is out jogging, a truck runs into him from behind, this turns out to be Charlie.\n\nWhile in the hospital, Scott calls Mike to come and see him,when Mike turns up, Scott explains to Mike that Charlie had lived with his wife Ellen and daughter Cassidy, but was deeply in debt and forced to sell the house. Charlie shows up at the house, and Annie invites him inside. Mike goes to check on her and is confronted by Charlie, who declares that he has a chance to get back all that he lost and must get rid of Scott. Charlie kills Mike with an axe.\n\nScott contacts Cassidy, who has changed her name but she hangs up when Scott mentions the house she grew up in. A while later, when Scott is driving home, Cassidy rings back and explains that Charlie killed his wife after she threatened to divorce him and take the house, and she now lives as far away from Charlie as she could get, and if he were ever to show up, she would kill him. Annie discovers Charlie's underground cellar connected to the house, where he has been living and has stored Mike's body. Scott returns home to find Charlie trying to rape Annie, but they fight back and overpower him before seizing his gun with a blow to the head by a baseball bat. Scott says to Annie (who is holding her phone ready to call 911) \"Make the call, just make the call.\" Annie calls the police and tells them, \"My husband has just shot an intruder.\" Charlie screams as a gunshot is heard and then the gun drops to the floor\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Michael Ealy]] as Scott Howard\n* [[Meagan Good]] as Annie Howard\n* [[Dennis Quaid]] as Charlie Peck\n* [[Joseph Sikora]] as Mike\n* Alvina August as Rachael\n* Lee Shorten as Brian\n* [[Erica Cerra]] as Jillian Richards\n* Kurt Evans as Grady Kramer\n* Carolyn Anderson as Ellen\n* Lili Sepe as Cassidy Peck Thompson/Vanessa Smith\n* Raylene Herewood as Ice cream girl\n* Chris Shields as doctor\n* Sam Vincent as first officer\n* Caroline Muthoni Muita as hotel receptionist\n* Connor Mackay as man on ladder\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2018, Ealy, Good and Quaid all signed onto the project.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.blackfilm.com/read/2018/05/dennis-quaid-meagan-good-michael-ealy-and-joseph-sikora-cast-in-deon-taylors-the-intruder/|title=Dennis Quaid, Meagan Good, Michael Ealy and Joseph Sikora Cast In Deon Taylor\u2019s The Intruder|date=May 15, 2018|website=Blackfilm.com|access-date=September 1, 2018}}</ref> It was then announced that the worldwide distribution rights had been acquired by [[Screen Gems]] at the [[2018 Cannes Film Festival]], after production had been completed under the title ''Motivated Seller''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2018/05/the-intruder-dennis-quaid-deon-taylor-meghan-good-michael-ealy-joseph-sikora-screen-gems-1202390258/|title=Screen Gems Lands Deon Taylor Thriller \u2018The Intruder\u2019 \u2013 Cannes|author=Mike Fleming, Jr.|date=May 14, 2018|work=Deadline|access-date=September 1, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://bloody-disgusting.com/movie/3498892/screem-gems-acquires-dennis-quaid-michael-ealy-starring-thriller-intruder/|title=Screem Gems Acquires Dennis Quaid and Michael Ealy-starring Thriller \u2018The Intruder\u2019|author=John Squires|date=May 14, 2018|website=Bloody Disgusting|access-date=September 1, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Release==\n''The Intruder'' was released in the United States on May 3, 2019.

During 2008, ERA's exploration programme identified a very significant mineral resource adjacent to the existing Ranger 3 operating pit. The area, known as Ranger 3 Deeps, is estimated to contain 34 thousand tonnes of contained uranium oxide, and ranks among the world's most significant uranium discoveries in recent years.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2447.asp</ref>\n\n==Ranger 3 Deeps==\nERA is constructing a $120 million Ranger 3 Deeps exploration decline to conduct close spaced underground exploration drilling and explore areas adjacent to the Ranger 3 Deeps resource.  The Ranger 3 Deeps mineralised zone contains an estimated 34,000 tonnes of uranium oxide, and represents one of the most significant recent uranium discoveries world-wide.\n\nIn parallel with the construction of the exploration decline, ERA began a $57 million project to prepare a Prefeasibility Study into the potential development of a Ranger 3 Deeps underground mine.  This Study will determine the economic viability of the project, optimise mining methods, and confirm metallurgical performance and production rates. Environmental studies will also be conducted.

The Independent Surface Water Working Group consisted of representatives from ERA, GAC, the Supervising Scientists Division and the Northern Land Council.\n\nOver a six-month period, the working group examined the impacts, monitoring and reporting of surface water flowing from the Ranger mine.\n\nThe working group agreed in findings released in March 2013 that the current surface water management and regulatory systems in place at the Ranger mine are of a very high standard.<ref>http://www.energyres.com.au/media/38_media_releases_2959.asp</ref>\nGoing forward, the Group has agreed upon an action plan to ensure that surface water management systems at Ranger remain best leading practice.\n\n==Safety breaches and controversy==\n[[Environment Australia]] (an agency of the [[Government of Australia]]) have documented over 200 environmental incidents since 1979.
