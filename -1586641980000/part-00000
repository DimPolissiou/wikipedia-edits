The only statewide elective offices up for election was a [[U.S. Senator from New York]]. Democrat [[Daniel Patrick Moynihan]], with Liberal endorsement, defeated the incumbent Conservative [[James L. Buckley]] who had Republican endorsement. The approximate party strength at this election, as expressed by the vote for U.S. Senator, was: Democrats 3,239,000; Republicans 2,525,000; Conservatives 311,000; Liberals 184,000; Communists 25,000; Socialist Workers 16,000; Libertarians 11,000; and Labor 7,000.\n\nEight of the eleven women members of the previous legislature\u2014State Senators [[Carol Bellamy]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Brooklyn]]; [[Karen Burstein]] (Dem.), a lawyer of [[Lawrence, Nassau County, New York|Lawrence]]; and [[Linda Winikow]] (Dem.), of [[Spring Valley, New York|Spring Valley]]; and Assemblywomen [[Jean Amatucci]] (Dem.), a registered nurse of [[White Lake, New York|White Lake]]; [[Elizabeth Connelly]] (Dem.), of [[Staten Island]]; [[Estella B.

Their role was originally mainly for [[reconnaissance]] purposes. They provided humans with the first available method of elevating themselves well over the [[battle]]field to obtain the proverbial \"birds-eye view.\" They were an early instrument of definitive intelligence collection, and were also particularly useful in the preparation of accurate battlefield maps, before which time this rudimentary craft had led to many a battlefield failure. [[Incendiary balloon]]s also have a long history.\n\n== Kongming lantern ==\n\n[[Kongming lantern]]s were used as military signalling. The lantern was invented in late [[Han dynasty]], when the [[Han dynasty]] chancellor [[Zhuge Liang]] (Kongming) was surrounded by [[Cao Wei|Wei]] dynasty General [[Sima Yi]] at Pinlo, [[Sichuan]].  [[Zhuge Liang]] used paper made \"lanterns\", or hot air balloons, to signal the rescue forces. \nThe [[Kongming lantern]] become a common military signal in [[China]], and it was inherited by the Mongolian troops, seen in the [[Battle of Legnica]].\nFlying the [[Kongming lantern]] is now a civilian festival of memorizing chancellor [[Zhuge Liang]] in the [[Lantern Festival]].\nthey were also used on warm summer and spring days when girls would suck\n.(totally true)\n\n== Early Western balloons ==\n\n=== Early French balloons ===\n\n[[File:Les ballons sortis pendant le Siege de Paris, 1870-1871.jpg|thumb|Balloons escaped from the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)]]]]\nThe first successfully flown balloons were made in [[France]] by the [[Montgolfier brothers]] in 1782\u20131783. They were rigid-style spheres made of [[cotton]] or [[silk]] stretched over a simple light wood frame resembling a large egg. These rigid balloons were held up over a fire so that the smoke billowed well into the cavity of the sphere. It was thought that the [[smoke]] made the balloons rise, but actually it was the hot air of the smoke that caused the elevating. The first decisive use of a balloon for aerial observation was performed by the [[French Aerostatic Corps]] using the aerostat ''l\u2019Entreprenant'' (\"The enterprising one\") at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1794.  The following year, during the [[Siege of Mainz (1795)|Siege of Mainz]] an observation balloon was employed again.  However, the French military use of the balloon did not continue uninterrupted, as in 1799 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] disbanded the French balloon corps.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |first1=Sir Philip |authorlink1=Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |title=The Third Service |year=1955 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=1 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1854, French [[aeronaut]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Godard]] performed several manned balloon demonstrations at the wedding of [[Austria]]n Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. The Emperor was so impressed that he drafted an agreement with the Godard stating that in the event of a war, he would build balloons, organize balloonists companies, and perform observation ascents for the Austrian military. However, in 1859 the French went to [[Second Italian War of Independence|war against the Austrians]], and Godard's observation balloons were used instead by French forces, contributing to a victory for [[Napoleon III]] over Franz Joseph. Godard's aerial reconnaissance balloons were again employed by the French in 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|Siege of Paris]].\n\nDuring the 1900 [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China, the French forces did bring a balloon with them, although there is no record of it ever having been deployed.\n\n===Austrian use at Venice in 1849===\nThe first aggressive use of balloons in warfare took place in 1849.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YSSPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT43 ''Air Power in the Age of Total War''], John Buckley</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WytEDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA355 ''The Future of Drone Use: Opportunities and Threats from Ethical and Legal Perspectives''], Asser Press - Springer, chapter by Alan McKenna, page 355</ref> [[Austrian Empire|Austrian imperial]] forces besieging Venice attempted to float some 200 paper [[hot air balloon]]s each carrying a {{convert|24|-|30|lb|adj=on}} bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city. The balloons were launched mainly from land; however, some were also launched from the side-wheel steamer [[SMS Vulcano|SMS ''Vulcano'']] that acted as a [[balloon carrier]]. The Austrians used smaller pilot balloons to determine the correct fuse settings. At least one bomb fell in the city; however, due to the wind changing after launch, most of the balloons missed their target, and some drifted back over Austrian lines and the launching ship ''Vulcano''.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=7pS1QpH8FRgC&pg=PA9 ''Military Aircraft, Origins to 1918: An Illustrated History of Their Impact''],  Justin D.

This had some of the top balloonists in the country vying for position as chief [[aeronaut]] of a would-be aeronautics division. The scientific community as well showed great support in influencing Washington to consider the use of balloons. Eventually it was Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] who would be awarded the title Chief Aeronaut of the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]].\n\nThe first major-scale use of balloons in the military occurred during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] established and organized by Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]]. Originally, the balloons were inflated with [[coal gas]] from municipal services and then walked out to the battlefield, an arduous and inefficient operation as the balloons had to be returned to the city every four days for re-inflation. Eventually [[hydrogen production|hydrogen gas generators]], a compact system of tanks and copper plumbing, were constructed which converted the combining of iron filings and [[sulfuric acid]] to hydrogen. The generators were easily transported with the uninflated balloons to the field on a standard buckboard. However, this method shortened the life of the balloons, because traces of the sulfuric acid often entered the balloons along with the hydrogen.<ref>\"Encyclopedia of War Machines\" edited by Daniel Bowen.</ref> In all, Lowe built seven balloons that were fit for military service.\n\nThe first application thought useful for balloons was map-making from aerial vantage points, thus Lowe's first assignment was with the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. General [[Irvin McDowell]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], realized their value in aerial reconnaissance and had Lowe, who at the time was using his personal balloon the ''[[Enterprise (balloon)|Enterprise]]'', called up to the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. Lowe also worked as a Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) by directing [[artillery]] fire via flag signals. This enabled gunners on the ground to fire accurately at targets they could not see, a military first.\n\nLowe's first military balloon, the ''Eagle'' was ready by 1 October 1861. It was called into service immediately to be towed to [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], without any gas generator which took longer to build. The trip began after inflation in Washington, D.C. and turned into a <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">12&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(19&nbsp;km)</span>, 12-hour excursion that was upended by a gale-force wind which ripped the [[aerostat]] from its netting and sent it sailing to the coast. Balloon activities were suspended until all balloons and gas generators were completed.\n\nWith his ability to inflate balloons from remote stations, Lowe, his new balloon the ''Washington'' and two gas generators were loaded onto a converted coal barge the ''George Washington Parke Custis''. As he was towed down the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], Lowe was able to ascend and observe the battlefield as it moved inward on the heavily forested peninsula. This would be the military's first claim of an [[aircraft carrier]].\n\nThe Union Army Balloon Corps enjoyed more success in the battles of the [[Peninsula Campaign]] than the Army of the Potomac it sought to support. The general military attitude toward the use of balloons deteriorated, and by August 1863 the Balloon Corps was disbanded.\n\nThe [[Confederate Army]] also made use of balloons, but they were gravely hampered by supplies due to the embargoes. They were forced to fashion their balloons from colored silk dress-making material, and their use was limited by the infrequent supply of gas in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The first balloon \"pilot\" in the Confederate \"air force\" was [[Edward Porter Alexander]].<ref>Michael R. Bradley, It Happened in the Civil War (2002; rev. 2010) pp. 22.</ref>  By the summer of 1863, all balloon reconnaissance of the Civil War had ceased.\n\n==== First balloon assignments ====\n\n[[File:intrepid balloon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Intrepid (balloon aircraft)|''Intrepid'']] being cross-inflated from ''Constitution'' in a mad-dash attempt to get the larger balloon in the air to overlook the imminent [[Battle of Fair Oaks]].]]\n\nThe first assignment for tethered military balloons was given to the Union Army's [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]] for [[mapmaking]], and observation of enemy troops as early as 1750. Up until that point, maps were made from ground level perspectives and their innate inaccuracy led to many a battlefield failure. The aerial perspective ostensibly improved mapmaking, especially when combined with the use of [[photography]].\n\nGeneral [[Irvin McDowell]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], called on the balloon to perform aerial observations of enemy encampments and movements in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. With Lowe's techniques proven to the top commanders, he was eventually tasked to build seven balloons and a series of [[hydrogen]] gas generators to inflate them in the battlefield. Even though Thaddeus Lowe was Chief Aeronaut, his bitter rival [[John La Mountain]] is credited with having made the first aerial observations of intelligence value while stationed independently at [[Fortress Monroe]].\n\nThe balloon, under flight direction of Prof. Lowe, was also used to direct artillery fire from an unseen location onto a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] encampment. The balloon, Eagle, was ascended with tether and telegraph from [[Fort Corcoran]] north of [[Falls Church, Virginia]].  (The use of a telegraph to a balloon was previously successfully tested by Lowe on June 18, 1861.<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton & Company|location=New York|page=184|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n191/mode/1up}}</ref>)  An artillery battery was located at the easterly Camp Advance. With a series of predetermined flag signals, Lowe directed fire onto the Rebel encampment until the shots were landing on target. This first-used concept was the predecessor to the Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) and revolutionized the use of artillery even to modern day.\n\nProf. Lowe was once approached by the young ''Graf'' [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] in 1863, who was at the time acting as a then-civilian observer for the Union Army, about possibly serving as an aerial observer with Lowe, but this was forbidden by Union military authorities during the Civil War years, due to von Zeppelin's then-civilian status.  The future [[rigid airship]] pioneer was instead directed to the camp of John Steiner, a German aeronaut already in the United States, to get his first flight experience in a balloon, which von Zeppelin was able to do at a slightly later time while he still was in the US.\n\n==== The first aircraft carrier ====\n\nBalloons and generators were loaded onto the ''[[USS George Washington Parke Custis]]'', a converted coal barge. The balloons were towed down the [[Potomac River]] and were able to ascend and make observations of the battle front as it moved toward [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. On November 11, 1861, Lowe made the first observations from a balloon based from a ship.  This is the first ever recorded observation from an aerial station by water, essentially the first-ever [[aircraft carrier]] ([[balloon carrier|balloon tender]]).\n\nLowe went on to make observations at [[Battle of Seven Pines|Fair Oaks]], [[Battle of Antietam|Sharpsburg]], [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] before political ambush both from within the military and in [[United States Congress|Congress]] forced him to resign in April 1863 at which point he returned to the private sector. The Balloon Corps all but ceased to exist by August 1863.\n\n==== Confederate ballooning ====\n\nThe Confederates tried their hand at ballooning as well, more only to counter the balloons of the Federals. One type of balloon was a Montgolfier style of a rigid, cotton, \u201chot smoke\u201d balloon. The attempts worked, but their handling techniques were poor at best and the balloon was easily lost and captured by the North.\n\nAnother style is referred to as the \u201csilk dress balloon,\u201d aerostat envelopes made of multicolored dress making silk (not actually silk dresses) which, when gas was available, were used effectively over Richmond. Again, these were easily lost, destroyed or captured, and the lack of supply made it impossible to replace them. They were relieved when the Union Army had discontinued the use of balloons.\n\nThe Confederate Balloon Corps also made use of an aircraft carrier, the [[CSS Teaser]].  The Teaser transported and launched one of the Confederate balloons to several observation positions before being captured by the Union Navy in July 1862.\n\n==== Analysis ====\n\nThe idea of dropping [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] on the enemy was not seriously considered, although there were mechanical drawings made up depicting bomb dropping devices that could be floated aloft by balloons. These depictions were paper theory at best designed by mechanical wizzes with no idea about [[aviation]], in particular, balloons, and all that it takes to successfully launch gas-filled aerostats.\n\nThere were no practical types of [[grenade]]s or bombs to use during the Civil War. Weight was a great factor in determining the size of balloons to be used and the amount of gas they needed to ascend. Carrying heavy ordnance and ungainly mechanisms in balloons would have been out of the question. With the newer, larger and more manageable aerostats, and smaller munitions, the use of bombs would make aerial warfare much more appealing in later days.\n\n=== Paraguayan War ===\n\nIn 1867 during the [[Paraguayan War]], observation balloons were used by [[Brazil]], assisted by the Allen brothers, James and Ezra, after their aerial intelligence pioneering for the Union army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |first1=Sir Philip |authorlink1=Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |title=The Third Service |year=1955 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=2 }}</ref>\n\n=== British ballooning ===\n\nBetween 1862\u201371 efforts by two [[Royal Engineers]] officers, were made to catch the attention of senior British officers to the potential use of balloons. In July 1863 experimental balloon ascents for reconnaissance purposes were conducted by the Royal Engineers on behalf of the [[British Army]], but although the experiments were successful it was considered not worth pursuing further because it was too expensive. However, by 1878 a Balloon Equipment Store was established at [[Woolwich]] by the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\">{{Cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=W.

The British, despite their experience in late 1800s Africa, were behind developments and were still using spherical balloons. These were quickly replaced by versions, commonly referred to as kite balloons, which were flyable and could operate in more extreme weather conditions; at first the German [[August von Parseval|Parseval]]-Siegsfeld type balloon, and then French [[Albert Caquot#The aeronautical engineer|Caquot]] type [[dirigible]]. By World War I, artillery had developed to the point where it was capable of engaging targets beyond the visual range of a ground-based observer. Positioning artillery observers on balloons, generally a few miles behind the front lines and at altitude, allowed them to see targets at greater range than they could on the ground. This allowed the artillery to take advantage of its increased range.<ref name=wfaobs>{{cite web |url=http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-on-land/73-weapons-equipment-uniforms/313-ob-bal-west.html |title=Observation Balloons On The Western Front  |work=[[The Western Front Association]] |date=29 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:German balloon corps LCCN2014691634.jpg|thumb|German Balloon Corps, 1910]]\nBecause of their importance as observation platforms, balloons were defended by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], groups of [[machine guns]] for low altitude defence and patrolling [[fighter aircraft]].

These were a primitive type, where the main part was in a bag suspended from the balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with lines from the harness attached to the main parachute in the bag.  When the balloonist jumped, the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag, with the shroud lines first, followed by the main canopy.

Their role was originally mainly for [[reconnaissance]] purposes. They provided humans with the first available method of elevating themselves well over the [[battle]]field to obtain the proverbial \"birds-eye view.\" They were an early instrument of definitive intelligence collection, and were also particularly useful in the preparation of accurate battlefield maps, before which time this rudimentary craft had led to many a battlefield failure.

[[Zhuge Liang]] used paper made \"lanterns\", or hot air balloons, to signal the rescue forces. \nThe [[Kongming lantern]] become a common military signal in [[China]], and it was inherited by the Mongolian troops, seen in the [[Battle of Legnica]].\nFlying the [[Kongming lantern]] is now a civilian festival of memorizing chancellor [[Zhuge Liang]] in the [[Lantern Festival]].\n\n== Early Western balloons ==\n\n=== Early French balloons ===\n\n[[File:Les ballons sortis pendant le Siege de Paris, 1870-1871.jpg|thumb|Balloons escaped from the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u20131871)]]]]\nThe first successfully flown balloons were made in [[France]] by the [[Montgolfier brothers]] in 1782\u20131783. They were rigid-style spheres made of [[cotton]] or [[silk]] stretched over a simple light wood frame resembling a large egg. These rigid balloons were held up over a fire so that the smoke billowed well into the cavity of the sphere. It was thought that the [[smoke]] made the balloons rise, but actually it was the hot air of the smoke that caused the elevating. The first decisive use of a balloon for aerial observation was performed by the [[French Aerostatic Corps]] using the aerostat ''l\u2019Entreprenant'' (\"The enterprising one\") at the [[Battle of Fleurus (1794)|Battle of Fleurus]] in 1794.  The following year, during the [[Siege of Mainz (1795)|Siege of Mainz]] an observation balloon was employed again.  However, the French military use of the balloon did not continue uninterrupted, as in 1799 [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]] disbanded the French balloon corps.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |first1=Sir Philip |authorlink1=Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |title=The Third Service |year=1955 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=1 }}</ref>\n\nIn 1854, French [[aeronaut]] [[Eug\u00e8ne Godard]] performed several manned balloon demonstrations at the wedding of [[Austria]]n Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]. The Emperor was so impressed that he drafted an agreement with the Godard stating that in the event of a war, he would build balloons, organize balloonists companies, and perform observation ascents for the Austrian military. However, in 1859 the French went to [[Second Italian War of Independence|war against the Austrians]], and Godard's observation balloons were used instead by French forces, contributing to a victory for [[Napoleon III]] over Franz Joseph. Godard's aerial reconnaissance balloons were again employed by the French in 1870 during the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and the [[Siege of Paris (1870\u201371)|Siege of Paris]].\n\nDuring the 1900 [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China, the French forces did bring a balloon with them, although there is no record of it ever having been deployed.\n\n===Austrian use at Venice in 1849===\nThe first aggressive use of balloons in warfare took place in 1849.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=YSSPAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT43 ''Air Power in the Age of Total War''], John Buckley</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=WytEDQAAQBAJ&pg=PA355 ''The Future of Drone Use: Opportunities and Threats from Ethical and Legal Perspectives''], Asser Press - Springer, chapter by Alan McKenna, page 355</ref> [[Austrian Empire|Austrian imperial]] forces besieging Venice attempted to float some 200 paper [[hot air balloon]]s each carrying a {{convert|24|-|30|lb|adj=on}} bomb that was to be dropped from the balloon with a time fuse over the besieged city.

This had some of the top balloonists in the country vying for position as chief [[aeronaut]] of a would-be aeronautics division. The scientific community as well showed great support in influencing Washington to consider the use of balloons. Eventually it was Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]] who would be awarded the title Chief Aeronaut of the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]].\n\nThe first major-scale use of balloons in the military occurred during the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] with the [[Union Army Balloon Corps]] established and organized by Prof. [[Thaddeus S. C. Lowe]]. Originally, the balloons were inflated with [[coal gas]] from municipal services and then walked out to the battlefield, an arduous and inefficient operation as the balloons had to be returned to the city every four days for re-inflation. Eventually [[hydrogen production|hydrogen gas generators]], a compact system of tanks and copper plumbing, were constructed which converted the combining of iron filings and [[sulfuric acid]] to hydrogen. The generators were easily transported with the uninflated balloons to the field on a standard buckboard. However, this method shortened the life of the balloons, because traces of the sulfuric acid often entered the balloons along with the hydrogen.<ref>\"Encyclopedia of War Machines\" edited by Daniel Bowen.</ref> In all, Lowe built seven balloons that were fit for military service.\n\nThe first application thought useful for balloons was map-making from aerial vantage points, thus Lowe's first assignment was with the [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]]. General [[Irvin McDowell]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], realized their value in aerial reconnaissance and had Lowe, who at the time was using his personal balloon the ''[[Enterprise (balloon)|Enterprise]]'', called up to the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. Lowe also worked as a Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) by directing [[artillery]] fire via flag signals. This enabled gunners on the ground to fire accurately at targets they could not see, a military first.\n\nLowe's first military balloon, the ''Eagle'' was ready by 1 October 1861. It was called into service immediately to be towed to [[Lewinsville, Virginia]], without any gas generator which took longer to build. The trip began after inflation in Washington, D.C. and turned into a <span style=\"white-space:nowrap\">12&nbsp;mile&nbsp;(19&nbsp;km)</span>, 12-hour excursion that was upended by a gale-force wind which ripped the [[aerostat]] from its netting and sent it sailing to the coast. Balloon activities were suspended until all balloons and gas generators were completed.\n\nWith his ability to inflate balloons from remote stations, Lowe, his new balloon the ''Washington'' and two gas generators were loaded onto a converted coal barge the ''George Washington Parke Custis''. As he was towed down the [[Potomac River|Potomac]], Lowe was able to ascend and observe the battlefield as it moved inward on the heavily forested peninsula. This would be the military's first claim of an [[aircraft carrier]].\n\nThe Union Army Balloon Corps enjoyed more success in the battles of the [[Peninsula Campaign]] than the Army of the Potomac it sought to support. The general military attitude toward the use of balloons deteriorated, and by August 1863 the Balloon Corps was disbanded.\n\nThe [[Confederate Army]] also made use of balloons, but they were gravely hampered by supplies due to the embargoes. They were forced to fashion their balloons from colored silk dress-making material, and their use was limited by the infrequent supply of gas in [[Richmond, Virginia]]. The first balloon \"pilot\" in the Confederate \"air force\" was [[Edward Porter Alexander]].<ref>Michael R. Bradley, It Happened in the Civil War (2002; rev. 2010) pp. 22.</ref>  By the summer of 1863, all balloon reconnaissance of the Civil War had ceased.\n\n==== First balloon assignments ====\n\n[[File:intrepid balloon.jpg|thumb|200px|right|[[Intrepid (balloon aircraft)|''Intrepid'']] being cross-inflated from ''Constitution'' in a mad-dash attempt to get the larger balloon in the air to overlook the imminent [[Battle of Fair Oaks]].]]\n\nThe first assignment for tethered military balloons was given to the Union Army's [[Corps of Topographical Engineers]] for [[mapmaking]], and observation of enemy troops as early as 1750. Up until that point, maps were made from ground level perspectives and their innate inaccuracy led to many a battlefield failure. The aerial perspective ostensibly improved mapmaking, especially when combined with the use of [[photography]].\n\nGeneral [[Irvin McDowell]], commander of the [[Army of the Potomac]], called on the balloon to perform aerial observations of enemy encampments and movements in the [[First Battle of Bull Run]]. With Lowe's techniques proven to the top commanders, he was eventually tasked to build seven balloons and a series of [[hydrogen]] gas generators to inflate them in the battlefield. Even though Thaddeus Lowe was Chief Aeronaut, his bitter rival [[John La Mountain]] is credited with having made the first aerial observations of intelligence value while stationed independently at [[Fortress Monroe]].\n\nThe balloon, under flight direction of Prof. Lowe, was also used to direct artillery fire from an unseen location onto a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] encampment. The balloon, Eagle, was ascended with tether and telegraph from [[Fort Corcoran]] north of [[Falls Church, Virginia]].  (The use of a telegraph to a balloon was previously successfully tested by Lowe on June 18, 1861.<ref>{{cite book|title=Appletons' annual cyclopaedia and register of important events of the year: 1862|year=1863|publisher=D. Appleton & Company|location=New York|page=184|url=https://archive.org/stream/1862appletonsan02newyuoft#page/n191/mode/1up}}</ref>)  An artillery battery was located at the easterly Camp Advance. With a series of predetermined flag signals, Lowe directed fire onto the Rebel encampment until the shots were landing on target. This first-used concept was the predecessor to the Forward Artillery Observer (FAO) and revolutionized the use of artillery even to modern day.\n\nProf. Lowe was once approached by the young ''Graf'' [[Ferdinand von Zeppelin]] in 1863, who was at the time acting as a then-civilian observer for the Union Army, about possibly serving as an aerial observer with Lowe, but this was forbidden by Union military authorities during the Civil War years, due to von Zeppelin's then-civilian status.  The future [[rigid airship]] pioneer was instead directed to the camp of John Steiner, a German aeronaut already in the United States, to get his first flight experience in a balloon, which von Zeppelin was able to do at a slightly later time while he still was in the US.\n\n==== The first aircraft carrier ====\n\nBalloons and generators were loaded onto the ''[[USS George Washington Parke Custis]]'', a converted coal barge. The balloons were towed down the [[Potomac River]] and were able to ascend and make observations of the battle front as it moved toward [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]]. On November 11, 1861, Lowe made the first observations from a balloon based from a ship.  This is the first ever recorded observation from an aerial station by water, essentially the first-ever [[aircraft carrier]] ([[balloon carrier|balloon tender]]).\n\nLowe went on to make observations at [[Battle of Seven Pines|Fair Oaks]], [[Battle of Antietam|Sharpsburg]], [[Battle of Vicksburg|Vicksburg]] and [[Battle of Fredericksburg|Fredericksburg]] before political ambush both from within the military and in [[United States Congress|Congress]] forced him to resign in April 1863 at which point he returned to the private sector. The Balloon Corps all but ceased to exist by August 1863.\n\n==== Confederate ballooning ====\n\nThe Confederates tried their hand at ballooning as well, more only to counter the balloons of the Federals. One type of balloon was a Montgolfier style of a rigid, cotton, \u201chot smoke\u201d balloon. The attempts worked, but their handling techniques were poor at best and the balloon was easily lost and captured by the North.\n\nAnother style is referred to as the \u201csilk dress balloon,\u201d aerostat envelopes made of multicolored dress making silk (not actually silk dresses) which, when gas was available, were used effectively over Richmond. Again, these were easily lost, destroyed or captured, and the lack of supply made it impossible to replace them. They were relieved when the Union Army had discontinued the use of balloons.\n\nThe Confederate Balloon Corps also made use of an aircraft carrier, the [[CSS Teaser]].  The Teaser transported and launched one of the Confederate balloons to several observation positions before being captured by the Union Navy in July 1862.\n\n==== Analysis ====\n\nThe idea of dropping [[Ammunition#Ordnance ammunition|ordnance]] on the enemy was not seriously considered, although there were mechanical drawings made up depicting bomb dropping devices that could be floated aloft by balloons. These depictions were paper theory at best designed by mechanical wizzes with no idea about [[aviation]], in particular, balloons, and all that it takes to successfully launch gas-filled aerostats.\n\nThere were no practical types of [[grenade]]s or bombs to use during the Civil War. Weight was a great factor in determining the size of balloons to be used and the amount of gas they needed to ascend. Carrying heavy ordnance and ungainly mechanisms in balloons would have been out of the question. With the newer, larger and more manageable aerostats, and smaller munitions, the use of bombs would make aerial warfare much more appealing in later days.\n\n=== Paraguayan War ===\n\nIn 1867 during the [[Paraguayan War]], observation balloons were used by [[Brazil]], assisted by the Allen brothers, James and Ezra, after their aerial intelligence pioneering for the Union army.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |first1=Sir Philip |authorlink1=Philip Joubert de la Fert\u00e9 |title=The Third Service |year=1955 |publisher=Thames and Hudson |location=London |page=2 }}</ref>\n\n=== British ballooning ===\n\nBetween 1862\u201371 efforts by two [[Royal Engineers]] officers, were made to catch the attention of senior British officers to the potential use of balloons. In July 1863 experimental balloon ascents for reconnaissance purposes were conducted by the Royal Engineers on behalf of the [[British Army]], but although the experiments were successful it was considered not worth pursuing further because it was too expensive. However, by 1878 a Balloon Equipment Store was established at [[Woolwich]] by the [[Royal Engineers]].<ref name=\"Fitzgerald\">{{Cite journal|last=Fitzgerald|first=W.

The British, despite their experience in late 1800s Africa, were behind developments and were still using spherical balloons. These were quickly replaced by versions, commonly referred to as kite balloons, which were flyable and could operate in more extreme weather conditions; at first the German [[August von Parseval|Parseval]]-Siegsfeld type balloon, and then French [[Albert Caquot#The aeronautical engineer|Caquot]] type [[dirigible]]. By World War I, artillery had developed to the point where it was capable of engaging targets beyond the visual range of a ground-based observer. Positioning artillery observers on balloons, generally a few miles behind the front lines and at altitude, allowed them to see targets at greater range than they could on the ground. This allowed the artillery to take advantage of its increased range.<ref name=wfaobs>{{cite web |url=http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-on-land/73-weapons-equipment-uniforms/313-ob-bal-west.html |title=Observation Balloons On The Western Front  |work=[[The Western Front Association]] |date=29 June 2008}}</ref>\n\n[[File:German balloon corps LCCN2014691634.jpg|thumb|German Balloon Corps, 1910]]\nBecause of their importance as observation platforms, balloons were defended by [[Anti-aircraft warfare|anti-aircraft guns]], groups of [[machine guns]] for low altitude defence and patrolling [[fighter aircraft]].  Attacking a balloon was a risky venture but some pilots relished the challenge.  The most successful were known as [[balloon busters]], including such notables as Belgium's [[Willy Coppens]], Germany's [[Friedrich Ritter von R\u00f6th]], America's [[Frank Luke]], and the Frenchmen [[L\u00e9on Bourjade]], [[Michel Coiffard]] and [[Maurice Boyau]]. Many expert balloon busters were careful not to go below {{convert|1000|ft|m}} in order to avoid exposure to anti-aircraft guns and machine-guns.\n\n[[File:Airships past and present, together with chapters on the use of balloons in connection with meteorology, photography and the carrier pigeon (1908) (14595639219).jpg|thumb|Prussian Balloon Corps Barracks at Tegel]]\nWorld War I observation crews were the first to use parachutes, long before they were adopted by fixed wing aircrews. These were a primitive type, where the main part was in a bag suspended from the balloon, with the pilot only wearing a simple body harness around his waist, with lines from the harness attached to the main parachute in the bag.  When the balloonist jumped, the main part of the parachute was pulled from the bag, with the shroud lines first, followed by the main canopy. This type of parachute was first adopted by the Germans and then later by the British and French for their observation balloon crews.<ref name=wfaobs/>\n\nObservation balloons began to be used at sea for anti-submarine purposes towards the end of World War I.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/onipubno46.htm |title=Kite Balloons in Escorts |work=[[Naval History and Heritage Command]]}}</ref>\n\nThe idiom \"The balloon's going up!\" as an expression for impending battle is derived from the very fact that an observation balloon's ascent likely signaled a preparatory bombardment for an offensive.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.grammar-monster.com/sayings_proverbs/balloon_has_gone_up.htm |title=What Is the Origin of the Saying \"Once the Balloon Has Gone Up\"? |work=Grammar Monster}}</ref>\n\n== World War II ==\n\n{{expand section|date=December 2010}}\n[[Barrage balloon]]s, widely known as \"blimps,\" were used by the United Kingdom to intercept air attacks by German bombers and [[V1 flying bomb|V-1 cruise missile]]s.\n\nJapan used recently discovered [[jet stream|high-altitude air currents]] to send [[fire balloon]]s (or ''fu-go'') carrying explosive payloads to the United States. About 300 made it across the Pacific, causing some property damage and at least six deaths. The US government called for a press blackout on all balloon incidents, fearing what might happen if the Japanese started using fu-go to deliver biological weapons.\n\nBritain used free balloons in a number of ways including [[Operation Outward]] which launched nearly 100,000 small balloons to drop incendiaries on German occupied Europe or to trail wires to short out electrical distribution cables.\n\nBalloons also were used at sea, particularly by the [[K-class blimp|US Navy for anti-submarine work]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.naval-airships.org/resources/documents/NAN_vol93_no2_KShips_feature.pdf |title=K-Ships Across the Atlantic |work=Naval Aviation News |volume=93 |date=Spring 2011 |pages=20\u201323 |journal= |access-date=2014-11-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217071129/http://naval-airships.org/resources/documents/NAN_vol93_no2_KShips_feature.pdf |archive-date=2015-02-17 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nThe [[Red Army]] of the Soviet Union used Observation Balloons for artillery spotting. 8 \"Aeronautical Sections\" existed and 19,985 observation flights were performed by balloonists of the Red Army during the war, clocking up 20,126 flight hours. 110 Soviet Observation Balloons were lost.\n\n== Postwar ==\n\n[[File:Blimp over Nangarhar -a.jpg|thumb|right|Observation balloon over Afghanistan, 2011]]\n{{expand section|date=April 2013}}\n\nThe US military developed high-altitude ballooning programs for nuclear detection and surveillance, such as [[Project Mogul]] (linked to the [[Roswell Incident]]), [[Project Genetrix]] and [[Project Moby Dick]].\n\nThey also worked on the [[E77 balloon bomb]], refining the principles of the Japanese [[fire balloon]] explosive-delivery system.\n\n[[Aerostats]] have been used by US and coalition military forces in [[Iraq War|Iraq]] and in [[War in Afghanistan (2001\u2013present)|Afghanistan]].<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/08/19/AR2009081903712.html |title=High-Tech Balloon to Help Forces Keep Watch |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=20 August 2009}}</ref>\n\nBalloons are used to gather intelligence and patrol above Israel's borders. What really makes the balloons stand out is their ability to remain in the sky for long periods of time. A balloon doesn't require constant refuelling like an aircraft does, and therefore is able to supply a constant source of intelligence on a target or a suspected area. If there's an area not visible from the ground, these surveillance balloons can reach a height and cover ground that may be difficult to detect from below.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOW0SM2fpB0</ref>\n\n== Future of military ballooning ==\n\n{{expand section|date=March 2011}}\n\n* A [[DARPA]] project explores the possibility of using balloons as non-line-of-sight communication relay among ground units and between ground units and aircraft.<ref>http://www.military.com/NewContent/0,13190,Defensewatch_072105_Helms,00.html</ref>\n* As of 2013, military researchers are investigating lighter-than-air craft for carrying cargo and, possibly, troops in the [[Integrated Sensor is Structure]] (ISIS) and [[Long Endurance Multi-intelligence Vehicle]] (LEMV) programs.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Balloon (aircraft)]]\n* [[Balloon campaigns in Korea]]\n* [[Fire balloon]] \u2013 History of balloon bombs launched by [[Japan]] against the [[United States]] in [[World War II]]\n* [[Operation Outward]] \u2013 [[United Kingdom|British]] World War II programme to attack [[Germany]] by means of free-flying balloons\n* [[Observation balloon]]\n* [[Espionage balloon]]\n* [[Barrage balloon]]\n* [[Union Army Balloon Corps]]\n* [[Aerial warfare]] \u2013 Section under American Civil War\n* [[Thaddeus S.
