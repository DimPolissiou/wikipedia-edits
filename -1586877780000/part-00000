In the summer of 2003, Lundin Petroleum sold its working interest in [[Block 5A, South Sudan|Block 5A]] to [[Petronas]] Carigali for US$142.5 million. In 1998 the company discovered the En Naga North and West field in southern part of the [[Sirte Basin]], [[Libya]]. After a successful appraisal program in 1998 and 1999 the field was declared. The commercial and development program commenced. Development included the construction of a central production facility, 100&nbsp;km pipeline together with the drilling of 20 production, 15 injector and 15 water supply wells. Recoverable reserves were estimated to be approximately {{convert|100|e6oilbbl|e6m3|abbr=off|lk=on}} of [[oil equivalent]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions.

Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction.

This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector.

It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "text_old": "'''T2K''' ('''[[T\u014dkai, Ibaraki|Tokai]] to [[Kamioka, Gifu|Kamioka]]''') is a [[particle physics]] experiment studying the [[neutrino oscillations|oscillations]] of the [[accelerator neutrinos]].

the proton beam line before target to generate neutrino beam]]\nT2K uses a muon neutrino or muon antineutrino [[accelerator neutrino|beam]] produced at the [[J-PARC]] facility using a proton beam gradually accelerated to 30 GeV by a system of three [[particle accelerator|accelerators]]: first to 400 MeV energy by the Linac linear accelerator, then up to 3 GeV by the RCS (Rapid Cycle Synchrotron), and finally up to 30 GeV by the MR [[synchrotron]] (Main Ring). [[Proton]]s collide with a [[graphite]] target, producing [[meson]]s, mainly [[pion]]s and [[kaon]]s, which are then focused by a set of three [[magnetic horn]]s and directed into a tunnel called the decay volume. Depending on the horns polarity, either positive or negative particles are focused. Positive pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon+}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}}, forming a muon neutrino beam, while negative pions and kaons decay mainly into {{SubatomicParticle|Muon-}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Muon antineutrino}}, forming a muon antineutrino beam. All remaining [[hadron]]s and charged [[lepton]]s are stopped by a 75-ton block of graphite (so-called beam dump) and in the ground, while neutrinos travel underground towards the far detector.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===Off-axis beam===\n\nT2K is the first experiment in which the concept of off-axis [[accelerator neutrino|neutrino beam]] was realized. The neutrino beam at J-PARC is designed so that it can be directed 2 to 3 [[degree (angle)|degrees]] away from the [[Super-Kamiokande]] far detector and one of the near detectors, ND280. The off-axis angle was chosen to 2.5\u00b0 to maximize the probability of oscillation at a distance corresponding to the far detector, which for 295&nbsp;km is maximal for around 600&nbsp;MeV neutrinos. In this neutrino energy range, the dominant type of neutrino interactions are charged current quasielastic interactions, for which it is possible to reconstruct the energy of the interacting neutrino only on the basis of the momentum and direction of the produced charged lepton. The higher neutrino energies are suppressed by the off-axis configuration, decreasing the number of interactions with meson production, which are background in the oscillation analysis in the T2K experiment.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref name=\"t2kflux\">{{cite journal |author=T2K Collaboration |title=T2K neutrino flux prediction |journal=Physical Review D |date=2 January 2013 |volume=87 |issue=1 |pages=012001 |doi=10.1103/physrevd.87.012001|arxiv=1211.0469|bibcode=2013PhRvD..87a2001A }}</ref>\n\n==Near detectors==\n\nThe near detector complex<ref name=\"t2knim\"/> is located at a distance of 280 meters from the graphite target. Its purpose is to measure the neutrino flux before oscillations and to study neutrino interactions. The system consists of three main detectors:\n* INGRID detector (Interactive Neutrino GRID) located on the axis of the neutrino beam,\n* ND280 detector located 2.5\u00b0 away from the beam axis, i.e. at the same angle as the far detector.\n* Wagasci-BabyMIND is a magnetised neutrino detector located at 1.5\u00b0 off-axis angle, built to explore the energy spectrum variation with the off-axis angle and cross-sections at higher average neutrino energy.\n\n===Signal readout===\n\nExcept for the [[Time Projection Chamber]]s in ND280, the entire active material (enabling particle tracking) of the near detectors is [[plastic]] [[scintillator]]. The light produced by traversing particles in the plastic scintillator bars and planes is collected by [[wavelength shifter|wavelength-shifting]] [[optical fiber|fibres]] and detected by Hamamatsu [[Silicon photomultiplier|Multi-pixel photon counters]] located at one or both ends of the fibres. Scintillator bars are organised into layers, where bars in two neighbouring layers are perpendicular to each other providing together 3D information about traversing particles.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===INGRID detector===\n\nThe main purpose of the INGRID detector is the monitoring of the direction and intensity of the beam on a daily basis by direct detection of neutrino interactions. The INGRID detector consists of 16 identical modules arranged in the shape of a cross, 7 in a vertical and 7 in a horizontal arm, plus 2 modules outside the cross. Height and width of the arms are 10 meters. A single module consists of alternating layers of iron and a plastic scintillator. An additional 4 veto layers of the scintillator surround the module on the sides to distinguish particles entering from the outside from those produced by interactions inside the module. The total mass of iron in one module is 7.1 tons and constitutes 96% of the module weight. On the neutrino beam axis, in the middle of the cross between the vertical and horizontal arm, there is an additional module built only from layers of the plastic scintillator (Proton Module) with a mass of 0.55 tons. Its purpose is to register quasielastic interactions and compare the obtained results with the simulations.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\n===ND280 detector===\n\n[[File:J-PARC T2K ND280 Pit.jpg|thumb|ND280 under construction]]\nThe ND280 detector is used to measure the flux, energy spectrum and electron neutrino beam pollution for the same off-axis angle as for the far detector. ND280 also investigates various types of muon and electron neutrino and antineutrino interactions. All this allows estimating the expected number and type of interactions in the far detector, reducing the systematic error in the neutrino oscillations analysis associated with models of neutrino interactions and flux.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nND280 is composed of the set of inner sub-detectors: Pi-Zero detector and a tracker with 2 Fine-Grained Detectors interleaved with 3 Time Projection Chambers, placed inside of a metal frame called a basket.

By comparison of the amount of interaction between modes with and without water in the bags, it is possible to extract the number of neutrino interactions occurring on the water - the target material inside the far detector Super-Kamiokande.\nThe size of the entire active P0D volume is around 2.1 m \u00d7 2.2 m \u00d7 2.4 m (X\u00d7Y\u00d7Z) and its mass with and without water is 15.8 and 12.9 tons respectively.\n\nThe main goal of the Pi-Zero Detector is measurement neutral [[pion]]s production in [[neutral current]] neutrino interactions on water:\n: {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} + N\u2019 + {{SubatomicParticle|Pion0}}\nThis reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions because photons from pi0 decay can be mis-reconstructed as an electron in the Super-Kamiokande detector, thus this reaction can mimic electron neutrino interactions and constitute an important background in electron neutrino appearance measurement.\n<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=S|last1=Assylbekov|first2=B E|last2=Berger|display-authors=1 |title=The T2K ND280 off-axis pi\u2013zero detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=September 2012 |volume=686 |pages=48\u201363 |doi=10.1016/j.nima.2012.05.028|arxiv=1111.5030|bibcode=2012NIMPA.686...48A}}</ref>\n\n====Time projection chambers====\n\nThree [[time projection chamber]]s (TPCs) are gas-tight rectangular boxes, with a cathode plane in the centre and readout [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules at both sides parallel to the cathode.

It detects a [[cone]] of [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov light]] emitted by charged particles moving in water faster than light in this medium.\nIts goal is to measure [[muon]]s and [[electron]]s produced in [[charged current]] quasielastic interactions (CCQE) of {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}}, respectively. Due to relatively large mass, muons usually do not change their direction and thus produce a well-defined cone of Cherenkov light observed by PMTs as a clear, sharp ring. In contrast, electrons, because of smaller mass, are more susceptible to scattering and almost always produce electromagnetic [[particle shower|showers]], observed by PMTs as a ring with fuzzy edges. Neutrino energy is calculated based on the direction and energy of a charged [[lepton]] produced in the CCQE interaction. In this way, {{SubatomicParticle|Muon neutrino}} and {{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} spectra are determined, leading to the measurement of the [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] parameters relevant for muon neutrino disappearance and electron neutrino appearance.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/><ref>{{cite journal |author=The Super-Kamiokande Collaboration |title=The Super-Kamiokande detector |journal=Nuclear Instruments and Methods in Physics Research Section A: Accelerators, Spectrometers, Detectors and Associated Equipment |date=April 2003 |volume=501 |issue=2\u20133 |pages=418\u2013462 |doi=10.1016/S0168-9002(03)00425-X|bibcode=2003NIMPA.501..418F }}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\nT2K is a successor of the KEK to Kamioka ([[K2K experiment|K2K]]) experiment, which ran from 1999 till 2004.

Construction of the entire INGRID detector and majority of the ND280 detector (without barrel part of the electromagnetic calorimeter) was completed in 2009. The missing part of the calorimeter was installed in the fall of 2010. T2K far detector is the large Super-Kamiokande detector, which has been running since 1996 and studying [[proton lifetime]] and oscillations of [[atmospheric neutrino|atmospheric]], [[solar neutrino|solar]] and [[accelerator neutrino|accelerator]] neutrinos.<ref name=\"t2knim\"/>\n\nT2K experiment started to take neutrino data for a physics analysis in January 2010, initially with an incomplete ND280 detector, and starting from November 2010 with the full setup. The data taking was interrupted for one year by the [[Great Tohoku Earthquake]] in March 2011. The proton beam power, and thus the neutrino beam intensity, was constantly growing, reaching by February 2020 the power of 515&nbsp;kW and a total number of accumulated protons on target of 3.64\u00d710<sup>21</sup> protons <ref>{{cite web |title=T2K experiment official page - T2K Run 10 |url=https://t2k-experiment.org/2020/02/t2k-run-10-ended-with-record-beam-power/}}</ref> with 55% of data in neutrino-mode and 45% in antineutrino-mode.\n\n==Future plans==\n\nThe T2K experiment is expected to operate in the current form until the end of 2020. In 2021 a major upgrade of the neutrino beamline and the ND280 near detector will be performed.

Achievement of these goals requires reduction of the statistical and systematic errors, and thus a significant upgrade of the beamline and the ND280 detector, as well as improvements in the software and analysis methods.<ref name=\"upgradeproposal\"/>\n\n====Beam upgrade====\n\nThe beam upgrade plan requires one year long shut down of the [[J-PARC]] Main Ring [[particle accelerator|accelerator]] in 2021, followed by a constant gradual increase of the [[proton]] [[particle beam|beam]] power until the start of the HK experiment. The beam power should reach 750&nbsp;kW in 2022 and then grow to 1.3 MW by 2029.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration and J-PARC Neutrino Facility Group |title=J-PARC Neutrino Beamline Upgrade Technical Design Report |date=14 August 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1908.05141}}</ref>\n\nIn February 2020, the proton beam power reached 515&nbsp;kW with 2.7x10<sup>14</sup> protons per pulse and with 2.48 seconds between pulses (so-called repetition cycle). To reach 750&nbsp;kW, the repetition cycle will be reduced to 1.32 s with 2.0x10<sup>14</sup> protons per pulse, while for 1.3 MW the repetition cycle has to be further decreased to 1.16 s and the number of protons per pulse has to increase to 3.2x10<sup>14</sup>. In addition to increasing the primary proton beam power, the current in the [[magnetic horn|horns]] focusing secondary particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, etc.) with a chosen [[electric charge]] will also be increased from 250 kA to 320 kA. This will increase the amount of right-sign neutrinos (neutrinos in the neutrino mode beam and anti-neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by 10%, and reduce the amount of wrong-sign neutrinos (anti-neutrinos in the neutrino-mode beam and neutrinos in the anti-neutrino mode beam) by around 5-10%.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\">{{cite journal |last1=Friend |first1=M |title=J-PARC accelerator and neutrino beamline upgrade programme |journal=Journal of Physics: Conference Series |date=September 2017 |volume=888 |issue=1 |pages=012042 |doi=10.1088/1742-6596/888/1/012042 |bibcode=2017JPhCS.888a2042F |language=en |issn=1742-6588|doi-access=free }}</ref>\n\nReduction of the repetition cycle will require a series of hardware upgrades, including a major upgrade of the Main Ring [[power supply|power supplies]] and a minor upgrade of the focusing horn power supplies, all of which will be installed during the long shutdown in 2021. Increasing the horn current will require using an additional (third) horn power supply. Meanwhile, the higher proton beam power demands enhancement of the [[cooling]] capacity of the secondary beamline components such as the [[graphite]] target, the magnetic horns and the beam dump, as well as disposal of a larger amount of irradiated cooling water.<ref name=\"beamupgradetdr\"/><ref name=\"beamupgradeprogramme\"/>\n\n====ND280 Upgrade====\n\nThe current design of the ND280 detector is optimized for the detection and reconstruction of forward-going [[lepton]]s ([[muon]]s and [[electron]]s), but it also has a number of limitations, like low reconstruction efficiency of particles produced almost perpendicular and backward w.r.t. the direction of the interacting [[neutrino]], as well as too high momentum threshold to reconstruct a large part of produced pions and knocked-out nucleons (protons and neutrons). In Charged Current Quasi-Elastic (CCQE) interactions, the dominating interaction in the ND280 near detector, kinematics of produced lepton is enough in the reconstruction of the incoming neutrino energy. However, other types of neutrino interactions in which additional particles ([[pion]]s, [[kaon]]s, [[nucleon]]s) were lost, may be mis-reconstructed as CCQE and introduce a [[Bias (statistics)|bias]] in the reconstructed neutrino energy spectrum. Thus, it is essential to optimize the detector to be sensitive to additional particles and [[Nuclear structure|nuclear effects]].\n\nThree main measures need to be taken to address these issues:\n* The detector needs to efficiently detect the nucleons in the final state of neutrino interactions. For this, the detection thresholds need to be lowered.\n* High-angle and backwards-going tracks must be well-reconstructed. This is achieved by increasing the angular acceptance and the efficiency of the discrimination backward from forward going tracks using timing information.\n* Finally, the total fiducial volume (the mass available for neutrino interactions) of the tracker part of the ND280 detector, characterising with a better reconstruction ability, needs to be enlarged in order to increase the rate of neutrino interactions.\n\nThe Upgrade of the ND280 detector (ND280 Upgrade) addresses these requirements by replacing a part of the P0D sub-detector with three types of new sub-detectors. The existing downstream part, consisting of two Fine-Grained scintillation Detectors (FGDs) and three Time Projection Chambers (TPCs), will maintain their sandwiched structure and continue to detect forward going leptons and high momentum hardons. The upstream part which now hosts the P0D sub-detector will be replaced by three novel sub-detectors: a scintillating 3D target (Super Fine-Grained Detector or SuperFGD), two new TPCs on top and below the SuperFGD (High-Angle TPCs or HATPCs), and six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the new structure. Each of these sub-detectors is briefly described below.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\">{{cite arxiv |author=T2K Collaboration|title=T2K ND280 Upgrade - Technical Design Report |date=11 January 2019 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1901.03750}}</ref>\n\n=====SuperFGD=====\n\nThe SuperFGD is a 2m x 2m x 0.5m detector consisting of approximately 2 million 1&nbsp;cm<sup>3</sup> [[scintillator|scintillating]] [[polystyrene]] [[cube]]s. The cubes are woven with a series of [[optical fiber|optical fibres]] designed to detect the light emitted by the particles produced during the interactions in the target. Unlike the current FGDs, the SuperFGD has a three-fold projective 2D readouts providing a quasi-3D readout. This readout configuration increases the detection of short tracks almost uniformly in all directions. Due to its geometry and coupled with the TOF and the HATPCs, the SuperFGD has the capability to detect fast-neutrons, which could be useful in the reconstruction of the [[antineutrino]] energy.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====HATPC=====\n\nThe High Angle [[Time Projection Chamber]]s (HATPCs) will surround the SuperFGD in the plane perpendicular to the incoming neutrino beam. Their design is similar to that of the existing TPCs, as they both use the [[MicroMegas detector|MicroMegas]] modules technology for track reconstruction. The main novel feature of the HATPCs, aside from their high angle coverage, is the use of the resistive MicroMegas technology. The latter consists of applying a layer of [[Electrical resistance and conductance|resistive]] material to increase the charge-sharing capabilities of the MicroMegas modules. This reduces the number of readout channels and allows for a spatial resolution which is as good as the one in the current TPCs.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====TOF=====\n\nThe six Time-of-Flight (TOF) detectors surrounding the HATPCs and SuperFGD are a series of [[plastic]] [[scintillator]] layer detectors designed to identify the particle direction sense through the measurement of the [[time of flight]] for each crossing track with a timing resolution of the order of 600 ps. The capability to determine track direction sense has been proven in the actual ND280 to be critical to reduce background generated outside the active inner detectors.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n=====Impact on Neutrino Oscillation Physics=====\n\nThe impact the ND280 Upgrade will have on the analyses at T2K is two-fold. Firstly, an increase in statistics thanks to the 2 ton SuperFGD target will allow to nearly double the amount of data in certain samples.  Secondly and more relevant, the new configuration will allow for better detection of additional final state particles: high angle particles thanks to the increased angular acceptance, and less-energetic particles because of lower detection thresholds. This detector acceptance improvement is important to cover almost the same phase space available at the far detector (SK). In addition, final state particles will allow probing nuclear effects which are essential for constraining the systematic effects of the oscillation analysis. It is an important step as well in the transition to using semi-inclusive or exclusive models in neutrino oscillation physics, as opposed to current inclusive models which use only the final state lepton in their predictions.<ref name=\"nd280upgradetdr\"/>\n\n===Hyper-Kamiokande experiment===\n\n{{main|Hyper-Kamiokande}}\n\nThe successor of the T2K experiment, the [[Hyper-Kamiokande]] (HK) experiment, will use the upgraded system of the currently used accelerator and neutrino beamline and upgraded set of the near detector. Apart from that, a new far detector, the Hyper-Kamiokande detector, and possibly also a new intermediate detector will be built. Part of the beam related upgrade works and the upgrade of the ND280 detector will be performed yet before the start of phase II of the T2K experiment. The HK experiment is expected to start operation around the year 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\">{{cite news|url=http://www.j-parc.jp/c/en/topics/2020/02/12000416.html|title=The Hyper-Kamiokande project is officially approved.|date=12 February 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |author=Hyper-Kamiokande Proto-Collaboraion |title=Physics potential of a long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiment using a J-PARC neutrino beam and Hyper-Kamiokande |journal=Progress of Theoretical and Experimental Physics |date=19 May 2015 |volume=2015 |issue=5 |pages=53C02\u20130 |doi=10.1093/ptep/ptv061 |arxiv=1502.05199|bibcode=2015PTEP.2015e3C02A }}</ref>\n\n====Hyper-Kamiokande detector====\n\nThe Hyper-Kamiokande detector will be a [[water]] [[Cherenkov radiation|Cherenkov]] detector, 5 times larger (258 kton of water) than the [[Super-Kamiokande]] detector. It will be a [[cylinder]] of 74 meters diameter and 60 meter height with 40000 [[photomultiplier]] tubes of 50&nbsp;cm diameter and 6700 photomultiplier tubes of 20&nbsp;cm diameter. It will be located 8&nbsp;km south from the Super-Kamiokande detector in the Tochibora mine, 650 meters under the peak of Nijuugo mountain, at the same off-axis angle (2.5\u00b0) to the neutrino beam centre and in the same distance (295&nbsp;km) from the beam production place at [[J-PARC]]. The start of the HK detector construction is planned for 2020 and the start of data collection is expected in 2027.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/><ref name=\"hyperkstart\"/>\n\n====Intermediate Water Cherenkov====\n\nThe Intermediate Water Cherenkov Detector (IWCD) will be located at a distance of 0.7\u20132&nbsp;km from the neutrino production place. It would be a cylinder filled with water of 10 m diameter and 50 m height with a 10 m tall structure instrumented with around 3000 photomultiplier tubes of a 20&nbsp;cm diameter. The structure will be moved in a vertical direction by a crane system, providing measurements of neutrino interactions at different off-axis angles, spanning from 1\u00b0 to 4\u00b0, and thus for different energy spectra.\nCombining the results from different off-axis angles it is possible to extract the results for nearly monochromatic neutrino spectrum without relying on theoretical models of neutrino interactions to reconstruct neutrino energy. Usage of the same type of detector as the far detector with almost the same angular and momentum acceptance allows comparing results from these two detectors without relying on detectors response simulations. These two facts, independence from the neutrino interaction and detector response models, will enable to minimise systematic error in the oscillation analysis. Additional advantages of such a design of the detector is a possibility to search for [[sterile neutrino|sterile]] [[neutrino oscillation|oscillation]] pattern for different off-axis angles and to obtain a cleaner sample of [[electron neutrino]] interaction, whose fraction is larger for the larger off-axis angle.<ref name=\"hyperk\"/>{{rp|47\u201350}}<ref>{{cite arxiv |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Letter of Intent to Construct a nuPRISM Detector in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |date=13 December 2014 |class=physics.ins-det |eprint=1412.3086}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=nuPRISM Collaboration |title=Proposal for the NuPRISM Experiment in the J-PARC Neutrino Beamline |url=https://j-parc.jp/researcher/Hadron/en/pac_1607/pdf/P61_2016-17.pdf |date=7 July 2016}}</ref>\n\nIt is planned that the IWCD will be finalised in 2024 and will start to take data from 2025, yet before launching the HK experiment.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Yoshida |first1=Tomoyo |title=J-PARC E61 experiment |url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/531125/contributions/2858586/attachments/1604730/2545546/4_J-PARC_E61_experiment.pdf |publisher=Lake Louise Winter Institute |date=21 February 2018}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Kamioka Observatory]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.t2k-experiment.org/ Official T2K site]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20040130175750/http://www.phys.washington.edu/~superk/ Super-Kamiokande]\n\n{{Breakthrough Prize laureates}}\n{{Neutrino detectors}}\n\n[[Category:Accelerator neutrino experiments]]\n[[Category:Science and technology in Japan]]\n[[Category:CERN experiments]]\n", "name_user": "Batmann", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200ePhysics program:typo", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T2K_experiment"}

{"title_page": "Examples of feudalism", "text_new": "{{More citations needed|date=March 2008}}\n'''Examples of feudalism''' are helpful to fully understand [[feudalism]] and [[feudal society]]. Feudalism was practiced in many different ways, depending on location and time period, thus a high-level encompassing conceptual definition does not always provide a reader with the intimate understanding that detailed historical examples provide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Western European Feudalism==\n===12th century England===\n\nFeudalism in 12th century [[England]] was among the better structured and established in Europe at the time. However, it could be structurally complex, which is illustrated by the example of the [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] of [[Stafford]] as described in a survey  of knight's fees made in 1166 and recorded in ''The [[Black Book of the Exchequer]]''. This  was a  roll of parchment or several such,  recording the quantity and tenant of each knight's fee held ''in capite''. It was a record commissioned by the [[Treasury]] as the knight's fee was the primary basis for assessing certain types of taxation, for example, feudalism is the exchange of land for military service, thus everything was based on what was called the [[knight's fee]], which is a fiefdom or [[Estate (law)|estate of land]]. A [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] contained several knight's fees, for example the baron   [[Robert de Stafford|Robert of Stafford]] held a barony containing   60 knight's fees. Often lords were not so much lords presiding over great estates, but managers of a network of tenants and sub-leases.\n\nStafford tenants were themselves [[lord of the manor|lords of the manors]] they held from him, which is altogether different from their being [[English feudal barony|barons]]. Henry d'Oilly, who held 3 fees from Robert of Stafford, also held, as a [[tenant-in-chief]], over 30 fees elsewhere that had been granted to him directly by the king. Thus while Henry was the vassal of his overlord Robert, Henry was himself a lord of his own manors held [[Tenant-in-chief|''in capite'']] and [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] many of his manors which he did not keep [[Demesne|in demesne]], that is to say under his own management using simple employees. It would  also have been possible and not uncommon for a situation where Robert of Stafford was a vassal of Henry elsewhere, creating the condition of mutual lordship/vassalage between the two.  These complex relationships invariably created loyalty problems through conflicts of interests. To resolve this the concept of a [[liege lord]] existed, which meant that the vassal was loyal to his liege lord above all others, except the king himself,  no matter what. However, even this sometimes broke down when a vassal would pledge himself to more than one liege lord.\n\nFrom the perspective of the smallest land holder, multiple networks of tenancy were layered on the same small plot of land. A chronicle of the time says \"different lordships lay on the land in different respects\". Each tenant laid claim to a certain aspect of the service from the land.\n\n===11th century France===\nAmong the complexities of feudal arrangements, there existed no guarantee that contracts between [[lord]] and [[vassal]] would be honored, and feudal contracts saw little enforcement from those with greater authority. This often resulted in the wealthier and more powerful party taking advantage of the weaker.\n\nSuch was (allegedly) the case of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] and his relations with his lord [[William V of Aquitaine]]. Between 1020 and 1025 Hugh wrote or possibly dictated a complaint against William and his vassals describing the unjust treatment he had received at the hands of both. Hugh describes a convoluted intermingling of loyalties that was characteristic of the period and instrumental in developing strain between nobles that resulted in competition for each other's land. According to Hugh's account, William wronged him on numerous occasions, often to the benefit of William's vassals. Many of his properties suffered similar fates: seized by opponents and divided between them and William. William apparently neglected to send military aid to Hugh when necessary and dealt most unfairly in the exchange of [[hostage]]s. Each time Hugh reclaimed one of his properties, William ordered him to return it to whomever had recently taken it from him. William broke multiple [[oath]]s in succession yet Hugh continued to put faith in his lord's word, to his own ruin. In his last contract with William, over possession of his uncle's castle at Chiza, Hugh dealt in no uncertain terms and with frank language:\n\n<blockquote>'''Hugh''': You are my lord, I will not accept a pledge from you, but I will simply rely on the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': Give up all those claims over which you have quarreled with me in the past and swear fidelity to me and my son and I will give you your uncle's honor [Chizes] or something else of equal value in exchange for it.<br />\n'''Hugh''': My lord, I beg you through God and this blessed crucifix which is made in the figure of Christ that you do not make me do this if you and your son were intending to threaten me with trickery.<br />\n'''William''': On my honor and my son I will do this without trickery.<br />\n'''Hugh''': And when I shall have sworn fidelity to you, you will demand Chizes castle of me, and if I should not turn it over to you, you will say that it is not right that I deny you the castle which I hold from you, and if I should turn it over to you, you and your son will seize it because you have given nothing in pledge except the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': We will not do that, but if we should demand it of you, don't turn it over to us.<ref name=\"Agreements Between Lord and Vassal\">Geary, P 2010, ''Readings in Medieval History, Fourth Edition'', University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile perhaps an embellishment of the truth for the sake of Hugh's cause, and not necessarily a microcosm of the feudal system everywhere, the ''Agreement Between Lord and Vassal'' is evidence at least of corruption in feudal rule.\n\n===Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n\n===Portugal===\nPortugal, originally a part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], was an example of a [[feudal society]], according to [[Marc Bloch]].<ref name=PortugalBloch/>\n\nPortugal has its roots in a feudal state in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[County of Portugal]], established in 868 within the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. The [[V\u00edmara Peres]], the local counts dynasty, was suppressed in 1071, but twenty two years later, in 1093, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alphonse VI of L\u00e9on and Castille]] gave the county as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] (a younger [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] who was participating in the [[reconquista]]), when he married [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]], the king's natural daughter.\n\nIn spite of their [[vassal]] link, Henry had a remarkable autonomy, especially after his father-in law's death in 1109. The [[The establishment of the monarchy in Portugal|Portuguese independence]] was obtained by his son, [[Afonso I of Portugal]] when, after defeating the Muslims at the [[Battle of Ourique]], proclaimed himself [[Kings of portugal|King of Portugal]] in 1139, cutting definitively all feudal bonds with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. Upon seeing the weakness of feudal society due to the Muslim invasion, Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n as Castile had done a century earlier.<ref name=PortugalBloch>[[Marc Bloch]], ''Feudal Society Vol.2'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd</ref>\n\n===North American colonies===\n\nSemi-feudal systems accompanied [[colonialism]] in some European settlements in North America:\n* [[Patroon]] system in [[New Netherland]], which lasted until the [[Anti-Rent War]] and the [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1846|New York Constitution of 1846]]\n* [[Seigneurial system of New France]] (now Canada), which was abolished in 1854 under British rule, though transitional rent payments persisted until 1970\n\n==\"Semi-feudal\" (non-Western European) feudalism==\nOutside of a medieval European historical context, the concept of feudalism is generally used by analogy (called '''semi-feudal'''), most often in discussions of [[Japan]] under the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'', and, sometimes, nineteenth-century [[Ethiopia]]. However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing it in places as diverse as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], [[Indian feudalism|India]], and the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860)|American South of the nineteenth century]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\n{{Main|Pronoia}}\n[[Pronoia]], the 11th-century system of land grants in the [[Byzantine empire]], makes a useful contrast to feudal tenure in the European West. Another distinction between the European West can be made in that paroiki (people who lived and farmed on the land of the Pronoiars) owed no debt or loyalty to the pronoiars (the recipients of the Pronoia).<ref name=\"Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900-1200\">Harvey, Allen (1989) Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900\u20131200 pp.1\u201313</ref> This system was adopted by [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the fall of the Byzantine Empire at their hands, which called their land grants ''[[timar]]'' and the recipients of the land grants \"[[timariots]]\".\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Muscovite Manorialism}}\nIn contrast to Western [[Europe]] where feudalism created a strong central power, it took a strong central power to develop feudalism in Russia. A lack of true central power weakened and doomed the Russians to outside domination. The Russians developed its system of land/lord/worker, loosely called feudalism, after it had created a strong central power. Lacking a feudal system of [[vassal]] loyalty made it impossible for any prince, early on, to gain enough influence and power to project a strong force against any invaders.\n\nIn contrast to other European forms of [[serfdom]] and [[feudalism]] there was a lack of vassalage and loyalty to the lord whose land the serfs worked. It took a much longer period of time for feudalism to develop but when it did it took on a much harsher form than elsewhere in Europe. Serfs had no rights whatsoever; they could be traded like livestock by their lords. They had no ownership of anything, including their own families, all of which belonged to their lord.\n\nAnother major difference was the lack of independent principalities; this was due to the lack of vassalage. As separate lords did not command their own troops to protect their own lands.<ref name=\"Blum\">Blum, Jerome, Lord and Peasant in Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961</ref>\n\n===Armenia===\n{{Main|Nakharar}}\nThe [[Nakharar]] system used by the [[Armenian nobility]] throughout [[Medieval Armenia]] has often been described as feudal, with hereditary houses of nobles owning large estates, each headed by its own [[tanuter]], and with the estates themselves divided amongst the family. For Armenia as a whole, a [[Sparapet]] (supreme commander), King, and chief [[Aspet]] were each taken from individual noble houses. However, Armenian feudalism differs from the feudalism of most of Europe as the estates were owned by families, not lords, and could not be split or given without the family's permission. Also, if a [[tanuter]] died heirless, he was succeeded by a different branch of the family, rather than by a noble who was sworn to him. [[Cilician Armenia]], through contact with [[crusader state]]s, had a system even closer to western feudalism.

Originally the system was introduced in the pre-colonial period to collect taxes from peasants, and it continued during colonial British rule. After independence Zamindari was abolished in [[India]] and East Pakistan (present day [[Bangladesh]]), but it is still present today in [[Pakistan]]. In modern times historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models and today it is rare for Zamindari to be described as feudal by academics; it still done in popular usage, however, but only for pejorative reasons to express disfavour, typically by critics of the system.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Feudalism in China}}\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] is officially a [[Communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist society and state]], based on ''[[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]]'' under a [[people's democratic dictatorship]],<!-- citations available via wikilinks --> and attempts have been made by Marxist academics to record China's history in the PRC.<ref>{{cite web|title=In China, Feudal Answers for Modern Problems|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/opinion/yu-in-china-feudal-answers-for-modern-problems.html|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Feudalism is the model that modern Chinese Marxists and [[Tokyo school]] historians use to identify China's recent past, [[Neologism|neologized]] from the Chinese concept of ''[[fengjian]]''<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\" /> (which means to allocate a region or piece of land to an individual, establishing him as the ruler of that region<ref>{{cite book|last=Levenson, Schurmann|first=Joseph, Franz|title=China-An Interpretive History: From the Beginnings to the Fall of Han|url=https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Regents of the University of California|location=London, England|isbn=0-520-01440-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve/page/34 34\u201336]}}</ref>), a term used to designate the multi-state which existed in China under the [[Zhou dynasty]], and was eradicated by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]],<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Brook|author2=Gregory Blue|title=China and Historical Capitalism: Genealogies of Sinological Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFF94exLscC&pg=PA136|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52591-6|page=136|ref=harv}}</ref> by which time the [[state of Qin]] had conquered all other states and established the [[Qin dynasty|first China-wide empire]]. After [[King Wu of Zhou]] defeated the [[Shang dynasty]], he created five hereditary ranks; \u516c ''g\u014dng'', \u4faf ''h\u00f3u'', \u4f2f ''b\u00f3'', \u5b50 ''z\u01d0'' and \u7537 ''n\u00e1n'', commonly translated as Duke, Marquis, Earl (or Count), Viscount and Baron. However, unlike their Western European equivalents, the titles often indicated more in the way of perceived nobility rather than amount of land possessed. For example, the Lords of the eventually huge states of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] were known as \"Earls\" and \"Viscounts\", while the Lord of [[Song (state)|Song]] was given the title of \"Duke\" on the merits of his descent from the previous Shang royal lineage, rather than his level of power.  Ancient Chinese texts can sometimes cause confusion as it was also considered to be polite to address rulers as ''g\u014dng'' regardless of their actual rank. As the Zhou dynasty's control weakened, the regional magnates caused further title inflation by referring to themselves as Kings; the inflation was such that under the [[Han dynasty]], many local lords were established with the title of \"king\"; in imperial China, the character is thus more normally rendered as \"prince\".\n\nThe [[Zhou Dynasty]] can be seen as a true feudal system as it is in many respects very similar to the system used in [[Medieval Europe]].<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Zhou Dynasty|url=http://www.chinaeducenter.com/en/whychina/zhou.php|website=China Education Center Limited|accessdate=17 September 2015}}</ref> Each lord was given land, and his power was legitimised by nominal allegiance to the central Zhou king; politics thus revolved around these noble households. In fact, the notion of \"prime minister\" \u592a\u5bb0 in ancient Chinese came from the feudal time meaning the \"chief housekeeper\" or \"butler\" of the noble household, in a similar way to the development of such European titles as \"[[constable]]\". Each feudal state was governed independently with taxes, currency and laws set by each individual household, but the nobles were required to pay regular homage to the Zhou Kings as an act of [[fealty]]. At the time of war the nobles were required to provide armed service to the King.  Approaching the end of the [[Zhou dynasty]], the power of the King dwindled while the power of the nobles had risen.

In theory, this meant that the land was held under [[The Crown]] as ultimate feudal superior. Historically, [[The Crown]] would make a grant of land in return for military or other services and the grantees would in turn make sub-grants for other services and so on. Those making grants \u2013 the \"superiors\" \u2013 retained a legal interest in the land (\"dominium directum\"), and so a hierarchical structure was created with each property having a number of owners, co-existing simultaneously. Only one of these, the [[vassal]], has what in normal language would be regarded as ownership of the property (\"dominium utile\").\n\nIn the 18th century, peasants were dispossessed of the land to which they were bonded.<ref>[[Thomas Douglas Selkirk]] (1805) ''[https://archive.org/details/observationsonp00selkgoog Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland]'' pp.31\u201354,</ref>\n\nThe [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] abolished the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland and replaced it with a system of outright ownership of land.

The right of feudal superiors to enforce conditions was ended, subject to certain saving provisions of a restricted nature.

Feudalism was practiced in many different ways, depending on location and time period, thus a high-level encompassing conceptual definition does not always provide a reader with the intimate understanding that detailed historical examples provide.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}\n\n==Western European Feudalism==\n===12th century England===\n\nFeudalism in 12th century [[England]] was among the better structured and established in Europe at the time. However, it could be structurally complex, which is illustrated by the example of the [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] of [[Stafford]] as described in a survey  of knight's fees made in 1166 and recorded in ''The [[Black Book of the Exchequer]]''. This  was a  roll of parchment or several such,  recording the quantity and tenant of each knight's fee held ''in capite''. It was a record commissioned by the [[Treasury]] as the knight's fee was the primary basis for assessing certain types of taxation, for example, feudalism is the exchange of land for military service, thus everything was based on what was called the [[knight's fee]], which is a fiefdom or [[Estate (law)|estate of land]]. A [[English feudal barony|feudal barony]] contained several knight's fees, for example the baron   [[Robert de Stafford|Robert of Stafford]] held a barony containing   60 knight's fees. Often lords were not so much lords presiding over great estates, but managers of a network of tenants and sub-leases.\n\nStafford tenants were themselves [[lord of the manor|lords of the manors]] they held from him, which is altogether different from their being [[English feudal barony|barons]]. Henry d'Oilly, who held 3 fees from Robert of Stafford, also held, as a [[tenant-in-chief]], over 30 fees elsewhere that had been granted to him directly by the king. Thus while Henry was the vassal of his overlord Robert, Henry was himself a lord of his own manors held [[Tenant-in-chief|''in capite'']] and [[subinfeudation|sub-enfeoffed]] many of his manors which he did not keep [[Demesne|in demesne]], that is to say under his own management using simple employees. It would  also have been possible and not uncommon for a situation where Robert of Stafford was a vassal of Henry elsewhere, creating the condition of mutual lordship/vassalage between the two.  These complex relationships invariably created loyalty problems through conflicts of interests. To resolve this the concept of a [[liege lord]] existed, which meant that the vassal was loyal to his liege lord above all others, except the king himself,  no matter what. However, even this sometimes broke down when a vassal would pledge himself to more than one liege lord.\n\nFrom the perspective of the smallest land holder, multiple networks of tenancy were layered on the same small plot of land. A chronicle of the time says \"different lordships lay on the land in different respects\". Each tenant laid claim to a certain aspect of the service from the land.\n\n===11th century France===\nAmong the complexities of feudal arrangements, there existed no guarantee that contracts between [[lord]] and [[vassal]] would be honored, and feudal contracts saw little enforcement from those with greater authority. This often resulted in the wealthier and more powerful party taking advantage of the weaker.\n\nSuch was (allegedly) the case of [[Hugh IV of Lusignan|Hugh de Lusignan]] and his relations with his lord [[William V of Aquitaine]]. Between 1020 and 1025 Hugh wrote or possibly dictated a complaint against William and his vassals describing the unjust treatment he had received at the hands of both. Hugh describes a convoluted intermingling of loyalties that was characteristic of the period and instrumental in developing strain between nobles that resulted in competition for each other's land. According to Hugh's account, William wronged him on numerous occasions, often to the benefit of William's vassals. Many of his properties suffered similar fates: seized by opponents and divided between them and William. William apparently neglected to send military aid to Hugh when necessary and dealt most unfairly in the exchange of [[hostage]]s. Each time Hugh reclaimed one of his properties, William ordered him to return it to whomever had recently taken it from him. William broke multiple [[oath]]s in succession yet Hugh continued to put faith in his lord's word, to his own ruin. In his last contract with William, over possession of his uncle's castle at Chiza, Hugh dealt in no uncertain terms and with frank language:\n\n<blockquote>'''Hugh''': You are my lord, I will not accept a pledge from you, but I will simply rely on the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': Give up all those claims over which you have quarreled with me in the past and swear fidelity to me and my son and I will give you your uncle's honor [Chizes] or something else of equal value in exchange for it.<br />\n'''Hugh''': My lord, I beg you through God and this blessed crucifix which is made in the figure of Christ that you do not make me do this if you and your son were intending to threaten me with trickery.<br />\n'''William''': On my honor and my son I will do this without trickery.<br />\n'''Hugh''': And when I shall have sworn fidelity to you, you will demand Chizes castle of me, and if I should not turn it over to you, you will say that it is not right that I deny you the castle which I hold from you, and if I should turn it over to you, you and your son will seize it because you have given nothing in pledge except the mercy of God and yourself.<br />\n'''William''': We will not do that, but if we should demand it of you, don't turn it over to us.<ref name=\"Agreements Between Lord and Vassal\">Geary, P 2010, ''Readings in Medieval History, Fourth Edition'', University of Toronto, Toronto.</ref></blockquote>\n\nWhile perhaps an embellishment of the truth for the sake of Hugh's cause, and not necessarily a microcosm of the feudal system everywhere, the ''Agreement Between Lord and Vassal'' is evidence at least of corruption in feudal rule.\n\n===Holy Roman Empire===\n{{Main|Feudalism in the Holy Roman Empire}}\n\n===Portugal===\nPortugal, originally a part of the [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n]], was an example of a [[feudal society]], according to [[Marc Bloch]].<ref name=PortugalBloch/>\n\nPortugal has its roots in a feudal state in northern [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]], the [[County of Portugal]], established in 868 within the [[Kingdom of Asturias]]. The [[V\u00edmara Peres]], the local counts dynasty, was suppressed in 1071, but twenty two years later, in 1093, King [[Alfonso VI of Castile|Alphonse VI of L\u00e9on and Castille]] gave the county as a [[fiefdom]] to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] (a younger [[Capetian dynasty|Capet]] who was participating in the [[reconquista]]), when he married [[Theresa, Countess of Portugal|Theresa]], the king's natural daughter.\n\nIn spite of their [[vassal]] link, Henry had a remarkable autonomy, especially after his father-in law's death in 1109. The [[The establishment of the monarchy in Portugal|Portuguese independence]] was obtained by his son, [[Afonso I of Portugal]] when, after defeating the Muslims at the [[Battle of Ourique]], proclaimed himself [[Kings of portugal|King of Portugal]] in 1139, cutting definitively all feudal bonds with the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n. Upon seeing the weakness of feudal society due to the Muslim invasion, Portugal became independent from the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n as Castile had done a century earlier.<ref name=PortugalBloch>[[Marc Bloch]], ''Feudal Society Vol.2'', Routledge & Kegan Paul Ltd</ref>\n\n===North American colonies===\n\nSemi-feudal systems accompanied [[colonialism]] in some European settlements in North America:\n* [[Patroon]] system in [[New Netherland]], which lasted until the [[Anti-Rent War]] and the [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1846|New York Constitution of 1846]]\n* [[Seigneurial system of New France]] (now Canada), which was abolished in 1854 under British rule, though transitional rent payments persisted until 1970\n\n==\"Semi-feudal\" (non-Western European) feudalism==\nOutside of a medieval European historical context, the concept of feudalism is generally used by analogy (called '''semi-feudal'''), most often in discussions of [[Japan]] under the ''[[sh\u014dgun]]s'', and, sometimes, nineteenth-century [[Ethiopia]]. However, some have taken the feudalism analogy further, seeing it in places as diverse as [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Parthia|Parthian empire]], [[Indian feudalism|India]], and the [[History of the Southern United States#Antebellum Era (1781\u20131860)|American South of the nineteenth century]].\n\n===Byzantine Empire===\n{{Main|Pronoia}}\n[[Pronoia]], the 11th-century system of land grants in the [[Byzantine empire]], makes a useful contrast to feudal tenure in the European West. Another distinction between the European West can be made in that paroiki (people who lived and farmed on the land of the Pronoiars) owed no debt or loyalty to the pronoiars (the recipients of the Pronoia).<ref name=\"Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900-1200\">Harvey, Allen (1989) Economic Expansion in the Byzantine Empire, 900\u20131200 pp.1\u201313</ref> This system was adopted by [[Kingdom of Serbia (medieval)|Serbia]] and then the [[Ottoman Empire]] after the fall of the Byzantine Empire at their hands, which called their land grants ''[[timar]]'' and the recipients of the land grants \"[[timariots]]\".\n\n===Russia===\n{{Main|Muscovite Manorialism}}\nIn contrast to Western [[Europe]] where feudalism created a strong central power, it took a strong central power to develop feudalism in Russia. A lack of true central power weakened and doomed the Russians to outside domination. The Russians developed its system of land/lord/worker, loosely called feudalism, after it had created a strong central power. Lacking a feudal system of [[vassal]] loyalty made it impossible for any prince, early on, to gain enough influence and power to project a strong force against any invaders.\n\nIn contrast to other European forms of [[serfdom]] and [[feudalism]] there was a lack of vassalage and loyalty to the lord whose land the serfs worked. It took a much longer period of time for feudalism to develop but when it did it took on a much harsher form than elsewhere in Europe. Serfs had no rights whatsoever; they could be traded like livestock by their lords. They had no ownership of anything, including their own families, all of which belonged to their lord.\n\nAnother major difference was the lack of independent principalities; this was due to the lack of vassalage. As separate lords did not command their own troops to protect their own lands.<ref name=\"Blum\">Blum, Jerome, Lord and Peasant in Russia. Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1961</ref>\n\n===Armenia===\n{{Main|Nakharar}}\nThe [[Nakharar]] system used by the [[Armenian nobility]] throughout [[Medieval Armenia]] has often been described as feudal, with hereditary houses of nobles owning large estates, each headed by its own [[tanuter]], and with the estates themselves divided amongst the family. For Armenia as a whole, a [[Sparapet]] (supreme commander), King, and chief [[Aspet]] were each taken from individual noble houses. However, Armenian feudalism differs from the feudalism of most of Europe as the estates were owned by families, not lords, and could not be split or given without the family's permission. Also, if a [[tanuter]] died heirless, he was succeeded by a different branch of the family, rather than by a noble who was sworn to him. [[Cilician Armenia]], through contact with [[crusader state]]s, had a system even closer to western feudalism.

Originally the system was introduced in the pre-colonial period to collect taxes from peasants, and it continued during colonial British rule. After independence Zamindari was abolished in [[India]] and East Pakistan (present day [[Bangladesh]]), but it is still present today in [[Pakistan]]. In modern times historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models and today it is rare for Zamindari to be described as feudal by academics; it still done in popular usage, however, but only for pejorative reasons to express disfavour, typically by critics of the system.\n\n===China===\n{{Main|Feudalism in China}}\nThe [[People's Republic of China]] is officially a [[Communist state|Marxist\u2013Leninist society and state]], based on ''[[Socialism with Chinese Characteristics]]'' under a [[people's democratic dictatorship]],<!-- citations available via wikilinks --> and attempts have been made by Marxist academics to record China's history in the PRC.<ref>{{cite web|title=In China, Feudal Answers for Modern Problems|url=http://mobile.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/opinion/yu-in-china-feudal-answers-for-modern-problems.html|accessdate=2 January 2016}}</ref> Feudalism is the model that modern Chinese Marxists and [[Tokyo school]] historians use to identify China's recent past, [[Neologism|neologized]] from the Chinese concept of ''[[fengjian]]''<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\" /> (which means to allocate a region or piece of land to an individual, establishing him as the ruler of that region<ref>{{cite book|last=Levenson, Schurmann|first=Joseph, Franz|title=China-An Interpretive History: From the Beginnings to the Fall of Han|url=https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve|url-access=registration|year=1969|publisher=Regents of the University of California|location=London, England|isbn=0-520-01440-5|pages=[https://archive.org/details/chinainterpretiv00leve/page/34 34\u201336]}}</ref>), a term used to designate the multi-state which existed in China under the [[Zhou dynasty]], and was eradicated by the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]],<ref name=\"BrookBlue2002\">{{cite book|author1=Timothy Brook|author2=Gregory Blue|title=China and Historical Capitalism: Genealogies of Sinological Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rAFF94exLscC&pg=PA136|date=5 September 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-52591-6|page=136|ref=harv}}</ref> by which time the [[state of Qin]] had conquered all other states and established the [[Qin dynasty|first China-wide empire]].

However, unlike their Western European equivalents, the titles often indicated more in the way of perceived nobility rather than amount of land possessed. For example, the Lords of the eventually huge states of [[Qin (state)|Qin]] and [[Chu (state)|Chu]] were known as \"Earls\" and \"Viscounts\", while the Lord of [[Song (state)|Song]] was given the title of \"Duke\" on the merits of his descent from the previous Shang royal lineage, rather than his level of power.

However, scholars have pointed out key differences that make the comparison contested and only limited evidence from that period is available for study.<ref>Childs, Geoff. 2003. \"Polyandry and population growth in a Historical Tibetan Society\", History of the Family, pp.423\u2013428</ref> Scholar Geoff Samuel further argued that Tibet even in the early 20th century did not constitute a single state but rather a collection of districts and a legal system of [[Lhasa]] with particular land and tax laws did not extend over the entire country.<ref name=\"TibetSamuel\">Samuel, Geoffrey (Feb., 1982) ''Tibet as a Stateless Society and Some Islamic Parallels'' The Journal of Asian Studies, Vol. 41, No. 2, pp. 215\u2013229</ref>\nHowever, according to [[Melvyn Goldstein]], for the 20th century, the Tibetan political system can not be categorized as feudal.<ref>Melvyn Goldstein, On the Nature of Tibetan Peasantry, The Tibet journal, Vol, XIII, n 1, 1988, 61\u201365 Citation : \"I did not argue in the paper in question that the Tibetan political system of the 20th century should be categorized as a feudal system, and in fact, have specifically rejected that argument in dissertation and in a later paper in which I argued that Tibet possessed a centralized type of state.\"</ref>\n\n===Japan===\nThe [[Tokugawa shogunate]] was a feudal military dictatorship of Japan established in the 17th century lasting until 1868. It marks a period often referred to loosely as 'feudal Japan', otherwise known as the [[Edo period]]. While modern historians have become very reluctant to classify other societies into European models, in Japan, the system of land tenure and a vassal receiving tenure in exchange for an oath of [[fealty]] is very close to what happened in parts of medieval Europe, and thus the term is sometimes used in connection with Japan.<ref>John Whitney Hall, \"Feudalism in Japan\u2014a reassessment,\" ''Comparative studies in Society and History'' (1962) 5#1 pp: 15\u201351 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/177767 in JSTOR]</ref>  Friday notes that in the 21st century, historians of Japan rarely invoke feudalism; instead of looking at similarities, specialists attempting comparative analysis concentrate on fundamental differences.<ref>Karl Friday,  \"The Futile Paradigm: In Quest of Feudalism in Early Medieval Japan,\" ''History Compass'' 8.2 (2010): 179\u2013196.</ref>\n\n==Modern traces of feudalism==\n===Scotland===\nScots law is quite different from English law. One scholar explained it in 1924 as following: \n:It is a law of Roman and feudal origin which has been adapted in the course of eight centuries by legislation and by judicial decisions to the needs of the Scottish people, and during the last century has, little by little, been combining with the English law by a slow operation of fusion.<ref>H L\u00e9vy-Ullmann \"The Law of Scotland\" (1925) 37 ''Juridical Review'' 370-91, quoted in Hector MacQueen, \"Private Law, National Identity and the Case of Scotland\" (2012) p 12 [http://www.glasgowsciencefestival.org.uk/media/media_247741_en.pdf online]{{Dead link|date=December 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nThe system of land tenure in Scotland was until recently feudal in nature. In theory, this meant that the land was held under [[The Crown]] as ultimate feudal superior. Historically, [[The Crown]] would make a grant of land in return for military or other services and the grantees would in turn make sub-grants for other services and so on. Those making grants \u2013 the \"superiors\" \u2013 retained a legal interest in the land (\"dominium directum\"), and so a hierarchical structure was created with each property having a number of owners, co-existing simultaneously. Only one of these, the [[vassal]], has what in normal language would be regarded as ownership of the property (\"dominium utile\").\n\nIn the 18th century, peasants were dispossessed of the land to which they were bonded.<ref>[[Thomas Douglas Selkirk]] (1805) ''[https://archive.org/details/observationsonp00selkgoog Observations on the Present State of the Highlands of Scotland]'' pp.31\u201354,</ref>\n\nThe [[Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000]] abolished the feudal system of land tenure in Scotland and replaced it with a system of outright ownership of land.  Since the Act became fully effective from 28 November 2004, the [[vassal]] owns the land outright, and superiority interests disappeared. The right of feudal superiors to enforce conditions was ended, subject to certain saving provisions of a restricted nature. [[Feu (land tenure)|Feu]] duty was abolished although compensation may be payable. The delay between [[royal assent]] and coming into force was a result of the great number of transitional arrangements needed to be put into place before final abolition and because of the close relation that the 2000 Act has to the Title Conditions Act 2003.<ref>{{cite book|last=Boyle|first=Alan E.|title=Human Rights and Scots Law|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SZSSuFFsD_QC&pg=PA287|year=2002|publisher=Hart Publishing|page=287}}</ref>\n\n===England===\nUnique in England, the village of [[Laxton, Nottinghamshire|Laxton]] in [[Nottinghamshire]] continues to retain some vestiges of the feudal system, where the land is still farmed using the [[open field system]].  The feudal court now only meets annually, with its authority now restricted to management of the farmland.<ref>J. V. Beckett, ''A History of Laxton: England's Last Open Field Village'' (Oxford, 1989), p. 271.</ref>\n\n===Sark===\nThe tiny island of [[Sark]], in the [[Channel Islands]], was arguably the last feudal state in Europe. It was a feudal state up until April 9, 2008. The island was a fiefdom of the larger nearby island of [[Guernsey]] and administered independently by a [[List of Seigneurs of Sark|Seigneur]], who was a vassal to the land's owner \u2013 the Queen of the United Kingdom. Sark's ruling body voted on 4 October 2006 to replace the remaining tenement seats in Chief Pleas with a fully elected democratic government. This was implemented on April 9, 2008.<ref>A. H.

In the later-released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]], a younger version of the character serves as one of the main [[protagonist]]s alongside [[Anakin Skywalker]] and is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]]. In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to [[Luke Skywalker]], to whom he introduces the ways of the [[Jedi]], until he becomes one with the Force after sacrificing himself to [[Darth Vader]] in their fight and later guides him alongside [[Yoda]] in the fight against the Empire with the Rebel Alliance while also being instrumental in Luke's completion of his Jedi training. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to a [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] named [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and later the mentor and friend to Luke\u2019s father Anakin, who falls to the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Vader. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nGuinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] (1977){{EpIV}} earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the only acting nomination for a ''Star Wars'' film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the usually criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Kenobi in an untitled web series on [[Disney+]] centered on the character that takes place some years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' and prior to ''A New Hope''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Skywalker saga===\n{{main|Skywalker saga}}\n\n====Original trilogy (1977\u20131983)====\n[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 02 (Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from Episode IV).jpg|thumb|Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from ''Episode IV'']]\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is first introduced in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{EpIV}} living as a [[hermit]] by the name of Ben Kenobi on the planet [[Tatooine]].{{efn|In an early draft of the film, his first meeting with Luke is lifted directly from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', acknowledging [[Gandalf]] as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|year=2015|publisher=Performing Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uG0uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|page=96}}</ref>}} The family of [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) purchases two droids, [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) and [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]]), the former of whom is able to speak English to communicate with Luke, while the latter can only communicate through beeps understood only by C-3PO. C-3PO explains to Luke that R2-D2 claims to have belonged to a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, although C-3PO does not remember this and does not know what R2-D2 is talking about. Luke, recognizing the surname, makes the connection to Ben Kenobi, and begins to wonder if the two are related, or the same person. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the lost [[R2-D2]], Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. At Obi-Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire's]] superweapon: the [[Death Star]]. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to the planet [[Alderaan]] in order to help the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\nObi-Wan reveals to Luke his true identity and explains that he is a [[Jedi]], a member of an ancient group of [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]] and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]) and uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) have been killed by [[Imperial stormtroopers]], he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi.\n\nAt the settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], Obi-Wan [[Jedi mind trick|uses the Force]] to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local [[cantina]] and meet smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) alongside the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \"a great disturbance in the Force\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that the planet [[Alderaan]] has been destroyed by the Empire.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' then encounters an Imperial [[TIE Fighter]]. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables tractor beam, but not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the ''Falcon''. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the [[Battle of Yavin|Rebel attack on the Death Star]], Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station.\n\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a [[Force ghost|spirit]] through the Force. On the ice planet [[Hoth]], he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]] ([[Frank Oz]]). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back.html |title=Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imdsb.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice.

When Maul mortally wounds Qui-Gon, Obi-Wan storms in to duel Maul, who nearly kills him. However, Obi-Wan manages to turn the tables and defeat Maul, slicing him in half and sending him plunging down a vast reactor shaft. He promises to fulfill Qui-Gon's dying wish of training Anakin as a Jedi, with or without the Council's blessing.

Over the years, Anakin has grown powerful but somewhat arrogant, and believes that Obi-Wan is \"holding him back.\" After they save Padm\u00e9, now a senator, from an assassination attempt, Obi-Wan goes on a solo mission to trace the would-be assassins involved to the planet [[Kamino (Star Wars)|Kamino]]. He learns of a [[Clone trooper|massive clone army]] that the planet's inhabitants are building for the Republic.

Anakin Skywalker, by now a Jedi Knight, remains Obi-Wan's partner, and the two have become war heroes and best friends. The film opens with the two on a rescue mission to save the kidnapped [[Palpatine|Supreme Chancellor Palpatine]] ([[Ian McDiarmid]]) from cyborg Separatist commander [[General Grievous]] ([[Matthew Wood (sound editor)|Matthew Wood]]) onboard his cruiser. Dooku duels the Jedi once again, knocking Obi-Wan unconscious; while Obi-Wan is out cold, Anakin defeats Dooku and reluctantly executes him on Palpatine's orders. Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] to track down Grievous.\n\nAfter finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine\u2014who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war\u2014issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the [[Jedi Temple]] has been killed. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin\u2014who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader\u2014who led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with battling Anakin. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin no longer exists, having been \u201cconsumed\u201d by Vader.\n\nObi-Wan visits Padm\u00e9 to question of Anakin's whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm\u00e9 sets out to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts his longtime apprentice, who accuses Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm\u00e9 into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin by severing his legs and left arm; as Anakin is immolated and mutilated by the bank of a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves Mustafar with C-3PO, R2-D2, and a fainted Padm\u00e9. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Anakin is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy.\n\nObi-Wan takes Padm\u00e9 to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to deliver Luke to Anakin\u2019s stepbrother [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Joel Edgerton]]) and his wife [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Bonnie Piesse]]) at the moisture farm on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned to teach him to become one with the Force after death.

The ''Jedi Apprentice'' books follow his adventures as Qui-Gon's Padawan. Notable events in the series include battling the Dark Jedi Xanatos and going on his first independent mission. The ''Jedi Quest'' books detail his adventures with Anakin in the years leading up to ''Attack of the Clones''.\n\nHis heroism just before and during the Clone Wars is portrayed in novels such as ''[[Outbound Flight]]'', ''[[The Approaching Storm]]'', and ''[[The Cestus Deception]]''.\n\nObi-Wan's life between ''Revenge of the Sith'' and ''A New Hope'' is portrayed mostly in [[Jude Watson]]'s ''[[The Last of the Jedi]]'' series. Set roughly a year after the fall of the Republic, the series follows Obi-Wan as he seeks out possible survivors of the [[Great Jedi Purge]], most notably Anakin's former rival, Ferus Olin. The books also portray Obi-Wan adjusting to life as a hermit on Tatooine and quietly watching over Luke. He also discovers that Vader is still alive after seeing him on the Holonet, the galaxy's official news source.\n\nObi-Wan appears in the final chapter of ''[[Dark Lord: The Rise of Darth Vader]]'', set just after the events in ''Revenge of the Sith'', in which he learns that Vader survived their duel on Mustafar.\n\nObi-Wan appears in spirit form in many novels set after ''Return of the Jedi''. In ''[[The Truce at Bakura]]'', he appears to Luke to warn him about the threat presented by the Ssi-ruuk; in ''[[The Lost City of the Jedi]]'', he guides Luke to the titular city on [[Yavin IV]]; in ''[[Heir to the Empire]]'', meanwhile, he bids farewell to Luke, explaining that he must abandon his spiritual form to \"move on\" to a new, higher plane of [[consciousness]]. Before parting, Luke says that Obi-Wan was like a father to him, and Obi-Wan replies that he loved Luke like a son.\n\n====Video games====\nObi-Wan Kenobi appears in several video games. He is a playable character in all four ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Video Game|Lego Star Wars]]'' [[video game]]s, as well as ''[[Star Wars: Battlefront II (2005 video game)|Battlefront II]]'' and ''[[Star Wars Battlefront: Renegade Squadron|Renegade Squadron]]''. He is also the lead character in ''[[Star Wars: Obi-Wan]]''. The older version is only playable in ''[[Lego Star Wars II: The Original Trilogy]]'' and ''[[Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: Episode III \u2013 Revenge of the Sith (video game)|Star Wars Episode III: Revenge of the Sith]]'' multiplayer mode and [[Death Star]] bonus mission ''[[Star Wars: Renegade Squadron]]'', and ''[[Star Wars: The Force Unleashed]]'' in multiplayer mode and the droid [[PROXY]] disguises as him. He also appears in ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Jedi Alliance]]'', ''[[Star Wars: Jedi Power Battles]]'' and ''[[Star Wars: The Clone Wars \u2013 Lightsaber Duels]]'' as a playable character. He is also playable in the strategy game ''Star Wars: Empire at War''. He is a playable character in ''Disney Infinity 3.0''. Kenobi is also a playable character as part of the Clone Wars season for ''[[Star Wars Battlefront II (2017 video game)|Star Wars Battlefront II]]''.<ref>{{cite magazine |first=Alex |last=Kane|title=Obi-Wan Kenobi, General Grievous, Anakin Skywalker Coming to \u2018Battlefront II\u2019 |url=https://variety.com/2018/gaming/news/clone-wars-battlefront-ii-1202838716/ |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Business Media, LLC.]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/games/star-wars/255307/star-wars-battlefront-2-new-clone-wars-content-and-heroes-coming-to-game |title=Star Wars Battlefront 2: New Clone Wars Content and Heroes Coming to Game |website=[[Den of Geek]]|publisher=[[Dennis Publishing]]|location=New York City|date=June 9, 2018 |access-date=June 10, 2018 }}</ref>\n\n====Comic books====\nIssue #24 of Marvel's [[Star Wars (1977 comic book)|1977 ''Star Wars'' comic]] depicts Obi-Wan during the time of the Republic.\n\nVarious [[Dark Horse Comics]] works utilize Kenobi, including [[Clone Wars (Star Wars)#Comics|several set during the Clone Wars]]. In ''[[Star Wars: Republic]]'' (1998\u20132006), Obi-Wan fights the Separatists during the Clone Wars. Among other notable storylines, he is kidnapped and tortured by Asajj Ventress before being rescued by Anakin (\"Hate & Fear\"), and apprehends corrupted Jedi Master [[Quinlan Vos]] (\"The Dreadnaughts of Rendili\"). Throughout the series, he grows increasingly wary of Palpatine's designs on the Republic and his influence on Anakin.\n\nIn the non-canon story \"Old Wounds\", published in ''[[Star Wars: Visionaries]]'' (2005) and set a few years after the events of ''Revenge of the Sith'', Obi-Wan confronts Darth Maul on Tatooine to protect Luke. The duel ends when Owen Lars shoots and kills Maul; he then warns Obi-Wan to stay away from his nephew. Through the Force, Obi-Wan reassures Luke that he will be there for him when needed.\n\n==Cultural impact==\nThe character is loosely inspired by General Makabe Rokur\u014dta, a character from [[Akira Kurosawa]]'s film ''[[The Hidden Fortress]]'', played by [[Toshiro Mifune]] (whom series creator [[George Lucas]] also considered casting as Obi-Wan).<ref>{{cite web|first=Bryan|last=Enk|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/blogs/movie-talk/seven-samurai-star-toshiro-mifune-face-darth-vader-202128282.html|title='Seven Samurai' star Toshiro Mifune: The would-be face of Darth Vader?|website=[[Yahoo.com]]|date=January 14, 2013|accessdate=December 24, 2015}}</ref> ''[[Mad (magazine)|Mad]]'' magazine parodied the original film under the title ''Star Roars'' and included a character named 'Oldie Von Moldie', a grizzled 97-year-old whose lightsaber runs on an extension cord. The [[Shanghai]] [[nightclub]] shown in the beginning of ''[[Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom]]'' is called \"Club Obi Wan\" (Lucas wrote both the ''Star Wars'' and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' series). A real bar/club by this name existed in the [[Xihai District, Beijing|Xihai]] district of [[Beijing]], [[China]] but closed in the summer of 2010. ''[[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!]]'' episode \"Star Koopa\" (a spoof of ''Star Wars'') also had its own parody of Obi-Wan called 'Obi-Wan Toadi', and the live-action segment \"Zenned Out Mario\" featured a parody called \"Obi-Wan Cannoli\". The 1998 ''[[Animaniacs]]'' episode \"Star Warners\" (which spoofed ''Star Wars'') featured [[Slappy Squirrel]] portraying a parody of Obi-Wan as 'Slappy Wanna Nappy'. In the ''[[Family Guy]]'' episode \"[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]\", Obi-Wan Kenobi is parodied by the character [[Herbert (Family Guy)|Herbert]]. In the short film ''[[Thumb Wars]]'', Obi-Wan is parodied as the character \"Oobedoob Benubi\". In the film, his full name is 'Oobedoob Scooby-Doobi Benubi, the silliest name in the galaxy.'

In the later-released [[Star Wars prequel trilogy|prequel trilogy]], a younger version of the character serves as one of the main [[protagonist]]s alongside [[Anakin Skywalker]] and is portrayed by Scottish actor [[Ewan McGregor]]. In the original trilogy, he is a mentor to [[Luke Skywalker]], to whom he introduces the ways of the [[Jedi]], until he becomes one with the Force after sacrificing himself to [[Darth Vader]] in their fight and later guides him alongside [[Yoda]] in the fight against the Empire with the Rebel Alliance while also being instrumental in Luke's completion of his Jedi training. In the prequel trilogy, set decades earlier, he is initially a Padawan (apprentice) to a [[Jedi|Jedi Master]] named [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] and later the mentor and friend to Luke\u2019s father Anakin, who falls to the [[dark side of the Force]] and becomes Vader. He is frequently featured as a main character in various other ''Star Wars'' media.\n\nGuinness' performance as Obi-Wan in the original [[Star Wars (film)|''Star Wars'']] (1977){{EpIV}} earned him a nomination for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], the only acting nomination for a ''Star Wars'' film. McGregor's performance as the character in the prequels received praise as well, considered to be among the highlights of the usually criticized trilogy. McGregor is set to return as Kenobi in an untitled web series on [[Disney+]] centered on the character that takes place some years after ''Revenge of the Sith'' and prior to ''A New Hope''.\n\n==Appearances==\n===Skywalker saga===\n{{main|Skywalker saga}}\n\n====Original trilogy (1977\u20131983)====\n[[File:Star Wars and the Power of Costume July 2018 02 (Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from Episode IV).jpg|thumb|Obi-Wan Kenobi's Jedi robes from ''Episode IV'']]\n\nObi-Wan Kenobi is first introduced in the original ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''{{EpIV}} living as a [[hermit]] by the name of Ben Kenobi on the planet [[Tatooine]].{{efn|In an early draft of the film, his first meeting with Luke is lifted directly from ''[[The Hobbit]]'', acknowledging [[Gandalf]] as a source of inspiration.<ref>{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Chris|title=How Star Wars Conquered the Universe: The Past, Present, and Future of a Multibillion Dollar Franchise|year=2015|publisher=Performing Arts|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uG0uCgAAQBAJ&pg=PT96|page=96}}</ref>}} The family of [[Luke Skywalker]] ([[Mark Hamill]]) purchases two droids, [[C-3PO]] ([[Anthony Daniels]]) and [[R2-D2]] ([[Kenny Baker (English actor)|Kenny Baker]]), the former of whom is able to speak English to communicate with Luke, while the latter can only communicate through beeps understood only by C-3PO. C-3PO explains to Luke that R2-D2 claims to have belonged to a man named Obi-Wan Kenobi, although C-3PO does not remember this and does not know what R2-D2 is talking about. Luke, recognizing the surname, makes the connection to Ben Kenobi, and begins to wonder if the two are related, or the same person. When Luke and C-3PO travel the desert in search of the lost [[R2-D2]], Obi-Wan rescues them from a band of [[Tusken Raider]]s. At Obi-Wan's home, the now-found R2-D2 plays a recording of [[Princess Leia]] ([[Carrie Fisher]]) saying that R2-D2 contains the plans for the [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire's]] superweapon: the [[Death Star]]. Leia asks him to deliver R2-D2 and the plans safely to the planet [[Alderaan]] in order to help the [[Rebel Alliance]].\n\nObi-Wan reveals to Luke his true identity and explains that he is a [[Jedi]], a member of an ancient group of [[Force (Star Wars)|Force]]-sensitive warriors. He explains that the Jedi were hunted down and exterminated by the Empire with help from his former apprentice, [[Darth Vader]] (portrayed by [[David Prowse]], voiced by [[James Earl Jones]]), the apparent killer of Luke's father. He gives Luke his father's [[lightsaber]] and asks him to accompany him to Alderaan and take up Jedi training. Luke, at first, declines; but after finding that his aunt [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Shelagh Fraser]]) and uncle [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Phil Brown (actor)|Phil Brown]]) have been killed by [[Imperial stormtroopers]], he realizes he must go with Obi-Wan to Alderaan and to train as a Jedi.\n\nAt the settlement of [[Mos Eisley]], Obi-Wan [[Jedi mind trick|uses the Force]] to trick Imperial troops into letting them through a military checkpoint. They enter a local [[cantina]] and meet smuggler [[Han Solo]] ([[Harrison Ford]]) alongside the Wookiee [[Chewbacca]] ([[Peter Mayhew]]). Obi-Wan and Luke make a deal to travel to Alderaan aboard their ship, the ''[[Millennium Falcon]]''. During the mission, Obi-Wan begins instructing Luke in lightsaber combat. He suddenly becomes worried and tells Luke of \"a great disturbance in the Force\". Emerging from hyperspace, the group discovers that the planet [[Alderaan]] has been destroyed by the Empire.\n\nThe ''Falcon'' then encounters an Imperial [[TIE Fighter]]. They chase the TIE fighter to the Death Star, and subsequently get caught in the space station's tractor beam. On board the Death Star, Obi-Wan ventures through and disables tractor beam, but not before long, Darth Vader confronts him, and they engage in a lightsaber duel. Obi-Wan uses the duel to distract Vader as Luke, Leia, Han and Chewbacca escape to the ''Falcon''. Obi-Wan allows Vader to strike him down and his body mysteriously vanishes the moment he dies. At the climax of the film, during the [[Battle of Yavin|Rebel attack on the Death Star]], Obi-Wan speaks to Luke through the Force to help him destroy the Imperial station.\n\nIn ''[[The Empire Strikes Back]]'', Obi-Wan Kenobi appears several times as a [[Force ghost|spirit]] through the Force. On the ice planet [[Hoth]], he appears to instruct Luke to go to the planet [[Dagobah]] to find the exiled Jedi Master [[Yoda]] ([[Frank Oz]]). Despite Yoda's skepticism, Obi-Wan convinces his old master to continue Luke's training. Obi-Wan appears later to beseech Luke not to leave Dagobah to try to rescue his friends on Cloud City, although Luke ignores this advice.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imsdb.com/scripts/Star-Wars-The-Empire-Strikes-Back.html |title=Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back Script at IMSDb |publisher=Imdsb.com |date= |accessdate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn ''[[Return of the Jedi]]'', Obi-Wan again appears to Luke after Yoda's death on Dagobah. Obi-Wan acknowledges that Darth Vader is indeed Luke's father, revealed by Vader himself in the previous film and confirmed by Yoda on his deathbed, and also reveals that Leia is Luke's twin sister. He urges Luke to confront and defeat Vader; Luke once more rejects his advice.

Soon after returning to Coruscant, Obi-Wan travels to planet [[Utapau (Star Wars)|Utapau]] to track down Grievous.\n\nAfter finding the Separatist encampment, Obi-Wan fights Grievous and kills him with an abandoned blaster. When Palpatine\u2014who is secretly the Sith Lord Darth Sidious, the mastermind of the war\u2014issues [[Order 66 (Star Wars)|Order 66]] to have the clone troopers turn on the Jedi, Obi-Wan survives the attempt on his life and escapes, rendezvousing with Yoda and Senator [[Bail Organa]] ([[Jimmy Smits]]) of Alderaan aboard Organa's ship, ''[[Tantive IV]]''. Returning to Coruscant, he and Yoda discover that every Jedi in the [[Jedi Temple]] has been killed. After sending a beacon to all surviving Jedi to scatter across the galaxy and remain in hiding, a distraught Obi-Wan watches security footage revealing that it was Anakin\u2014who is now Sidious' Sith apprentice Darth Vader\u2014who led the chaos. Yoda says that he will confront Sidious, and charges Obi-Wan with battling Anakin. Obi-Wan is loath to fight his best friend, but reluctantly accepts when Yoda says that Anakin no longer exists, having been \u201cconsumed\u201d by Vader.\n\nObi-Wan visits Padm\u00e9 to question of Anakin's whereabouts, and realizes that Anakin is her husband and the father of her unborn child. When Padm\u00e9 sets out to the volcanic planet [[Mustafar]] to confront her husband herself, Obi-Wan secretly stows away aboard her ship. After they arrive on Mustafar, Obi-Wan reveals himself and confronts his longtime apprentice, who accuses Padm\u00e9 and Obi-Wan of conspiring against him and uses the dark side to choke Padm\u00e9 into unconsciousness. After a long and ferocious lightsaber duel, Obi-Wan defeats Anakin by severing his legs and left arm; as Anakin is immolated and mutilated by the bank of a lava river, Obi-Wan takes his former friend's lightsaber and leaves Mustafar with C-3PO, R2-D2, and a fainted Padm\u00e9. Unbeknownst to Obi-Wan, Anakin is rescued by Palpatine and reconstructed into the cyborg as first seen in the original trilogy.\n\nObi-Wan takes Padm\u00e9 to the asteroid Polis Massa, where she dies after giving birth to twins Luke and Leia. Afterwards, Yoda instructs Obi-Wan to deliver Luke to Anakin\u2019s stepbrother [[Owen Lars|Owen]] ([[Joel Edgerton]]) and his wife [[Beru Lars|Beru]] ([[Bonnie Piesse]]) at the moisture farm on Tatooine, and reveals that Qui-Gon's spirit has returned to teach him to become one with the Force after death. On Tatooine, Obi-Wan hands Luke off to his step-family and goes into exile.\n\n====Sequel trilogy (2015\u20132019)====\nIn ''[[The Force Awakens]]'', set 30 years after ''Return of the Jedi'', the protagonist [[Rey (Star Wars)|Rey]] ([[Daisy Ridley]]) hears Obi-Wan's voice when she touches the lightsaber that previously belonged to Luke. Obi-Wan calls out to Rey, before saying the words of encouragement he gave to Luke during his training on the ''Millennium Falcon'': \"These are your first steps.\" [[James Arnold Taylor]] first recorded the lines for this scene, but his recordings were replaced with [[Ewan McGregor]]'s voice acting.<ref>{{cite tweet|first=James Arnold|last=Taylor|authorlink=James Arnold Taylor|user=JATactor|url=https://twitter.com/jatactor/status/678299784621350912|title=yes, it was me originally but they replaced my version with Ewan.
