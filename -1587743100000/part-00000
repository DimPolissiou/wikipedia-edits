The band was formed in early 1980s, with the name Anvil. They released several self-recorded demos under that name, before discovering the Canadian band [[Anvil (band)|Anvil]] who had already released an album internationally, \n\nIn response to this, the band changed their name to \u201cAxis\u201d. In interview with Battle Helm <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://battlehelm.com/interviews/axxis/|title=AXXIS |website=Battlehelm|accessdate=2019-11-12}}</ref> in 2015, vocalist Bernhard Wei\u00df stated that the new band name must be a small word to get bigger letters on the promotional posters, but he also stated that they chose the name because \"the name AXIS sounds a bit like guitar axes, but also meaning wise\".\n\nThey recorded a demo entitled \"Tears of the Trees\" (later to appear on the ''Kingdom of the Night'' album) in 1988. Which they submitted to EMI records several times, and were eventually signed to EMI Electrola. Due to an EMI subsidiary in Germany also named Axis, the band introduced a second X in their name, becoming \u201cAxxis\u201d.  At this time, the band consisted of vocalist Bernhard Wei\u00df, guitarist Walter Pietsch, bassist Werner Kleinhans and drummer Richard Michaelski.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nAxxis then released their debut album, ''[[Kingdom of the Night]]'' in 1989.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> This album was released in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and the USA, and sold 100.000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axxis.de/eng_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014202834/http://www.axxis.de/eng_history.html |archivedate=2013-10-14 }}</ref> It became 1989's best selling debut album by a hard rock band in Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Axxis toured to promote the album, opening for such bands as [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/><ref>[http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/axxis] {{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Axxis released ''Axxis II'', which achieved similar success. Keyboard player Harry Oellers was added for the album. The album also contained the single \"Touch the Rainbow\" and the fan-favourite \"Little Look Back\" (later to become an anthem in their live shows), and was followed by ''Access All Areas'' in 1991, the first live album by the band.\n\nThe band then released ''[[The Big Thrill]]'' in 1993. Produced by Joey Balin and recorded in Philadelphia, it was the first international production by Axxis. The album became a best seller in 1993. It was promoted by the band in various shows, including in Japan, where acoustic performances by Wei\u00df and Pietsch would later be included in ''Profile \u2013 The Best of Axxis'', a 1994 Japan-only release.\n\nAxxis continued to record in America for their next album ''Matters of Survival'', and had [[Keith Olsen]] to produce it. Axxis originally wanted Olsen to produce their previous album ''The Big Thrill'', but Olsen declined due to time restraints.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://metalkings.com/reviews/axxis/axxis-eng.htm|title=AXXIS INTERVIEW |website=Metalkings.com|accessdate=2019-11-12}}</ref> Wei\u00df later implied that Olsen tried to change the band\u2019s sound from heavy metal to alternative, which was trending at that time. ''Matters of Survival'' was released in 1995, and fans rejected it due to the change in sound. Wei\u00df admitted later this album was \u201cnot metal enough\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axxis.de/data_fanclub/data%20fanreports/eng_interview_tm2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419190321/http://www.axxis.de/data_fanclub/data%20fanreports/eng_interview_tm2.html |archivedate=2016-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nAxxis continued to play with a modern rock style in their 1996 album, ''Voodoo Vibes'', the last album they recorded under EMI. Axxis then parted ways with long-time guitarist Walter Pietsch. According to Wei\u00df, Pietsch choose to be a producer, and has since become a well-known producer in Germany.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAxxis then signed with Massacre Records in 2000 to record the album ''Back to the Kingdom'', with a name implying the return to their classic heavy metal sound. The new album was received well among fans, and the followed up in 2000 and 2001 with the compilation albums ''Collection of Power'' and ''Eyes of Darkness''.\n\nBernhard Wei\u00df\u2019 unique vocal style is significantly characteristic trademark of the band, and he (along with Oellers) has been Axxis\u2019 most constant member, featuring in the band from 1988 to present. Over time Axxis have adopted an increasing amount of both classic and modern power metal into their sound, this is significantly heard on the albums ''Time Machine'' (2004), ''Paradise in Flames'' (2006), ''[[Doom of Destiny]]'' (2007) and ''[[Utopia (Axxis album)|Utopia]]'' (2009). \n \nThe band celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2011, releasing ''20 Years of Axxis'' on their publishing company, Phonotraxx. The anniversary production was an official bootleg live recording released on both CD and DVD, the following year they released the cover album ''reDISCOver(ed)'', featuring covers of \"[[Ma Baker]]\", \"[[Stayin' Alive]], \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\" and many more.\n\nIn 2014, the band returned to their roots similarly to ''Back to the Kingdom'' with the release of ''Kingdom of the Night II'' a double-CD release sequel to their debut album. The double-CDs were released as the hard rock oriented \u201cwhite\u201d and the heavy metal and power metal oriented \u201cblack\u201d versions, respectively, with completely different songs on them, and were both sold separately as well as packaged together in a \u201cDeluxe\u201d edition.\n\nAxxis celebrated their 25th anniversary similar to their 20th, with the live release of ''25 Years of Rock & Power'' in 2015. Early 2017 saw the release of ''Retrolution'', a heavy metal and hard rock oriented album, taking various throwback elements to the bands which Axxis had listened to over the years. The title implies this, word-playing \u201cretro\u201d with \u201crevolution\u201d.\nIn October 2018, they released their new studio album ''Monster Hero''.\n\nIn 2019, they celebrated their 30th anniversary with a tour, their first ever live Blu-Ray ''Bang Your Head with Axxis'', as well as a double album ''Best of EMI-Years'' with re-recordings of songs from the years 1989-1997.\n\n==Members==\n*Bernhard Wei\u00df \u2013 vocals (1988\u2013present)\n*Harry Oellers \u2013 keyboards (1990\u2013present)\n*Rob Schomaker \u2013 bass (2004\u2013present)\n*Dirk Brand \u2013 drums (2012\u2013present)\n*Stefan Weber \u2013 guitars (2015\u2013present)\n\n===Former members===\n*Guido Wehmeyer \u2013 guitars (1998\u20132006)\n*Werner Kleinhaus \u2013 bass (1988\u20131993)\n*Walter Pietsch \u2013 guitars (1988\u20131998)\n*Markus Gfeller \u2013 bass (1993\u20131998)\n*Richard Michalski \u2013 drums (1988\u20132004)\n*Kuno Niemeyer \u2013 bass (1998\u20132004)\n*Andr\u00e9 Hilgers \u2013 drums (2004\u20132008)\n*Alex Landenburg \u2013 drums (2008\u20132011)\n*Marco Wriedt \u2013 guitars (2007\u20132015)\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:800 height:auto barincrement:18\nPlotArea   = left:170 bottom:80 top:0 right:15\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1988 till:{{#time:m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1988\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1988\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\n\nColors =\n id:vocals  value:red       legend:Vocals\n id:guitar    value:green     legend:Guitars\n id:bass    value:blue      legend:Bass\n id:keys     value:purple   legend:Keyboards\n id:drums   value:orange    legend:Drums\n id:bars    value:gray(0.95)\n id:studio   value:black     legend:Studio_album\n\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\n\nLineData =\n at:03/01/1989 color:black layer:back\n at:08/31/1990 color:black layer:back\n at:03/04/1993 color:black layer:back\n at:02/23/1995 color:black layer:back\n at:01/24/1997 color:black layer:back\n at:03/20/2000 color:black layer:back\n at:09/17/2001 color:black layer:back\n at:01/26/2004 color:black layer:back\n at:01/20/2006 color:black layer:back\n at:11/16/2007 color:black layer:back\n at:08/28/2009 color:black layer:back\n at:05/18/2012 color:black layer:back\n at:02/28/2014 color:black layer:back\n at:07/14/2017 color:black layer:back\n at:10/05/2018 color:black layer:back\n\nBarData =\n bar:Bernhard   text:\"Bernhard Wei\u00df\"\n bar:Walter       text:\"Walter Pietsch\"\n bar:Guido        text:\"Guido Wehmeyer\"\n bar:Marco       text:\"Marco Wriedt\"\n bar:Stefan       text:\"Stefan Weber\"\n bar:Matthias     text:\"Matthias Degener\"\n bar:Werner      text:\"Werner Kleinhaus\"\n bar:Markus      text:\"Markus Gfeller\"\n bar:Kuno         text:\"Kuno Niemeyer\"\n bar:Rob           text:\"Rob Schomaker\"\n bar:Richard     text:\"Richard Michalski\"\n bar:Andre        text:\"Andr\u00e9 Hilgers\"\n bar:Alex           text:\"Alex Landenburg\"\n bar:Dirk           text:\"Dirk Brand\"\n bar:Harry        text:\"Harry Oellers\"\n\nPlotData =\n width:11\n bar:Bernhard from:01/01/1988 till:end  color:vocals\n bar:Walter     from:01/01/1988 till:04/01/1998  color:guitar\n bar:Guido      from:01/01/1998 till:05/01/2006  color:guitar\n bar:Marco     from:05/01/2006 till:07/01/2015  color:guitar\n bar:Stefan     from:07/01/2015 till:12/31/2018  color:guitar\n bar:Matthias  from:01/01/2019 till:end  color:guitar\n bar:Werner    from:01/01/1988 till:09/01/1993  color:bass\n bar:Markus    from:09/01/1993 till:04/01/1998  color:bass\n bar:Kuno       from:04/01/1998 till:11/01/2004  color:bass\n bar:Rob         from:11/01/2004 till:end  color:bass\n bar:Richard   from:01/01/1988 till:11/01/2004  color:drums\n bar:Andre      from:11/01/2004 till:07/01/2008  color:drums\n bar:Alex         from:07/01/2008 till:10/01/2011  color:drums\n bar:Dirk         from:10/01/2011 till:end  color:drums\n bar:Harry      from:01/01/1990 till:end  color:keys\n }}\n\n==Albums==\n*1989: ''[[Kingdom of the Night]]'' (GER: #42)\n*1990: ''Axxis II'' (GER: #32)\n*1993: ''[[The Big Thrill]]'' (GER: #38)\n*1995: ''Matters of Survival'' (GER: #48)\n*1997: ''Voodoo Vibes'' (GER: #82)\n*1999: ''Pure and Rough''\n*2000: ''Back to the Kingdom'' (GER: #59)\n*2001: ''Eyes of Darkness'' (GER: #83)\n*2004: ''Time Machine'' (GER: #72)\n*2006: ''[[Paradise in Flames]]'' (GER: #45)\n*2007: ''[[Doom of Destiny]]''\n*2009: ''[[Utopia (Axxis album)|Utopia]]'' (GER: #40)\n*2012: ''reDISCOver(ed)'' - Cover Album\n*2014: ''Kingdom of the Night II'' (GER: #28)\n*2017: ''Retrolution'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.axxis.de/data_news/eng_news.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220101910/http://www.axxis.de/data_news/eng_news.html |archive-date=2016-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (GER: #36.

At this time, the band consisted of vocalist Bernhard Wei\u00df, guitarist Walter Pietsch, bassist Werner Kleinhans and drummer Richard Michaelski.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/>\n\nAxxis then released their debut album, ''[[Kingdom of the Night]]'' in 1989.<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/> This album was released in Europe, Canada, Japan, Australia and the USA, and sold 100.000 copies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axxis.de/eng_history.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-07-26 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131014202834/http://www.axxis.de/eng_history.html |archivedate=2013-10-14 }}</ref> It became 1989's best selling debut album by a hard rock band in Germany.{{citation needed|date=November 2019}} Axxis toured to promote the album, opening for such bands as [[Black Sabbath]].<ref name=\"LarkinHM\"/><ref>[http://www.rockdetector.com/artist/germany/axxis] {{dead link|date=November 2019}}</ref>\n\nIn 1990, Axxis released ''Axxis II'', which achieved similar success. Keyboard player Harry Oellers was added for the album. The album also contained the single \"Touch the Rainbow\" and the fan-favourite \"Little Look Back\" (later to become an anthem in their live shows), and was followed by ''Access All Areas'' in 1991, the first live album by the band.\n\nThe band then released ''[[The Big Thrill]]'' in 1993. Produced by Joey Balin and recorded in Philadelphia, it was the first international production by Axxis. The album became a best seller in 1993. It was promoted by the band in various shows, including in Japan, where acoustic performances by Wei\u00df and Pietsch would later be included in ''Profile \u2013 The Best of Axxis'', a 1994 Japan-only release.\n\nAxxis continued to record in America for their next album ''Matters of Survival'', and had [[Keith Olsen]] to produce it. Axxis originally wanted Olsen to produce their previous album ''The Big Thrill'', but Olsen declined due to time restraints.<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=http://metalkings.com/reviews/axxis/axxis-eng.htm|title=AXXIS INTERVIEW |website=Metalkings.com|accessdate=2019-11-12}}</ref> Wei\u00df later implied that Olsen tried to change the band\u2019s sound from heavy metal to alternative, which was trending at that time. ''Matters of Survival'' was released in 1995, and fans rejected it due to the change in sound. Wei\u00df admitted later this album was \u201cnot metal enough\u201d.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.axxis.de/data_fanclub/data%20fanreports/eng_interview_tm2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-11 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160419190321/http://www.axxis.de/data_fanclub/data%20fanreports/eng_interview_tm2.html |archivedate=2016-04-19 }}</ref>\n\nAxxis continued to play with a modern rock style in their 1996 album, ''Voodoo Vibes'', the last album they recorded under EMI. Axxis then parted ways with long-time guitarist Walter Pietsch. According to Wei\u00df, Pietsch choose to be a producer, and has since become a well-known producer in Germany.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nAxxis then signed with Massacre Records in 2000 to record the album ''Back to the Kingdom'', with a name implying the return to their classic heavy metal sound. The new album was received well among fans, and the followed up in 2000 and 2001 with the compilation albums ''Collection of Power'' and ''Eyes of Darkness''.\n\nBernhard Wei\u00df\u2019 unique vocal style is significantly characteristic trademark of the band, and he (along with Oellers) has been Axxis\u2019 most constant member, featuring in the band from 1988 to present. Over time Axxis have adopted an increasing amount of both classic and modern power metal into their sound, this is significantly heard on the albums ''Time Machine'' (2004), ''Paradise in Flames'' (2006), ''[[Doom of Destiny]]'' (2007) and ''[[Utopia (Axxis album)|Utopia]]'' (2009). \n \nThe band celebrated their 20th anniversary in 2011, releasing ''20 Years of Axxis'' on their publishing company, Phonotraxx. The anniversary production was an official bootleg live recording released on both CD and DVD, the following year they released the cover album ''reDISCOver(ed)'', featuring covers of \"[[Ma Baker]]\", \"[[Stayin' Alive]], \"[[My Heart Will Go On]]\" and many more.\n\nIn 2014, the band returned to their roots similarly to ''Back to the Kingdom'' with the release of ''Kingdom of the Night II'' a double-CD release sequel to their debut album. The double-CDs were released as the hard rock oriented \u201cwhite\u201d and the heavy metal and power metal oriented \u201cblack\u201d versions, respectively, with completely different songs on them, and were both sold separately as well as packaged together in a \u201cDeluxe\u201d edition.\n\nAxxis celebrated their 25th anniversary similar to their 20th, with the live release of ''25 Years of Rock & Power'' in 2015. Early 2017 saw the release of ''Retrolution'', a heavy metal and hard rock oriented album, taking various throwback elements to the bands which Axxis had listened to over the years. The title implies this, word-playing \u201cretro\u201d with \u201crevolution\u201d.\nIn October 2018, they released their new studio album ''Monster Hero''.\n\nIn 2019, they celebrated their 30th anniversary with a tour, their first ever live Blu-Ray ''Bang Your Head with Axxis'', as well as a double album ''Best of EMI-Years'' with re-recordings of songs from the years 1989-1997.\n\n==Members==\n*Bernhard Wei\u00df \u2013 vocals (1988\u2013present)\n*Harry Oellers \u2013 keyboards (1990\u2013present)\n*Rob Schomaker \u2013 bass (2004\u2013present)\n*Dirk Brand \u2013 drums (2012\u2013present)\n*Stefan Weber \u2013 guitars (2015\u2013present)\n\n===Former members===\n*Guido Wehmeyer \u2013 guitars (1998\u20132006)\n*Werner Kleinhaus \u2013 bass (1988\u20131993)\n*Walter Pietsch \u2013 guitars (1988\u20131998)\n*Markus Gfeller \u2013 bass (1993\u20131998)\n*Richard Michalski \u2013 drums (1988\u20132004)\n*Kuno Niemeyer \u2013 bass (1998\u20132004)\n*Andr\u00e9 Hilgers \u2013 drums (2004\u20132008)\n*Alex Landenburg \u2013 drums (2008\u20132011)\n*Marco Wriedt \u2013 guitars (2007\u20132015)\n\n===Timeline===\n{{#tag:timeline|\nImageSize  = width:800 height:auto barincrement:18\nPlotArea   = left:170 bottom:80 top:0 right:15\nAlignbars  = justify\nDateFormat = mm/dd/yyyy\nPeriod     = from:01/01/1988 till:{{#time:m/d/Y}}\nTimeAxis   = orientation:horizontal format:yyyy\nScaleMinor = increment:1 start:1988\nScaleMajor = increment:2 start:1988\nLegend     = orientation:vertical position:bottom columns:4\n\nColors =\n id:vocals  value:red       legend:Vocals\n id:guitar    value:green     legend:Guitars\n id:bass    value:blue      legend:Bass\n id:keys     value:purple   legend:Keyboards\n id:drums   value:orange    legend:Drums\n id:bars    value:gray(0.95)\n id:studio   value:black     legend:Studio_album\n\nBackgroundColors = bars:bars\n\nLineData =\n at:03/01/1989 color:black layer:back\n at:08/31/1990 color:black layer:back\n at:03/04/1993 color:black layer:back\n at:02/23/1995 color:black layer:back\n at:01/24/1997 color:black layer:back\n at:03/20/2000 color:black layer:back\n at:09/17/2001 color:black layer:back\n at:01/26/2004 color:black layer:back\n at:01/20/2006 color:black layer:back\n at:11/16/2007 color:black layer:back\n at:08/28/2009 color:black layer:back\n at:05/18/2012 color:black layer:back\n at:02/28/2014 color:black layer:back\n at:07/14/2017 color:black layer:back\n at:10/05/2018 color:black layer:back\n\nBarData =\n bar:Bernhard   text:\"Bernhard Wei\u00df\"\n bar:Walter       text:\"Walter Pietsch\"\n bar:Guido        text:\"Guido Wehmeyer\"\n bar:Marco       text:\"Marco Wriedt\"\n bar:Stefan       text:\"Stefan Weber\"\n bar:Matthias     text:\"Matthias Degener\"\n bar:Werner      text:\"Werner Kleinhaus\"\n bar:Markus      text:\"Markus Gfeller\"\n bar:Kuno         text:\"Kuno Niemeyer\"\n bar:Rob           text:\"Rob Schomaker\"\n bar:Richard     text:\"Richard Michalski\"\n bar:Andre        text:\"Andr\u00e9 Hilgers\"\n bar:Alex           text:\"Alex Landenburg\"\n bar:Dirk           text:\"Dirk Brand\"\n bar:Harry        text:\"Harry Oellers\"\n\nPlotData =\n width:11\n bar:Bernhard from:01/01/1988 till:end  color:vocals\n bar:Walter     from:01/01/1988 till:04/01/1998  color:guitar\n bar:Guido      from:01/01/1998 till:05/01/2006  color:guitar\n bar:Marco     from:05/01/2006 till:07/01/2015  color:guitar\n bar:Stefan     from:07/01/2015 till:12/31/2018  color:guitar\n bar:Matthias  from:01/01/2019 till:end  color:guitar\n bar:Werner    from:01/01/1988 till:09/01/1993  color:bass\n bar:Markus    from:09/01/1993 till:04/01/1998  color:bass\n bar:Kuno       from:04/01/1998 till:11/01/2004  color:bass\n bar:Rob         from:11/01/2004 till:end  color:bass\n bar:Richard   from:01/01/1988 till:11/01/2004  color:drums\n bar:Andre      from:11/01/2004 till:07/01/2008  color:drums\n bar:Alex         from:07/01/2008 till:10/01/2011  color:drums\n bar:Dirk         from:10/01/2011 till:end  color:drums\n bar:Harry      from:01/01/1990 till:end  color:keys\n }}\n\n==Albums==\n*1989: ''[[Kingdom of the Night]]'' (GER: #42)\n*1990: ''Axxis II'' (GER: #32)\n*1993: ''[[The Big Thrill]]'' (GER: #38)\n*1995: ''Matters of Survival'' (GER: #48)\n*1997: ''Voodoo Vibes'' (GER: #82)\n*1999: ''Pure and Rough''\n*2000: ''Back to the Kingdom'' (GER: #59)\n*2001: ''Eyes of Darkness'' (GER: #83)\n*2004: ''Time Machine'' (GER: #72)\n*2006: ''[[Paradise in Flames]]'' (GER: #45)\n*2007: ''[[Doom of Destiny]]''\n*2009: ''[[Utopia (Axxis album)|Utopia]]'' (GER: #40)\n*2012: ''reDISCOver(ed)'' - Cover Album\n*2014: ''Kingdom of the Night II'' (GER: #28)\n*2017: ''Retrolution'' <ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.axxis.de/data_news/eng_news.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-12-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220101910/http://www.axxis.de/data_news/eng_news.html |archive-date=2016-12-20 |url-status=dead }}</ref> (GER: #36.

In part two, [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] is taken by [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] for a ritual in which [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] is restored to health.\n\n== Plot ==\n=== Part one ===\n[[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] works on a cure for [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]]. [[Dalton (Buffyverse)|Dalton]], a vampire transcriber, is unable to decipher the book stolen from the library which contains a cure. Drusilla informs Spike that they need a key because the book is in code.\n\nBuffy witnesses Dalton stealing an object from a mausoleum, but he escapes when she is distracted by another vampire. She enters her bedroom and finds Angel waiting to warn her of grave danger. Buffy reports to [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], and he is concerned when she tells him about the theft from the mausoleum.\n\nSpike and Drusilla examine the key stolen by Dalton, a gold cross. Spike decides to call the Order of Taraka, an ancient guild of assassins, to rid himself of Buffy once and for all. Back at school, Willow is taken into a secluded lounge area to be recruited by a leading software company, along with [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Oz]], the boy who has been watching her for weeks. At the mausoleum, Giles realizes that Josephus du Lac, the author of the book stolen from the library, is buried there and that the book's key was taken from the mausoleum.\n\nThe assassins begin to arrive. A large, intimidating man exits a bus, and a door-to-door beauty salesman attacks Buffy's next-door neighbor. A young woman attacks an airplane worker in the cargo hold of a plane, escaping with little difficulty.\n\nGiles tells Buffy, Xander, and Willow about the \"du Lac Cross\" which can be used as the key, and he enlists their help with further research. Buffy arrives at the ice skating stadium for a date with Angel. She is attacked, but Angel arrives in time to help her fight off the assassin whom she kills with the blade of her skate. Angel, recognizing the assassin's ring, warns Buffy that she should leave Sunnydale and hide. The female from the plane watches from the shadows.\n\nThe assassin next-door to Buffy's house feeds on the neighbors's body by disintegrating into hundreds of writhing mealworms which can reshape themselves into limbs at will. Buffy is paranoid and jittery, suspicious of each person who passes by in the hallways at school, including Oz. Buffy arrives at Angel's empty home and falls asleep in his bed. Angel goes to [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Willy the Snitch|Willy]]'s bar for information, and Willy finally confirms Angel's suspicions that Spike is behind the assassins. Before Angel can leave, he is attacked by the mysterious female. She locks him in a metal cage in front of an eastern window, with only a few hours until sunrise.\n\nGiles reveals that the missing manuscript contains a ritual to restore a weakened vampire back to health. Xander and Cordelia enter Buffy's house, and Xander searches for her while Cordelia waits downstairs. She hears a knock at the door and lets in the mealworm assassin. In Angel's bedroom, Buffy is attacked by the mysterious woman. They fight, and the woman tells Buffy that her name is [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra]] the Vampire Slayer.\n\n=== Part two ===\nRealising that they are both slayers, [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra]] go to [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] for assistance in explaining the situation. They learn that Kendra was called when Buffy temporarily died in her fight with [[The Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]] in \"[[Prophecy Girl]]\". Meanwhile, [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Willy the Snitch|Willy]] has saved Angel from certain death, but sold him out to [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]. Spike takes Angel back to the warehouse, where he will be held until he can be sacrificed to restore [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] to full strength.\n\n[[Xander Harris|Xander]] and [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] run and hide in the basement, although before long they are arguing with each other. After an unexpected kiss, they rush to escape, running past the attacking mealworm assassin. At school, Buffy, whose test results recommend a career in law enforcement, attends a career seminar. The police officer leading the seminar tries to shoot Buffy. Oz is shot and slightly injured as he pushes Willow out of harm's way. Kendra comes to Buffy's rescue, and they fight off the attacker. The Scoobies then gather in the library, where Giles announces that Spike intends for Angel to die in the ritual to restore Drusilla.\n\nAngel is tortured by Drusilla, both emotionally and physically; she pours holy water on him as she reminds him about how he killed her whole family. Angel taunts Spike with insinuations that Spike is unable to satisfy Drusilla, in the hope that Spike will kill him before he can be used to cure Drusilla. Meanwhile, Kendra gains a newfound respect for Buffy's qualities as a slayer. Later, the slayers go after Willy to learn what happened to Angel; they force Willy to take them to the location of Spike and Angel. However, Willy leads them to the assassins, and the ritual has already begun. Buffy attacks Spike to save Angel, and Kendra and the Scooby Gang arrive to back her up. Xander and Cordelia lure the mealworm assassin underneath a door into a liquid glue trap. Willow and Giles stake a vampire while Buffy and Kendra fight several of their own. Spike starts a fire and rushes to rescue the unconscious Drusilla, hoping that the ritual has had time to cure her. Buffy prevents their exit, crushing them in falling rubble. She helps the weakened Angel to exit the building.\n\nWith the danger over, it is time for Kendra to leave. Buffy and Kendra discuss their position as slayer. Kendra remarks that Buffy considers slaying to be a job when it is actually a part of who she is. The two, now friends, say their goodbyes and Buffy is left with a new outlook on her position as the slayer, as well as the knowledge that she is no longer alone in her calling.\n\nAt the remains of the church, Spike lies seriously injured under the rubble. Drusilla rises, the ritual having worked and restored her to full power. She carries her partner out of the debris, promising to return the favor and make him as powerful as her.\n\n==Production==\n* The hold of the plane in which Kendra arrived in Sunnydale was turned upside down and used as a sewer tunnel in later episodes.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Watcher's Guide, Volume 1 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) |last=Golden |first=Christopher |last2=Holder |first2=Nancy |publisher=Simon & Schuster |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0613633652 |pages=95 }}</ref> The ice rink, called ''Iceland'', is found in Paramount, California, around 25 miles from where Buffy was filmed.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Watcher's Guide, Volume 1 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) |last=Golden |first=Christopher |last2=Holder |first2=Nancy |publisher=Simon & Schuster |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0613633652 |pages=96 }}</ref>\n* Sarah Michelle Gellar is a fan of ice skating in real life, and lists ice skating as one of her hobbies,<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/whatsmylineone/trivia.shtml |title=Episode Guide: What's My Line Part One |publisher=BBC }}</ref> which, according to writer Marti Noxon in the DVD commentary for the episode, is the reason ice skating was incorporated into part one.\n* Seth Green mentioned in an ''Ultimate TV'' talk that the line \"I mock you with my monkey pants\" was initially dreamt by Alyson Hannigan.

[[Dalton (Buffyverse)|Dalton]], a vampire transcriber, is unable to decipher the book stolen from the library which contains a cure. Drusilla informs Spike that they need a key because the book is in code.\n\nBuffy witnesses Dalton stealing an object from a mausoleum, but he escapes when she is distracted by another vampire. She enters her bedroom and finds Angel waiting to warn her of grave danger. Buffy reports to [[Rupert Giles|Giles]], and he is concerned when she tells him about the theft from the mausoleum.\n\nSpike and Drusilla examine the key stolen by Dalton, a gold cross. Spike decides to call the Order of Taraka, an ancient guild of assassins, to rid himself of Buffy once and for all. Back at school, Willow is taken into a secluded lounge area to be recruited by a leading software company, along with [[Oz (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Oz]], the boy who has been watching her for weeks. At the mausoleum, Giles realizes that Josephus du Lac, the author of the book stolen from the library, is buried there and that the book's key was taken from the mausoleum.\n\nThe assassins begin to arrive. A large, intimidating man exits a bus, and a door-to-door beauty salesman attacks Buffy's next-door neighbor. A young woman attacks an airplane worker in the cargo hold of a plane, escaping with little difficulty.\n\nGiles tells Buffy, Xander, and Willow about the \"du Lac Cross\" which can be used as the key, and he enlists their help with further research. Buffy arrives at the ice skating stadium for a date with Angel. She is attacked, but Angel arrives in time to help her fight off the assassin whom she kills with the blade of her skate. Angel, recognizing the assassin's ring, warns Buffy that she should leave Sunnydale and hide. The female from the plane watches from the shadows.\n\nThe assassin next-door to Buffy's house feeds on the neighbors's body by disintegrating into hundreds of writhing mealworms which can reshape themselves into limbs at will. Buffy is paranoid and jittery, suspicious of each person who passes by in the hallways at school, including Oz. Buffy arrives at Angel's empty home and falls asleep in his bed. Angel goes to [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Willy the Snitch|Willy]]'s bar for information, and Willy finally confirms Angel's suspicions that Spike is behind the assassins. Before Angel can leave, he is attacked by the mysterious female. She locks him in a metal cage in front of an eastern window, with only a few hours until sunrise.\n\nGiles reveals that the missing manuscript contains a ritual to restore a weakened vampire back to health. Xander and Cordelia enter Buffy's house, and Xander searches for her while Cordelia waits downstairs. She hears a knock at the door and lets in the mealworm assassin. In Angel's bedroom, Buffy is attacked by the mysterious woman. They fight, and the woman tells Buffy that her name is [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra]] the Vampire Slayer.\n\n=== Part two ===\nRealising that they are both slayers, [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] and [[Kendra (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kendra]] go to [[Rupert Giles|Giles]] for assistance in explaining the situation. They learn that Kendra was called when Buffy temporarily died in her fight with [[The Master (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|The Master]] in \"[[Prophecy Girl]]\". Meanwhile, [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#Willy the Snitch|Willy]] has saved Angel from certain death, but sold him out to [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]. Spike takes Angel back to the warehouse, where he will be held until he can be sacrificed to restore [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] to full strength.\n\n[[Xander Harris|Xander]] and [[Cordelia Chase|Cordelia]] run and hide in the basement, although before long they are arguing with each other. After an unexpected kiss, they rush to escape, running past the attacking mealworm assassin. At school, Buffy, whose test results recommend a career in law enforcement, attends a career seminar. The police officer leading the seminar tries to shoot Buffy. Oz is shot and slightly injured as he pushes Willow out of harm's way. Kendra comes to Buffy's rescue, and they fight off the attacker. The Scoobies then gather in the library, where Giles announces that Spike intends for Angel to die in the ritual to restore Drusilla.\n\nAngel is tortured by Drusilla, both emotionally and physically; she pours holy water on him as she reminds him about how he killed her whole family. Angel taunts Spike with insinuations that Spike is unable to satisfy Drusilla, in the hope that Spike will kill him before he can be used to cure Drusilla. Meanwhile, Kendra gains a newfound respect for Buffy's qualities as a slayer. Later, the slayers go after Willy to learn what happened to Angel; they force Willy to take them to the location of Spike and Angel. However, Willy leads them to the assassins, and the ritual has already begun. Buffy attacks Spike to save Angel, and Kendra and the Scooby Gang arrive to back her up. Xander and Cordelia lure the mealworm assassin underneath a door into a liquid glue trap. Willow and Giles stake a vampire while Buffy and Kendra fight several of their own. Spike starts a fire and rushes to rescue the unconscious Drusilla, hoping that the ritual has had time to cure her. Buffy prevents their exit, crushing them in falling rubble. She helps the weakened Angel to exit the building.\n\nWith the danger over, it is time for Kendra to leave. Buffy and Kendra discuss their position as slayer. Kendra remarks that Buffy considers slaying to be a job when it is actually a part of who she is. The two, now friends, say their goodbyes and Buffy is left with a new outlook on her position as the slayer, as well as the knowledge that she is no longer alone in her calling.\n\nAt the remains of the church, Spike lies seriously injured under the rubble. Drusilla rises, the ritual having worked and restored her to full power. She carries her partner out of the debris, promising to return the favor and make him as powerful as her.\n\n==Production==\n* The hold of the plane in which Kendra arrived in Sunnydale was turned upside down and used as a sewer tunnel in later episodes.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Watcher's Guide, Volume 1 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) |last=Golden |first=Christopher |last2=Holder |first2=Nancy |publisher=Simon & Schuster |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0613633652 |pages=95 }}</ref> The ice rink, called ''Iceland'', is found in Paramount, California, around 25 miles from where Buffy was filmed.<ref>{{Citation |title=The Watcher's Guide, Volume 1 (Buffy the Vampire Slayer) |last=Golden |first=Christopher |last2=Holder |first2=Nancy |publisher=Simon & Schuster |url=https://www.amazon.com/gp/reader/0613633652 |pages=96 }}</ref>\n* Sarah Michelle Gellar is a fan of ice skating in real life, and lists ice skating as one of her hobbies,<ref>{{Citation |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/buffy/indetail/whatsmylineone/trivia.shtml |title=Episode Guide: What's My Line Part One |publisher=BBC }}</ref> which, according to writer Marti Noxon in the DVD commentary for the episode, is the reason ice skating was incorporated into part one.\n* Seth Green mentioned in an ''Ultimate TV'' talk that the line \"I mock you with my monkey pants\" was initially dreamt by Alyson Hannigan.

All of these, regardless of their social position or policy beliefs, subscribed to the interpretation that Marcos declared martial law:<ref name=\"Brillantes1987\"/>\n\n* as a strategy to enable Ferdinand Marcos to stay in power past the two Presidential terms allowed him under Philippine Constitution of 1935; and\n* as a technique for covering up the ill-gotten wealth of Marcos, his family, and his cronies.\n\n==== Economic interpretations ====\nIn addition, some critics who ascribe an economic component to Marcos' motivations,<ref name=\"Brillantes1987\"/> suggesting that martial law:\n* was an acquiescence to the global market system, which required tight control of sociopolitical systems so that the country's resources could be exploited efficiently;\n* was a product of the infighting among the families that formed the upper socioeconomic class of Philippine society; and\n* was a connivance between the state powers and the upper-class families to keep the members of the country's lower classes from becoming too powerful.\n\n== Planning and preparation for martial law ==\n[[File:Martiallawjf9906 09.JPG|thumb|Martial Law monument in [[Mehan Garden]]]]\nAlthough Marcos initially claimed that he had declared martial law in response to violent acts which took place in 1971-72 &ndash; such as the Plaza Miranda bombing and the alleged assassination attempt on Defense Secretary Enrile &ndash; the groundwork for its implementation had been laid down much earlier.

All of these, regardless of their social position or policy beliefs, subscribed to the interpretation that Marcos declared martial law:<ref name=\"Brillantes1987\"/>\n\n* as a strategy to enable Ferdinand Marcos to stay in power past the two Presidential terms allowed him under Philippine Constitution of 1935; and\n* as a technique for covering up the ill-gotten wealth of Marcos, his family, and his cronies.\n\n==== Economic interpretations ====\nIn addition, some critics who ascribe an economic component to Marcos' motivations,<ref name=\"Brillantes1987\"/> suggesting that martial law:\n* was an acquiescence to the global market system, which required tight control of sociopolitical systems so that the country's resources could be exploited efficiently;\n* was a product of the infighting among the families that formed the upper socioeconomic class of Philippine society; and\n* was a connivance between the state powers and the upper-class families to keep the members of the country's lower classes from becoming too powerful.\n\n== Planning and preparation for martial law ==\n[[File:Martiallawjf9906 09.JPG|thumb|Martial Law monument in [[Mehan Garden]]]]\nAlthough Marcos initially claimed that he had declared martial law in response to violent acts which took place in 1971-72 &ndash; such as the Plaza Miranda bombing and the alleged assassination attempt on Defense Secretary Enrile &ndash; the groundwork for its implementation had been laid down much earlier.

It first aired on February 15, 2009. The episode was directed by [[Michel Gondry]] and written by [[Iain Morris]] and [[Damon Beesley]]. [[Jemaine Clement]] and [[Bret McKenzie]] of the band [[Flight of the Conchords]] star as fictional versions of themselves. The plot focuses on Jemaine's forbidden romance with the Australian Keitha ([[Sarah Wynter]]), which chagrins his fellow New Zealanders Bret and Murray ([[Rhys Darby]]), the band's manager.\n\n\"Unnatural Love\" was well received by critics. It earned Clement a 2009 [[Emmy]] nomination for Best Comedy Actor and received two [[Creative Arts Emmy]] nominations, one for Outstanding Sound Mixing and one for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for the song \"Carol Brown\". The two songs featured in the episode, \"Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)\" and \"Carol Brown\", were well received critically and subsequently appeared on the album ''[[I Told You I Was Freaky]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Unnaturallove fotc.png|thumb|right|Jemaine with Keitha ([[Sarah Wynter]])]]\nFlight of the Conchords manager Murray ([[Rhys Darby]]) brings a reluctant Bret ([[Bret McKenzie]]) and Jemaine ([[Jemaine Clement]]) to a nightclub to experience \"[[Electronic dance music|dancing music]]\", recruiting their friend Dave ([[Arj Barker]]) to compel them inside. Finding the club overpopulated with men, the three sing \"Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)\". Jemaine goes home with a woman ([[Sarah Wynter]]), but when he awakes the next morning, he finds himself surrounded by Australian memorabilia. He suspects he has slept with an Australian, a major taboo for New Zealanders, and attempts to sneak out, calling Bret for help when he cannot unlock the door. However, the woman catches him, introducing herself as Keitha, a rough, crude Australian.\n\nKeitha asks Jemaine to stay longer, but he leaves and goes straight to the doctor for a checkup. Later, at a band meeting with Murray, Bret reveals Jemaine's escapade. Bret and Murray express their shock and dismay, even contemplating temporarily ejecting Jemaine from the band. Murray asks Jemaine if he still has his wallet; as it happens Jemaine has left his wallet in Keitha's apartment. He goes back to retrieve it, and questions Keitha over tea about her family background to determine exactly how Australian she is. She explains that she is quite Australian, proudly descended from criminals. She invites him back to bed.\n\nJemaine and Keitha start dating. He introduces her to Bret and Murray, but they refuse to accept her. Later, Bret unsuccessfully attempts to fool Jemaine by poorly mimicking Keitha's voice and leaving a fake break-up message on the answering machine. Jemaine goes to Keitha's apartment, where he learns her two Australian housemates similarly disapprove of him (though Keitha states this is not because he is from New Zealand, but because they consider him a \"dick\" and not attractive enough for her). Nonetheless, Keitha still likes Jemaine. Jemaine sings \"Carol Brown\".\n\nJemaine and Keitha decide to elope to [[New Jersey]], with the assistance of Dave, who approves of their forbidden love, comparing it to \"that movie, Interracial Hole Stretchers 2\". However, Keitha fails to show up at their predetermined meeting spot. Jemaine realizes something is amiss when the [[carriage]] driver explains he cannot go to New Jersey, despite Keitha's earlier claims. Jemaine rushes home, where he discovers Keitha and her friends have cleaned out the apartment and duct taped Bret to the door.\n\n==Production==\n\"Unnatural Love\" was written by [[Iain Morris]] and [[Damon Beesley]], who also wrote the Season 1 episode \"[[The Actor (Flight of the Conchords)|The Actor]]\".

It first aired on February 15, 2009. The episode was directed by [[Michel Gondry]] and written by [[Iain Morris]] and [[Damon Beesley]]. [[Jemaine Clement]] and [[Bret McKenzie]] of the band [[Flight of the Conchords]] star as fictional versions of themselves. The plot focuses on Jemaine's forbidden romance with the Australian Keitha ([[Sarah Wynter]]), which chagrins his fellow New Zealanders Bret and Murray ([[Rhys Darby]]), the band's manager.\n\n\"Unnatural Love\" was well received by critics. It earned Clement a 2009 [[Emmy]] nomination for Best Comedy Actor and received two [[Creative Arts Emmy]] nominations, one for Outstanding Sound Mixing and one for Outstanding Original Music and Lyrics for the song \"Carol Brown\". The two songs featured in the episode, \"Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)\" and \"Carol Brown\", were well received critically and subsequently appeared on the album ''[[I Told You I Was Freaky]]''.\n\n==Plot==\n[[Image:Unnaturallove fotc.png|thumb|right|Jemaine with Keitha ([[Sarah Wynter]])]]\nFlight of the Conchords manager Murray ([[Rhys Darby]]) brings a reluctant Bret ([[Bret McKenzie]]) and Jemaine ([[Jemaine Clement]]) to a nightclub to experience \"[[Electronic dance music|dancing music]]\", recruiting their friend Dave ([[Arj Barker]]) to compel them inside. Finding the club overpopulated with men, the three sing \"Too Many Dicks (On the Dancefloor)\". Jemaine goes home with a woman ([[Sarah Wynter]]), but when he awakes the next morning, he finds himself surrounded by Australian memorabilia. He suspects he has slept with an Australian, a major taboo for New Zealanders, and attempts to sneak out, calling Bret for help when he cannot unlock the door. However, the woman catches him, introducing herself as Keitha, a rough, crude Australian.\n\nKeitha asks Jemaine to stay longer, but he leaves and goes straight to the doctor for a checkup. Later, at a band meeting with Murray, Bret reveals Jemaine's escapade. Bret and Murray express their shock and dismay, even contemplating temporarily ejecting Jemaine from the band. Murray asks Jemaine if he still has his wallet; as it happens Jemaine has left his wallet in Keitha's apartment. He goes back to retrieve it, and questions Keitha over tea about her family background to determine exactly how Australian she is. She explains that she is quite Australian, proudly descended from criminals. She invites him back to bed.\n\nJemaine and Keitha start dating. He introduces her to Bret and Murray, but they refuse to accept her. Later, Bret unsuccessfully attempts to fool Jemaine by poorly mimicking Keitha's voice and leaving a fake break-up message on the answering machine. Jemaine goes to Keitha's apartment, where he learns her two Australian housemates similarly disapprove of him (though Keitha states this is not because he is from New Zealand, but because they consider him a \"dick\" and not attractive enough for her). Nonetheless, Keitha still likes Jemaine. Jemaine sings \"Carol Brown\".\n\nJemaine and Keitha decide to elope to [[New Jersey]], with the assistance of Dave, who approves of their forbidden love, comparing it to \"that movie, Interracial Hole Stretchers 2\". However, Keitha fails to show up at their predetermined meeting spot. Jemaine realizes something is amiss when the [[carriage]] driver explains he cannot go to New Jersey, despite Keitha's earlier claims. Jemaine rushes home, where he discovers Keitha and her friends have cleaned out the apartment and duct taped Bret to the door.\n\n==Production==\n\"Unnatural Love\" was written by [[Iain Morris]] and [[Damon Beesley]], who also wrote the Season 1 episode \"[[The Actor (Flight of the Conchords)|The Actor]]\".
