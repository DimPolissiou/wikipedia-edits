The resulting album, ''Vs.'', featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] and its first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]].\n\nPearl Jam decided to scale back its promotional efforts for ''Vs.'', including declining to produce music videos for any of the album's singles. Upon its release, ''Vs.'' set the record for most copies of an album sold during its first week, a record it held for five years. ''Vs.'' occupied the number one spot on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|seven times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.\n\n==Recording==\nFor its second album, Pearl Jam felt the pressure of trying to match the success of its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. In a 2002 interview, guitarist [[Mike McCready]] said, \"The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.\"<ref name=\"totalguitar\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> ''Vs.'' was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]. It was also the band's first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]], who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album ''Ten''. Rehearsals for ''Vs.'' began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The band then moved to The Site in [[Nicasio, California|Nicasio]], [[California]] in March 1993 to begin recording. Abbruzzese called the tranquil recording site \"paradise\" while lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] said, \"I fucking hate it here&nbsp;... I've had a hard time&nbsp;...

The resulting album, ''Vs.'', featured a rawer and more aggressive sound compared with the band's previous release. It was the band's first collaboration with producer [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]] and its first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]].\n\nPearl Jam decided to scale back its promotional efforts for ''Vs.'', including declining to produce music videos for any of the album's singles. Upon its release, ''Vs.'' set the record for most copies of an album sold during its first week, a record it held for five years. ''Vs.'' occupied the number one spot on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart for five weeks, the longest duration for a Pearl Jam album. The album has been certified [[RIAA certification|seven times platinum]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]] in the United States.\n\n==Recording==\nFor its second album, Pearl Jam felt the pressure of trying to match the success of its debut album, ''[[Ten (Pearl Jam album)|Ten]]''. In a 2002 interview, guitarist [[Mike McCready]] said, \"The band was blown up pretty big and everything was pretty crazy.\"<ref name=\"totalguitar\">\"Interview with Stone Gossard and Mike McCready\". ''[[Total Guitar]]''. November 2002.</ref> ''Vs.'' was the first Pearl Jam album to have production duties handled by [[Brendan O'Brien (music producer)|Brendan O'Brien]]. It was also the band's first album with drummer [[Dave Abbruzzese]], who had joined the band in August 1991 and toured for the album ''Ten''. Rehearsals for ''Vs.'' began in February 1993 at Potatohead Studio in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. The band then moved to The Site in [[Nicasio, California|Nicasio]], [[California]] in March 1993 to begin recording. Abbruzzese called the tranquil recording site \"paradise\" while lead vocalist [[Eddie Vedder]] said, \"I fucking hate it here&nbsp;... I've had a hard time&nbsp;...

According to Ament, the cover was a representation of how the band felt at the time, with Ament stating \"we were slaves\".<ref name=\"tenpast\"/> The album booklet contains additional drawings and writings by Vedder, including one page apparently [[doodle]]d at a business meeting that says \"I will never trust anybody again.\"<ref name=\"thenewyorktimes\"/> The lyric page for \"W.M.A.\" features a portion of a news story concerning [[Malice Green]], a victim of [[police brutality]].\n\nOriginally, the album was titled ''Five Against One'' (The song \"Animal\" features the lyric \"One, two, three, four, five against one&nbsp;...\"). Concerning the original album title, Gossard said, \"For me, that title represented a lot of struggles that you go through trying to make a record&nbsp;... Your own independence\u2014your own soul\u2014versus everybody else's.\"<ref name=\"fiveagainst\"/> The album title was changed at the last minute, first to a self-titled album and then to ''Vs.'', a nod to the general theme of conflict present in most of the songs on the album. Regarding the title ''Vs.'', Vedder said, \"They were writing all these articles&nbsp;... Our band against somebody else's band. What the hell are they talking about? You know, don't try to separate the powers that be. We're all in this together.\"<ref>Vedder, Eddie. \"Rockline Interview\". [[KISW|KISW-FM]], Seattle, Washington. October 18, 1993.</ref>\n\nThe decision to change the album's name at the last minute resulted in a few different versions of the album. There are also different versions of the album that are unrelated to the title.

After several failed job opportunities in similar companies, he worked part-time at a convenience store where he was scouted by An Onoya who chose him for the ReLife Project. As a high school student who only appears to be 17-years old, Arata is predictably seen as mature by his classmates and has no problem easily making friends. He has forgotten most of his high school lessons, so he needs to take many remedial tests. He prevents himself from falling in love due to his (real) age and the after-effect of the pill he must take after the experiment ends, even though Ry\u014d encourages him to \"live the ReLife to its finest\". He is currently the Project #002 from Kanto prefecture.\n:It is revealed that after he graduated from college and started working in the company, his older female co-worker named Saiki was being harassed by her male co-workers. He tried to help her, but that only increased the harassment, leading to Saiki rejecting his help and eventually committing suicide. This tragedy left him traumatized and he subsequently quit the job. At the end of the manga, he is given a job ReLIFE and starts a relationship with Chizuru after learning she was a subject too.

She is not only socially awkward but also fairly ignorant with regards to anything not directly related to school matters, particularly social and emotional ones. She's always doing research online on whatever she doesn't understand. It is revealed that she was a ReLIFE subject too and had two terms. She falls in love with Arata and starts (correctly) suspect he is a subject too. At the end of the manga, she gets a job at ReLIFE and starts a relationship with Arata.

Now having lost both the class representative position and the place at Kazuomi's side to Chizuru, Rena begins to think less of herself, and grows angrier towards Chizuru for thinking she is mocking her for her shortcomings. Chizuru, however, is unaware of Rena's feelings and confides in Arata that she feels that she and Rena are becoming friends.

Arata encourages her not to stoop to the level of harassing people she does not like, and to continue being a person who perseveres to obtain what she wants. After leaving, Arata meets Chizuru who suspects Rena was trying to steal her bag, but could not think of a reason why. Arata confirms Chizuru's suspicions, and she decides to speak with Rena as she is leaving the school. Rena explains her feelings towards Chizuru and learns that Chizuru never meant to degrade her, and was only attempting to be her friend. With the confusion cleared up, Rena apologizes and agrees to be Chizuru's friend on the condition that Chizuru acknowledges Rena as a rival.\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 6\n| Title           = This Isn't the First Time\n| AltTitle        = Hajimemashite janainda yo\n| RAltTitle       = &nbsp;({{Nihongo2|\u521d\u3081\u307e\u3057\u3066\u3058\u3083\u306a\u3044\u3093\u3060\u3088}})\n| OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2016|8|6}}\n| ShortSummary    = Kazuomi and An pay a visit to Arata's apartment for a study session due to both Arata and An repeatedly scoring poorly on their previous tests.

After several failed job opportunities in similar companies, he worked part-time at a convenience store where he was scouted by An Onoya who chose him for the ReLife Project. As a high school student who only appears to be 17-years old, Arata is predictably seen as mature by his classmates and has no problem easily making friends. He has forgotten most of his high school lessons, so he needs to take many remedial tests. He prevents himself from falling in love due to his (real) age and the after-effect of the pill he must take after the experiment ends, even though Ry\u014d encourages him to \"live the ReLife to its finest\". He is currently the Project #002 from Kanto prefecture.\n:It is revealed that after he graduated from college and started working in the company, his older female co-worker named Saiki was being harassed by her male co-workers. He tried to help her, but that only increased the harassment, leading to Saiki rejecting his help and eventually committing suicide. This tragedy left him traumatized and he subsequently quit the job. At the end of the manga, he is given a job ReLIFE and starts a relationship with Chizuru after learning she was a subject too.

She usually scores the top grades in her year, which makes her the class representative and has all her school expenses paid for as a result. She is not only socially awkward but also fairly ignorant with regards to anything not directly related to school matters, particularly social and emotional ones. She's always doing research online on whatever she doesn't understand. It is revealed that she was a ReLIFE subject too and had two terms. She falls in love with Arata and starts (correctly) suspect he is a subject too. At the end of the manga, she gets a job at ReLIFE and starts a relationship with Arata.

Now having lost both the class representative position and the place at Kazuomi's side to Chizuru, Rena begins to think less of herself, and grows angrier towards Chizuru for thinking she is mocking her for her shortcomings. Chizuru, however, is unaware of Rena's feelings and confides in Arata that she feels that she and Rena are becoming friends. One night after staying late at school, Rena sees Chizuru has also stayed late and steals her school bag in retaliation for her perceived mistreatment, but she is caught by Arata.

When Rena awakens, Arata confronts her about her actions and Rena shares her feelings of insecurity and frustration towards Chizuru. Arata encourages her not to stoop to the level of harassing people she does not like, and to continue being a person who perseveres to obtain what she wants. After leaving, Arata meets Chizuru who suspects Rena was trying to steal her bag, but could not think of a reason why. Arata confirms Chizuru's suspicions, and she decides to speak with Rena as she is leaving the school. Rena explains her feelings towards Chizuru and learns that Chizuru never meant to degrade her, and was only attempting to be her friend.

Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded [[interurban]] railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.

a [[light rail]] system in [[Portland, Oregon]], United States, that is owned and operated by [[TriMet]]. It consists of [[List of MAX Light Rail stations|94 stations]] over a {{convert|59.7|mi|km|1|adj=on}} network and is served by five lines, each of which is designated by a color. The system connects the north, northeast, and southeast [[Neighborhoods of Portland, Oregon|sections]] of Portland; the suburban communities of [[Beaverton, Oregon|Beaverton]], [[Clackamas, Oregon|Clackamas]], [[Gresham, Oregon|Gresham]], [[Hillsboro, Oregon|Hillsboro]], and [[Milwaukie, Oregon|Milwaukie]]; and [[Portland International Airport]] to [[Downtown Portland, Oregon|Portland City Center]]. MAX is the [[List of United States light rail systems by ridership|fourth-busiest light rail system]] in the United States after comparable light rail services in [[Los Angeles Metro Rail|Los Angeles]], [[MBTA subway|Boston]], and [[Muni Metro|San Francisco]]. The system had an average daily ridership of 120,900 and nearly 39 million annual riders in 2019. Lines run seven days a week with [[headway]]s of between 30 minutes off-peak and three minutes during [[rush hour]]s.\n\nMAX was among the first [[Light rail in the United States#Second-generation systems|second-generation]] American light rail systems to be built. It was conceived as a result of [[Highway revolts in the United States|freeway revolts]] that took place in Portland in the early 1970s. Construction of the network's inaugural eastside segment, which was then known as the [[MAX Blue Line|Banfield light rail project]], began in 1982 following a study of mass transit alternatives using funds diverted from the canceled [[Mount Hood Freeway]] and [[Interstate 505 (Oregon)|Interstate 505]] (I-505). This line commenced service between [[Library/Southwest 9th Avenue and Galleria/Southwest 10th Avenue stations|11th Avenue]] in downtown Portland and [[Cleveland Avenue station|Cleveland Avenue]] in Gresham on September 5, 1986. \n\nBuilding upon the original line, MAX was extended west to [[Hatfield Government Center station|downtown Hillsboro]] in 1998, northeast to [[Portland International Airport station|Portland Airport]] in 2001, north to the [[Expo Center station|Expo Center]] in 2004, across the [[Portland Transit Mall]] in August 2009, and south to [[Clackamas Town Center Transit Center|Clackamas Town Center]] in September 2009. The [[MAX Orange Line|Orange Line]]'s Portland\u2013Milwaukie segment, which opened in 2015 and terminates just [[Southeast Park Avenue station|south of Milwaukie]], is the system's latest extension. Future expansion plans include extending [[MAX Red Line|Red Line]] service further west to [[Fair Complex/Hillsboro Airport station]] in 2023 and if voters approve funding in November 2020, a planned rail extension through Southwest Portland and [[Tigard, Oregon|Tigard]] to [[Tualatin, Oregon|Tualatin]] that is known as the Southwest Corridor light rail project, is scheduled to open in 2027.\n\nMAX is one of three [[urban rail transit]] services operating in the [[Portland metropolitan area]], the other two being the [[Portland Streetcar]] and [[WES Commuter Rail]]. MAX provides direct connections to additional modes of public transportation, including local and [[Intercity bus service|intercity buses]] at most stations and [[Amtrak]] via [[Portland Union Station]]. MAX trains operate at a maximum of two-car [[Train|consist]]s, owing to downtown Portland's short city blocks. Fares are charged at a flat rate and are mainly collected through the [[Hop Fastpass]] payment system.\n\n==History==\n===Background===\n{{see also|Oregon Electric Railway}}\n[[File:Beaverton Depot for Oregon Electric Railway (Beaverton, Oregon Historical Photo Gallery) (247).jpg|thumb|right|An [[Oregon Electric Railway|Oregon Electric]] train seen in Beaverton]]\n\nIn the early 20th century, privately funded [[interurban]] railways gave Portland one of the largest urban rail systems in the [[Western United States|American West]], including lines that once extended from [[Forest Grove, Oregon|Forest Grove]] to [[Troutdale, Oregon|Troutdale]] and [[Vancouver, Washington]] to [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]].<ref name=\"Selinger\">{{cite web |title=Making History: 45 Years of Transit in the Portland Region |last=Selinger |first=Philip |date=2015 |publisher=TriMet |url=https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |oclc=919377348 |access-date=July 26, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180509021212/https://trimet.org/pdfs/history/making-history.pdf |archive-date=May 9, 2018 |url-status=unfit}}</ref>{{rp|7\u20138}}<ref name=\"thompson2010\">{{cite book |last=Thompson |first=Richard M. |date=2010 |title=Portland's Streetcar Lines |pages=7\u20138 |publisher=[[Arcadia Publishing]] |isbn=978-0-7385-8126-2 |access-date=March 12, 2019 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rCD1zjOPXvMC&pg=PA71}}</ref> [[Ben Holladay]] brought over Portland's first [[tram|trolley]]s from [[San Francisco]]; they were introduced in 1872 and were initially drawn by horses and mules.
