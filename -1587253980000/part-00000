A woman who had an art studio near to the Lusks, encouraged her to paint. In 1928 the family returned to Dunedin when her father joined the architectural firm, Mandeno and Frazer. Lusk had one more year at Arthur Street primary school before attending Otago Girl's High School in 1930.\n\nIn 1933 she left high school, before she matriculated, and enrolled in the [[King Edward Technical College]], the formal name for the Dunedin School of Art.<ref name=\"DNZB Lusk\"/> Lusk enrolled against her father's wishes and later noted there had been 'one hell of a row' about her decision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirker|first1=Anne|title=New Zealand women artists|date=1986|publisher=Reed Methuen|location=Auckland|isbn=0474001814}}</ref>{{Rp|106}}\n\nLusk attended the art school from 1934 to 1939. The school was a member of the La Trobe programme which involved the importation of practising artists from England to staff New Zealand schools. These artists included [[W. H. Allen]] and [[Robert Nettleton Field|R. N Field]], who arrived in 1925 and had a major impact on the Dunedin art scene.\n\nLusk was taught by [[J. D.

The authors wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In a number of ways the unpretentious, well-considered and solid qualities of her work summed-up a good deal that was thought to be the best tendencies of the Canterbury painters during this decade. In essence it was straightforward, uncomplicated and while not denying detail when necessary, remained uncluttered. Doris Lusk continued to develop this style through the 1940s and fifties with paintings like ''Tahananui'', ''Power House at Tuai'' and ''Botanical Gardens, H\u0101wera''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Gordon H|last2=Keith|first2=Hamish|title=An introduction to New Zealand painting 1839\u20131967|date=1969|publisher=Collins|location=Auckland|pages=135\u20136}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 1996 publication accompanying ''Landmarks: The Landscape Paintings of Doris Lusk'', an exhibition of Lusk's work she co-curated, art historian Lisa Beaven disputed this assessment, writing:\n\n<blockquote>An analysis of her art throughout her career reveals a deep fascination with particular motifs, centring around industrial imagery in landscape settings. For more than five decades, Lusk consistently pursued this preoccupation, using different techniques and employing different media. From being the result of random excursions, Lusk's paintings were directed explorations, not just of the relationship between the structures and the land around them, but also of the buildings themselves, and aspects of the juxtapositions of interior and exterior, exposure and concealment, surface and depth. The manifold layers of meaning embedded in the buildings and their role in projecting a certain mood, suggest her painting may profit from being read as expressions of moods, metaphors and symbols.<ref name='Landmarks'/>{{Rp|9\u201310}}</blockquote>\n\nArt historian Julie King, in a review of ''Landmarks'', noted that the exhibition gave the opportunity to assess Lusk's later paintings, and 'how she was positioned in relation to the new artistic models, values, and professionalism of the art institutional world which emerged in New Zealand in the late 1950s and '60s.'<ref name=King>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Julie|title=Landmarks: The Landscape Paintings of Doris Lusk|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1996|issue=80|pages=67\u201371}}</ref> King argued that the negative reception of Lusk's previous 1973 survey exhibition (organised by the [[Dowse Art Museum]] and toured to [[Auckland Art Gallery|Auckland City Art Gallery]]) by Auckland critics reflected the 'exclusivity of the canon created in Auckland by critics and curators in the early '70s' and the way art history in New Zealand had been written, 'with its focus on Colin McCahon and modernism, on internationalism and abstraction, so that placed within this context, her career appears peripheral.'<ref name=King/>{{Rp|70}}\n\nIn the same article, King examined how being a woman artist may have inflected Lusk's career and opportunities:\n\n<blockquote>Despite her reluctance to acknowledge the political issues surrounding women's art practice, Lusk's significance also lies within the history of women's artistic culture during the post-war period. At a time when social assumptions emphasised women's domestic role, she challenged these expectations by retaining her firm commitment to painting, and gained recognition as one of New Zealand's leading painters. Yet her painting was always fitted within the constraints of domestic life. After her marriage and birth of three children in the '40s, she dealt with the practicalities of looking after her family by painting in the kitchen,and it was not until the late '60s that she even had a studio of her own. Lusk was unable to study overseas until 1974, and her art was fitted into her personal life, so that visits to friends at Tuai and family holidays became her opportunity for painting.<ref name=King/>{{Rp|70}}</blockquote>\n\nIn a 1996 article, art historian Grant Banbury noted that while Lusk was usually discussed in terms of her landscape painting, she also produced a number of portraits and self-portraits, and championed life drawing as both an artist and a teacher.<ref name=Banbury>{{cite journal|last1=Banbury|first1=Grant|title=The Portraits of Doris Lusk|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1996|issue=80|pages=72\u201375}}</ref>{{Rp|72}} Lusk mainly painted close friends, family and colleagues, along with a small number of commissions and a several works painted in the 1970s based on images from newspapers.<ref name=Banbury/>{{Rp|72}} In 1939, while at art school, Lusk painted a portrait of Colin McCahon; nearly 50 years later, in 1987, Lusk painted ''Return to Otago'', a portrait of Anne McCahon and their son William - Colin McCahon had died earlier that year.<ref name=Banbury/>{{Rp|72\u201373}}\n\n==Career as a potter==\n\nIn addition to her painting career, Lusk was also a pioneer potter in New Zealand.<ref name=\"DNZB Lusk\"/> She was introduced to modelling with clay by Field while at art school, which ignited her interest in the medium.<ref name ='DPAG'/> She made her ceramics largely under her married name, Doris Holland, most of it in earthenware.<ref name ='DPAG'/>\n\nIn 1947 she began teaching pottery at Risingholme Community Centre with Margaret Frankel, and continued there until 1967.

A woman who had an art studio near to the Lusks, encouraged her to paint. In 1928 the family returned to Dunedin when her father joined the architectural firm, Mandeno and Frazer. Lusk had one more year at Arthur Street primary school before attending Otago Girl's High School in 1930.\n\nIn 1933 she left high school, before she matriculated, and enrolled in the [[King Edward Technical College]], the formal name for the Dunedin School of Art.<ref name=\"DNZB Lusk\"/> Lusk enrolled against her father's wishes and later noted there had been 'one hell of a row' about her decision.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Kirker|first1=Anne|title=New Zealand women artists|date=1986|publisher=Reed Methuen|location=Auckland|isbn=0474001814}}</ref>{{Rp|106}}\n\nLusk attended the art school from 1934 to 1939. The school was a member of the La Trobe programme which involved the importation of practising artists from England to staff New Zealand schools. These artists included [[W. H. Allen]] and [[Robert Nettleton Field|R. N Field]], who arrived in 1925 and had a major impact on the Dunedin art scene.\n\nLusk was taught by [[J. D.

The authors wrote:\n\n<blockquote>In a number of ways the unpretentious, well-considered and solid qualities of her work summed-up a good deal that was thought to be the best tendencies of the Canterbury painters during this decade. In essence it was straightforward, uncomplicated and while not denying detail when necessary, remained uncluttered. Doris Lusk continued to develop this style through the 1940s and fifties with paintings like ''Tahananui'', ''Power House at Tuai'' and ''Botanical Gardens, Hawera''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=Gordon H|last2=Keith|first2=Hamish|title=An introduction to New Zealand painting 1839\u20131967|date=1969|publisher=Collins|location=Auckland|pages=135\u20136}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nIn a 1996 publication accompanying ''Landmarks: The Landscape Paintings of Doris Lusk'', an exhibition of Lusk's work she co-curated, art historian Lisa Beaven disputed this assessment, writing:\n\n<blockquote>An analysis of her art throughout her career reveals a deep fascination with particular motifs, centring around industrial imagery in landscape settings. For more than five decades, Lusk consistently pursued this preoccupation, using different techniques and employing different media. From being the result of random excursions, Lusk's paintings were directed explorations, not just of the relationship between the structures and the land around them, but also of the buildings themselves, and aspects of the juxtapositions of interior and exterior, exposure and concealment, surface and depth. The manifold layers of meaning embedded in the buildings and their role in projecting a certain mood, suggest her painting may profit from being read as expressions of moods, metaphors and symbols.<ref name='Landmarks'/>{{Rp|9\u201310}}</blockquote>\n\nArt historian Julie King, in a review of ''Landmarks'', noted that the exhibition gave the opportunity to assess Lusk's later paintings, and 'how she was positioned in relation to the new artistic models, values, and professionalism of the art institutional world which emerged in New Zealand in the late 1950s and '60s.'<ref name=King>{{cite journal|last1=King|first1=Julie|title=Landmarks: The Landscape Paintings of Doris Lusk|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1996|issue=80|pages=67\u201371}}</ref> King argued that the negative reception of Lusk's previous 1973 survey exhibition (organised by the [[Dowse Art Museum]] and toured to [[Auckland Art Gallery|Auckland City Art Gallery]]) by Auckland critics reflected the 'exclusivity of the canon created in Auckland by critics and curators in the early '70s' and the way art history in New Zealand had been written, 'with its focus on Colin McCahon and modernism, on internationalism and abstraction, so that placed within this context, her career appears peripheral.'<ref name=King/>{{Rp|70}}\n\nIn the same article, King examined how being a woman artist may have inflected Lusk's career and opportunities:\n\n<blockquote>Despite her reluctance to acknowledge the political issues surrounding women's art practice, Lusk's significance also lies within the history of women's artistic culture during the post-war period. At a time when social assumptions emphasised women's domestic role, she challenged these expectations by retaining her firm commitment to painting, and gained recognition as one of New Zealand's leading painters. Yet her painting was always fitted within the constraints of domestic life. After her marriage and birth of three children in the '40s, she dealt with the practicalities of looking after her family by painting in the kitchen,and it was not until the late '60s that she even had a studio of her own. Lusk was unable to study overseas until 1974, and her art was fitted into her personal life, so that visits to friends at Tuai and family holidays became her opportunity for painting.<ref name=King/>{{Rp|70}}</blockquote>\n\nIn a 1996 article, art historian Grant Banbury noted that while Lusk was usually discussed in terms of her landscape painting, she also produced a number of portraits and self-portraits, and championed life drawing as both an artist and a teacher.<ref name=Banbury>{{cite journal|last1=Banbury|first1=Grant|title=The Portraits of Doris Lusk|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Spring 1996|issue=80|pages=72\u201375}}</ref>{{Rp|72}} Lusk mainly painted close friends, family and colleagues, along with a small number of commissions and a several works painted in the 1970s based on images from newspapers.<ref name=Banbury/>{{Rp|72}} In 1939, while at art school, Lusk painted a portrait of Colin McCahon; nearly 50 years later, in 1987, Lusk painted ''Return to Otago'', a portrait of Anne McCahon and their son William - Colin McCahon had died earlier that year.<ref name=Banbury/>{{Rp|72\u201373}}\n\n==Career as a potter==\n\nIn addition to her painting career, Lusk was also a pioneer potter in New Zealand.<ref name=\"DNZB Lusk\"/> She was introduced to modelling with clay by Field while at art school, which ignited her interest in the medium.<ref name ='DPAG'/> She made her ceramics largely under her married name, Doris Holland, most of it in earthenware.<ref name ='DPAG'/>\n\nIn 1947 she began teaching pottery at Risingholme Community Centre with Margaret Frankel, and continued there until 1967.

The trim was regulated by pumping water back and forth between two tanks in the bow and aft section of the ship so that the airship adopted a nose up or nose down attitude.\n\nThe first test flight took place on 20 August 1909. After the airship had been moved out of its [[Airship hangar|hangar]], the manoeuvrability was tested for about one hour at a height of {{convert|100|m}} on the [[Leichlingen]] airship grounds.

The relief valves could not vent the developing excess pressure quickly enough. This allowed [[hydrogen]] to leak from the envelope and come into contact with sparks from the propulsion system, causing the gas to explode.\n\nWitnesses on the ground only heard an explosion: the ship was not visible in the morning fog. The ''Erbsl\u00f6h'' crashed in a field close to Neuenkamp. The front part of the gondola was destroyed, with the torn envelope lying across it. The crew was found dead among the debris.

It was the first in the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation of video game consoles]], preceding Sony's [[PlayStation 2]], Nintendo's [[GameCube]] and Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market.\n\nIn contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn]], the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with \"off-the-shelf\" components, including a [[Hitachi]] [[SuperH|SH-4]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] and an [[NEC]] [[PowerVR]]2 [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. Released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Sega's expectations despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher. 9.13 million<!-- Do NOT change to \"10.6 million\"; see talk page on the overall sales number --> Dreamcast units were sold worldwide.\n\nAlthough the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited [[Third-party developer|third-party]] support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time. Its library contains many games considered creative and innovative, including ''[[Crazy Taxi (video game)|Crazy Taxi]]'', ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' and ''[[Shenmue]]'', as well as high-quality [[Porting|ports]] from Sega's [[Sega NAOMI|NAOMI arcade system board]]. The Dreamcast was also the first console to include a built-in modular [[modem]] for internet support and [[Online game|online play]].\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nReleased in 1988, the

In the end, it felt like Sega was not acting like a competent hardware company\". Gordon also claimed, \"[Sega] couldn't afford to give us [EA] the same kind of license that EA has had over the last five years\". Stolar had a different account of the breakdown in negotiations with EA, recalling that EA president Larry Probst specifically wanted \"exclusive rights to be the only sports brand on Dreamcast\", which Stolar could not accept due to Sega's recent $10 million purchase of [[sports game]] developer [[Visual Concepts]]. While EA's [[Madden NFL]] series did have established brand power, Stolar regarded [[NFL 2K]] as far superior and providing \"a breakthrough experience\" to launch the Dreamcast.<ref name=\"IGN's History of Sega\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra1\"/> While the Dreamcast would have none of EA's popular sports games, \"Sega Sports\" games developed mainly by Visual Concepts{{sfn|Kent|2001|page=581}} helped to fill that void.<ref name=\"gamasutra1\"/> The Dreamcast however suffered from mediocre soccer titles, a sport popular in Europe.\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = \"Let's take the conservative estimate of 250,000 Dreamcast units at presage\u2014that's a quarter of a million units at $200.

It was the first in the [[History of video game consoles (sixth generation)|sixth generation of video game consoles]], preceding Sony's [[PlayStation 2]], Nintendo's [[GameCube]] and Microsoft's [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]]. The Dreamcast was Sega's final home console, marking the end of the company's 18 years in the console market.\n\nIn contrast to the expensive hardware of the unsuccessful [[Sega Saturn]], the Dreamcast was designed to reduce costs with \"off-the-shelf\" components, including a [[Hitachi]] [[SuperH|SH-4]] [[central processing unit|CPU]] and an [[NEC]] [[PowerVR]]2 [[Graphics processing unit|GPU]]. Released in Japan to a subdued reception, the Dreamcast enjoyed a successful U.S. launch backed by a large marketing campaign, but interest in the system steadily declined as Sony built hype for the upcoming PlayStation 2. Sales did not meet Sega's expectations despite several price cuts, and the company continued to incur significant financial losses. After a change in leadership, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast on March 31, 2001, withdrawing from the console business and restructuring itself as a third-party publisher. 9.13 million<!-- Do NOT change to \"10.6 million\"; see talk page on the overall sales number --> Dreamcast units were sold worldwide.\n\nAlthough the Dreamcast had a short lifespan and limited [[Third-party developer|third-party]] support, reviewers have considered the console ahead of its time.

In the end, it felt like Sega was not acting like a competent hardware company\". Gordon also claimed, \"[Sega] couldn't afford to give us [EA] the same kind of license that EA has had over the last five years\". Stolar had a different account of the breakdown in negotiations with EA, recalling that EA president Larry Probst specifically wanted \"exclusive rights to be the only sports brand on Dreamcast\", which Stolar could not accept due to Sega's recent $10 million purchase of [[sports game]] developer [[Visual Concepts]]. While EA's [[Madden NFL]] series did have established brand power, Stolar regarded [[NFL 2K]] as far superior and providing \"a breakthrough experience\" to launch the Dreamcast.<ref name=\"IGN's History of Sega\"/><ref name=\"gamasutra1\"/> While the Dreamcast would have none of EA's popular sports games, \"Sega Sports\" games developed mainly by Visual Concepts{{sfn|Kent|2001|page=581}} helped to fill that void.<ref name=\"gamasutra1\"/>\n\n{{Quote box\n|quote = \"Let's take the conservative estimate of 250,000 Dreamcast units at presage\u2014that's a quarter of a million units at $200.
