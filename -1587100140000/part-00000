Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 (\u0926\u0947\u0935\u0915\u0941\u0932 \u092a\u093e\u091f\u0928 \u0928\u0917\u0930\u0940) which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were over 400 [[Jain temples]]. Delwara was the center of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Around middle of 13<sup>th</sup> century, Raja Sagar, a Deora Chauhan and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal of Jalore was a very brave king of Delwara (Mewar). Descendants of Raja Sagar sacrificed their lives whilst fighting alongside Ranas of Mewar against Muslim invaders. Raja Sagar was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan of Oswals. Sagar's son Prince Bohitya was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.\u00a0 Samdhar, a grandson of Bohitya and a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism.{{Multiple issues|\n{{Cleanup rewrite|date=April 2020}}\n{{More citations needed|date=April 2020}}\n}}\n\n{{Infobox settlement \n| name           = Delwara\n| other_name     = \n| settlement_type = Sub-Tehsil\n| image_skyline   = \n| image_alt               = \n| image_caption           = \n| nickname = \"Devkul Patan Nagri\"\n| pushpin_map             = India Rajasthan#India\n| pushpin_label_position  = right\n| pushpin_map_alt         = Delwara\n| pushpin_map_caption     = Location in Rajasthan, India\n| coordinates             = {{coord|24.7752|N|73.7463|E|display=inline,title}}\n| subdivision_type        = [[List of sovereign states|Country]]\n| subdivision_name        = {{IND}}\n| subdivision_type1       = [[States and union territories of India|State]]\n| subdivision_type2       = [[List of districts of India|District]]\n| subdivision_name1       = [[Rajasthan]]\n| subdivision_name2       = [[Rajsamand district|Rajsamand]]\n| established_date        = 224-215 BC\n| founder                 = \n| named_for               = \n| governing_body          = \n| leader_title            = \n| leader_name             = \n| unit_pref               = Metric\n| elevation_m             = 586\n| population_total        = 4429\n| population_as_of        = 2011\n| population_footnotes=<ref>http://censusindia.gov.in/</ref>\n| population_density_km2  = \n| literacy_rate = 76.7\n| demographics_type1     = Languages\n| demographics1_title1   = Official\n| demographics1_info1    = [[Hindi]]\n| demographics1_title2   = {{no wrap|Additional Official}}\n| demographics1_info2    = [[English language|English]]\n| demographics1_title3   = Regional\n| demographics1_info3   = [[Mewari language|Mewari]]\n| timezone1               = [[Indian Standard Time|IST]]\n| utc_offset1             = +5:30\n| postal_code_type        = [[Postal Index Number|PIN]]\n| postal_code             = 313202\n| area_code               = +91- 2952\n| area_code_type          = Telephone code\n| registration_plate      = RJ-30\n| blank1_name_sec1        = Nearest Places \n| blank1_info_sec1        = [[Udaipur]], [[Nathdwara]], [[Rajsamand]], [[Haldighati]], [[Kumbhalgarh]], [[Chittorgarh]]\n| blank2_name_sec1        = [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|Climate]]\n| blank2_info_sec1        = [[Semi-arid climate#Hot semi-arid climates|BSh]]\n|}}\n__FORCETOC__\n\n== Historical & Spiritual Background of Temple Town \u2013 Delwara ==\nThe ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> \n\n<br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref>\n\n<br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhanatha]] (Rishabhdevbhagwan) and one of [[Parshvanatha]] (Parshvnathbhagwan). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]]. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujarat visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11<sup>th</sup> century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Ojha writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015). Udaipur Rajya ka Itihas Part 1 & 2 (Hindi). Rajasthani Granthaghar, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cThe information regarding genealogy of Deora Chauhans, available from the different books of \u2018Bhaats\u2019 (story tellers) and inscriptions, is full of contradictions and the names are at variance.

Sagar\u2019s son Bohitya became sharvak (Jain disciple) by the blessings of Vardhman Suri Khartar\u201d.'' </blockquote>\nRaja Sagar fought against Muslim invaders<br>\nDuring 12<sup>th</sup> century, Rao Samant Singh of Jalore had four sons \u2013 Rao Kanhadeo, Maldeo, Raningdeo and Sagar. Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century?

Delwara was originally known as \u2018Devkul Patan Nagri\u2019 which means the town of god, boasted of over 1500 temples at one time, out of which there were about 400 [[Jain temples]]. The ancient [[Jain temples]] of Delwara, now in total ruins, are believed to have been built during the reign of Samrat [[Samprati]] (224-215 BC). He was grandson of Samrat Ashoka and son of Ashoka's blind son Kunal. [[Samprati]] became the Emperor of entire western and southern part of [[India]] ([[Maurya Empire]]) and ruled from [[Ujjain]]. It is said that [[Samprati]], also known as \u2018Jain Ashoka\u2019, built thousands of [[Jain temples]] in India. It may be noted that all the ancient Jain monuments of Rajasthan and Gujarat, including the [[Jain temples]] at Delwara (Mewar), are also attributed to Samrat [[Samprati]].<ref>Sharma, Suresh K.; Sharma, Usha (2004), Cultural and Religious Heritage of India: Jainism, Mittal Publications, {{ISBN|978-81-7099-957-7}}</ref><ref>[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samprati Samprati - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nDelwara, Nagda and Aayad were the centers of learning and culture before 15<sup>th</sup> century AD. Most princes of Mewar and adjoining kingdoms were groomed in the art of warfare and formal education at Delwara. Hence it was also known as Kunwarpada \u2013 center of learning. Delwara was a large town and spread from Gandharva Sagar Lake to [[Nagda]]. Today only 25% of the original town remains.<ref name=\"Prof Harak Lal Pamecha 2013\">Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><br>\nAs on 2017, three main [[Jain temples]] remain in Delwara, for which good restoration work has been undertaken. Two of the temples are of [[Rishabhanatha]] (Rishabhdevbhagwan) and one of [[Parshvanatha]] (Parshvnathbhagwan). [[Jain temples]] at Delwara were built with white marble stones. Despite being plain and austere on outside, the interiors of all these temples are covered with delicate carvings. Each has a walled courtyard called Rang Mandap. In the center of the courtyard is the shrine with the image of the deity, [[Rishabhdeo|Rishabhdev]] and [[Parshvanatha|Parshvnath]]. Around the large courtyard, there are numerous small shrines, each housing a beautiful sculpture of the 24 [[Tirthankara]] with a series of elegantly carved pillars from the entrance to the courtyard. The special feature of these temples is its ceiling, which is circular in eleven richly carved concentric rings. The central ceiling of the temple is adorned with magnificent carving and it culminates into ornamented central pendant. The pendant of the domes tapers down forming a drop or point, like a lotus flower. This is an astonishing piece of work. It symbolizes the divine grace coming down to fulfill human aspirations. The figure of sixteen Vidya-devis (goddesses of knowledge) are carved on the ceiling.\n\n=== Why [[Jain temples]] at [[Mt. Abu]] are called Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]? <ref>Prof Roshan Jain, Principal, Pannadhai B.Ed. Collage, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref><ref>Prof Harak Lal Pamecha, Retired, Sr lecturer at Senior Secondary School, Delwara (2013) \u2013 in conversation with</ref> ===\nThere is a story that the minsters of the Solanki rulers of Gujarat visited these temples during 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> centuries AD and were much impressed with the architecture and carving of the temples. At the request of these visiting ministers, then rulers of Delwara (Mewar), provided the design and drawings of the [[Jain temples]]. Vimal Shah,the minister, governor of Chandravati and commander in chief of Bhimadev I (1022\u201364), the Solanki ruler of Gujarat,came to Delwara. He was inspired by Jain Acharya to wash out his sins perpetrated in the battle fields, hence constructed a temple near Mount Abu which was the replication of Delwara (Mewar) Jain temple. The temple is known as Vimal Vasahi (Shri Adinath temple). He was remorseful and spent the rest of his life in religious discourse at Chandravati (near Abu road). Later, in 1230, the two Porwad brothers \u2013 Vastupal and Tejpal, both ministers of a Virdhaval, the Vaghela ruler of Gujarat, came to Delwara. They also built the [[Jain temples]] designed after Vimal Vasahi temples near Abu. Since these five temples, built between 11<sup>th</sup> and 13<sup>th</sup> century at Abu, are similar in design and architecture to the ones at Delwara (Mewar), came to be known as Dilwara (Delwara) [[Jain temples]]. The Dilwara temples are a composite cluster of five temples, with their own unique identity. Each is named after the small village in which it is located. The grandeur of sculptured marble, exquisite carvings of ceilings, domes, pillars and arches of the temple which is beyond anyone's expectations, is far superior to the originals at Delwara (Mewar).\n\n== Arrival of Chauhans to Aravalli\u2019s of South West [[Rajasthan]] ==\nThe Chauhans during 11<sup>th</sup> century founded Amber, [[Sambhar, Rajasthan|Sambhar]] and [[Ajmer]] in Rajputana. The last of them, Vigraha Raja or Rao Bisaldeo, in the middle of the 12<sup>th</sup> century extended the ancestral dominions considerably and conquered [[Delhi]] from a chief of the Tomara clan. At that time, according to their own bard, the dominions of the Chauhans extended north to Hissar and south to the [[Aravalli]] hills. After Prithviraj Chauhan III was killed in a battle in 1192, the Chauhan kingdom was broken up. <br>\nThe Chauhan clan of Rajputs, ruled over a large area of South Western Rajasthan and Gujarat. Alhana, younger son of Wakpati Rao Chauhan, seized Nadol (near Jodhpur) from the Paramaras and established himself there toward the end of the 10<sup>th</sup> century. His descendant, Kirtipal (Keytu) was driven from Nadol by Sultan Qutbud-din Aibak of Delhi, during the 12<sup>th</sup> century. Kirtipal, then journeyed further to the south-west to Bhinmal and Sanchor, before seizing Jalore from the Paramaras. Some of his descendants were known as Sanchora Chauhans. Rao Kirtipal, the youngest son of Alhana, ruler of [[Nadol]], is the founder of the [[Jalore]] line of Chauhans. He captured it from the Paramaras in 1181. Kirtipalwas progenitor of Songara clan of Chauhans. He died in 1182 and was succeeded by his son Samar Singh.<ref>Dr Mohanlal Gupta. Jalore ka Rajnitik Evem Sanskritik Itihas (Hindi). Shubhda Prakash, Jodhpur</ref><br>\nChauhans have 26 major sects - Hada, Songara, Deora, Khichi, Shambhri, Sanchora, Pavia, Goyalwal, Bhadauria, Malani, Nirwan, Puravia, Madrecha, Cheeba, Mohil, Chahil, Balecha, Chachera, Boda, Nadola, Nikumbh,..etc. It is said that Rao Bisaldeo was the progenitor of the Deora clan. Prithviraj Chauhan III was nephew of Rao Bisaldeo. In ages past, the rulers of Jalore, Chandravati and Sirohi belonged to the Songara and Deora clans.<br>\n\n== Songara and Deora Chauhans in Mewar ==\nIt is said that around 1172\u201380, King of Jalore, Rao Kirtipal (Keytu, a Songara Chauhan), captured Ahar(now Ayad), then capital of Mewar, from Rawal Kshem Singh or Samant Singh. In 1172, Rawal Samant Singh of Mewar was forced to move his capital from Ahar to Dungarpur. Samant Singh and his younger brother Kumar Singh ruled from Dungarpur.<ref>[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mewar#cite_note-Naravane-1 Mewar - Wikipedia<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> However, Ahar and the adjoining area of Mewar, was ruled by Songara / Deora Chauhans for few years, till they were recovered by Rawal Kumar Singh. Interregnum, the brothers and cousins of Songara / Deora Chauhans were perhaps given the Jagirs in the Girva \u2013 the villages surrounded by Aravalli hills of the present-day Udaipur city. Jagirdars of Girva were called Raja. There is no historical record or manuscript of Mewar / Jalore state narrating that Rawal Samant Singh was dislodged by Keytu of Jalore.  However, the extract of personal dairy written in 1939 by Mathuranath Purohit, Master of Ceremonies, Mewar, states,<ref>Dr Rajendranath Purohit, Senior Research Fellow, Oriental Institute of Research, Udaipur (2013) \u2013 in conversation with.</ref><br>\n\n<blockquote>''\u201cKeytu Chauhan, the King of Nadol snatched Ahar from Samant Singh, after defeating him in a battle. Samant Singh went to Vagad and established Dungarpur state. Later Rawal Kumar Singh, younger brother of Rawal Samant Singh, recaptured Ahar, the capital of Mewar\u201d''.</blockquote>\n\nThis fact is also established by the existence of an Ashapura temple on a hill top at village Berwas, between Ahar and Debari region of Udaipur. Also, according to local dialect the village of Debari, adjacent to Berwas, means Deora-ki-Bari, meaning \u2018Window to Deora Kingdom\u2019. However, according to Mewar's eminent historian and writer, Dr Shri KrishanJugnu, \u201cDebarimeans window to God\u2019s kingdom (Dev-bari)\u201d. There, is an inscription put up in 1975 during renovation of Ashapura Mata temple, \u201cTemple of the Kul deity (family idol) of Deora Chauhans was initially made by Raja Munjerao Deora of Girva in 1528\u201d (during the times of Maharana Ratan Singh II, 1528\u20131531). To date the temple is managed by Deora Chauhans. <br>\nThe Udaipur Girva too has number of villages which are inhabited by Deora Chauhans. There are many families of Deora Chauhans in Delwara, which is very close to Udaipur and on the periphery of Girva. It is therefore, quite possible that one Raja Sagar, fourth son of Rao Samant Singh of Jalore and a descendant of Rao Kirtipal, was bestowed the Jagir of Delwara during mid-13<sup>th</sup> century. It is believed that later Maharana Udai Singh II (1540\u20131572), annexed these Jagirs from Deora Chauhans to move his capital from Chittor to Udaipur when he lost Chittor to Akbar in 1568.<br>\nEminent historian, Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar Ojha writes,<ref>Rai Bahadur Gaurishankar H Ojha (2015). Udaipur Rajya ka Itihas Part 1 & 2 (Hindi). Rajasthani Granthaghar, Jodhpur</ref><br>\n<blockquote> ''\u201cThe information regarding genealogy of Deora Chauhans, available from the different books of \u2018Bhaats\u2019 (story tellers) and inscriptions, is full of contradictions and the names are at variance.

Rao Kanhadeo and his son Kunwar Viramdeo were killed in a battle against Allauddin Khilji in 1311, while Rao Maldeo and Rao Raningdeo ruled smaller Jagirs in Jalore. It is believed that Rao Sagar was given the Jagir of Delwara, as the adjoining areas of Girva (Udaipur) were ruled by Deora Chauhans until 14-15<sup>th</sup> century.<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.org/britishraj/Tod1/bk04ch05.html#fn925 Chapter 5<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> <br>\nThere is another bard's tale that during 12<sup>th</sup> Century, Delwara was being ruled by a Rajput ruler Rao Bhim Singh. His only daughter was married to Rao Samant Singh of Jalore, who had two queens. Sagar was born to Delwara Baiji. Due to differences with the other queen over succession to the throne of Jalore, she returned to her father's place, Delwara. Since Rao Bhim Singh, did not have any male child, his grandson Sagar, a Deora Chauhan, ascended the throne of Delwara.<ref>Seth Rajmal Lalwani; Sukhsampat Raj Bhandari and others (1939).

He was the progenitor of Bachhawat clan. Raja Sagar was blessed with three sons - Bohitya, Gangadas and Jaisingh. Whenever there was invasion from Muslims, Rana Jaitra Singh (1213\u201353) called Raja Sagar for help in the battle. Raja Sagar always came along with army and fought valiantly against the invading Muslims.<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\">Jaysom Pathak and Guna Vinaya-1594 (1980).

While he ensured full protection for Jaitra Singh, as Delwada's army fought fearlessly alongside Mewar army. Iltutmish destroyed temples after temples in and around Nagda and Delwara. The villages were burnt. <br>\nDr Shri Krishan Jugnu, writes in his book, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh<ref>Dr Shri Krishan Jugnu, Nandeshma Abhilekh \u2013 Rajasthan Ke Prachin Abhilekh (2015).

Besides Gohils, there were brave soldiers from Chauhans, Chandanas, Solankis, Parmars, Chaarans and Tribals who fought for Mewar. They gave a tough fight to Sultan\u2019s army. However, when Jaitra Singh was cornered, he was secretly sheltered in one of the houses in Nagda. Iltutmish was furious and encircled Nagda. Every house was searched, burnt and destroyed. In 14<sup>th</sup> century, according to a mythological tradition of offeringwater tribute to the martyrs of Bhutalghati, a lake was built at Nagda and christened as BaaghelaTaalab.\u201d There is another bard that says, Maharana Mokal built this lake in memory of his brother Baagh Singh.''</blockquote>\n\n===Raja Bohitya sacrifices his life for Mewar===\nRaja Sagar's son Raja Bohitya was also brave and intelligent like his father and ruled Delwara during the time of Rawal Samar Singh (1273\u20131302) and Rana Ratan Singh (1302\u20131303). Once, apprehending danger to his life from the Muhammadans, Bohitya sought refuge in a Jain Temple at Delwara. It is believed that he was immensely influenced and inspired by Jain philosophy.<ref name=autogenerated1>Bhanwarlal Nahata (2009). Mantri Karam Chand Bachhawat. Prakrit Bharati Academy, Jaipur; BJ Nahata Foundation, Calcutta.</ref><br>\nOne day while Bohitya was asleep in his palace, a snake climbed the bed and bit him on his legs. After biting, the snake hit the prince with his tail and descended from the bed. Prince got up with fright and asked for help. There was commotion in the palace and Raja Sagar came to know of it. The Raja asked the prince, \u201cWhat happened?\u201d The prince replied, \u201cSnake has bitten me\u201d. Raja tried to save him but in vain. People looked around for the snake but couldn't find one. The prince's leg became blue and body turned cold. Knowing that the prince was dead, they took him for the final journey of cremation. At that time the disciples (bhattarack) of Acharya Jindutt Suriji who were out for \u2018Gochari\u2019 (collecting food and alms) saw the funeral procession of the prince. They started discussing among themselves. One disciple said, \u201cThe prince is not dead. Why are they taking him for cremation?\u201d<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\nThe Mantri of Raja Sagar, who was passing by, heard the conversation and informed the King. Thus, the life of Prince Bohitya was saved and he was brought back to the palace. Since then Bohitya and his family developed deep faith in Jainism and started paying obeisance to Jain Acharyas and their disciples in Delwara. Bahrang Devi, wife of Raja Bohitya, was a beautiful and talented lady and lived in Delwara. She had eight sons - Shree Karan, Jaiso, Jaimal, Nanha, Bhima, Padam, Somji and Pushmal. \nWhen Sultan Allauddin Khilji captured Chittor, Rani Padmani (wife of Rana Ratan Singh I) and several hundred other court ladies threw themselves into a fire \u2013 committed Jauhar.  Khilji seized the Fort of Chittor and the fort was made over to Rao Maldeo, son of Rao Samant Singh, a Chauhan Chief in Jalore for governance. Incidentally, Rao Maldeo was uncle of Raja Bohitya. Both Rana Ratan Singh I and his cousin Rawal Laksh (Lakshman Singh) were killed in the battle. Raja Bohitya too sacrificed his life in the battle, while fighting alongside Rana Ratan Singh I against Allauddin Khilji in 1303. Later Maharana Hamir Singh I (1326\u201364), successor of Sisodia clan, married the daughter of Rao Maldeo.<ref>Lalit K. Mehta (1999). Caste, Clan, and Ethnicity: A Study of Mehtas in Rajasthan.

Shree Karan was a kind-hearted king. Raja Shree Karan won Machindragarh (present day village Machind near Kumbhalgarh) in a battle and was bestowed the title of Rana. At one time around mid-14<sup>th</sup> Century the soldiers of RanaShree Karan looted the treasury of Sultan Muhammad Bin Tughluk while his army was on a passage through Aravalli's from Delhi to Gujarat.<ref>Lakshman Singh Mehta (1983).

Rana Shree Karan was killed in the battle while assisting MaharanaHamir Singh I.Muhammad Bin Tughlug was released after paying 50 lakh Rupees, 100 elephants and several districts.

Samdhar, a Deora Chauhan, was the first man in his genealogy to convert to Jainism from the saint and scholar of Khartargachh, Shree Jineshwar Suri Maharaj. Thereafter his descendants became merged in the premier merchant community of Oswals and established matrimonial relation with Jain-Oswal community. He chose Bohotra (Bothra) as the name for his clan on the name of his grandfather Bohitya. Samdhar and all hisbrothers became the followers of Jainism and organised sangh yatra. Thus, he received the title of Sanghpati. Samdhar was blessed by a son named Tejpal.\u201d''<ref name=\"Guna Vinaya-1594 1980\"/></blockquote>\nAfter the death of Samdhar, Tejpal became Sanghpati. He gifted gold, horses, elephants, etc. to the King of Gurjar \u2013 Patan (Anhilpur) and the King pleased with his friendship gifted him some part of his region to administer. He successfully ruled the people and helped the poor and needy by providing alms. Tejpal was blessed with a son -Vilha, from his wife Tara Devi.Later on, Tejpal took santhara (fast until death - left all food) and died. After his death, Vilha became Sanghpati. He was very rich but also very philanthropic. He gave generous donations, especially for Jain religion and honoured the sadhvis and shravaks. He had three sons - Kadua, Dharma and Nanda. After Vilha's death, his elder son Kadua became Sanghpati and went to Chittor to settle down. Later his descendant Bachhraj became Dewan of Jodhpur and founding Dewan of Bikaner. Bachhraj's descendants were known as Bachhawats.<ref name=autogenerated1 />\n\n==Delwara after Deora Chauhans==\nLater, the Kingdom of Mewar was divided into 16 first grade thikanas or districts. Delwara was one of the 16 Rajwadas, along with Badi Sadri and Gogunda. Delwara has been ruled by Jhala Rajputs from 15<sup>th</sup> Century onwards. The ancestor of the Jhala family was Raj Sahib Raidharji Vogohoji of Dhrangadhara (Halvad), son of Harpal Makwana. During the reign of Maharana Raimal (1473\u20131509), Ajoji (Ajja Singh Jhala) the deposed son of Raj Sahib Raidharji, along with his brother Sajoji (Sajja Singh Jhala) came to Mewar. Jhalas performed meritorious service in Mewar. Later the Maharana granted the Jagir of Delwara to Kunwar Sajja and that of Bari Sadri to Kunwar Ajja Singh and were granted the title of Raj Rana. <br> \nAjja fought alongside Maharana Sangram Singh I (1509\u20131527) against Babur in 1527 at the Battle of Khanwa. When Maharana Sangram Singh (Rana Sanga) was wounded on the battlefield, Ajja donned the Maharana's tunic, which kept the Mewar army together but proved fatal for Raj Rana Ajja, who died in the battle. As many as 7 generations of the Jhala family had been sacrificing their lives for Maharanas of Mewar.<ref name=autogenerated2 /> <br>\nWho ruled Delwara after Deora Chauhans left in 14<sup>th</sup> century till Jhalas came in 15<sup>th</sup> century?

Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English, though ''TIBS'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u026a|b|z}}, \"Trans-Island Bus Service\") and ''CISCO'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|s|k|o\u028a}}, \"Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation\") are found.<ref>Brown, ''Singapore English in a Nutshell'', above, p. 112.</ref>\n* [[Initialism]]s, in which the individual letters are spelled out. This is by far the most common category in Singapore, including ''PAP'' (\"[[People's Action Party]]\") and ''PIE'' (\"[[Pan-Island Expressway]]\"), which are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|e\u026a|_|\u02c8|p|i\u02d0}} and {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|a\u026a|_|\u02c8|i\u02d0}} respectively and never {{IPA|*/\u02c8p\u00e6p/}} and {{IPA|*/\u02c8pa\u026a/}}. Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym,<ref>Low & Brown, ''English in Singapore'', above, p. 70.</ref> but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories.<ref>Deterding, ''Singapore English'', above, p. 77.</ref>\n\nInitialisms are extremely common in Singapore, and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent. One example is the [[Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital]], which is more commonly referred to as ''KK''.\n\nThe most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions. Among the earliest examples are ''PUB'' (\"Public Utilities Board\") and ''HDB'' (\"Housing Development Board\"). Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English, and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English. Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms, so they occur even in non-English publications. Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English, abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore English.\n\nThere are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms. Three letters are used for government institutions (''PUB'', ''HDB'', ''CPF'', ''MOH'', ''CWO'') and for expressways (''AYE'', ''PIE'', ''KJE''), while two letters are used for polytechnics (''SP'', ''RP''). To maintain this consistency, some abbreviations are not direct initials; for example ''CTE'' is used for \"Central Expressway\"  instead of *''CE'', and ''NP'' is used for \"Ngee Ann Polytechnic\" instead of *''NAP''. When the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (''NTU'') was established in 1991, the name was chosen instead of the alternative \"Nanyang University of Technology\" because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable ''NUT''. While [[Anderson Secondary School]] has shortened its name to ''ANDSS'' instead of ''ASS''.\n\nRecently, there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations, such as ''A*STAR'' for ''Agency for Science, Technology and Research''.) When ''SAFTI'' (Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute) was reorganised in 1995, it acquired the name [[SAFTI Military Institute]], further abbreviated as ''SAFTI MI'', which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title ''Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute Military Institute''.\n\n==Abbreviations==\n\n===0\u20139===\n*'''4D''' -

The most prominent are the three-letter abbreviations of the expressways in Singapore; all, except one, end with the letter \"E\":\n* '''AYE''' - [[Ayer Rajah Expressway]]\n* '''BKE''' - [[Bukit Timah Expressway]]\n* '''CTE''' - [[Central Expressway, Singapore|Central Expressway]]\n* '''ECP''' - [[East Coast Parkway]]\n* '''KJE''' - [[Kranji Expressway]]\n* '''KPE''' - [[Kallang-Paya Lebar Expressway]]\n* '''MCE''' - [[Marina Coastal Expressway]]\n* '''NSE''' - [[North\u2013South Expressway (Singapore)|North-South Expressway]]\n* '''PIE''' - [[Pan Island Expressway]]\n* '''SLE''' - [[Seletar Expressway]]\n* '''TPE''' - [[Tampines Expressway]]\n\nWith the introduction of the [[Expressway Monitoring and Advisory System]] (EMAS) in 1998, LED signboards were installed along the expressways to display warning and other informational messages to road users.

Creation of acronyms such as this is rare in Singapore English, though ''TIBS'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|t|\u026a|b|z}}, \"Trans-Island Bus Service\") and ''CISCO'' ({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|s|\u026a|s|k|o\u028a}}, \"Commercial and Industrial Security Corporation\") are found.<ref>Brown, ''Singapore English in a Nutshell'', above, p. 112.</ref>\n* [[Initialism]]s, in which the individual letters are spelled out. This is by far the most common category in Singapore, including ''PAP'' (\"[[People's Action Party]]\") and ''PIE'' (\"[[Pan-Island Expressway]]\"), which are pronounced {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|e\u026a|_|\u02c8|p|i\u02d0}} and {{IPAc-en|\u02cc|p|i\u02d0|_|\u02cc|a\u026a|_|\u02c8|i\u02d0}} respectively and never {{IPA|*/\u02c8p\u00e6p/}} and {{IPA|*/\u02c8pa\u026a/}}. Some analysts regard initialisms such as these as one kind of acronym,<ref>Low & Brown, ''English in Singapore'', above, p. 70.</ref> but others prefer to distinguish between the two categories.<ref>Deterding, ''Singapore English'', above, p. 77.</ref>\n\nInitialisms are extremely common in Singapore, and many have become better known and more widely used than the full form of the words they represent. One example is the [[Kandang Kerbau Women's and Children's Hospital]], which is more commonly referred to as ''KK''.\n\nThe most important category of Singapore initialisms are those for government departments and public institutions. Among the earliest examples are ''PUB'' (\"Public Utilities Board\") and ''HDB'' (\"Housing Development Board\"). Abbreviations such as these were especially important in the past when most Singaporeans were not educated in English, and their use facilitated communication in the public services where the main administrative language is English. Government departments have therefore promoted the use of these initialisms, so they occur even in non-English publications. Although the younger generation of Singaporeans are now all educated in English, abbreviations remain a major characteristic of Singapore English.\n\nThere are efforts to maintain some consistency among the initialisms. Three letters are used for government institutions (''PUB'', ''HDB'', ''CPF'', ''MOH'', ''CWO'') and for expressways (''AYE'', ''PIE'', ''KJE''), while two letters are used for polytechnics (''SP'', ''RP''). To maintain this consistency, some abbreviations are not direct initials; for example ''CTE'' is used for \"Central Expressway\"  instead of *''CE'', and ''NP'' is used for \"Ngee Ann Polytechnic\" instead of *''NAP''. When the [[Nanyang Technological University]] (''NTU'') was established in 1991, the name was chosen instead of the alternative \"Nanyang University of Technology\" because the latter would have resulted in the unsuitable ''NUT''. While [[Anderson Secondary School]] has shortened its name to ''ANDSS'' instead of ''ASS''.\n\nRecently, there have emerged a number of unconventional abbreviations, such as ''A*STAR'' for ''Agency for Science, Technology and Research''.) When ''SAFTI'' (Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute) was reorganised in 1995, it acquired the name [[SAFTI Military Institute]], further abbreviated as ''SAFTI MI'', which when fully expanded would form a rather awkward title ''Singapore Armed Forces Training Institute Military Institute''.\n\n==Abbreviations==\n\n===0\u20139===\n*'''4D''' -

Runstein  ''Modern Recording Techniques'', Focal Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-240-81069-4}}, page 117</ref>\nIt is best known as a convenient power source for [[condenser microphone]]s, though many active [[DI unit|direct box]]es also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.\n\nPhantom power supplies are often built into [[mixing console]]s, [[microphone preamplifiers]] and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.\n\n==History==\nPhantom powering was used in [[telephone]] systems since the introduction of the rotary-dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a [[Direct current|DC]] signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems. The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9\u201312 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the [[Nagra]] IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support \"negative phantom\" until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.\n\nIn 1966, [[Neumann GmbH]] presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48 V available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-V phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.\n\n==Standards==\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee's \"Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability\" (IEC 61938:2018) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/30762|title=IEC 61938:2018 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}</ref> Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48.

A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for \"P48\" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]\n\n[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]\n\nPhantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.<ref group=\"note\">There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]</ref>\n\nWith phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as \"parallel powering\" or \"T-powering\" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.\n\nThe IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|k\u03a9]] for 48 V, 1.2 k\u03a9 for 24 V, and 680 \u03a9 for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&nbsp;k\u03a9 value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%<ref>http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm</ref> or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.\n\nNearly all modern [[mixing console|mixing consoles]] have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any  channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.\n\n[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:AKG C1000S microphone, open.jpg|right|thumb|[[AKG C1000|AKG C1000S]] showing battery]]\n\nSome microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.\n\nPhantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.\n\nMid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2\u20134&nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4\u20135&nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC (\"Colette\") series and Josephson microphones, 5\u20136&nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone. If its required current is not available, a microphone may still put out a signal, but it cannot deliver its intended level of performance. The specific symptoms vary somewhat, but the most common result will be reduction of the maximum sound-pressure level that the microphone can handle without overload (distortion). Some microphones will also show lower sensitivity (output level for a given sound-pressure level).\n\nMost [[ground lift]] switches have the unwanted effect of disconnecting phantom power. There must always be a DC current path between pin 1 of the microphone and the negative side of the 48 volt supply, if power is to reach the microphone's electronics. Lifting the ground, which is normally pin 1, breaks this path and disables the phantom power supply.\n\nThere is a common belief that connecting a dynamic or ribbon microphone to a phantom-powered input will damage it. There are three possibilities for this damage to occur. If there is a fault in the cable, phantom power may damage some mics by applying a voltage across the output of the microphone.<ref>{{cite web |quote=Sending Phantom Power to an old (prior to 1970 design) ribbon microphone without an isolating transformer, while using a bad cable, which has the ground (pin 1) shorted to pin 2 or pin 3 of the XLR.

Runstein  ''Modern Recording Techniques'', Focal Press 2009 {{ISBN|0-240-81069-4}}, page 117</ref>\nIt is best known as a convenient power source for [[condenser microphone]]s, though many active [[DI unit|direct box]]es also use it. The technique is also used in other applications where power supply and signal communication take place over the same wires.\n\nPhantom power supplies are often built into [[mixing console]]s, [[microphone preamplifiers]] and similar equipment. In addition to powering the circuitry of a microphone, traditional condenser microphones also use phantom power for polarizing the microphone's transducer element.\n\n==History==\nPhantom powering was used in [[telephone]] systems since the introduction of the rotary-dial telephone in 1919 before it was applied to condenser microphones. One such application in the telephone system was to provide a [[Direct current|DC]] signaling path around transformer connected amplifiers in analogue line transmission systems. The first known commercially available phantom-powered microphone was the [[Schoeps]] model CMT 20, which came out in 1964, built to the specifications of French radio with 9\u201312 volt DC phantom power; the positive pole of this powering was grounded. Microphone preamplifiers of the [[Nagra]] IV-series tape recorders offered this type of powering as an option for many years and Schoeps continued to support \"negative phantom\" until the CMT series was discontinued in the mid-1970s, but it is obsolete now.\n\nIn 1966, [[Neumann GmbH]] presented a new type of transistorized microphone to the [[Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation]], NRK. Norwegian Radio had requested phantom-powered operation. Since NRK already had 48 V available in their studios for their emergency lighting systems, this voltage was used for powering the new microphones (model KM 84), and is the origin of 48-V phantom power. This arrangement was later standardized in DIN 45596.\n\n==Standards==\nThe International Electrotechnical Commission Standards Committee's \"Multimedia systems - Guide to the recommended characteristics of analogue interfaces to achieve interoperability\" (IEC 61938:2018) specifies parameters for microphone phantom power delivery.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/30762|title=IEC 61938:2018 {{!}} IEC Webstore|website=webstore.iec.ch|access-date=2016-04-19}}</ref> Three variants are defined by the document: P12, P24 and P48.

A microphone or other device can obtain DC power from either signal line to ground terminal, and two capacitors block this DC from appearing at the output. R1 and R2 should be 6.81k ohms for \"P48\" 48 volt phantom. R3-6 and [[Zener diode]]s 1-4 protect the output to a maximum of 10v.]]\n\n[[File:Audio-Technica AT8801 Phantom Power Supply.jpg|thumb|right| An external phantom power supply.]]\n\nPhantom powering consists of a [[phantom circuit]] where direct current is applied equally through the two [[Signaling (telecommunication)|signal]] lines of a [[balanced audio connector]] (in modern equipment, both pins 2 and 3 of an [[XLR connector]]). The supply voltage is referenced to the ground pin of the connector (pin 1 of an XLR), which normally is connected to the cable shield or a ground wire in the cable or both. When phantom powering was introduced, one of its advantages was that the same type of balanced, shielded microphone cable that studios were already using for [[dynamic microphone]]s could be used for condenser microphones. This is in contrast to microphones with [[Vacuum tube|vacuum-tube]] circuitry, most of which require special, multi-conductor cables.<ref group=\"note\">There are phantom-powered vacuum tube microphones, such as the [http://www.microtechgefell.com/index.php/en/microphones/studio-a-recording/large-membrane-tube-mics/340-um900-roehrenmikrofon Microtech Gefell UM900] and [http://www.audio-technica.com/cms/wired_mics/187139bf88c8539d/index.html/ Audio-Technica AT3060]</ref>\n\nWith phantom power, the supply voltage is effectively invisible to balanced microphones that do not use it, which includes most dynamic microphones. A balanced signal consists only of the differences in voltage between two signal lines; phantom powering places the same DC voltage on both signal lines of a balanced connection. This is in marked contrast to another, slightly earlier method of powering known as \"parallel powering\" or \"T-powering\" (from the German term ''Tonaderspeisung''), in which DC was overlaid directly onto the signal in differential mode. Connecting a conventional microphone to an input that had parallel powering enabled could very well damage the microphone.\n\nThe IEC 61938 Standard defines 48-volt, 24-volt, and 12-volt phantom powering. The signal conductors are positive, both fed through resistors of equal value (6.81 [[kilohm|k\u03a9]] for 48 V, 1.2 k\u03a9 for 24 V, and 680 \u03a9 for 12 V), and the shield is [[ground (electricity)|ground]]. The 6.81&nbsp;k\u03a9 value is not critical, but the resistors must be matched to within 0.1%<ref>http://sound.whsites.net/project96.htm</ref> or better to maintain good [[Common-mode rejection ratio|common-mode rejection]] in the circuit. The 24-volt version of phantom powering, proposed quite a few years after the 12 and 48 V versions, was also included in the DIN standard and is in the IEC standard, but it was never widely adopted by equipment manufacturers.\n\nNearly all modern [[mixing console|mixing consoles]] have a switch for turning phantom power on or off; in most high-end equipment this can be done individually by channel, while on smaller mixers a single master switch may control power delivery to all channels. Phantom power can be blocked in any  channel with a 1:1 isolation transformer or blocking capacitors. Phantom powering can cause equipment malfunction or even damage if used with cables or adapters that connect one side of the input to ground, or if certain equipment other than microphones is connected to it.\n\n[[Instrument amplifier]]s rarely provide phantom power. To use equipment requiring it with these amplifiers, a separate power supply must be inserted into the line. These are readily available commercially, or alternatively are one of the easier projects for the amateur electronics constructor.\n\n==Caveats==\n[[File:AKG C1000S microphone, open.jpg|right|thumb|[[AKG C1000|AKG C1000S]] showing battery]]\n\nSome microphones offer a choice of internal battery powering or (external) phantom powering. In some such microphones it is advisable to remove the internal batteries when phantom power is being used since batteries may corrode and leak chemicals. Other microphones are specifically designed to switch over to the internal batteries if an external supply fails, which may be useful.\n\nPhantom powering is not always implemented correctly or adequately, even in professional-quality preamps, mixers, and recorders. In part this is because first-generation (late-1960s through mid-1970s) 48-volt phantom-powered condenser microphones had simple circuitry and required only small amounts of operating current (typically less than 1&nbsp;[[Milliampere|mA]] per microphone), so the phantom supply circuits typically built into recorders, mixers, and preamps of that time were designed on the assumption that this current would be adequate. The original DIN 45596 phantom-power specification called for a maximum of 2&nbsp;mA. This practice has carried forward to the present; many 48-volt phantom power supply circuits, especially in low-cost and portable equipment, simply cannot supply more than 1 or 2&nbsp;mA total without breaking down. Some circuits also have significant additional resistance in series with the standard pair of supply resistors for each microphone input; this may not affect low-current microphones much, but it can disable microphones that need more current.\n\nMid-1970s and later condenser microphones designed for 48-volt phantom powering often require much more current (e.g., 2\u20134&nbsp;mA for Neumann transformerless microphones, 4\u20135&nbsp;mA for the Schoeps CMC (\"Colette\") series and Josephson microphones, 5\u20136&nbsp;mA for most [[Shure]] KSM-series microphones, 8&nbsp;mA for CAD Equiteks and 10&nbsp;mA for Earthworks). The IEC standard gives 10&nbsp;mA as the maximum allowed current per microphone.

Joe Kozenczak (Riley) becomes concerned that local businessman John Wayne Gacy (Dennehy) may be responsible for this as well as many other disappearances. However, when he and his team are ready to arrest Gacy, their evidence is viewed as being circumstantial.

Meanwhile, Gacy himself begins a sadistic game of [[cat and mouse|cat-and-mouse]] as he tries in every way to manipulate and outwit the police.\n\nAfter eventually achieving two search warrants, Kozenczak finds a large amount of incriminating evidence, as well as 29 bodies buried throughout John Gacy's property; the remaining four are found dumped in a nearby river, including Gant's remains. Afterwards, he is charged with the rape and murder of 33 boys and young men and convicted, being sentenced to death.\n\n== Impact/Reception ==\n\nThe film was broadcast in three countries, the [[United States]], [[Canada]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-13/entertainment/ca-1440_1_eye-view|title=TV Reviews :  'To Catch a Killer' a Cop's-Eye View of Gacy Case|last=ROSENBERG|first=HOWARD|date=1992-05-13|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-10-16|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}</ref><ref>[https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/schedules/bbcone/london/1994-08-19 ''bbc.co.uk: 19 August 1994'']</ref> In general, the film was received well by critics.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich name, meaning Third Realm or Third Empire, alluded to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahnen]]'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]] or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136\u2013137}} Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of 1932]], the NSDAP was the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=87}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See|History of Germany}}\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] became Germany's head of state, with the title of ''[[F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', in 1934.]]\n\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)}}\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the [[German National People's Party]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=293, 302}} Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set afire]]. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}}\n\nIn March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=196}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=358\u2013359}} On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party \u2013 their former coalition partners \u2013 and they disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a [[one-party state]] with the passage of a law decreeing the NSDAP to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=201}} The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the NSDAP established.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=199}} Further elections [[November 1933 German parliamentary election|in November 1933]], [[German election and referendum, 1936|1936]], and [[German election and referendum, 1938|1938]] were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the NSDAP and a small number of independents elected.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=109, 637}}\n\n=== Nazification of Germany ===\n{{Main|Gleichschaltung}}\n[[File:Weimar Republic states map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|While the [[States of the Weimar Republic|traditional German states]] were not formally abolished (excluding [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] [[Greater Hamburg Act|in 1937]]), their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended.

The largest states of Prussia and Bavaria are coloured in light grey and light blue respectively.]]\nThe Hitler cabinet used the terms of the Reichstag Fire Decree and later the Enabling Act to initiate the process of ''Gleichschaltung'' (\"co-ordination\"), which brought all aspects of life under party control.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=14}} Individual states not controlled by elected Nazi governments or Nazi-led coalitions were forced to agree to the appointment of Reich Commissars to bring the states in line with the policies of the central government. These Commissars had the power to appoint and remove local governments, state parliaments, officials, and judges. In this way Germany became a ''de facto'' [[unitary state]], with all state governments controlled by the central government under the NSDAP.{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=281\u201387}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=200}} The state parliaments and the ''[[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]]'' (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934,{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=109}} with all state powers being transferred to the central government.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=200}}\n\nAll civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members; these civic organisations either merged with the NSDAP or faced dissolution.{{sfn|Koonz|2003|p=73}} The Nazi government declared a \"Day of National Labor\" for [[May Day]] 1933, and invited many trade union delegates to Berlin for celebrations. The day after, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country; all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=202}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed in April, removed from their jobs all teachers, professors, judges, magistrates, and government officials who were Jewish or whose commitment to the party was suspect.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=268}} This meant the only non-political institutions not under control of the NSDAP were the churches.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}}\n\nThe Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic\u2014including the [[Flag of Germany|black, red, and gold tricolour flag]]\u2014and adopted reworked symbolism. The previous imperial black, white, and red tricolour was restored as one of Germany's two official flags; the second was the [[swastika flag]] of the NSDAP, which became the sole national flag in 1935. The NSDAP anthem \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\" (\"Horst Wessel Song\") became a second national anthem.{{sfn|Cuomo|1995|p=231}}\n\nGermany was still in a dire economic situation, as six million people were unemployed and the [[balance of trade]] deficit was daunting.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=54}} Using [[deficit spending]], public works projects were undertaken beginning in 1934, creating 1.7&nbsp;million new jobs by the end of that year alone.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=54}} Average wages began to rise.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=56}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe SA leadership continued to apply pressure for greater political and military power.

By the end of the war, occupation costs were calculated by the Nazis at 60&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks, with France alone paying 31.5&nbsp;billion. The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions.

G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50&nbsp;million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, {{convert|2000000|t|LT ST}} of fodder, {{convert|3000000|t|LT ST}} of potatoes, and {{convert|662000|t|LT ST}} of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12&nbsp;million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.

Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were killed. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were killed by the SS, the German Army, and ''Einsatzgruppen''. In [[Government of National Salvation|occupied Serbia]], 1,000 to 12,000 Romani were killed, while nearly all 25,000 Romani living in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] were killed.

By July 1933, radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=133\u2013135}} Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=136}}\n\n=== Censorship ===\n{{See also|List of authors banned in Nazi Germany}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, B\u00fccherverbrennung.jpg|thumb|A Nazi book burning on 10 May 1933 in Berlin, as books by Jewish and [[leftist]] authors are burned{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=16}}|alt=|left]]\nNewspapers, like other media, were controlled by the state; the Reich Press Chamber shut down or bought newspapers and publishing houses.

Under Goebbels, the Propaganda Ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely, especially regarding what to omit.{{sfn|Dussel|2010|pp=545, 555\u2013557}} Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=146\u2013147}} Propaganda became less effective towards the end of the war, as people were able to obtain information outside of official channels.{{sfn|Dussel|2010|pp=561}}\n\nAuthors of books left the country in droves and some wrote material critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths and the concept of [[blood and soil]]. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books\u2014most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters\u2014had been banned by the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=152\u2013159}} [[Nazi book burnings]] took place; nineteen such events were held on the night of 10 May 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=16}} Tens of thousands of books from dozens of figures, including [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Alfred Kerr]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Erich Maria Remarque]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Jakob Wassermann]], [[H.

The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], organised by Goebbels, ran in Munich from July to November 1937. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=171, 173}}\n\nComposer [[Richard Strauss]] was appointed president of the ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'' (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=187}} As was the case with other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable and for the most part disapproved of music that was too modern or [[atonal]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=199}} [[Jazz]] was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=204}} Hitler favoured the music of [[Richard Wagner]], especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories, and attended the [[Bayreuth Festival]] each year from 1933 to 1942.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=199\u2013200}}\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Nazism and cinema}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-106-29, Leni Riefenstahl bei Dreharbeiten.jpg|thumb|[[Leni Riefenstahl]] (behind cameraman) at the 1936 Summer Olympics|alt=|left]]\nMovies were popular in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over a billion people in 1942, 1943 and 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=130}}{{sfn|SPIO, Department of Statistics}} By 1934, German regulations restricting currency exports made it impossible for US film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, [[Universum Film AG]] and [[Wien-Film|Tobis]], were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content.

The result was convictions of 1,426 people; 297 of these were sentenced to death and 279 to life in prison, with the remainder receiving lesser sentences. About 65 percent of the death sentences were carried out.{{sfn|Marcuse|2001|p=98}} Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, for example prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=295\u201396}}\n\nThe political programme espoused by Hitler and the NSDAP brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Europe.

While Evans remarks that the era \"exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity\",{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=56}} young neo-Nazis enjoy the shock value the use Nazi symbols or slogans provides.{{sfn|''The Economist''|2015}} The display or use of [[Nazi symbolism]] such as flags, [[swastika]]s, or greetings is illegal in Germany and Austria.{{sfn|''Strafgesetzbuch'', section 86a}}\n\nThe process of denazification, which was initiated by the Allies as a way to remove Nazi Party members was only partially successful, as the need for experts in such fields as medicine and engineering was too great. However, expression of Nazi views was frowned upon, and those who expressed such views were frequently dismissed from their jobs.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=748\u2013749}} From the immediate post-war period through the 1950s, people avoided talking about the Nazi regime or their own wartime experiences. While virtually every family suffered losses during the war has a story to tell, Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}}\n\nThe trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 and the broadcast of the television miniseries ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' in 1979 brought the process of ''[[Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung]]'' (coping with the past) to the forefront for many Germans.{{sfn|''The Economist''|2015}}{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}} Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school [[curriculum]] starting in the 1970s, people began researching the experiences of their family members.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The Third Reich name, meaning Third Realm or Third Empire, alluded to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahnen]]'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed a [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union]] and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]] or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the Soviet Union in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136\u2013137}} Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of 1932]], the NSDAP was the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=87}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See|History of Germany}}\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] became Germany's head of state, with the title of ''[[F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', in 1934.]]\n\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)}}\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the [[German National People's Party]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=293, 302}} Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set afire]]. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}}\n\nIn March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=196}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=358\u2013359}} On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party \u2013 their former coalition partners \u2013 and they disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a [[one-party state]] with the passage of a law decreeing the NSDAP to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=201}} The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the NSDAP established.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=199}} Further elections [[November 1933 German parliamentary election|in November 1933]], [[German election and referendum, 1936|1936]], and [[German election and referendum, 1938|1938]] were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the NSDAP and a small number of independents elected.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=109, 637}}\n\n=== Nazification of Germany ===\n{{Main|Gleichschaltung}}\n[[File:Weimar Republic states map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|While the [[States of the Weimar Republic|traditional German states]] were not formally abolished (excluding [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] [[Greater Hamburg Act|in 1937]]), their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended.

Germany imported and enslaved some 12&nbsp;million people from 20 European countries to work in factories and on farms. Approximately 75 percent were Eastern European.{{sfn|Beyer & Schneider}} Many were casualties of Allied bombing, as they received poor air raid protection.

By the end of the war, occupation costs were calculated by the Nazis at 60&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks, with France alone paying 31.5&nbsp;billion. The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions.

G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50&nbsp;million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, {{convert|2000000|t|LT ST}} of fodder, {{convert|3000000|t|LT ST}} of potatoes, and {{convert|662000|t|LT ST}} of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12&nbsp;million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.

This incident provided the pretext for a [[pogrom]] the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany.

Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were killed. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were killed by the SS, the German Army, and ''Einsatzgruppen''.
