When he was a child his parents were killed by Shintaro Kazama, a Tojo Clan affiliate Dojima Family lieutenant, who brought him to the Sunflower orphanage he financed. Later Kazama introduced Kiryu and Nishikiyama in the Dojima Family. Kazama became a father figure for Kiryu who supported him within the Family and years later when he was released from prison. Kiryu rose through the Tojo hierarchy and earned the nickname \"the Dragon of Dojima\" ({{Nihongo2|\u5802\u5cf6\u306e\u9f8d}}, ''D\u014djima no Ry\u016b'') because of the dragon tattoo on his back but the main reason was because he gained the victory fight against Keiji Shibusawa who wanted to be called the Dragon of Dojima in Yakuza 0. He was planning on starting his own subsidiary group until he took the blame for the murder of his boss, Sohei Dojima, to protect his best friend, Nishikiyama, and was imprisoned for ten years.\n\n'''Haruka Sawamura''' ({{Nihongo2|\u6fa4\u6751 \u9065}}, ''Sawamura Haruka'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|[[Debi Derryberry]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n:Portrayed by: Natsuo (''Like a Dragon'')\nBorn in 1996. 120&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Haruka is a young girl searching for her mother, Mizuki, who evidence seems to indicate is Yumi's younger sister. Haruka is also somehow connected to the money that went missing before Kiryu's release. A combination of these reasons and pure chance leave Haruka in Kiryu's tentative custody. Before arriving in Kamurocho, she too lived at the Sunflower Orphanage.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 2'', she is 10 years old. Haruka has lived with Kiryu as her stepfather since the events of the first game. In the beginning of the game she decided to spend some time in Sunshine Orphanage to not be a thorn in the way of Kiryu's investigation of Terada's murder. In chapter 11, she is kidnapped by Senguku and his men as they attempt to lure Kiryu to the Osaka castle to kill him; in the end he manages to defeat Sengoku's men and rescue Haruka with Ryuji's help.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 3'', she is 12 years old. Haruka is an orphan raised by Kiryu. Her mother was Yumi Sawamura, Kazuma Kiryu's childhood love and best friend Nishikiyama's fianc\u00e9e, while her father was Jingu, the head of the MBI. Haruka was abandoned at birth by her mother and grew up as an orphan until she met Kazuma Kiryu who took care of her as a father figure though she calls him ojisan (\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093) the Japanese equivalent for \"Uncle\".\n\nIn ''Yakuza 5'', she is 16 years old. 165&nbsp;cm. In 2012, Haruka has left the orphanage in Okinawa and is currently in Osaka pursuing her childhood dream of becoming an Idol.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 6'', Kiryu returns to Kamurocho to search for Haruka, only to find out that she has been left in a coma after a hit and run incident, and that she has an infant son, Haruto.\n\nIn the spinoff ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Of the End'', she was 14 years old, and kidnapped by a mysterious man.\n\n'''Goro Majima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u771f\u5cf6 \u543e\u6717}}, ''Majima Gor\u014d'')\n{{main|Goro Majima}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hidenari Ugaki]]|[[Mark Hamill]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n:Portrayed by: Goro Kishitani (''Like a Dragon'')\n \nA lieutenant of the Shimano family, Shimano's right-hand man and head of the Majima Family, Majima is an acquaintance of Kiryu with a twisted sense of loyalty. His temper and lack of mercy earned him the nickname \"the Mad Dog of the [[Shimano Family]]\". Because of his friendship with Kiryu he believed himself to be the only one entitled to kill him, and nearly died attempting to protect that right. Majima and Kiryu fight each other twice in the game, the first time in the batting cages and the second time in the soapland, Shangri-la.\n \t\nIn ''Yakuza 2'', with Shimano dead and his family now disbanded, the Majima Family leaves the Tojo Clan and establish themselves as a construction company. With Kage the Florist gone from Purgatory, Majima immediately takes over the secret society. Although no longer interested in the clan, he promises to help Kiryu fend off the Omi Alliance after fighting him once again at the Underground Coliseum. He later takes on all of the men sent to the town single-handed. Recklessly disarming the bomb in the Millennium Tower, Majima tells Kiryu to finish off Ryuji Goda and the Jingweon Mafia at the final showdown as he proclaims himself as the one destined to defeat him.\n \nIn 2006, with the Jingweon Mafia and the Omi Alliance dealt with, Kiryu meets with Majima at the top of Millennium Tower. Kazuma pleads with him once more to go back to the Tojo Clan to support the newly appointed Sixth Chairman, Daigo Dojima, as a contingency for any future troubles. Majima, reluctant at first since his construction company is now his responsibility, becomes intrigued by Kiryu's idea that he would be able to run amok and cause chaos for the survival of the clan. Majima then explains that he is only swayed by the strong, and implies that he will only accept this favour by force. After their fourth battle in the series, Majima loses and promises Kiryu he would return to the Tojo clan, leaving him to wonder what he had got himself into.\n \nIn 2008, suspected of betraying the Tojo Clan over the resort deal, Kiryu heads to Purgatory to meet with Majima to get his side of the story. Greeted by his large entourage of yakuza soldiers, Majima asks Kiryu to follow him to the now-defunct Underground Coliseum where they could talk quietly. Before Majima can answer any further questions, Kiryu must beat him first in the first official coliseum fight since its closure two years ago. After losing again to Kiryu, he reveals that he got involved for Daigo's sake and that he was also set up by Goh Hamazaki as a suspect of the clan's inner dispute. After saving Kiryu from Land Minister Suzuki's private army outside of the Diet Building, Majima offers to send his family in Okinawa as assistance, which Kiryu refuses. Majima wishes him luck and tells him not to be beaten by Mine and the CIA as he's the one going to kill him someday.\n \nIn 2010, the Majima Family has moved to the old Kazama Family office in the Millennium Tower. Majima follows the trail of Yasuko, determined to protect her for his old friend, Taiga Saejima. Majima is later reunited with Saejima at the batting cages where they fight before reminiscing. Majima recounts the story of how he lost his eye to Saejima, and Saejima comments that Majima's Kansai speech has improved. Majima is later arrested to keep him from being an obstacle in Munakata's plan.\n \nDuring the events of the zombie spinoff ''Of the End'' (''Dead Souls'' in English), Majima is watching old zombie films in his flat in Millennium Tower when it is put under quarantine. He escapes the tower only to receive a phone call saying that he is late for the grand opening of Kamurocho Hills, a skyscraper he helped to construct throughout the series. He arrives only to find that it too is under quarantine, and that he must protect the people holed up inside the tower from the zombie invaders. He helps to evacuate the refugees to Purgatory, but in the process gets bitten by a zombie. He fears he may soon become one, a fear that is reinforced when Kiryu and Asagi (a female SDF soldier) remark that his eye has started turning red. In despair, he walks over to the Champion District, where he finds an abandoned Sauna. Thinking he may be able to \"sweat out\" the zombie toxin, he decides to visit. He is not seen again until the end of the game, where it is revealed that the zombie who \"bit\" him was in fact a toothless old man and thus did not manage to break his skin. It is also revealed that the reason his eye has turned red is because he was suffering from hay fever.\n\nMajima's character is explored in more detail during the prequel ''Yakuza 0'', in which he is a 24-year-old former Yakuza and a playable protagonist along with Kiryu. In this game, Majima has a calmer demeanor that develops during a war between multiple families in a fight for a patch of land known as the empty lot.\n\n'''Shun Akiyama''' ({{Nihongo2|\u79cb\u5c71 \u99ff}}, ''Akiyama Shun'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]}}\n\nIntroduced in ''Yakuza 4'', Shun Akiyama was born 24 July 1978. Akiyama is a former homeless, he now owns Sky Finance, a loan company, as well as the [[hostess club]] Elise, which he started up using the money he gathered that fell from Millennium Tower in 2005. Once helped out by the yakuza Hiroaki Arai, he looked up to Arai as a potential new leader of Kamurocho who could eventually succeed the legendary Kazuma Kiryu.<br>\n\nAkiyama was an elite in his 20s, during which time he dated Eri, a woman who bears a striking resemblance to Yasuko/Lily. In 2005 he was framed for stealing from the bank and was fired. All of his remaining money was spent investigating who framed him, and his money eventually ran out without him finding an answer. He was then forced to sleep on the streets until one fateful night, when money appeared to fall from the sky. He gathered up a large amount of money, but it was stolen by a group of thugs. Arai retrieved the money for him, and he used it to set up a business. Akiyama meets a woman named Lily when she requests to borrow money from him. After a series of \"tests\" he agrees to lend her the money, though he knows he likely won't get it back. This angers Hana, his secretary, and she quits. Kido discovers the secret safe behind the bookcase in Akiyama's office, and steals 100 billion yen in cash.<br>\n\nLater in the game Akiyama uses his own money to lure the men to the Millennium Tower roof, where he fights Arai. He is shot by Munakata at the end, but a thick padding of bills, his last money, stops the bullet and saves his life.\n\nAlongside Sky Finance, he runs a hostess club and is considered to be an entrupenuer of some sort. Akiyama is considered to be quite lazy, often forgetting to clean his office and frequently neglects his duties. He also appears in ''Yakuza 5'', ''Yakuza 6: The Song of Life'' and during the events of the spinofff ''Of the End'' he teams up with Kiryu, Majima and Ryuji Goda to stop the zombie plague.\n\n'''Taiga Saejima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u51b4\u5cf6 \u5927\u6cb3}}, ''Saejima Taiga'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rikiya Koyama]]}}\n\nBorn 2 June 1965. A 45-year-old physically imposing former yakuza who was sentenced to death for having killed 18 members of the Ueno Seiwa Clan by himself in 1985. His tattoo is a tiger, a pun on his name. After serving 25 years, a few days before his scheduled execution, he is suddenly transferred to a secret prison off the coast of Okinawa, where he meets Goh Hamazaki, who persuades him to break out together. He agrees and, after falling into the sea, washes up on the beach where he is found by Haruka. Saejima gives his name as \"Suzuki\" to Haruka and Kiryu, and, after getting tickets and pocket money from Kiryu, heads to Kamurocho. Here he reunites briefly with Majima. Soon after he and Yasuko, his sister, are kidnapped by Katsuragi, where they see each other for the first time in 25 years. Here Katsuragi explains that Saejima didn't kill the men; the real culprit is Katsuragi himself. The rounds Saejima used were rubber bullets, and all the men were only knocked unconscious after being shot by Saejima. After Saejima left, Katsuragi returned and shot them all in the head, but framed Saejima. Kido shoots Katsuragi and Saejima warns Kiryu and Yasuko of the bulletproof vest he's wearing, but the warning comes too late and Yasuko is fatally shot protecting Taiga. Taiga later fights Kido on top of the Millennium Tower. After the game he officially becomes part of the Tojo again. Although he didn't make an appearance in ''Ryuga Gotoku: Of The End'', his name was mention by one of the Tojo Clan members stating that he was in China on business during the events that took place in Kamurocho.\n\nWhen Saejima was younger, he and his sister decided to run away from their caretakers and live on their own, as they felt they were imposing on them. One day, however, Yasuko got sick, and the doctors told them that she needed a kidney transplant. Yasuko had a rare blood type, and since she and Saejima were step-siblings, their kidneys weren't compatible. Saejima had to look for Yasuko's biological father, who was actually a high-ranked Yakuza. Yasuko's father demanded compensation in exchange for his kidney, 30 million yen. With no way to easily obtain the money, Saejima took to street fights to scrape up whatever money he could. On one such occasion, he decided to pick a fight with a middle-aged man. The man easily defeated Saejima, then asked Saejima why he was sad. Saejima then poured his heart to the man, who turned out to be Hideki Sasai. Sasai agreed to pay the 30 million yen Saejima needed. In exchange, Saejima had to become a member of the Sasai Family.\n\n'''Masayoshi Tanimura''' ({{Nihongo2|\u8c37\u6751 \u6b63\u7fa9}}, ''Tanimura Masayoshi'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Narimiya]]}}\n\nA 29-year-old policeman of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|Japanese National Police]], he is known as \"The Parasite of Kamurocho\" for his corruption and love of gambling.

In secrecy, he is also tracking Saejima's murder case 25 years ago, a case that his father, also an inspector, died following. He goes to meet Mishima, an Ueno Seiwa-kai member to give him protection, but Mishima is shot and killed by Junji Sugiuchi. After being cornered by Sudo, Sugiuchi flees to the water and attempts to escape by speedboat, but is pursued by Tanimura. Tanimura attempts to handcuff him but Sugiuchi escapes and the two fight. A defeated Sugiuchi reveals he knows what happened the day of the murder and that it was he who killed his father, though he was not a police officer, but really a yakuza. He is quickly shot by a mystery man on a speedboat (who turns out to be Hisai). Later, Tanimura defeats Munakata and his SWAT-uniformed squad (total 10 of them) on top of the Millennium Tower.

He headed up all the affiliate families that made up the Tojo Clan. He was regarded as a legend for achieving the position in his 40s and under his leadership the Clan prospered. Akira Nishikiyama called an emergency meeting of all the captains of the Tojo Clan where he revealed that the 10 billion yen that the Clan had gained over the years had been stolen. Sera went to investigate what had happened to the money only to be assassinated when he found out what happened. The chairmanship was left open as a result, and the top captains; Kazama, Shimano, and Nishikiyama all vied for the position.\n\n===Dojima Family===\n'''Sohei Dojima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u5802\u5cf6 \u5b97\u5175}}, ''D\u014djima S\u014dhei'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hisao Egawa]]}}\n:Portrayed by: Harumi Sone (''Like a Dragon: Prologue'')\nThe cunning but violent head of the Dojima Family. Dojima was known for getting his way by any means necessary. Daigo's father, and Yayoi's husband. His death caused discord among the men of his family, and forced them to choose a new oyabun to follow. Nishikiyama was responsible for his death, but Kiryu took the blame.\n\nIt is revealed in a flashback during the second game by Kashiwagi that he was behind the Jingweon mafia massacre, ordering his lieutenants Shintaro Kazama and Futoshi Shimano to kill all 46 members of the mafia.\n\n'''Yayoi Dojima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u5802\u5cf6 \u5f25\u751f}}, ''D\u014djima Yayoi'')\n:{{Voiced by|Orine Fukushima}}\n\nBy the second game, she has taken interim chairmanship of the Tojo Clan.

He holds a deep respect for Kiryu, and accompanies him to Kansai to settle a score with Ryuji Goda, the chairman of the Go-Ryu clan and the man who sent him to prison 5 years ago as part of a set-up. He is kidnapped, but eventually recovered. He then takes on a leadership role and brings the fragments of the Tojo Clan together, to lead them into Kamurocho to stop the Jingweon mafia from destroying the city.\n\nPrior to the third game, Daigo becomes the 6th Chairman of the Tojo Clan. He is shot by a man who is the spitting image of Shintaro Kazama. His fate is left uncertain until Kashiwagi reveals that he has stashed him in a hospital to recover, but has not told anyone of Daigo's whereabouts. Mine eventually finds his way to the hospital (as does Kiryu), and Mine prepares to kill Daigo out of compassion as he holds too deep a respect to see him living off machines. Daigo awakens after Mine's defeat and saves the two from Richardson momentarily.\n\nDuring Yakuza 4, Daigo made an emergency meeting with the Ueno Seiwa Clan following Ihara's death. Isao Katsuragi, lieutenant of the Ueno Seiwa, demanded Daigo that, to make up for Ihara's murder, the life of Arai or control of the business Majima runs, but Daigo refused but was then asked by Katsuragi to use Majima instead since he is the \"only one to measure up Ihara's murder.\n\nKatsuragi then leaves and tells Daigo to decide what he should do. It was later revealed by Majima that he told Kazuma that Daigo set him up by giving him away to the police. Later Daigo is fought and defeated by Kiryu on top of the millennium tower.\n\n===Kazama Family===\n\n'''Shintaro Kazama/Fuma''' ({{Nihongo2|\u98a8\u9593 \u65b0\u592a\u90ce}}, ''Kazama Shintar\u014d'')\n \n:{{Voiced by|[[Tetsuya Watari]]|[[Roger L.

Later, as lieutenant of the Dojima Family, Kazama inducted both Kiryu and Nishikiyama in the family as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Kazama remained a father-figure to both of them.\n\n178&nbsp;cm, 75&nbsp;kg. A kind and honourable man, a Tojo Clan affiliate, first captain of the Kazama Family he founded after Sohei Dojima's death, absorbing the remains of the Dojima Family, thus making this new family the most powerful in the Tojo Clan. This advantage helped keep the other affiliate captains in check. However, five years after the murder a rift was created in the Kazama Family when Nishikiyama, a supposed lieutenant, broke away and declared his own family. This caused many of Kazama's men to desert to the rival family. Kazama was the one that helped inform Kiryu about the current state of affairs when he was released from prison. At Masaru Sera's funeral, Kiryu meets up with Kazama but the latter is shot by an assassin, Nishikiyama. Shinji Tanaka, Nishikiyama's lieutenant, takes Kazama to a hospital to recover. At some point Shinji turns Kazama over to [[Yukio Terada]], a lieutenant of the Omi Family who is indebted to the latter. Kazama is kept on Terada's yacht until Kiryu can meet him. Futoshi Shimano than attacks the yacht, but is defeated by the Kazama Family's reinforcements. Kazama is killed while protecting Haruka Sawamura from a grenade thrown by Shimano Shimano. Shortly before he dies, Kazama admits that he was the one who killed Kiryu's parents and that the Sunflower Orphanage is where he sends the children of the people he kills, making them into orphans. Despite this, Kiryu forgives Kazama and calls him the only parent he ever had.\n \nIt is shown at the start of ''Yakuza 2'' that Kazama participated in the slaughter of the Jingweon mafia 20 years ago. This is later revealed to be an action carried out at Sohei Dojima's behest, which he agreed to after much reluctance. Unlike his partner in this operation, Futo Shimano, Kazama actually showed mercy to a few Jingeweon operatives, although this action eventually caused the events of ''Yakuza 2''. Unwilling to kill them, and attempting to strike a deal, Kazama told the Jingweon boss that if they would leave town he would spare their lives. However, a young Kazuma Kiryu, thinking Kazama was in danger, ran into the room with a pipe. Thinking he had been double-crossed, the boss attempted to shoot Kiryu, prompting Kazama to shoot. This began the massacre.\n \nIn ''Yakuza 3'', Kazama seemingly returns and is involved in a situation where Daigo Dojima is shot. This is later revealed to be his younger brother, Joji Kazama, who, because Shintaro never mentioned about him to anyone including those \"close\" to him (i.e. Kazuma), he would appear to be Shintaro Kazama due to looking very similar to each other.\n \n'''Osamu Kashiwagi''' ({{Nihongo2|\u67cf\u6728 \u4fee}}, ''Kashiwagi Osamu'')\n \n:{{Voiced by|[[Shunsuke Sakuya]]|[[John DiMaggio]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n \t\nKashiwagi is the second in command of the Kazama family; he holds a deep respect for his oyabun Shintaro Kazama. He is seen at the beginning of the game, trying to tell a tale about his boss, but is silenced. Kashiwagi is not seen again until end of chapter 12 when he comes with backup to the final confrontation against Futoshi Shimano, ening with the deaths of both Shimano and Kazama.\n \t\nPrior to ''Yakuza 2'', Kashiwagi takes over the chairmanship of the Kazama family following its patriarch's death. He is also the interim second-in-command of the Tojo Clan. He appears throughout the game, cooperating with Kiryu to solve the problems of the Tojo.\n \t\nIn ''Yakuza 3'' Kiryu visits Kashiwagi at the Kazama family's offices in Millennium Tower, but Kashiwagi is fatally gunned down by a helicopter. His dying wish is that Kiryu finds the man in the picture, who is the spitting image of Kazama.\n \t\n===Nishikiyama Family===\n\n'''Akira Nishikiyama''' ({{Nihongo2|\u9326\u5c71 \u5f70}}, ''Nishikiyama Akira'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|Kazuhiro Nakaya|[[Michael Rosenbaum]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n \n:Portrayed by: Mikio Ohosawa (''Like a Dragon: Prologue''), [[Claude Maki]] (''Like a Dragon'')\n \nAkira Nishkiyama,183&nbsp;cm born October 8, 1968, known as simply \"Akira Nishiki\" in English versions of the first two games and by his original name in ''Yakuza 4'', is the former best friend of Kiryu and one of the main antagonists of ''Yakuza'' 1. He leads the Nishikiyama Family as its inaugural  Chairman.\n \nAlong with his sister Yuko, Kazuma Kiryu and Yumi Sawamura, Nishikiyama grew up in Shintaro Kazama's Sunflower Orphanage. Nishikiyama was the one actually responsible for the death of Sohei Dojima, but reluctantly allowed Kiryu to take the fall for it so he could tend to his ill sister near her death.\n \nWhen Kiryu returns to Kamurocho, he finds that Nishikiyama has not only started his own subsidiary group, but he has changed into a cold, heartless man completely unlike his former self.

In chapter 10, it is revealed that Reina, the owner of Serena and former ally of Kiryu, was a mole for Nishikiyama. Because she was in love with him she betrayed her friends, but later regrets it and tries to kill Nishikiyama. She fails and is killed by Arase on a rooftop. Finally, in chapter 13, Nishikiyama reveals that he knew Jingu was trying to use him. After his best friend went to prison and the loss of his sister, he has never trusted anyone since. He reveals his romantic feelings towards Yumi, and that he that was jealous of Kiryu because she loves him, not Nishikiyama. Wanting to surpass Kiryu, he has made sacrifices and numerous betrayals in order to claim the 10 billion yen so that he may become the Tojo Clan's fourth chairman. With that realised, he will claim Yumi for himself. Yumi asks Nishikiyama if he is truly happy with the things he's done because of his obsession, that he has failed to confront his inner problems. Nishikiyama scolds Yumi for not falling in love with the person he is, which makes Yumi cry. Kiryu then tells Nishikiyama how he and Yumi are both irreplaceable to him. He couldn't change the hurt and pain from the past, even if he wanted to. Then Kiryu says that they both must settle this feud once and for all. Nishikiyama accepts this final showdown with his former best friend Kiryu, both removing their shirts to display their yakuza tattoos on their backs - the Dragon and the Koi. They fight to the bitter end but Kiryu eventually wins. After Jingu shoots Yumi while trying to kill Kiryu, Nishikiyama redeems himself by stabbing Jingu with a knife to save Kiryu, only to blow up himself along with the 10 billion yen and Jingu.\n \nKiryu pays his respects to his deceased friend at his grave, along with his foster father and Yumi, in future games.\n \t\n'''Yuko Nishikiyama'''<br>\n \t\nYuko was Akira's younger sister raised with him, Kazuma Kiryu and Yumi Sawamura in Shintaro Kazama's Sunflower Orphanage. She suffered from a disease which had her periodically going to the hospital since 1984. In 1996, her final possible surgery and reliance on her elder brother is the reason Kazuma Kiryu takes the fall for Sohei Dojima's murder. She died shortly after and her death spiraled Nishikiyama's descent into darkness.\n \n'''Shinji Tanaka''' ({{Nihongo2|\u7530\u4e2d \u30b7\u30f3\u30b8}}, ''Tanaka Shinji'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takafumi Yamaguchi]] (''Yakuza''), [[Tomokazu Sugita]] (''Yakuza Kiwami'')|[[Daniel Capellaro]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n\t\nKazuma Kiryu's friend, Shinji looks up to Kiryu and helps him out when he can.

He is part of the Dojima family. He dies from wounds inflicted by Arase's subordinate Mochizuki.\n \t\n'''Koji Shindo''' ({{Nihongo2|\u65b0\u85e4 \u6d69\u4e8c}}, ''Shind\u014d K\u014dji'')<br>\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoyuki Dan]]}}\n \nInitially a lieutenant of the Nishikiyama family in the first game, he serves as a boss in Chapter 7.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 2'', he eventually becomes the second chairman of the Nishikiyama family.

Much like Sohei Dojima, he has a reputation for his ruthless, violent nature, and has a brutal grudge against Kiryu for Dojima's death. At Masaru Sera's funeral, Shimano fights Kiryu after the latter is discovered. After Shinji leaves Kazama on Terada's boat, the Shimano family attacks. After being defeated by Kiryu and the Kazama Family reinforcements, Shimano throws a grenade towards Haruka, which kills Kazama when he saves Haruka's life, shortly before being shot and killed by Terada. He has a tattoo of a tiger on his back.\n \t\nIn the events of Yakuza 0, he was the Patriarch of Goro Majima. Infuriated with his failure to participate in the raid he orders him to be tortured in his private chambers where he endured a year of pain and suffering by Shimano's personal hands. Exiling him to Soutenboori, he entrusts Majima with the custody of Sagawa who offers him to a chance to escape if he kills Makimura Makoto. Shimano does not reappear until later in the game after Majima and Sagawa finds and supposedly kills Sera and reveals they wanted Makoto alive so she would willingly give Shimano the deed to the land she owned due to her feelings for Majima. After Sera secured his position as the new Chairman of the Tojo, Majima was tasked with killing Shimano for his secret alliance with the Omi but Shimano demonstrates his loyalty by killing the envoy of the Omi present for negotiations which spares him of his involvement in the plot to betray the Tojo.\n \n===Majima Family===\n \n'''Daisaku Minami'''\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hideo Ishikawa]]}}\n \nMinami is the Junior Leader of the Majima Family. He debuts in ''Yakuza 4'' where he arrives at a dance club owned by Akiyama looking for Lily. After trading insults and refusing to leave, he and Akiyama fight in which he is defeated.

He later appears in the Millennium Tower when Taiga Saejima arrives looking for Goro. He then orders members of the Majima Family to attack the intruder and fights Taiga personally after they are defeated in which he is defeated himself. He uses \"drunken style\" while fighting in which he attacks opponents while intoxicated, which makes him more agile and nimble than he is normally.\n \t\n===Hakuho Clan===\n'''Yoshitaka Mine''' ({{Nihongo2|\u5cef \u7fa9\u5b5d}}, ''Mine Yoshitaka'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nakamura Shid\u014d II]]}}\n \n34 years old. Mine is the President of the Hakuho Clan ({{Nihongo2|\u767d\u5cef\u4f1a}}, ''Hakuh\u014d-kai''), a Tojo Clan affiliate, and serves as one of the main antagonists (and is the final boss of) ''Yakuza 3''. He has a golden kirin tattoo on his back. Bilingual, he speaks both Japanese and English.\n\t\nMine as a child grew up in a poor environment, shunned by other children because of his poor background. He was solely raised by his father (uncle in the EU & US localization) who later died of an unknown illness. Before his father died, on his deathbed he advised Mine that because of his high intelligence he should make something of himself and that he was sorry to leave him alone. He grew up as an orphan and studied hard to make something of himself whilst shunning people from ever getting close to him.\n \t\nIn adulthood, he became a very successful Japanese businessman; he had all the money he wanted and could have any woman he desired. However, this life led him to the realization that it was all a lie and that people only used him for his money. Human bonds, to Mine, were non-existent as humans are all self-serving hypocrites.\n\t\nTo find a society where human bonds were absolute, he took an interest in the yakuza. He bribed the Nishikiyama Family's Third Chairman, Tsuyoshi Kanda, to gain access to the Tojo Clan, making it appear as though Kanda was the one who scouted him. There he met with the Sixth Chairman, Daigo Dojima, and took an interest in him. Daigo, to Mine, was someone for the first time in ages he genuinely respected and cared for; he loved him like he was his best friend and brother. With Daigo's support, he rose to the top ranks and became the Chairman of the Hakuho Clan through his clear thinking and financial prowess.\n \nAfter Daigo was shot, Kashiwagi, acting as interim chairman, calls a meeting with the current Tojo Clan executive members over Kazuma Kiryu, the Fourth Chairman, returning to help mend this current crisis. Mine sides with Kashiwagi while Kanda and Hamazaki, due to their own personal ambitions, express their disapproval.\n \nMine, for the first time, meets with Kiryu at Kage's office in Purgatory to apologize profusely for Kanda's actions, that it was him who funded the Nishikiyama Family to stage a coup against the other families. As a peace offering he places a large metal box on Kage's desk containing Kanda's head. A flashback in Mine's office reveals how Kanda is angry over his defeat against Kiryu, destroying antiques in the process. Mine calmly tells him to refrain from destroying any more expensive antiques as he doesn't comprehend their value. Kanda lunges at Mine in animosity while Mine effortlessly counters him with a blow to his abdomen. After further consecutive blows, Kanda helplessly falls to the floor, pleading mercy. Mine confesses to him that while he may not look it, his physical strength surpasses Kanda's. Mine also reveals to the petulant Kanda how he has outlived his usefulness and orders his subordinates to execute him away from his office. Back in the present, Mine addresses that the matter is closed and that they have nothing to worry about with regards to Hamazaki, now that he has gone into hiding. Kiryu expresses his disapproval over Mine's actions, asking if this is what Daigo would have wanted. Mine responds to Kiryu how his reluctance to give up the orphanage caused Daigo to be shot and that his idealism is nothing more than hypocrisy. Mine then gives a final warning to Kiryu and his allies before he leaves.\n \nMine travels to Downtown Ryukyu in Okinawa by plane. With the employ of the Tamashiro Family he destroys the orphanage to further the resort development project. Mine orders the family to stall Kiryu in Okinawa before he travels back to Tokyo to find Daigo in Toto Hospital. During the plane journey, his subordinates discuss how Mine becoming the Seventh Chairman is something worth celebrating. Mine overhears their conversation and stabs a subordinate's hand with a dinner knife for insulting Daigo.\n \t\nAt Toto Hospital, he sits beside Daigo, lamenting how things come to this. He receives a phone call from the enigmatic Andre Richardson, head of Black Monday. Mine assures him in English that everything is going according to schedule and that there will be no changes in the plan. During the final battle on top of Toto University Hospital, he reveals to Kiryu that he is an orphan just like him, as well his true (albeit misguided) motives behind his betrayal of the Tojo Clan. Unable to cope with Daigo being in a coma after being shot, even if it was a lie to him, he wanted the power to do anything. Collaborating with Black Monday, he wanted to become the Seventh Chairman of the Tojo Clan to give him a new reason to live to render his grief non-existent. To fulfill that ambition, he has two obstacles: 1) To compassionately kill Daigo in his vegetative state and 2) To kill the person whom Daigo Dojima thought of the most highly - Kazuma Kiryu. Kiryu sees the futility in Mine's actions, and that his isolation was a result of his self-centredness. This prompts Mine to shoot at him out of rage while Kiryu remains unfazed by his opponent's anger. To get through to Mine, Kiryu challenges him to a duel to prove him wrong, which Mine accepts gladly and mentions how he won't be easily beaten. After a grueling fight, Mine is defeated.\n \t\nAfter Mine's defeat, he lies down on the rooftop exhausted. He receives an urgent phone call from his secretary whom he thought he mattered to. When she was discussing some business deal, Mine laments how it goes back to money, yet the yearning desire for bonds of friendship and love is in all of us, before cutting off the call. Mine asks Kiryu whether his clear state of mind means that his life has ended. The equally exhausted Kiryu responds that as long as we're still alive, we can start anew. The CIA Agent appears with five of his subordinates. Mine confirms that they are not CIA and that it was just a cover for the Black Monday organization. The agentKiryu had defeated was Andre Richardson, the leader of Black Monday and the mastermind behind the resort project. Andre casually responds how their roles have come to end and that Mine is easily a replaceable pawn. Before Andre executes both of them with his handgun, Daigo recovers from his coma and shoots him and his five men with a pistol. Andre, near death, rises once more to kill everyone now that his plans are ruined. Mine grabs Andre and throws himself off the hospital rooftop along with his former collaborator to make amends to both Kiryu and Daigo, ending Richardson and his ambitions for good.\n\t\n===Hamazaki Family===\t\n'''Goh Hamazaki''' ({{Nihongo2|\u6d5c\u5d0e \u8c6a}}, ''Hamazaki G\u014d'')\t\n:{{Voiced by|[[George Takahashi]]}}\n \nGoh is the tough leader of the Hamazaki Family ({{Nihongo2|\u6d5c\u5d0e\u7d44}}, ''Hamazaki-gumi'').

With the land in his possession, he plans to create a secret casino for the Triad group.\n \t\nTo stop Kiryu from interfering in his plans to take over the Tojo Clan and claim the Okinawa resort land in his possession, he blackmails Majima to use his family to stop him. When that doesn't go to plan, he convinces his partner Lau Ka Long and his Triad to invade Kamurocho, though Lau is more than obliged out of revenge against Kiryu. After Lau Ka Long is killed, the Snake Flower Triad HQ in China destroys Goh's Hamazaki Family for allowing their Japanese branch leader to be killed. He goes into hiding.\n \t\nIn the game's ending, he appears again in Theater Square confronting Kazuma.

Kiryu convinces Goh that it's not too late to mend his ways as long as he is alive, stretching his hand out as a sign of trust. Goh walks towards Kiryu, stabbing him in his abdomen with a knife. With Kiryu dying, Goh mockingly states to Kazuma that his idealism will not amount to anything now that he's near death, and Kiryu responds that he still believes in people and his ideals even if he's dying, as the now-deceased Mine taught him this lesson. Bemused by Kiryu's resolve, he is tackled by Kazuki and Yuya, and forced to the ground as the police sirens wail in the background.\n \nGoh Hamazaki appears again in Yakuza 4, now as a 51-year-old prisoner at the same facility Taiga Saejima is transferred to.

When he was a child his parents were killed by Shintaro Kazama, a Tojo Clan affiliate Dojima Family lieutenant, who brought him to the Sunflower orphanage he financed. Later Kazama introduced Kiryu and Nishikiyama in the Dojima Family. Kazama became a father figure for Kiryu who supported him within the Family and years later when he was released from prison. Kiryu rose through the Tojo hierarchy and earned the nickname \"the Dragon of Dojima\" ({{Nihongo2|\u5802\u5cf6\u306e\u9f8d}}, ''D\u014djima no Ry\u016b'') because of the dragon tattoo on his back but the main reason was because he gained the victory fight against Keiji Shibusawa who wanted to be called the Dragon of Dojima in Yakuza 0. He was planning on starting his own subsidiary group until he took the blame for the murder of his boss, Sohei Dojima, to protect his best friend, Nishikiyama, and was imprisoned for ten years.\n\n'''Haruka Sawamura''' ({{Nihongo2|\u6fa4\u6751 \u9065}}, ''Sawamura Haruka'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rie Kugimiya]]|[[Debi Derryberry]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n:Portrayed by: Natsuo (''Like a Dragon'')\nBorn in 1996. 120&nbsp;cm.<ref name=\"auto\"/> Haruka is a young girl searching for her mother, Mizuki, who evidence seems to indicate is Yumi's younger sister. Haruka is also somehow connected to the money that went missing before Kiryu's release. A combination of these reasons and pure chance leave Haruka in Kiryu's tentative custody. Before arriving in Kamurocho, she too lived at the Sunflower Orphanage.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 2'', she is 10 years old. Haruka has lived with Kiryu as her stepfather since the events of the first game. In the beginning of the game she decided to spend some time in Sunshine Orphanage to not be a thorn in the way of Kiryu's investigation of Terada's murder. In chapter 11, she is kidnapped by Senguku and his men as they attempt to lure Kiryu to the Osaka castle to kill him; in the end he manages to defeat Sengoku's men and rescue Haruka with Ryuji's help.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 3'', she is 12 years old. Haruka is an orphan raised by Kiryu. Her mother was Yumi Sawamura, Kazuma Kiryu's childhood love and best friend Nishikiyama's fianc\u00e9e, while her father was Jingu, the head of the MBI. Haruka was abandoned at birth by her mother and grew up as an orphan until she met Kazuma Kiryu who took care of her as a father figure though she calls him ojisan (\u304a\u3058\u3055\u3093) the Japanese equivalent for \"Uncle\".\n\nIn ''Yakuza 5'', she is 16 years old. 165&nbsp;cm. In 2012, Haruka has left the orphanage in Okinawa and is currently in Osaka pursuing her childhood dream of becoming an Idol.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 6'', Kiryu returns to Kamurocho to search for Haruka, only to find out that she has been left in a coma after a hit and run incident, and that she has an infant son, Haruto.\n\nIn the spinoff ''Ry\u016b ga Gotoku Of the End'', she was 14 years old, and kidnapped by a mysterious man.\n\n'''Goro Majima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u771f\u5cf6 \u543e\u6717}}, ''Majima Gor\u014d'')\n{{main|Goro Majima}}\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hidenari Ugaki]]|[[Mark Hamill]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n:Portrayed by: Goro Kishitani (''Like a Dragon'')\n \nA lieutenant of the Shimano family, Shimano's right-hand man and head of the Majima Family, Majima is an acquaintance of Kiryu with a twisted sense of loyalty. His temper and lack of mercy earned him the nickname \"the Mad Dog of the [[Shimano Family]]\". Because of his friendship with Kiryu he believed himself to be the only one entitled to kill him, and nearly died attempting to protect that right. Majima and Kiryu fight each other twice in the game, the first time in the batting cages and the second time in the soapland, Shangri-la.\n \t\nIn ''Yakuza 2'', with Shimano dead and his family now disbanded, the Majima Family leaves the Tojo Clan and establish themselves as a construction company. With Kage the Florist gone from Purgatory, Majima immediately takes over the secret society. Although no longer interested in the clan, he promises to help Kiryu fend off the Omi Alliance after fighting him once again at the Underground Coliseum. He later takes on all of the men sent to the town single-handed. Recklessly disarming the bomb in the Millennium Tower, Majima tells Kiryu to finish off Ryuji Goda and the Jingweon Mafia at the final showdown as he proclaims himself as the one destined to defeat him.\n \nIn 2006, with the Jingweon Mafia and the Omi Alliance dealt with, Kiryu meets with Majima at the top of Millennium Tower. Kazuma pleads with him once more to go back to the Tojo Clan to support the newly appointed Sixth Chairman, Daigo Dojima, as a contingency for any future troubles. Majima, reluctant at first since his construction company is now his responsibility, becomes intrigued by Kiryu's idea that he would be able to run amok and cause chaos for the survival of the clan. Majima then explains that he is only swayed by the strong, and implies that he will only accept this favour by force. After their fourth battle in the series, Majima loses and promises Kiryu he would return to the Tojo clan, leaving him to wonder what he had got himself into.\n \nIn 2008, suspected of betraying the Tojo Clan over the resort deal, Kiryu heads to Purgatory to meet with Majima to get his side of the story. Greeted by his large entourage of yakuza soldiers, Majima asks Kiryu to follow him to the now-defunct Underground Coliseum where they could talk quietly. Before Majima can answer any further questions, Kiryu must beat him first in the first official coliseum fight since its closure two years ago. After losing again to Kiryu, he reveals that he got involved for Daigo's sake and that he was also set up by Goh Hamazaki as a suspect of the clan's inner dispute. After saving Kiryu from Land Minister Suzuki's private army outside of the Diet Building, Majima offers to send his family in Okinawa as assistance, which Kiryu refuses. Majima wishes him luck and tells him not to be beaten by Mine and the CIA as he's the one going to kill him someday.\n \nIn 2010, the Majima Family has moved to the old Kazama Family office in the Millennium Tower. Majima follows the trail of Yasuko, determined to protect her for his old friend, Taiga Saejima. Majima is later reunited with Saejima at the batting cages where they fight before reminiscing. Majima recounts the story of how he lost his eye to Saejima, and Saejima comments that Majima's Kansai speech has improved. Majima is later arrested to keep him from being an obstacle in Munakata's plan.\n \nDuring the events of the zombie spinoff ''Of the End'' (''Dead Souls'' in English), Majima is watching old zombie films in his flat in Millennium Tower when it is put under quarantine. He escapes the tower only to receive a phone call saying that he is late for the grand opening of Kamurocho Hills, a skyscraper he helped to construct throughout the series. He arrives only to find that it too is under quarantine, and that he must protect the people holed up inside the tower from the zombie invaders. He helps to evacuate the refugees to Purgatory, but in the process gets bitten by a zombie. He fears he may soon become one, a fear that is reinforced when Kiryu and Asagi (a female SDF soldier) remark that his eye has started turning red. In despair, he walks over to the Champion District, where he finds an abandoned Sauna. Thinking he may be able to \"sweat out\" the zombie toxin, he decides to visit. He is not seen again until the end of the game, where it is revealed that the zombie who \"bit\" him was in fact a toothless old man and thus did not manage to break his skin. It is also revealed that the reason his eye has turned red is because he was suffering from hay fever.\n\nMajima's character is explored in more detail during the prequel ''Yakuza 0'', in which he is a 24-year-old former Yakuza and a playable protagonist along with Kiryu. In this game, Majima has a calmer demeanor that develops during a war between multiple families in a fight for a patch of land known as the empty lot.\n\n'''Shun Akiyama''' ({{Nihongo2|\u79cb\u5c71 \u99ff}}, ''Akiyama Shun'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[K\u014dichi Yamadera]]}}\n\nIntroduced in ''Yakuza 4'', Shun Akiyama was born 24 July 1978. Akiyama is a former homeless, he now owns Sky Finance, a loan company, as well as the [[hostess club]] Elise, which he started up using the money he gathered that fell from Millennium Tower in 2005. Once helped out by the yakuza Hiroaki Arai, he looked up to Arai as a potential new leader of Kamurocho who could eventually succeed the legendary Kazuma Kiryu.<br>\n\nAkiyama was an elite in his 20s, during which time he dated Eri, a woman who bears a striking resemblance to Yasuko/Lily. In 2005 he was framed for stealing from the bank and was fired. All of his remaining money was spent investigating who framed him, and his money eventually ran out without him finding an answer. He was then forced to sleep on the streets until one fateful night, when money appeared to fall from the sky. He gathered up a large amount of money, but it was stolen by a group of thugs. Arai retrieved the money for him, and he used it to set up a business. Akiyama meets a woman named Lily when she requests to borrow money from him. After a series of \"tests\" he agrees to lend her the money, though he knows he likely won't get it back. This angers Hana, his secretary, and she quits. Kido discovers the secret safe behind the bookcase in Akiyama's office, and steals 100 billion yen in cash.<br>\n\nLater in the game Akiyama uses his own money to lure the men to the Millennium Tower roof, where he fights Arai. He is shot by Munakata at the end, but a thick padding of bills, his last money, stops the bullet and saves his life.\n\nAlongside Sky Finance, he runs a hostess club and is considered to be an entrupenuer of some sort. Akiyama is considered to be quite lazy, often forgetting to clean his office and frequently neglects his duties. He also appears in ''Yakuza 5'', ''Yakuza 6: The Song of Life'' and during the events of the spinofff ''Of the End'' he teams up with Kiryu, Majima and Ryuji Goda to stop the zombie plague.\n\n'''Taiga Saejima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u51b4\u5cf6 \u5927\u6cb3}}, ''Saejima Taiga'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Rikiya Koyama]]}}\n\nBorn 2 June 1965.

After serving 25 years, a few days before his scheduled execution, he is suddenly transferred to a secret prison off the coast of Okinawa, where he meets Goh Hamazaki, who persuades him to break out together. He agrees and, after falling into the sea, washes up on the beach where he is found by Haruka. Saejima gives his name as \"Suzuki\" to Haruka and Kiryu, and, after getting tickets and pocket money from Kiryu, heads to Kamurocho. Here he reunites briefly with Majima. Soon after he and Yasuko, his sister, are kidnapped by Katsuragi, where they see each other for the first time in 25 years. Here Katsuragi explains that Saejima didn't kill the men; the real culprit is Katsuragi himself. The rounds Saejima used were rubber bullets, and all the men were only knocked unconscious after being shot by Saejima. After Saejima left, Katsuragi returned and shot them all in the head, but framed Saejima. Kido shoots Katsuragi and Saejima warns Kiryu and Yasuko of the bulletproof vest he's wearing, but the warning comes too late and Yasuko is fatally shot protecting Taiga. Taiga later fights Kido on top of the Millennium Tower. After the game he officially becomes part of the Tojo again. Although he didn't make an appearance in ''Ryuga Gotoku: Of The End'', his name was mention by one of the Tojo Clan members stating that he was in China on business during the events that took place in Kamurocho.\n\nWhen Saejima was younger, he and his sister decided to run away from their caretakers and live on their own, as they felt they were imposing on them. One day, however, Yasuko got sick, and the doctors told them that she needed a kidney transplant. Yasuko had a rare blood type, and since she and Saejima were step-siblings, their kidneys weren't compatible. Saejima had to look for Yasuko's biological father, who was actually a high-ranked Yakuza. Yasuko's father demanded compensation in exchange for his kidney, 30 million yen. With no way to easily obtain the money, Saejima took to street fights to scrape up whatever money he could. On one such occasion, he decided to pick a fight with a middle-aged man. The man easily defeated Saejima, then asked Saejima why he was sad. Saejima then poured his heart to the man, who turned out to be Hideki Sasai. Sasai agreed to pay the 30 million yen Saejima needed. In exchange, Saejima had to become a member of the Sasai Family.\n\n'''Masayoshi Tanimura''' ({{Nihongo2|\u8c37\u6751 \u6b63\u7fa9}}, ''Tanimura Masayoshi'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroki Narimiya]]}}\n\nA 29-year-old policeman of the [[National Police Agency (Japan)|Japanese National Police]], he is known as \"The Parasite of Kamurocho\" for his corruption and love of gambling.

After being cornered by Sudo, Sugiuchi flees to the water and attempts to escape by speedboat, but is pursued by Tanimura. Tanimura attempts to handcuff him but Sugiuchi escapes and the two fight. A defeated Sugiuchi reveals he knows what happened the day of the murder and that it was he who killed his father, though he was not a police officer, but really a yakuza. He is quickly shot by a mystery man on a speedboat (who turns out to be Hisai). Later, Tanimura defeats Munakata and his SWAT-uniformed squad (total 10 of them) on top of the Millennium Tower.

He headed up all the affiliate families that made up the Tojo Clan. He was regarded as a legend for achieving the position in his 40s and under his leadership the Clan prospered. Akira Nishikiyama called an emergency meeting of all the captains of the Tojo Clan where he revealed that the 10 billion yen that the Clan had gained over the years had been stolen. Sera went to investigate what had happened to the money only to be assassinated when he found out what happened. The chairmanship was left open as a result, and the top captains; Kazama, Shimano, and Nishikiyama all vied for the position.\n\n===Dojima Family===\n'''Sohei Dojima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u5802\u5cf6 \u5b97\u5175}}, ''D\u014djima S\u014dhei'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hisao Egawa]]}}\n:Portrayed by: Harumi Sone (''Like a Dragon: Prologue'')\nThe cunning but violent head of the Dojima Family. Dojima was known for getting his way by any means necessary. Daigo's father, and Yayoi's husband. His death caused discord among the men of his family, and forced them to choose a new oyabun to follow. Nishikiyama was responsible for his death, but Kiryu took the blame.\n\nIt is revealed in a flashback during the second game by Kashiwagi that he was behind the Jingweon mafia massacre, ordering his lieutenants Shintaro Kazama and Futoshi Shimano to kill all 46 members of the mafia.\n\n'''Yayoi Dojima''' ({{Nihongo2|\u5802\u5cf6 \u5f25\u751f}}, ''D\u014djima Yayoi'')\n:{{Voiced by|Orine Fukushima}}\n\nBy the second game, she has taken interim chairmanship of the Tojo Clan.

He holds a deep respect for Kiryu, and accompanies him to Kansai to settle a score with Ryuji Goda, the chairman of the Go-Ryu clan and the man who sent him to prison 5 years ago as part of a set-up. He is kidnapped, but eventually recovered. He then takes on a leadership role and brings the fragments of the Tojo Clan together, to lead them into Kamurocho to stop the Jingweon mafia from destroying the city.\n\nPrior to the third game, Daigo becomes the 6th Chairman of the Tojo Clan. He is shot by a man who is the spitting image of Shintaro Kazama. His fate is left uncertain until Kashiwagi reveals that he has stashed him in a hospital to recover, but has not told anyone of Daigo's whereabouts. Mine eventually finds his way to the hospital (as does Kiryu), and Mine prepares to kill Daigo out of compassion as he holds too deep a respect to see him living off machines. Daigo awakens after Mine's defeat and saves the two from Richardson momentarily.\n\nDuring Yakuza 4, Daigo made an emergency meeting with the Ueno Seiwa Clan following Ihara's death. Isao Katsuragi, lieutenant of the Ueno Seiwa, demanded Daigo that, to make up for Ihara's murder, the life of Arai or control of the business Majima runs, but Daigo refused but was then asked by Katsuragi to use Majima instead since he is the \"only one to measure up Ihara's murder.\n\nKatsuragi then leaves and tells Daigo to decide what he should do. It was later revealed by Majima that he told Kazuma that Daigo set him up by giving him away to the police. Later Daigo is fought and defeated by Kiryu on top of the millennium tower.\n\n===Kazama Family===\n\n'''Shintaro Kazama/Fuma''' ({{Nihongo2|\u98a8\u9593 \u65b0\u592a\u90ce}}, ''Kazama Shintar\u014d'')\n \n:{{Voiced by|[[Tetsuya Watari]]|[[Roger L.

Later, as lieutenant of the Dojima Family, Kazama inducted both Kiryu and Nishikiyama in the family as his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s. Kazama remained a father-figure to both of them.\n\n178&nbsp;cm, 75&nbsp;kg. A kind and honourable man, a Tojo Clan affiliate, first captain of the Kazama Family he founded after Sohei Dojima's death, absorbing the remains of the Dojima Family, thus making this new family the most powerful in the Tojo Clan. This advantage helped keep the other affiliate captains in check. However, five years after the murder a rift was created in the Kazama Family when Nishikiyama, a supposed lieutenant, broke away and declared his own family. This caused many of Kazama's men to desert to the rival family. Kazama was the one that helped inform Kiryu about the current state of affairs when he was released from prison. At Masaru Sera's funeral, Kiryu meets up with Kazama but the latter is shot by an assassin, Nishikiyama. Shinji Tanaka, Nishikiyama's lieutenant, takes Kazama to a hospital to recover. At some point Shinji turns Kazama over to [[Yukio Terada]], a lieutenant of the Omi Family who is indebted to the latter. Kazama is kept on Terada's yacht until Kiryu can meet him. Futoshi Shimano than attacks the yacht, but is defeated by the Kazama Family's reinforcements. Kazama is killed while protecting Haruka Sawamura from a grenade thrown by Shimano Shimano. Shortly before he dies, Kazama admits that he was the one who killed Kiryu's parents and that the Sunflower Orphanage is where he sends the children of the people he kills, making them into orphans. Despite this, Kiryu forgives Kazama and calls him the only parent he ever had.\n \nIt is shown at the start of ''Yakuza 2'' that Kazama participated in the slaughter of the Jingweon mafia 20 years ago. This is later revealed to be an action carried out at Sohei Dojima's behest, which he agreed to after much reluctance. Unlike his partner in this operation, Futo Shimano, Kazama actually showed mercy to a few Jingeweon operatives, although this action eventually caused the events of ''Yakuza 2''. Unwilling to kill them, and attempting to strike a deal, Kazama told the Jingweon boss that if they would leave town he would spare their lives. However, a young Kazuma Kiryu, thinking Kazama was in danger, ran into the room with a pipe. Thinking he had been double-crossed, the boss attempted to shoot Kiryu, prompting Kazama to shoot. This began the massacre.\n \nIn ''Yakuza 3'', Kazama seemingly returns and is involved in a situation where Daigo Dojima is shot. This is later revealed to be his younger brother, Joji Kazama, who, because Shintaro never mentioned about him to anyone including those \"close\" to him (i.e. Kazuma), he would appear to be Shintaro Kazama due to looking very similar to each other.\n \n'''Osamu Kashiwagi''' ({{Nihongo2|\u67cf\u6728 \u4fee}}, ''Kashiwagi Osamu'')\n \n:{{Voiced by|[[Shunsuke Sakuya]]|[[John DiMaggio]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n \t\nKashiwagi is the second in command of the Kazama family; he holds a deep respect for his oyabun Shintaro Kazama. He is seen at the beginning of the game, trying to tell a tale about his boss, but is silenced. Kashiwagi is not seen again until end of chapter 12 when he comes with backup to the final confrontation against Futoshi Shimano, ening with the deaths of both Shimano and Kazama.\n \t\nPrior to ''Yakuza 2'', Kashiwagi takes over the chairmanship of the Kazama family following its patriarch's death. He is also the interim second-in-command of the Tojo Clan. He appears throughout the game, cooperating with Kiryu to solve the problems of the Tojo.\n \t\nIn ''Yakuza 3'' Kiryu visits Kashiwagi at the Kazama family's offices in Millennium Tower, but Kashiwagi is fatally gunned down by a helicopter. His dying wish is that Kiryu finds the man in the picture, who is the spitting image of Kazama.\n \t\n===Nishikiyama Family===\n\n'''Akira Nishikiyama''' ({{Nihongo2|\u9326\u5c71 \u5f70}}, ''Nishikiyama Akira'')\n\n:{{Voiced by|Kazuhiro Nakaya|[[Michael Rosenbaum]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n \n:Portrayed by: Mikio Ohosawa (''Like a Dragon: Prologue''), [[Claude Maki]] (''Like a Dragon'')\n \nAkira Nishkiyama,183&nbsp;cm born October 8, 1968, known as simply \"Akira Nishiki\" in English versions of the first two games and by his original name in ''Yakuza 4'', is the former best friend of Kiryu and one of the main antagonists of ''Yakuza'' 1. He leads the Nishikiyama Family as its inaugural  Chairman.\n \nAlong with his sister Yuko, Kazuma Kiryu and Yumi Sawamura, Nishikiyama grew up in Shintaro Kazama's Sunflower Orphanage. Nishikiyama was the one actually responsible for the death of Sohei Dojima, but reluctantly allowed Kiryu to take the fall for it so he could tend to his ill sister near her death.\n \nWhen Kiryu returns to Kamurocho, he finds that Nishikiyama has not only started his own subsidiary group, but he has changed into a cold, heartless man completely unlike his former self. He has a ''[[koi]]'' tattooed on his back. He tries to kill Kiryu on several occasions. In chapter 10, it is revealed that Reina, the owner of Serena and former ally of Kiryu, was a mole for Nishikiyama. Because she was in love with him she betrayed her friends, but later regrets it and tries to kill Nishikiyama. She fails and is killed by Arase on a rooftop. Finally, in chapter 13, Nishikiyama reveals that he knew Jingu was trying to use him. After his best friend went to prison and the loss of his sister, he has never trusted anyone since. He reveals his romantic feelings towards Yumi, and that he that was jealous of Kiryu because she loves him, not Nishikiyama. Wanting to surpass Kiryu, he has made sacrifices and numerous betrayals in order to claim the 10 billion yen so that he may become the Tojo Clan's fourth chairman. With that realised, he will claim Yumi for himself. Yumi asks Nishikiyama if he is truly happy with the things he's done because of his obsession, that he has failed to confront his inner problems. Nishikiyama scolds Yumi for not falling in love with the person he is, which makes Yumi cry. Kiryu then tells Nishikiyama how he and Yumi are both irreplaceable to him. He couldn't change the hurt and pain from the past, even if he wanted to. Then Kiryu says that they both must settle this feud once and for all. Nishikiyama accepts this final showdown with his former best friend Kiryu, both removing their shirts to display their yakuza tattoos on their backs - the Dragon and the Koi. They fight to the bitter end but Kiryu eventually wins. After Jingu shoots Yumi while trying to kill Kiryu, Nishikiyama redeems himself by stabbing Jingu with a knife to save Kiryu, only to blow up himself along with the 10 billion yen and Jingu.\n \nKiryu pays his respects to his deceased friend at his grave, along with his foster father and Yumi, in future games.\n \t\n'''Yuko Nishikiyama'''<br>\n \t\nYuko was Akira's younger sister raised with him, Kazuma Kiryu and Yumi Sawamura in Shintaro Kazama's Sunflower Orphanage. She suffered from a disease which had her periodically going to the hospital since 1984. In 1996, her final possible surgery and reliance on her elder brother is the reason Kazuma Kiryu takes the fall for Sohei Dojima's murder. She died shortly after and her death spiraled Nishikiyama's descent into darkness.\n \n'''Shinji Tanaka''' ({{Nihongo2|\u7530\u4e2d \u30b7\u30f3\u30b8}}, ''Tanaka Shinji'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Takafumi Yamaguchi]] (''Yakuza''), [[Tomokazu Sugita]] (''Yakuza Kiwami'')|[[Daniel Capellaro]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n\t\nKazuma Kiryu's friend, Shinji looks up to Kiryu and helps him out when he can.

He is part of the Dojima family. He dies from wounds inflicted by Arase's subordinate Mochizuki.\n \t\n'''Koji Shindo''' ({{Nihongo2|\u65b0\u85e4 \u6d69\u4e8c}}, ''Shind\u014d K\u014dji'')<br>\n:{{Voiced by|[[Tomoyuki Dan]]}}\n \nInitially a lieutenant of the Nishikiyama family in the first game, he serves as a boss in Chapter 7.\n\nIn ''Yakuza 2'', he eventually becomes the second chairman of the Nishikiyama family.

Her son, Daigo, intervenes and kills Shindo.\n\n'''Kazuto Arase''' ({{Nihongo2|\u8352\u702c \u548c\u4eba}}, ''Arase Kazuto'')<br>\n \t\nA cold-hearted Yakuza officer who is renowned for his brutality and his high marksmanship, he kills Reina and Shinji in ''Yakuza 1'' on the orders of Nishkiyama before being defeated by Kiryu.\n\t\nIn ''Yakuza 3'', it is revealed that he was disowned from the Nishikiyama family by Shindo for his failure to kill Kiryu. He forms the Yakuza assassin group the \"Avengers\", made up of disowned Yakuza, with his ultimate goal to take his revenge on Kiryu and kill him. He fails and disbands the Avengers, but swears to have one final showdown with Kiryu in the future.\n \n'''Tsuyoshi Kanda''' ({{Nihongo2|\u795e\u7530 \u5f37}}, ''Kanda Tsuyoshi'')\t\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hiroyuki Miyasako]]}}\n\n49 years old, bald.

He most likely became the fourth chairman of the clan following Kanda's death.\n\n===Shimano Family===\n;Futoshi Shimano ({{Nihongo2|\u5d8b\u91ce \u592a}}, ''Shimano Futoshi'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Naomi Kusumi]]|[[Michael Madsen]] (''Yakuza'')}}\n \t\nShimano is 193&nbsp;cm,120&nbsp;kg, the head of the Shimano Family, and an affiliate of the Tojo Clan, known as '''Futo Shimano''' in the overseas versions. Much like Sohei Dojima, he has a reputation for his ruthless, violent nature, and has a brutal grudge against Kiryu for Dojima's death. At Masaru Sera's funeral, Shimano fights Kiryu after the latter is discovered. After Shinji leaves Kazama on Terada's boat, the Shimano family attacks. After being defeated by Kiryu and the Kazama Family reinforcements, Shimano throws a grenade towards Haruka, which kills Kazama when he saves Haruka's life, shortly before being shot and killed by Terada. He has a tattoo of a tiger on his back.\n \t\nIn the events of Yakuza 0, he was the Patriarch of Goro Majima. Infuriated with his failure to participate in the raid he orders him to be tortured in his private chambers where he endured a year of pain and suffering by Shimano's personal hands. Exiling him to Soutenboori, he entrusts Majima with the custody of Sagawa who offers him to a chance to escape if he kills Makimura Makoto. Shimano does not reappear until later in the game after Majima and Sagawa finds and supposedly kills Sera and reveals they wanted Makoto alive so she would willingly give Shimano the deed to the land she owned due to her feelings for Majima. After Sera secured his position as the new Chairman of the Tojo, Majima was tasked with killing Shimano for his secret alliance with the Omi but Shimano demonstrates his loyalty by killing the envoy of the Omi present for negotiations which spares him of his involvement in the plot to betray the Tojo.\n \n===Majima Family===\n \n'''Daisaku Minami'''\n:{{Voiced by|[[Hideo Ishikawa]]}}\n \nMinami is the Junior Leader of the Majima Family. He debuts in ''Yakuza 4'' where he arrives at a dance club owned by Akiyama looking for Lily. After trading insults and refusing to leave, he and Akiyama fight in which he is defeated. He then attempts to continue fighting until he is stopped by Majima, who then reveals that he is looking for Lily in order to protect her. He later appears in the Millennium Tower when Taiga Saejima arrives looking for Goro. He then orders members of the Majima Family to attack the intruder and fights Taiga personally after they are defeated in which he is defeated himself. He uses \"drunken style\" while fighting in which he attacks opponents while intoxicated, which makes him more agile and nimble than he is normally.\n \t\n===Hakuho Clan===\n'''Yoshitaka Mine''' ({{Nihongo2|\u5cef \u7fa9\u5b5d}}, ''Mine Yoshitaka'')\n:{{Voiced by|[[Nakamura Shid\u014d II]]}}\n \n34 years old. Mine is the President of the Hakuho Clan ({{Nihongo2|\u767d\u5cef\u4f1a}}, ''Hakuh\u014d-kai''), a Tojo Clan affiliate, and serves as one of the main antagonists (and is the final boss of) ''Yakuza 3''. He has a golden kirin tattoo on his back. Bilingual, he speaks both Japanese and English.\n\t\nMine as a child grew up in a poor environment, shunned by other children because of his poor background. He was solely raised by his father (uncle in the EU & US localization) who later died of an unknown illness. Before his father died, on his deathbed he advised Mine that because of his high intelligence he should make something of himself and that he was sorry to leave him alone. He grew up as an orphan and studied hard to make something of himself whilst shunning people from ever getting close to him.\n \t\nIn adulthood, he became a very successful Japanese businessman; he had all the money he wanted and could have any woman he desired. However, this life led him to the realization that it was all a lie and that people only used him for his money. Human bonds, to Mine, were non-existent as humans are all self-serving hypocrites.\n\t\nTo find a society where human bonds were absolute, he took an interest in the yakuza. He bribed the Nishikiyama Family's Third Chairman, Tsuyoshi Kanda, to gain access to the Tojo Clan, making it appear as though Kanda was the one who scouted him. There he met with the Sixth Chairman, Daigo Dojima, and took an interest in him. Daigo, to Mine, was someone for the first time in ages he genuinely respected and cared for; he loved him like he was his best friend and brother. With Daigo's support, he rose to the top ranks and became the Chairman of the Hakuho Clan through his clear thinking and financial prowess.\n \nAfter Daigo was shot, Kashiwagi, acting as interim chairman, calls a meeting with the current Tojo Clan executive members over Kazuma Kiryu, the Fourth Chairman, returning to help mend this current crisis. Mine sides with Kashiwagi while Kanda and Hamazaki, due to their own personal ambitions, express their disapproval.\n \nMine, for the first time, meets with Kiryu at Kage's office in Purgatory to apologize profusely for Kanda's actions, that it was him who funded the Nishikiyama Family to stage a coup against the other families. As a peace offering he places a large metal box on Kage's desk containing Kanda's head. A flashback in Mine's office reveals how Kanda is angry over his defeat against Kiryu, destroying antiques in the process. Mine calmly tells him to refrain from destroying any more expensive antiques as he doesn't comprehend their value. Kanda lunges at Mine in animosity while Mine effortlessly counters him with a blow to his abdomen. After further consecutive blows, Kanda helplessly falls to the floor, pleading mercy. Mine confesses to him that while he may not look it, his physical strength surpasses Kanda's. Mine also reveals to the petulant Kanda how he has outlived his usefulness and orders his subordinates to execute him away from his office. Back in the present, Mine addresses that the matter is closed and that they have nothing to worry about with regards to Hamazaki, now that he has gone into hiding. Kiryu expresses his disapproval over Mine's actions, asking if this is what Daigo would have wanted. Mine responds to Kiryu how his reluctance to give up the orphanage caused Daigo to be shot and that his idealism is nothing more than hypocrisy. Mine then gives a final warning to Kiryu and his allies before he leaves.\n \nMine travels to Downtown Ryukyu in Okinawa by plane. With the employ of the Tamashiro Family he destroys the orphanage to further the resort development project. Mine orders the family to stall Kiryu in Okinawa before he travels back to Tokyo to find Daigo in Toto Hospital. During the plane journey, his subordinates discuss how Mine becoming the Seventh Chairman is something worth celebrating. Mine overhears their conversation and stabs a subordinate's hand with a dinner knife for insulting Daigo.\n \t\nAt Toto Hospital, he sits beside Daigo, lamenting how things come to this. He receives a phone call from the enigmatic Andre Richardson, head of Black Monday. Mine assures him in English that everything is going according to schedule and that there will be no changes in the plan. During the final battle on top of Toto University Hospital, he reveals to Kiryu that he is an orphan just like him, as well his true (albeit misguided) motives behind his betrayal of the Tojo Clan. Unable to cope with Daigo being in a coma after being shot, even if it was a lie to him, he wanted the power to do anything. Collaborating with Black Monday, he wanted to become the Seventh Chairman of the Tojo Clan to give him a new reason to live to render his grief non-existent. To fulfill that ambition, he has two obstacles: 1) To compassionately kill Daigo in his vegetative state and 2) To kill the person whom Daigo Dojima thought of the most highly - Kazuma Kiryu. Kiryu sees the futility in Mine's actions, and that his isolation was a result of his self-centredness. This prompts Mine to shoot at him out of rage while Kiryu remains unfazed by his opponent's anger. To get through to Mine, Kiryu challenges him to a duel to prove him wrong, which Mine accepts gladly and mentions how he won't be easily beaten. After a grueling fight, Mine is defeated.\n \t\nAfter Mine's defeat, he lies down on the rooftop exhausted. He receives an urgent phone call from his secretary whom he thought he mattered to. When she was discussing some business deal, Mine laments how it goes back to money, yet the yearning desire for bonds of friendship and love is in all of us, before cutting off the call. Mine asks Kiryu whether his clear state of mind means that his life has ended. The equally exhausted Kiryu responds that as long as we're still alive, we can start anew.

Although tall and strong, Hamazaki is more tactful and cunning than Kanda, using intimidation, manipulation and business connections to further his ambitions.\n \nWith only 10 members in his family, Hamazaki rose to the top ranks of the Tojo Clan after taking over Yokohama from the Japanese branch of the Snake Flower Triad 4 years ago. It is shown that Hamazaki was secretly working with the Snake Flower Triad leader Lau Ka Long, who survived the events of Yakuza 1, in order to accomplish this.\n \t\nInterested in the land resort deal, he works with the Land Minister Suzuki in order to remove the orphanage. With the land in his possession, he plans to create a secret casino for the Triad group.\n \t\nTo stop Kiryu from interfering in his plans to take over the Tojo Clan and claim the Okinawa resort land in his possession, he blackmails Majima to use his family to stop him.

With Kiryu dying, Goh mockingly states to Kazuma that his idealism will not amount to anything now that he's near death, and Kiryu responds that he still believes in people and his ideals even if he's dying, as the now-deceased Mine taught him this lesson. Bemused by Kiryu's resolve, he is tackled by Kazuki and Yuya, and forced to the ground as the police sirens wail in the background.\n \nGoh Hamazaki appears again in Yakuza 4, now as a 51-year-old prisoner at the same facility Taiga Saejima is transferred to.
