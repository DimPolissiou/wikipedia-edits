It is closed on Wednesdays and in the winter.\n\nThe line is locally known as \"''Torokko'' in Hozu gorge\". ''Torokko'' is a Japanese word derived from the English \"truck\" once used for mining cars hauling ore, but presently means rail carriages basic accommodation and open sides.\n\n==Description==\n===Company===\n*Wholly owned subsidiary of West Japan Railway Company\n*Headquarters: [[Uky\u014d-ku, Kyoto]], [[Kyoto Prefecture]], Japan\n*Founded: 1990\n*Major enterprise: Operation of Sagano Scenic Line\n\n===Line===\n*Under Railway Business Act (not under Tram Act)\n*Operation and possession (see [[Rail transport in Japan#Categories of railway|Three categories of railway]])\n**Operation: Sagano Scenic Railway (category 2)\n**Possession: West Japan Railway (category 1)\n*Track: single\n**Shares down (for Kameoka) track of Sanin Main Line between Torokko Saga and Torokko Arashiyama stations. Up trains of the line traverse the down line to reach Arashiyama.\n*Traction: internal combustion (diesel)\n*No. of stations: 4 including both ends\n*Rolling stock\n**Locomotive: 1\n**Coaches: 5\n\n==History==\n===Construction of the line===\nThe line was originally a part of the main line of the {{Nihongo|Kyoto Railway|\u4eac\u90fd\u9244\u9053|Ky\u014dto Tetsud\u014d}} opened in 1899, to connect [[Kyoto]] to the northern part of [[Kyoto Prefecture]], or the old [[Provinces of Japan|province]] of [[Tanba Province|Tanba]]. The company adopted the relatively level route through the gorge, avoiding {{Nihongo|Oinosaka|\u8001\u306e\u5742}} pass which would have required a steep grade. The company was nationalized in 1907. The line became a part of the [[San'in Main Line]].\n\n===Bypass===\n[[JR West]], succeeding the [[Japanese National Railways]] (JNR), built a new, shorter, straighter, electrified double-tracked section of the Sanin Main Line between Saga (present {{STN|Saga-Arashiyama}}) and {{STN|Umahori}} which opened in 1989, bypassing the original winding route with narrow tunnels.\n\n===Success===\nJR West utilised the original line for tourism under a subsidiary founded in 1990. JR West used old rolling stock for this purpose; four semi-open coaches hauled by a diesel locomotive.\n\nBy 1991, the line was more popular than expected (there had been speculation that the venture would be unsuccessful). As a result, a fifth carriage, nicknamed {{Nihongo|\"The Rich\"|\u30b6\u30fb\u30ea\u30c3\u30c1}}, was introduced. The car is contrary to its name, converted from an old gondola of JR West to fully open carriage, even the floor and the sides are of fine grills and offers a rough ride.\n\nCombined with [[rafting]] on the Hozu River, it is a major tourist attraction in Arashiyama and Sagano.\n\n==Operation==\nAll trains are operated between Torokko Saga and Torokko Kameoka stations. All seats are reserved, and tickets (JPY 620 for adult and JPY 310 for child, as of 2019) are on sale one month prior to the operation with some exceptions. Some are sold on the day, but travel in \"The Rich\" is not available on rainy days. Down (for Kameoka) trains cater for a return journey via the Hozu River boat ride to Arashiyama, thus up trains are generally less patronised.\n\n==Stations==\n[[File:Truck-hozukyo-station dec2006.jpg|thumb|Hozukyo station]]\nExcept Torokko Kameoka is in [[Kameoka, Kyoto|Kameoka]], all stations are in [[Kyoto]].\n*{{STN|Torokko Saga}} ([[:ja:\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30b3\u5d6f\u5ce8\u99c5|\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30b3\u5d6f\u5ce8]])\n**Newly built next to the Saga Station of the San'in Main Line as the terminus of Kyoto\n*{{STN|Torokko Arashiyama}} ([[:ja:\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30b3\u5d50\u5c71\u99c5|\u30c8\u30ed\u30c3\u30b3\u5d50\u5c71]])\n**Newly built next to the eastern portal of a tunnel entering to the gorge.

The main series follows the adventures of [[Carmen Cortez|Carmen]] and [[Juni Cortez]], two children who become involved in their parents' espionage. The rest of their family are [[Spy|spies]] as well, including their estranged uncle, [[Machete (character)|Machete]], and maternal grandparents. The films tend to have a strong [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] theme, as Rodriguez is of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]] descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/celebrity/machete-director-robert-rodriguez-doesn-t-see-oscar-future-1.1246087 |title=\u2018Machete\u2019 director Robert Rodriguez doesn\u2019t see Oscar future |author=AFP |date=October 23, 2013 |work= |publisher=/gulfnews.com |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n{{essay|section|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Influences===\n''Spy Kids'' was influenced by [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] films.

Technology in the films is portrayed as looking friendly, and a bit cartoonish.\n\nThe spy organization featured in the films is called the OSS. The initials seem to have been derived from the [[Office of Strategic Services]], a former [[United States|U.S.]] intelligence organization during World War II which later evolved into the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Note there is a character named Donnagon Giggles, after [[William J. Donovan|William Joseph Donovan]], the director of the real OSS.<ref name=cia2009december31>[https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/gen.-william-j.-donovan-heads-oss.html CIA: ''Look Back \u2026 Gen. William J. Donovan Heads Office of Strategic Services'']</ref> What the initials stand for in the ''Spy Kids'' universe is not specified on screen, but, according to one of the books, they stand for the Organization of Super Spies.\n\n===Themes===\nOne of the chief themes of ''Spy Kids'' is the unity of family. The films also play with the idea of children having adult responsibilities, and how keeping secrets from family members can have a negative effect on relationships. The first film also deals extensively with sibling rivalry and the responsibility of older children. It also has a strong sense of [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] heritage.\n\n===Technical innovations===\nThe other films were shot with High Definition [[digital video]],<ref>{{cite magazine | date = August 2002 | author = Fred Topel | title = Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams | quote = Rodriguez shot SPY KIDS 2 entirely with High Definition digital cameras | magazine = Cinefantastique | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages= 46-49 | url = https://archive.org/details/CinefantastiqueVol34No5Aug2002/page/n48 }}</ref> parts of the third film using an anaglyphic process to create the [[stereoscopy|3-D]] effects. Audiences were given red/blue glasses with their ticket purchase in movie theatres. Four sets of these glasses were also included in the [[DVD]] release. The third film was also used as a test for a special [[Texas Instruments]] digital projector which is supposed to be able to project polarized 3D, a process that does not require the red-blue lenses.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Spy Kids'' (2001)===\n{{main|Spy Kids}}\nAfter retiring from espionage for ten years, Gregorio and Ingrid ([[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Carla Gugino]]) are pulled back into duty for their important assignment despite the fact they were out of practice, and were captured. Their two children, [[Carmen Cortez|Carmen]] and [[Juni Cortez|Juni]] ([[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]] and [[Daryl Sabara]]), stay with their uncle Felix Gumm ([[Cheech Marin]]) and discover the truth of their parents' past, which they had neglected to tell them because they were afraid that if they knew, they would picture danger at every corner; and decide to rescue them. On their first mission, Carmen and Juni manage to bring around their estranged uncle, [[Machete (character)|Isador \"Machete\" Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]), a genius gadget inventor and Juni helps to redeem a tv show host named Fegan Floop ([[Alan Cumming]]). Together, Carmen and Juni thwart the plan of Floop's notorious second in-command Alexander Minion ([[Tony Shalhoub]]) to develop an army of androids resembling young children (including Carmen and Juni themselves) for a mastermind named Mr. Lisp ([[Robert Patrick]]) and his partner Ms. Gradenko ([[Teri Hatcher]]). The robots based on Carmen and Juni became part of Floop's show.\n\n===''Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams'' (2002)===\n{{main|Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams}}\nAs agents of the OSS, Carmen and Juni try to save the daughter ([[Taylor Momsen]]) of The President Of The United States ([[Christopher McDonald]]) while facing a particularly hard competition with Gary and Gerti Giggles ([[Matt O'Leary]] and [[Emily Osment]]), the two children of a double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles ([[Mike Judge]]), whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue them from the first film. Juni gets fired from the OSS after fighting with Gary over a smaller version of the transmooker, a device that can shut off all [[Electronics|electronic devices]] even though it was Gary who started the fight. Juni loses his spot for the best spy kid of the year award, while Donnagon plans to steal the transmooker to take over the world. On their second mission, Carmen and Juni follow the trail to the mysterious island of Leeke Leeke which is home to Romero ([[Steve Buscemi]]), an eccentric scientist who attempted to create genetically-miniaturised animals, but instead ended up with his island inhabited by mutant monsters. Eventually, Donnagon is fired and Gary is suspended, and the transmooker is destroyed. Juni is offered his job back, but in order to take a break from the OSS, he retires to start his own private eye agency.\n\n===''Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over'' (2003)===\n{{main|Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over}}\nAfter retiring from the OSS, Juni is thrust back into service when an evil mastermind named Sebastian \"The Toymaker\" ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) creates a fictional video game called ''Game Over'', which hypnotizes its users. Carmen was sent on a mission to disable the game, but disappeared on Level 4. With the help of his maternal grandfather, Valentin Avellan ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n|Ricardo Montalban]]), who uses a wheelchair, Juni is sent after Carmen and helps her to disable the game in order to save the world. It is revealed that Sebastian was the one who disabled Valentin in the first place. Instead of avenging his former partner, Valentin forgives Sebastian who is redeemed.\n\n===''Spy Kids: All the Time in the World'' (2011)===\n{{main|Spy Kids: All the Time in the World}}\nThe OSS has become the world's top spy agency, while the Spy Kids department has become defunct. A retired spy Marissa ([[Jessica Alba]]) is thrown back into the action along with her two stepchildren, Rebecca and Cecil ([[Rowan Blanchard]] and [[Mason Cook]]), when a maniacal Timekeeper ([[Jeremy Piven]]) attempts to take over the world.

The rest of their family are [[Spy|spies]] as well, including their estranged uncle, [[Machete (character)|Machete]], and maternal grandparents. The films tend to have a strong [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latino]] theme, as Rodriguez is of [[Mexican Americans|Mexican]] descent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gulfnews.com/arts-entertainment/celebrity/machete-director-robert-rodriguez-doesn-t-see-oscar-future-1.1246087 |title=\u2018Machete\u2019 director Robert Rodriguez doesn\u2019t see Oscar future |author=AFP |date=October 23, 2013 |work= |publisher=/gulfnews.com |accessdate=October 4, 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}\n{{essay|section|date=January 2015}}\n\n===Influences===\n''Spy Kids'' was influenced by [[James Bond (film series)|James Bond]] films. Director [[Robert Rodriguez]] says the first film was \"[[Willy Wonka]]-meets-[[James Bond]]\"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/apr/11/artsfeatures1 |title=Interview with Mexican director Robert Rodriguez &#124; Film |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2001-04-11 |accessdate=2018-09-16}}</ref> and the second was the \"''[[Mysterious Island]]'' and James Bond mix\". Technology in the films is portrayed as looking friendly, and a bit cartoonish.\n\nThe spy organization featured in the films is called the OSS. The initials seem to have been derived from the [[Office of Strategic Services]], a former [[United States|U.S.]] intelligence organization during World War II which later evolved into the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]]. Note there is a character named Donnagon Giggles, after [[William J. Donovan|William Joseph Donovan]], the director of the real OSS.<ref name=cia2009december31>[https://www.cia.gov/news-information/featured-story-archive/gen.-william-j.-donovan-heads-oss.html CIA: ''Look Back \u2026 Gen. William J. Donovan Heads Office of Strategic Services'']</ref> What the initials stand for in the ''Spy Kids'' universe is not specified on screen, but, according to one of the books, they stand for the Organization of Super Spies.\n\n===Themes===\nOne of the chief themes of ''Spy Kids'' is the unity of family. The films also play with the idea of children having adult responsibilities, and how keeping secrets from family members can have a negative effect on relationships. The first film also deals extensively with sibling rivalry and the responsibility of older children. It also has a strong sense of [[Latino]] heritage.\n\n===Technical innovations===\nThe other films were shot with High Definition [[digital video]],<ref>{{cite magazine | date = August 2002 | author = Fred Topel | title = Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams | quote = Rodriguez shot SPY KIDS 2 entirely with High Definition digital cameras | magazine = Cinefantastique | volume = 34 | issue = 5 | pages= 46-49 | url = https://archive.org/details/CinefantastiqueVol34No5Aug2002/page/n48 }}</ref> parts of the third film using an anaglyphic process to create the [[stereoscopy|3-D]] effects. Audiences were given red/blue glasses with their ticket purchase in movie theatres. Four sets of these glasses were also included in the [[DVD]] release. The third film was also used as a test for a special [[Texas Instruments]] digital projector which is supposed to be able to project polarized 3D, a process that does not require the red-blue lenses.\n\n==Films==\n\n===''Spy Kids'' (2001)===\n{{main|Spy Kids}}\nAfter retiring from espionage for ten years, Gregorio and Ingrid ([[Antonio Banderas]] and [[Carla Gugino]]) are pulled back into duty for their important assignment despite the fact they were out of practice, and were captured. Their two children, [[Carmen Cortez|Carmen]] and [[Juni Cortez|Juni]] ([[Alexa PenaVega|Alexa Vega]] and [[Daryl Sabara]]), stay with their uncle Felix Gumm ([[Cheech Marin]]) and discover the truth of their parents' past, which they had neglected to tell them because they were afraid that if they knew, they would picture danger at every corner; and decide to rescue them. On their first mission, Carmen and Juni manage to bring around their estranged uncle, [[Machete (character)|Isador \"Machete\" Cortez]] ([[Danny Trejo]]), a genius gadget inventor and Juni helps to redeem a tv show host named Fegan Floop ([[Alan Cumming]]). Together, Carmen and Juni thwart the plan of Floop's notorious second in-command Alexander Minion ([[Tony Shalhoub]]) to develop an army of androids resembling young children (including Carmen and Juni themselves) for a mastermind named Mr. Lisp ([[Robert Patrick]]) and his partner Ms. Gradenko ([[Teri Hatcher]]). The robots based on Carmen and Juni became part of Floop's show.\n\n===''Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams'' (2002)===\n{{main|Spy Kids 2: The Island of Lost Dreams}}\nAs agents of the OSS, Carmen and Juni try to save the daughter ([[Taylor Momsen]]) of The President Of The United States ([[Christopher McDonald]]) while facing a particularly hard competition with Gary and Gerti Giggles ([[Matt O'Leary]] and [[Emily Osment]]), the two children of a double-dealing agent Donnagon Giggles ([[Mike Judge]]), whom Carmen and Juni helped to rescue them from the first film. Juni gets fired from the OSS after fighting with Gary over a smaller version of the transmooker, a device that can shut off all [[Electronics|electronic devices]] even though it was Gary who started the fight. Juni loses his spot for the best spy kid of the year award, while Donnagon plans to steal the transmooker to take over the world. On their second mission, Carmen and Juni follow the trail to the mysterious island of Leeke Leeke which is home to Romero ([[Steve Buscemi]]), an eccentric scientist who attempted to create genetically-miniaturised animals, but instead ended up with his island inhabited by mutant monsters. Eventually, Donnagon is fired and Gary is suspended, and the transmooker is destroyed. Juni is offered his job back, but in order to take a break from the OSS, he retires to start his own private eye agency.\n\n===''Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over'' (2003)===\n{{main|Spy Kids 3-D: Game Over}}\nAfter retiring from the OSS, Juni is thrust back into service when an evil mastermind named Sebastian \"The Toymaker\" ([[Sylvester Stallone]]) creates a fictional video game called ''Game Over'', which hypnotizes its users. Carmen was sent on a mission to disable the game, but disappeared on Level 4. With the help of his maternal grandfather, Valentin Avellan ([[Ricardo Montalb\u00e1n|Ricardo Montalban]]), who uses a wheelchair, Juni is sent after Carmen and helps her to disable the game in order to save the world. It is revealed that Sebastian was the one who disabled Valentin in the first place. Instead of avenging his former partner, Valentin forgives Sebastian who is redeemed.\n\n===''Spy Kids: All the Time in the World'' (2011)===\n{{main|Spy Kids: All the Time in the World}}\nThe OSS has become the world's top spy agency, while the Spy Kids department has become defunct. A retired spy Marissa ([[Jessica Alba]]) is thrown back into the action along with her two stepchildren, Rebecca and Cecil ([[Rowan Blanchard]] and [[Mason Cook]]), when a maniacal Timekeeper ([[Jeremy Piven]]) attempts to take over the world. In order to save the world, Rebecca and Cecil must team up with Marissa.\n\n===''Machete'' series===\n{{Main|Machete (2010 film)|Machete Kills}}\n[[Machete (character)|Isador \"Machete\" Cortez]] (played by [[Danny Trejo]]), who appeared in all four ''Spy Kids'' films, had a series of two [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] films: ''[[Machete (2010 film)|Machete]]'' and ''[[Machete Kills]]'', also directed by Robert Rodriguez. However, the ''Machete'' films share little in common with the ''Spy Kids'' films thematically, instead being adult-oriented [[Action film|action]] [[exploitation film]]s, though they do share several cast members and characters with the ''Spy Kids'' films.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/1ytq7j/i_am_director_robert_rodriguez_here_again_with_el/cfnpq7k?context=1|last=Rodriguez |first=Robert|title=I am director Robert Rodriguez, here again with El Rey.

The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nWith version 2019.4 in November 2019, the default user interface was switched from [[GNOME]] to [[Xfce]], with a GNOME version still available.<ref name=\"softpedia\">{{cite web|first1=Marius|last1=Nestor|accessdate=2019-11-29|title=Kali Linux Ethical Hacking OS Switches to Xfce Desktop, Gets New Look and Feel|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/kali-linux-ethical-hacking-os-switches-to-xfce-desktop-gets-new-look-and-feel-528328.shtml|website=softpedia}}</ref>\n\n=== Requirements ===\n*Kali Linux requires a minimum of 3GB hard disk space for installation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kali Linux Hard Disk Install |url=https://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install |website=Kali Linux Official Documentation |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n*A minimum of 512MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 architectures.\n*A bootable CD-DVD drive or a USB stick.\n\n== Recommended==\nThe recommended hardware specification for smooth run are:\n* 10 GB of hard disk space, [[SSD]] preferred\n*Minimum of 2048 MB of [[RAM]]\n\n== Supported platforms ==\nKali Linux is distributed in [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] images for use on hosts based on the [[x86]] [[instruction set]] and as an image for the [[ARM architecture]] for use on the [[Beagle Board]] computer and on Samsung's ARM [[Chromebook]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/backtrack-successor-kali-launched-336420 |title=BackTrack successor Kali Linux launched |publisher=[[SC Magazine]] |first=Darren |last=Pauli |date=2013-03-13 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe developers of Kali Linux aim to make Kali Linux available for even more ARM devices.<ref name=\"Interview with Mati\">{{cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/behind-the-app-the-story-of-kali-linux-1666168491 |title=Behind the App: The Story of Kali Linux |publisher=Lifehacker |last=Orin |first=Andy |date=2014-12-03 |access-date=2019-04-10 |quote=Mati Aharoni: One of our goals with Kali is to provide images of the operating system for all sorts of exotic hardware\u2014mainly ARM based.

The decision was made to build Kali on top of the Debian distribution because it is well known for its quality, stability, and wide selection of available software.\n\nThe first version (1.0) was released one year later, in March 2013, and was based on [[Debian 7 Wheezy|Debian 7 \u201cWheezy\u201d]], Debian\u2019s stable distribution at the time. In that first year of development, they packaged hundreds of pen-testing-related applications and built the infrastructure. Even though the number of applications is significant, the application list has been meticulously curated, dropping applications that no longer worked or that duplicated features already available in better programs.\n\nDuring the two years following version 1.0, Kali released many incremental updates, expanding the range of available applications and improving hardware support, thanks to newer kernel releases. With some investment in continuous integration, they ensured that all important packages were kept in an installable state and that customized live images (a hallmark of the distribution) could always be created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://kali.training/topic/a-bit-of-history/ |title=A Bit of History |website=kali.training |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nWith version 2019.4 in November 2019, the default user interface was switched from [[GNOME]] to [[Xfce]], with a GNOME version still available.<ref name=\"softpedia\">{{cite web|first1=Marius|last1=Nestor|accessdate=2019-11-29|title=Kali Linux Ethical Hacking OS Switches to Xfce Desktop, Gets New Look and Feel|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/kali-linux-ethical-hacking-os-switches-to-xfce-desktop-gets-new-look-and-feel-528328.shtml|website=softpedia}}</ref>\n\n=== Requirements ===\n*Kali Linux requires a minimum of 3GB hard disk space for installation.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kali Linux Hard Disk Install |url=https://docs.kali.org/installation/kali-linux-hard-disk-install |website=Kali Linux Official Documentation |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n*A minimum of 512MB RAM for i386 and AMD64 architectures.\n*A bootable CD-DVD drive or a USB stick.\n\n== Recommended==\nThe recommended hardware specification for smooth run are:\n* 10 GB of hard disk space, [[SSD]] preferred\n*Minimum of 2048 MB of [[RAM]]\n\n== Supported platforms ==\nKali Linux is distributed in [[32-bit]] and [[64-bit]] images for use on hosts based on the [[x86]] [[instruction set]] and as an image for the [[ARM architecture]] for use on the [[Beagle Board]] computer and on Samsung's ARM [[Chromebook]].<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.itnews.com.au/news/backtrack-successor-kali-launched-336420 |title=BackTrack successor Kali Linux launched |publisher=[[SC Magazine]] |first=Darren |last=Pauli |date=2013-03-13 |access-date=2019-04-10}}</ref>\n\nThe developers of Kali Linux aim to make Kali Linux available for even more ARM devices.<ref name=\"Interview with Mati\">{{cite web |url=https://lifehacker.com/behind-the-app-the-story-of-kali-linux-1666168491 |title=Behind the App: The Story of Kali Linux |publisher=Lifehacker |last=Orin |first=Andy |date=2014-12-03 |access-date=2019-04-10 |quote=Mati Aharoni: One of our goals with Kali is to provide images of the operating system for all sorts of exotic hardware\u2014mainly ARM based.

I\u2019m not intrigued by a lot of the same things my peers are. The things that draw me in are more simple. I try to surround myself with the simple things such as mountains, surfing and nature, because that\u2019s what I enjoy. I\u2019m inspired by it; it\u2019s how I grew up. I\u2019ve never been tempted to stray from that. By being in creation, I\u2019m able to learn about and enjoy God\u2019s artwork. Seeing what God has created is simply magnificent! However I can play in it \u2014 hiking, surfing, camping or practicing photography \u2014 I want to share that with others so they can experience the beauty of God\u2019s handiwork as well. Baseball is definitely my main passion and focus, but these secondary things are also a big part of my life. However I can use my life to point others to God, while enjoying the way He\u2019s created me, I will.<ref>{{cite web |title=THE INCREASE: Daniel Norris - How He Created Me |url=https://sportsspectrum.com/the-increase/2018/04/26/the-increase-daniel-norris-how-he-created-me/ |accessdate=9 August 2019}}</ref>\n\nNorris's family has owned a bicycle shop in [[Johnson City, Tennessee]], for more than 80 years.

His unconventional lifestyle can be described as nonconformist and minimalist, and has raised eyebrows in MLB. Prior to the 2015 season, [[Tony LaCava]], Toronto's assistant general manager, said of Norris \"He takes care of himself as well as anybody we've got. He's in great shape. He competes on the mound.

{"title_page": "Literaturoper", "text_new": "'''Literaturoper''' (''literature opera'', plural \u201cLiteraturopern\u201d), a term coined by the German music critic Edgar Istel, describes a genre of [[opera]] that emerged during the late 19th century. When an existing play for the legitimate theatre is set to music without major changes and without the intervention of a librettist, a \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d is the result. Although the term is [[German language|German]], it can be applied to any kind of opera, irrespective of style or language. (In that sense it can be regarded as a term rather than a genre as such.)\n\nThe former, much broader usage of the term \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d for opera libretti on the basis of dramas, novels and short stories of undoubted literary renown, which was still common until around 1980, has been made obsolete by recent research on the history of the opera libretto. Since opera libretti have relied on subject matter from the history of literature since the very origin of the genre of opera, a broader usage of the term would cover the entire genre of opera.<ref>Albert Gier: ''Das Libretto. Theorie und Geschichte einer musikoliterarischen Gattung.'' Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 1998, ISBN 3-534-12368-9. (Second edition: Insel, Frankfurt am Main 2000, ISBN 3-458-34366-0)</ref>\n\n== Current definition ==\nAccording to a seminal publication by Peter Petersen, the term means \u201ea special form of music theater in which the libretto is based on a literary work whose linguistic, semantic and aesthetic structure remains recognizable in the musical-dramatic work as a structural layer.\u201c<ref>Peter Petersen: ''Der Terminus \"Literaturoper\" \u2013 eine Begriffsbestimmung.''

When an existing play for the legitimate theatre is set to music without major changes and without the intervention of a librettist, a \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d is the result. Although the term is [[German language|German]], it can be applied to any kind of opera, irrespective of style or language. (In that sense it can be regarded as a term rather than a genre as such.)\n\nThe former, much broader usage of the term \u201cLiteraturoper\u201d for opera libretti on the basis of dramas, novels and short stories of undoubted literary renown, which was still common until around 1980, has been made obsolete by recent research on the history of the opera libretto. Since opera libretti have relied on subject matter from the history of literature since the origin of the genre of opera, a broader usage of the term would apply to the entitre genre of opera.<ref>Albert Gier: ''Das Libretto.

The transmit and receive data paths include, respectively, (TDCLK, TDAT[15:0],TCTL) and (RDCLK, RDAT[15:0], RCTL).
