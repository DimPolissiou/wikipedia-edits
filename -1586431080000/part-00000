It derives from the ''[[cognomen]]'' of [[Julius Caesar]], the [[Roman dictator]]. The change from being a familial name to a title adopted by the [[Roman Emperor]]s can be dated to about 68/69 AD, the so-called \"[[Year of the Four Emperors]]\".{{dubious|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Sole Roman Emperor==\nFor political and personal reasons, [[Octavian]] chose to emphasize his relationship with Julius Caesar by styling himself simply \"[[Imperator]] Caesar\" (whereto the [[Roman Senate]] added the honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', \"Majestic\" or \"Venerable\", in 27 BC), without any of the other elements of his full name. His successor as emperor, his stepson [[Tiberius]], also bore the name as a matter of course; born Tiberius Claudius Nero, he was adopted by Caesar Augustus on 26 June 4 AD, as \"Tiberius Julius Caesar\". The precedent was set: the Emperor designated his successor by adopting him and giving him the name \"Caesar\".\n\nThe fourth Emperor, [[Claudius]], was the first to assume the name \"Caesar\" upon accession, without having been adopted by the previous emperor; however, he was at least a member by blood of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], being the maternal great-nephew of Augustus on [[Antonia Minor|his mother]]'s side, the nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of [[Caligula]]. Claudius in turn adopted his stepson and grand-nephew Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, giving him the name \"Caesar\" in the traditional way; his stepson would rule as the Emperor [[Nero]]. The first emperor to assume the position and the name simultaneously without any real claim to either was the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] Servius Sulpicius [[Galba]], who took the imperial throne under the name \"Servius Galba Imperator Caesar\" following the death of the last of the Julio-Claudians, Nero, in 68 AD.  Galba helped solidify \"Caesar\" as the title of the designated heir by giving it to his own adopted heir, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Licinianus.\n\nGalba's reign did not last long and he was soon deposed by Marcus [[Otho]].  Otho did not at first use the title \"Caesar\" and occasionally used the title \"Nero\" as emperor, but later adopted the title \"Caesar\" as well.  Otho was then defeated by Aulus [[Vitellius]], who acceded with the name \"Aulus Vitellius Germanicus Imperator Augustus\".  Vitellius did not adopt the cognomen \"Caesar\" as part of his name and may have intended to replace it with \"Germanicus\" (he bestowed the name \"Germanicus\" upon his own son that year).\n\nNevertheless, Caesar had become such an integral part of the imperial dignity that its place was immediately restored by Titus Flavius [[Vespasian]]us (\"Vespasian\"), whose defeat of Vitellius in 69 AD put an end to the period of instability and began the [[Flavian dynasty]]. Vespasian's son, [[Titus]] Flavius Vespasianus became \"Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus\".\n\n==Dynastic title==\nBy this point the status of \"Caesar\" had been regularised into that of a title given to the Emperor-designate (occasionally also with the honorific title ''Princeps Iuventutis'', \"Prince of Youth\") and retained by him upon accession to the throne (e.g., Marcus Ulpius [[Trajan|Traianus]] became Marcus Cocceius [[Nerva]]'s designated heir as Caesar Nerva Traianus in October 97 and acceded on 28 January 98 as \"Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Augustus\"). After some variation among the earliest emperors, the style of the Emperor-designate on coins was usually ''[[Nobilissimus]] Caesar'' \"Most Noble Caesar\" (abbreviated to NOB CAES, N CAES etc.), though ''Caesar'' (CAES) on its own was also used.\n\n==Late Empire==\n===Crisis of the Third Century===\nThe popularity of using the title Caesar to designate heirs-apparent increased throughout the third century. Many of the soldier emperors during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] attempted to strengthen their legitimacy by naming heirs, including [[Maximinus Thrax]], [[Philip the Arab]], [[Decius]], [[Trebonianus Gallus]] and [[Gallienus]]. Some of these were promoted to the rank of Augustus within their father's lifetime, for example [[Philippus II]]. The same title would also be used in the [[Gallic Empire]], which operated autonomously from the rest of the Roman Empire from 260 to 274, with the final Gallic emperor [[Tetricus I]] appointing his heir [[Tetricus II]] Caesar and his consular colleague for 274. \n\nDespite the best efforts of these emperors, however, the granting of this title does not seem to have made succession in this chaotic period any more stable. Almost all Caesars would be killed before or alongside their fathers, or at best outlive them for a matter of months, as in the case of [[Hostilian]]. The sole Caesar to successfully obtain the rank of Augustus and rule for some time in his own right was [[Gordian III]], and even he was heavily controlled by his court.\n\n===Tetrarchy===\nOn 1 March 293, Gaius Aurelius Valerius [[Diocletian]]us established the [[Tetrarchy]], a system of rule by two senior Emperors and two junior sub-Emperors. The two coequal senior emperors were styled identically to previous Emperors, as ''Imperator Caesar NN. Pius Felix Invictus Augustus'' ([[Elagabalus]] had introduced the use of ''Pius Felix'', \"the Pious and Blessed\", while [[Maximinus Thrax|Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus \"Thrax\"]] introduced the use of ''Invictus'', \"the Unconquered\") and were called the ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]'', while the two junior sub-Emperors were styled identically to previous Emperors-designate, as ''Nobilissimus Caesar''. Likewise, the junior sub-Emperors retained the title \"Caesar\" upon accession to the senior position.\n\nThe Tetrarchy was quickly abandoned as a system (though the four quarters of the empire survived as [[praetorian prefecture]]s) in favour of two equal, territorial emperors, and the previous system of Emperors and Emperors-designate was restored, both in the [[Latin]]-speaking West and the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking East.\n\n===After the Tetrarchy===\nThe title of Caesar remained in use throughout the Constantinian period, with both [[Constantine]] I and his co-emperor and rival [[Licinius]] utilising it to mark their heirs. In the case of Constantine, this meant that by the time he died, he had four Caesars: [[Constantius II]], [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constans]] and his nephew [[Dalmatius]], with his eldest son [[Crispus]] having been executed in mysterious circumstances earlier in his reign. In the event, Constantine would be succeeded only by his three sons, with Dalmatius dying in the summer of 337 in similarly murky circumstances. \n\nConstantius II himself would nominate as Caesars his two cousins [[Constantius Gallus]] and [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in succession in the 350s, although he first executed Gallus and then found himself at war with Julian before his own death. After Julian's revolt of 361, the title Caesar fell out of imperial fashion for some time, with emperors preferring simply to elevate their sons directly to the post of Augustus, as with [[Gratian]]. It would be revived only nearly three quarters of a century later when [[Theodosius II]] used it to mark his nephew [[Valentinian III]] before successfully installing him upon the western throne vacated by the boy's other uncle [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. Thereafter it would receive limited use in the Eastern Roman Empire, for example, in the designation of [[Leo II (emperor)|the future Leo II]] in the final months of [[Leo I the Thracian|his grandfather]]'s life.\n\n==Byzantine Empire==\n[[File:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]], mosaic in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Constantinople]]]]\n''Caesar'' or ''Kaisar'' ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1}}) was a senior court title in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Originally, as in the late [[Roman Empire]], it was used for a subordinate co-emperor or the heir apparent, and was first among the \"awarded\" dignities. From the reign of [[Theodosius I]], however, most emperors chose to solidify the succession of their intended heirs by raising them to co-emperors. Hence the title was more frequently awarded to second- and third-born sons, or to close and influential relatives of the Emperor: thus for example [[Alexios Mosele (Caesar)|Alexios Mosele]] was the son-in-law of [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] (ruled 829\u2013842), [[Bardas]] was the uncle and chief minister of [[Michael III]] (r. 842\u2013867), while [[Nikephoros II]] (r. 963\u2013969) awarded the title to his father, [[Bardas Phokas the Elder|Bardas Phokas]].{{sfn|Bury|1911|p=36}}{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Caesar\" (A. Kazhdan), p. 363}} An exceptional case was the conferment of the dignity and its insignia to the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] khan [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] by [[Justinian II]] (r. 685\u2013695, 705\u2013711) who had helped him regain his throne in 705.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Caesar\" (A. Kazhdan), p. 363}} The title was awarded to the brother of Empress [[Maria of Alania]], [[George II of Georgia]] in 1081.\n\nThe office enjoyed extensive privileges, great prestige and power. When [[Alexios I Komnenos]] created the title of ''[[sebastokrator]]'', ''kaisar'' became third in importance, and fourth after [[Manuel I Komnenos]] created the title of ''[[despot (court title)|despot]]'', which it remained until the end of the Empire. The feminine form was ''kaisarissa''. It remained an office of great importance, usually awarded to imperial relations, as well as a few high-ranking and distinguished officials, and only rarely awarded to foreigners.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Kletorologion|Kl\u0113torologion]]'' of 899, the Byzantine ''Caesar''{{'}}s insignia were a crown without a cross, and the ceremony of a ''Caesar''{{'}}s creation (in this case dating to [[Constantine V]]), is included in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' I.43.{{sfn|Bury|1911|pp=20, 36}} The title remained the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the introduction of the ''[[sebastokrator|sebastokrat\u014dr]]'' (a composite derived from ''[[sebastos]]'' and ''[[autokrator]]'', the Greek equivalents of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' and ''[[imperator]]'') by [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081\u20131118) and later of ''[[Despotes|despot\u0113s]]'' by [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (r. 1143\u20131180). The title remained in existence through the last centuries of the Empire. In the [[Palaiologan period]], it was held by prominent nobles like [[Alexios Strategopoulos]], but from the 14th century, it was mostly awarded to rulers of the [[Balkans]] such as the princes of [[Great Vlachia|Vlachia]], [[Medieval Serbian state|Serbia]] and [[Thessaly]].{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Caesar\" (A. Kazhdan), p. 363}}\n\nIn the late Byzantine hierarchy, as recorded in the mid-14th century ''Book of Offices'' of [[pseudo-Kodinos]], the rank continued to come after the ''sebastokrat\u014dr''. Pseudo-Kodinos further records that the ''Caesar'' was equal in precedence to the ''[[panhypersebastos]]'', another creation of Alexios I, but that Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1259\u20131282) had raised his nephew [[Michael Tarchaneiotes]] to the rank of ''[[protovestiarios]]'' and decreed that to come after the ''Caesar''; while under [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282\u20131328) the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' was raised to the same eminence, when it was awarded to the future emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] (r. 1347\u20131354).{{sfn|Verpeaux|1966|pp=134\u2013136}} According to pseudo-Kodinos, the ''Caesar''{{'}}s insignia under the Palaiologoi were a ''skiadion'' hat in red and gold, decorated with gold-wire embroideries, with a veil bearing the wearer's name and [[Pendilia|pendants]] identical to those of the ''despot\u0113s'' and the ''sebastokrat\u014dr''. He wore a red tunic (''rouchon'') similar to the emperor's (without certain decorations), and his shoes and stockings were blue, as were the accouterments of his horse; these were all identical to those of the ''sebastokrat\u014dr'', but without the embroidered eagles of the latter. Pseudo-Kodinos writes that the particular forms of another form of hat, the domed ''skaranikon'', and of the mantle, the ''tamparion'', for the ''Caesar'' were not known.{{sfn|Verpeaux|1966|pp=147\u2013149}}\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n [[Image:Gennadios II and Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Mehmed II]] and Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadios]].]]\nIn the [[Middle East]], the Persians and the Arabs continued to refer to the Roman and Byzantine emperors as \"Caesar\" (in  {{lang-fa|\u0642\u06cc\u0635\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0645}} ''Qaysar-i Rum'', \"Caesar of the Romans\", from [[Middle Persian]] ''k\u0113sar''). Thus, following the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the victorious [[Ottoman sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] became the first of the rulers of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to assume the title (in {{lang-ota|\u0642\u06cc\u0635\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0645}} ''Kaysar-i R\u00fbm''). \n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople, having conquered the Byzantine Empire, Mehmed took the title ''Kaysar-i R\u00fbm'', claiming succession to the Roman imperium.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michalis N.

It derives from the ''[[cognomen]]'' of [[Julius Caesar]], the [[Roman dictator]]. The change from being a familial name to a title adopted by the [[Roman Emperor]]s can be dated to about 68/69 AD, the so-called \"[[Year of the Four Emperors]]\".{{dubious|date=March 2018}}\n\n==Sole Roman Emperor==\nFor political and personal reasons, [[Octavian]] chose to emphasize his relationship with Julius Caesar by styling himself simply \"[[Imperator]] Caesar\" (whereto the [[Roman Senate]] added the honorific ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'', \"Majestic\" or \"Venerable\", in 27 BC), without any of the other elements of his full name. His successor as emperor, his stepson [[Tiberius]], also bore the name as a matter of course; born Tiberius Claudius Nero, he was adopted by Caesar Augustus on 26 June 4 AD, as \"Tiberius Julius Caesar\". The precedent was set: the Emperor designated his successor by adopting him and giving him the name \"Caesar\".\n\nThe fourth Emperor, [[Claudius]], was the first to assume the name \"Caesar\" upon accession, without having been adopted by the previous emperor; however, he was at least a member by blood of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]], being the maternal great-nephew of Augustus on [[Antonia Minor|his mother]]'s side, the nephew of Tiberius, and the uncle of [[Caligula]]. Claudius in turn adopted his stepson and grand-nephew Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, giving him the name \"Caesar\" in the traditional way; his stepson would rule as the Emperor [[Nero]]. The first emperor to assume the position and the name simultaneously without any real claim to either was the [[Roman usurper|usurper]] Servius Sulpicius [[Galba]], who took the imperial throne under the name \"Servius Galba Imperator Caesar\" following the death of the last of the Julio-Claudians, Nero, in 68 AD.  Galba helped solidify \"Caesar\" as the title of the designated heir by giving it to his own adopted heir, Lucius Calpurnius Piso Frugi Licinianus.\n\nGalba's reign did not last long and he was soon deposed by Marcus [[Otho]].  Otho did not at first use the title \"Caesar\" and occasionally used the title \"Nero\" as emperor, but later adopted the title \"Caesar\" as well.  Otho was then defeated by Aulus [[Vitellius]], who acceded with the name \"Aulus Vitellius Germanicus Imperator Augustus\".  Vitellius did not adopt the cognomen \"Caesar\" as part of his name and may have intended to replace it with \"Germanicus\" (he bestowed the name \"Germanicus\" upon his own son that year).\n\nNevertheless, Caesar had become such an integral part of the imperial dignity that its place was immediately restored by Titus Flavius [[Vespasian]]us (\"Vespasian\"), whose defeat of Vitellius in 69 AD put an end to the period of instability and began the [[Flavian dynasty]]. Vespasian's son, [[Titus]] Flavius Vespasianus became \"Titus Flavius Caesar Vespasianus\".\n\n==Dynastic title==\nBy this point the status of \"Caesar\" had been regularised into that of a title given to the Emperor-designate (occasionally also with the honorific title ''Princeps Iuventutis'', \"Prince of Youth\") and retained by him upon accession to the throne (e.g., Marcus Ulpius [[Trajan|Traianus]] became Marcus Cocceius [[Nerva]]'s designated heir as Caesar Nerva Traianus in October 97 and acceded on 28 January 98 as \"Imperator Caesar Nerva Traianus Augustus\"). After some variation among the earliest emperors, the style of the Emperor-designate on coins was usually ''[[Nobilissimus]] Caesar'' \"Most Noble Caesar\" (abbreviated to NOB CAES, N CAES etc.), though ''Caesar'' (CAES) on its own was also used.\n\n==Late Empire==\n===Crisis of the Third Century===\nThe popularity of using the title Caesar to designate heirs-apparent increased throughout the third century. Many of the soldier emperors during the [[Crisis of the Third Century]] attempted to strengthen their legitimacy by naming heirs, including [[Maximinus Thrax]], [[Philip the Arab]], [[Decius]], [[Trebonianus Gallus]] and [[Gallienus]]. Some of these were promoted to the rank of Augustus within their father's lifetime, for example [[Philippus II]]. The same title would also be used in the [[Gallic Empire]], which operated autonomously from the rest of the Roman Empire from 260 to 274, with the final Gallic emperor [[Tetricus I]] appointing his heir [[Tetricus II]] Caesar and his consular colleague for 274. \n\nDespite the best efforts of these emperors, however, the granting of this title does not seem to have made succession in this chaotic period any more stable. Almost all Caesars would be killed before or alongside their fathers, or at best outlive them for a matter of months, as in the case of [[Hostilian]]. The sole Caesar to successfully obtain the rank of Augustus and rule for some time in his own right was [[Gordian III]], and even he was heavily controlled by his court.\n\n===Tetrarchy===\nOn 1 March 293, Gaius Aurelius Valerius [[Diocletian]]us established the [[Tetrarchy]], a system of rule by two senior Emperors and two junior sub-Emperors. The two coequal senior emperors were styled identically to previous Emperors, as ''Imperator Caesar NN. Pius Felix Invictus Augustus'' ([[Elagabalus]] had introduced the use of ''Pius Felix'', \"the Pious and Blessed\", while [[Maximinus Thrax|Gaius Iulius Verus Maximinus \"Thrax\"]] introduced the use of ''Invictus'', \"the Unconquered\") and were called the ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augusti]]'', while the two junior sub-Emperors were styled identically to previous Emperors-designate, as ''Nobilissimus Caesar''. Likewise, the junior sub-Emperors retained the title \"Caesar\" upon accession to the senior position.\n\nThe Tetrarchy was quickly abandoned as a system (though the four quarters of the empire survived as [[praetorian prefecture]]s) in favour of two equal, territorial emperors, and the previous system of Emperors and Emperors-designate was restored, both in the [[Latin]]-speaking West and the [[Greek language|Greek]]-speaking East.\n\n===After the Tetrarchy===\nThe title of Caesar remained in use throughout the Constantinian period, with both [[Constantine]] I and his co-emperor and rival [[Licinius]] utilising it to mark their heirs. In the case of Constantine, this meant that by the time he died, he had four Caesars: [[Constantius II]], [[Constantine II (emperor)|Constantine II]], [[Constans]] and his nephew [[Dalmatius]], with his eldest son [[Crispus]] having been executed in mysterious circumstances earlier in his reign. In the event, Constantine would be succeeded only by his three sons, with Dalmatius dying in the summer of 337 in similarly murky circumstances. \n\nConstantius II himself would nominate as Caesars his two cousins [[Constantius Gallus]] and [[Julian the Apostate|Julian]] in succession in the 350s, although he first executed Gallus and then found himself at war with Julian before his own death. After Julian's revolt of 361, the title Caesar fell out of imperial fashion for some time, with emperors preferring simply to elevate their sons directly to the post of Augustus, as with [[Gratian]]. It would be revived only nearly three quarters of a century later when [[Theodosius II]] used it to mark his nephew [[Valentinian III]] before successfully installing him upon the western throne vacated by the boy's other uncle [[Honorius (emperor)|Honorius]]. Thereafter it would receive limited use in the Eastern Roman Empire, for example, in the designation of [[Leo II (emperor)|the future Leo II]] in the final months of [[Leo I the Thracian|his grandfather]]'s life.\n\n==Byzantine Empire==\n[[File:Byzantinischer Mosaizist um 1000 002.jpg|thumb|right|170px|The Roman emperor [[Constantine the Great]], mosaic in [[Hagia Sophia]], [[Constantinople]]]]\n''Caesar'' or ''Kaisar'' ({{lang|grc|\u039a\u03b1\u1fd6\u03c3\u03b1\u03c1}}) was a senior court title in the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Originally, as in the late [[Roman Empire]], it was used for a subordinate co-emperor or the heir apparent, and was first among the \"awarded\" dignities. From the reign of [[Theodosius I]], however, most emperors chose to solidify the succession of their intended heirs by raising them to co-emperors. Hence the title was more frequently awarded to second- and third-born sons, or to close and influential relatives of the Emperor: thus for example [[Alexios Mosele (Caesar)|Alexios Mosele]] was the son-in-law of [[Theophilos (emperor)|Theophilos]] (ruled 829\u2013842), [[Bardas]] was the uncle and chief minister of [[Michael III]] (r. 842\u2013867), while [[Nikephoros II]] (r. 963\u2013969) awarded the title to his father, [[Bardas Phokas the Elder|Bardas Phokas]].{{sfn|Bury|1911|p=36}}{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Caesar\" (A. Kazhdan), p. 363}} An exceptional case was the conferment of the dignity and its insignia to the [[First Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian]] khan [[Tervel of Bulgaria|Tervel]] by [[Justinian II]] (r. 685\u2013695, 705\u2013711) who had helped him regain his throne in 705.{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Caesar\" (A. Kazhdan), p. 363}} The title was awarded to the brother of Empress [[Maria of Alania]], [[George II of Georgia]] in 1081.\n\nThe office enjoyed extensive privileges, great prestige and power. When [[Alexios I Komnenos]] created the title of ''[[sebastokrator]]'', ''kaisar'' became third in importance, and fourth after [[Manuel I Komnenos]] created the title of ''[[despot (court title)|despot]]'', which it remained until the end of the Empire. The feminine form was ''kaisarissa''. It remained an office of great importance, usually awarded to imperial relations, as well as a few high-ranking and distinguished officials, and only rarely awarded to foreigners.\n\nAccording to the ''[[Kletorologion|Kl\u0113torologion]]'' of 899, the Byzantine ''Caesar''{{'}}s insignia were a crown without a cross, and the ceremony of a ''Caesar''{{'}}s creation (in this case dating to [[Constantine V]]), is included in ''[[De Ceremoniis]]'' I.43.{{sfn|Bury|1911|pp=20, 36}} The title remained the highest in the imperial hierarchy until the introduction of the ''[[sebastokrator|sebastokrat\u014dr]]'' (a composite derived from ''[[sebastos]]'' and ''[[autokrator]]'', the Greek equivalents of ''[[Augustus (honorific)|Augustus]]'' and ''[[imperator]]'') by [[Alexios I Komnenos]] (r. 1081\u20131118) and later of ''[[Despotes|despot\u0113s]]'' by [[Manuel I Komnenos]] (r. 1143\u20131180). The title remained in existence through the last centuries of the Empire. In the [[Palaiologan period]], it was held by prominent nobles like [[Alexios Strategopoulos]], but from the 14th century, it was mostly awarded to rulers of the [[Balkans]] such as the princes of [[Great Vlachia|Vlachia]], [[Medieval Serbian state|Serbia]] and [[Thessaly]].{{sfn|ODB|loc=\"Caesar\" (A. Kazhdan), p. 363}}\n\nIn the late Byzantine hierarchy, as recorded in the mid-14th century ''Book of Offices'' of [[pseudo-Kodinos]], the rank continued to come after the ''sebastokrat\u014dr''. Pseudo-Kodinos further records that the ''Caesar'' was equal in precedence to the ''[[panhypersebastos]]'', another creation of Alexios I, but that Emperor [[Michael VIII Palaiologos]] (r. 1259\u20131282) had raised his nephew [[Michael Tarchaneiotes]] to the rank of ''[[protovestiarios]]'' and decreed that to come after the ''Caesar''; while under [[Andronikos II Palaiologos]] (r. 1282\u20131328) the ''[[megas domestikos]]'' was raised to the same eminence, when it was awarded to the future emperor [[John VI Kantakouzenos]] (r. 1347\u20131354).{{sfn|Verpeaux|1966|pp=134\u2013136}} According to pseudo-Kodinos, the ''Caesar''{{'}}s insignia under the Palaiologoi were a ''skiadion'' hat in red and gold, decorated with gold-wire embroideries, with a veil bearing the wearer's name and [[Pendilia|pendants]] identical to those of the ''despot\u0113s'' and the ''sebastokrat\u014dr''. He wore a red tunic (''rouchon'') similar to the emperor's (without certain decorations), and his shoes and stockings were blue, as were the accouterments of his horse; these were all identical to those of the ''sebastokrat\u014dr'', but without the embroidered eagles of the latter. Pseudo-Kodinos writes that the particular forms of another form of hat, the domed ''skaranikon'', and of the mantle, the ''tamparion'', for the ''Caesar'' were not known.{{sfn|Verpeaux|1966|pp=147\u2013149}}\n\n==Ottoman Empire==\n [[Image:Gennadios II and Mehmed II.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Mehmed II]] and Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople [[Gennadius Scholarius|Gennadios]].]]\nIn the [[Middle East]], the Persians and the Arabs continued to refer to the Roman and Byzantine emperors as \"Caesar\" (in  {{lang-fa|\u0642\u06cc\u0635\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0645}} ''Qaysar-i Rum'', \"Caesar of the Romans\", from [[Middle Persian]] ''k\u0113sar''). Thus, following the [[Fall of Constantinople|conquest of Constantinople]] in 1453, the victorious [[Ottoman sultan]] [[Mehmed II]] became the first of the rulers of the [[Ottoman Empire]] to assume the title (in {{lang-ota|\u0642\u06cc\u0635\u0631 \u0631\u0648\u0645}} ''Kaysar-i R\u00fbm''). \n\nAfter the Fall of Constantinople, having conquered the Byzantine Empire, Mehmed took the title ''Kaysar-i R\u00fbm'', claiming succession to the Roman imperium.<ref>{{cite book|author1=Michalis N.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor.

His notable films include ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961), ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), ''[[Once Is Not Enough (film)|Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975), ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' (1979), ''[[Zorro, The Gay Blade]]'' (1981), ''[[The Godfather Part III]]'' (1990), ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1991), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), ''[[Hollywood Ending]]'' (2002) and ''[[The Congressman]]'' (2016). For his debut performance in ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), Hamilton won a [[Golden Globe Award]] and was nominated for a [[BAFTA Award]]. He has received one additional BAFTA nomination and two additional Golden Globe nominations.\n\nHamilton began his film career in 1958 and although he has a substantial body of work in film and television he is, perhaps, most famous for his debonair style and his perpetual suntan. [[Bo Derek]] writes in her autobiography that \"there was an ongoing contest between [[John Derek|John]] [Derek] and George Hamilton as to who was tanner\".<ref>Derek, Bo (with Mark Seal) (2002), ''Riding Lessons: Everything That Matters in Life I Learned from Horses'', ReganBooks HarperCollins, {{ISBN|0060394374}}, p.212</ref>\n\n==Early life==\nHamilton was born in [[Memphis, Tennessee]], the middle of three boys with an older maternal half brother and a younger full brother, and lived in [[Blytheville, Arkansas]]. He is the eldest son of bandleader [[George Hamilton (musician)|George \"Spike\" Hamilton]].<ref>[http://www.filmreference.com/film/43/George-Hamilton.html George Hamilton Biography (1939\u2013)<!-- Bot generated title -->] from filmreference.com</ref>\n\nHis stepfathers were Carleton Hunt and Jesse Spalding; his stepmother was June Howard, with whom Hamilton said he had an affair when he was 12 years old which was shortly after she married his father.<ref>Beifuss, John.

He appeared on such shows as ''[[The Veil (TV series)|The Veil]]'' (playing an Indian), ''[[The Adventures of Rin Tin Tin]]'', ''[[The Donna Reed Show]]'' and ''[[Cimarron City]]''.\n\nHis first film role was a lead, ''[[Crime and Punishment U.S.A.]]'' (1959), directed by [[Denis Sanders]]. Although shot in 1958 it was not released until the following year.\n\nHowever the film was seen by [[Vincente Minnelli]] who thought Hamilton would be ideal for the younger son in ''[[Home from the Hill (film)|Home from the Hill]]'' (1960), a Southern melodrama with [[Robert Mitchum]]. Hamilton was duly cast and the film was popular. [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] signed him to a long-term contract.\n\n===Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer===\nMGM cast Hamilton in support of [[Natalie Wood]] and [[Robert Wagner]] in the melodrama ''[[All the Fine Young Cannibals]]'' (1960) which flopped at the box office.\n\nHamilton's next film was far more popular, the beach party comedy ''[[Where the Boys Are]]'' (1960). This was a hit and remains one of his best known movies.\n\nHamilton wanted to do more serious material, however, so he appeared in the lower budgeted ''[[Angel Baby (1961 film)|Angel Baby]]'' (1961), a drama about an evangelist, for [[Allied Artists Pictures Corporation|Allied Artists]]. It had minimal commercial or critical impact. For [[United Artists]] he supported [[Lana Turner]] in a melodrama, ''[[By Love Possessed (film)|By Love Possessed]]'' (1961).\n\nMGM tried to change his image by putting him in a Western, ''[[A Thunder of Drums]]'' (1961) alongside [[Richard Boone]]; the film was mildly popular.\n\nHamilton lobbied hard for the role of the Italian husband in ''[[Light in the Piazza (film)|Light in the Piazza]]'' (1962), another melodrama, with [[Olivia de Havilland]]. The film lost money but Hamilton received excellent notices. It was shot in Italy, and MGM kept Hamilton in that country to play a role in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]'' (1962), an unsuccessful attempt to repeat the success of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' (1952).\n\nHamilton had an excellent part in ''[[The Victors (film)|The Victors]]'' (1963), an anti-war drama from [[Carl Foreman]]. It was a box office disappointment but was critically acclaimed. Hamilton had another good role in ''[[Act One (film)|Act One]]'' (1963), playing [[Moss Hart]], but the movie was poorly received. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre]]'' and ''[[Burke's Law (1963 TV series)|Burke's Law]]''.\n\nAfter making a cameo in ''[[Looking for Love (film)|Looking for Love]]'' (1964), Hamilton appeared in another biopic, ''[[Your Cheatin' Heart (film)|Your Cheatin' Heart]]'' (1964), playing [[Hank Williams]]. The movie was not widely seen but had its fans and Hamilton's performance received some praise. He guest starred on episodes of ''[[The Rogues (TV series)|The Rogues]]'' and ''[[Ben Casey]]''.\n\nHamilton went to Mexico to support [[Jeanne Moreau]] and [[Brigitte Bardot]] in ''[[Viva Maria!]]'' (1965). It was directed by [[Louis Malle]] who cast Hamilton on the strength of his performance in ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Malle said \"he was a personal choice and I am happy with him.... He's more interested in being in the social columns&nbsp;\u2013 I don't understand&nbsp;\u2013 when he should be one of the greatest of his generation.\"<ref>He Blunted U.S. Blue Pencil Thomas, Kevin. Los Angeles Times (June 29, 1965: C8</ref> The film was hugely popular in Europe, but did not break through to the US.\n\nHamilton made a movie in France, ''[[That Man George]]'' (1965) and appeared in a production of ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1966 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (1966) on TV, opposite [[Vanessa Redgrave]].\n\nHe returned to MGM to make a romantic comedy with [[Sandra Dee]], ''[[Doctor, You've Got to Be Kidding!]]'' (1967), which was mildly popular. At Columbia he co-starred with [[Glenn Ford]] in a Western ''[[A Time for Killing]]'' (1967), originally directed by [[Roger Corman]] then [[Phil Karlson]].\n\nHamilton played a cat burglar in MGM's ''[[Jack of Diamonds (1967 film)|Jack of Diamonds]]'' (1967). It was produced by Sandy Howard who said Hamilton was \"a hot commodity these days\" because he was dating [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s daughter.<ref>Lynda Johnson Gets A Job at McCall's: LYNDA BIRD GETS A JOB AT M'CALL'S By TERENCE SMITH.

He portrayed a trouble shooter for the US State Department in Paris helping US citizens. This series was canceled in March 1970.\n\nHe starred in the TV films ''[[Togetherness (film)|Togetherness]]'' (1970) and ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'', a 1971 compilation of two episodes of ''[[Harold Robbins' The Survivors]]''.\n\n===Producer===\nHamilton decided to move into producing to give himself greater control over his career. He produced and played the title role in ''[[Evel Knievel (1971 film)|Evel Knievel]]'' (1971). Hamilton had the script rewritten by [[John Milius]] who later called Hamilton \"a wonderful guy, totally underrated. A great con-man, that's what he really is. He always said, 'I'll be remembered as a third-rate actor when in fact, I'm a first-rate con man'.\"<ref name=\"nat\">Segaloff, Nat, \"John Milius: The Good Fights\", ''Backstory 4: Interviews with Screenwriters of the 1970s and 1980s'', Ed. [[Patrick McGilligan (biographer)|Patrick McGilligan]], Uni of California 2006 p 289</ref>\n\nHe appeared in a TV movie, ''[[The Last of the Powerseekers]]'' (1973), and had a support role as a wealthy rancher whose wife was trying to leave him in the western, ''[[The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing (film)|The Man Who Loved Cat Dancing]]'', starring [[Burt Reynolds]] (1973).\n\nHe produced and appeared in ''[[Medusa (1973 film)|Medusa]]'' (1973). He starred in the TV movie ''[[The Dead Don't Die (1975 film)|The Dead Don't Die]]'' (1975) and had a support role in ''[[Once Is Not Enough]]'' (1975). On a 1975 episode of ''[[Columbo (TV series)|Columbo]]'', Hamilton played a psychiatrist who uses hypnosis to commit a murder, whose arrogant assertions in his own defence establish that he was in fact at the scene of the crime. \n\nHamilton guest starred on episodes of ''[[Police Story (1973 TV series)|Police Story]]'', ''[[McCloud (TV series)|McCloud]]'', ''[[Roots (1977 miniseries)|Roots]]'', ''[[The Eddie Capra Mysteries]]'', ''[[Gibbsville (TV series)|Gibbsville]]'', ''[[Supertrain]]'', and ''[[Sword of Justice]]''.\n\nHe had support roles in ''[[The Strange Possession of Mrs. Oliver]]'' (1977), ''[[The Happy Hooker Goes to Washington]]'' (1977), ''[[Killer on Board]]'' (1977), ''[[Sextette (film)|Sextette]]'' (1978), ''[[The Users (1978 film)|The Users]]'' (1978), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979), ''[[Institute for Revenge]]'' (1979), ''[[From Hell to Victory]]'' (1979) and ''[[Death Car on the Freeway]]'' (1979).\n\n===''Love at First Bite''===\nA surprise blockbuster hit came his way in 1979 when Hamilton showed a flair for comedy in ''[[Love at First Bite]]'' which was the story of [[Count Dracula]]'s pursuit of a young Manhattanite model, played by [[Susan Saint James]]. The movie included such scenes as Dracula and his conquest dancing to \"[[I Love the Nightlife]]\" at a disco. The film's box-office success created a popularity surge for Hamilton, who also served as executive producer.\n\nHe returned to TV for ''[[The Seekers (miniseries)|The Seekers]]'' (1979) and ''[[The Great Cash Giveaway Getaway]]'' (1979) then he did a ''Love at First Bite'' style comedy, 1981's ''[[Zorro, the Gay Blade]]'', which he produced.\n\nHowever, ''Zorro'' was not as popular as ''Love at First Bite'' and film leads dried up quickly. He focused on television: ''[[Malibu (TV movie)|Malibu]]'' (1983) and ''[[Two Fathers' Justice]]'' (1985).\n\nIn the mid-1980s, Hamilton starred in the sixth season of the ABC [[Aaron Spelling]]-produced nighttime television serial ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''.\n\nHe supported [[Joan Collins]] in the mini series ''[[Monte Carlo (miniseries)|Monte Carlo]]'' (1986) and had the lead in a short lived series ''[[Spies (TV series)|Spies]]'' (1987).  He supported [[Elizabeth Taylor]] in ''[[Poker Alice]]'' (1987).\n\n===1990s===\nA break for Hamilton came in 1990 when [[Francis Ford Coppola]] cast him as the Corleone family's lawyer in a much-anticipated film, ''[[The Godfather Part III]]''.\n\nFor the second time, he portrayed a murderer on the television series ''[[Columbo]]'', starring as the host of a TV true-crime show in the 1991 episode \"[[List of Columbo episodes|Caution: Murder Can Be Hazardous to Your Health]].\" He had previously been in the 1975 episode \"A Deadly State of Mind\".\n\nHamilton had small roles in ''[[Doc Hollywood]]'' (1992), ''[[Once Upon a Crime...]]'' (1992) and ''[[Amore! (film)|Amore]]'' (1993) and guest starred on ''[[Diagnosis Murder]]'' and ''[[Dream On (TV series)|Dream On]]''. He went to Germany to make ''[[Das Paradies am Ende der Berge]]'' (1993) and did ''[[Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent]]'' (1994), ''[[Vanished]]'' (1995), and ''[[Playback (film)|Playback]]'' (1996), as well as guest starring on shows like ''Bonnie'', ''Diagnosis Murder'', ''Hart to Hart'' and ''The Guilt''.\n\nHe was in ''[[Meet Wally Sparks]]'' (1997), ''[[8 Heads in a Duffel Bag]]'' (1997), and ''[[Rough Riders (miniseries)|Rough Riders]]'' (1997). With his matinee-idol looks it was sometimes noted that Hamilton physically resembled [[Warren Beatty]]. Beatty's political satire ''[[Bulworth]]'' (1998) contained a running gag about this with Hamilton appearing as himself in a brief cameo. Hamilton had a regular role on the short lived TV series ''[[Jenny (TV series)|Jenny]]'' (1997).\n\nHe was in ''[[Casper Meets Wendy]]'' (1998), ''[[P.T. Barnum (film)|P.T. Barnum]]'' (1999) and ''[[She's Too Tall]]'' (1999). He was a semi-regular celebrity guest on the 1998-99 syndicated version of ''[[Match Game]]''\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2003, Hamilton hosted ''[[The Family (U.S. TV series)|The Family]]'' which was a reality television series on ABC for one season. The program starred ten members from a traditional Italian-American family, each fighting for a $1,000,000 prize. In 2006, Hamilton competed in the second season of ABC's ''Dancing with the Stars''<ref>[http://abc.go.com/primetime/dancing/ Dancing With The Stars]&nbsp;\u2013 ABC.com</ref> with professional [[Edyta Sliwinska]] in which they lasted until the sixth round. At age 66 and recovering from knee injuries, Hamilton, unable to match the limber dance moves of his younger competitors, charmed the audience and judges with endearingly silly dances utilizing props including a [[Zorro]] mask and the sword from ''Zorro, The Gay Blade''.\n\nIn 2006, it was rumored that Hamilton would replace [[Bob Barker]] on ''[[The Price Is Right (U.S. game show)|The Price Is Right]]''. He auditioned for the show and in March 2007, [[TMZ.com|TMZ]] reported that Hamilton was a frontrunner to replace Barker. According to [[Reuters]], Hamilton was one of the final three contenders to host the show, alongside [[Mark Steines]] and [[Todd Newton]].<ref>[https://www.reuters.com/article/televisionNews/idUSN1624240720070416 Trio remaining in Price line] from Reuters</ref> Soon thereafter, however, [[Drew Carey]] was named as Barker's successor. Subsequently, Hamilton has hosted the live stage adaptation of the show, ''[[The Price Is Right Live!]]''. In August 2008, Hamilton co-starred in ''Coma'', a web series on [[Crackle (company)|Crackle]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Michael Madsen, George Hamilton and Paul Ben-Victor Star in Coma, an Original Web Series Premiering On Crackle.com|url=http://www.webwire.com/ViewPressRel.asp?aId=73148|publisher=webwire.com|date=August 22, 2008|accessdate=March 5, 2009}}</ref> Hamilton was executive producer of the 2009 film ''[[My One and Only (film)|My One and Only]]'', which is loosely based on his early life and relationship with his mother.\n\nHamilton was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk Of Fame on August 12, 2009&nbsp;\u2013 his 70th birthday.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |title=Content Marketing Platform - B2B and B2C Content Marketing Technology - NewsCred |publisher=Daylife.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304070010/http://www.daylife.com/photo/0bMv0nZ2Ce94v |archivedate=March 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> In 1999, a Golden Palm Star on the [[Palm Springs, California]], [[Palm Springs Walk of Stars|Walk of Stars]] was dedicated to him.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180508121758/http://www.palmspringswalkofstars.com/web-storage/Stars/Stars+dedicated+by+date.pdf|title=Wayback Machine|date=May 8, 2018|website=web.archive.org}}</ref> Hamilton appeared as a contestant on the UK edition of ''[[I'm a Celebrity\u2026Get Me out of Here!
