It was one of many [[German-Americans in the Civil War|all-German regiments]] in the army, most notably in the [[XI Corps (ACW)|XI Corps]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. Its combat record was marred by the perceived poor performance of the entire corps at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], when parts of the corps routed during [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attacks.\n\n==Organization==\nThe volunteer regiment was recruited during August and September 1861, primarily of recent German immigrants and descendants of Germans.  It was officially mustered into service in mid-September as the '''35th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment''' at Camp Wilkens, near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. On September 22, the 35th was posted to [[Washington, D.C.]]  However, due to internal intrigue arising while its first [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], [[Alexander Schimmelfennig]], was ill, it was to lose that designation, and its men were in a state of limbo until Pittsburgh and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] interests convinced the [[U.S. War Department]] to reinstate the colonel.  The regiment was then redesignated as the 74th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but its men and its communities knew it as \"The German Regiment\" or the \"1st German Regiment.\"\n\nThe companies were from the following counties:<br>\nCompany A [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia]] and [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming]] Counties<br>\nCompany B [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]<br>\nCompany C [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland]] County<br>\nCompany D [[Snyder County, Pennsylvania|Snyder]] and [[Union County, Pennsylvania|Union]] Counties<br>\nCompany E Northumberland County<br>\nCompany F [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] Counties<br>\nCompany G [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams]] and [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]] Counties<br>\nCompany H Unknown<br>\nCompany I Pittsburgh<br>\nCompany K [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]] and [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] Counties\n\n==Early service - 1862==\nThe 74th Infantry received its colors on March 5, 1862, while encamped near the nation's capital.  [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Robert McKnight]] made the presentation.  The regiment was part of the \"mud march\" in [[Virginia]]'s [[Shenandoah Valley]] in the spring of 1862 in the effort to confront General [[Stonewall Jackson]].<ref>Bates, p. 893.</ref>\n\nIts first significant battle was at [[Battle of Cross Keys|Cross Keys]]. The 74th was on the far left of the Union line, where it was engaged in a heated battle in the latter part of the day.  Six men were killed and another thirteen were wounded.  Its second battle was at [[Battle of Rappahannock Station I|Freeman's Ford]], when Schimmelfennig advanced the regiment into the rear column of the Confederate forces.  The enemy turned its full force on the regiment forced the 74th to retreat. 12 men were killed, 37 were wounded, and 3 drowned trying to cross the river and get back within Union lines. An additional 16 men were missing. It was here that [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Henry Bohlen]] was killed.  Colonel Schimmelfennig was eventually promoted to take his place.\n\nIn the following days, the regiment participated in the battles of Sulphur Springs and  Waterloo Bridge before joining the [[Army of the Potomac]] for the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. It participated in heated fighting at [[Second Battle of Manassas|Second Bull Run]]. When the regiment returned to the Washington D.C. area, its command changed. [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] Adolph von Hartung was promoted to colonel and commander of the regiment, which was stationed near [[Stafford, Virginia|Stafford Court House]]. There, some of its men who took ill were treated at the XI Corps Reserve Hospital in [[Fairfax, Virginia]]. (Today this historic building, complete with Union soldier graffiti on the walls, is known as Blenheim House.  Four members of the 74th wrote on the walls of this house.)<ref>*[http://www.olypen.com/tinkers/74th%20Pennsylvania/Webpage/default.htm 74th PA Volunteers]</ref>\n[[File:74th PA Infantry Tablet.JPG|thumb|74th PA Infantry tablet at Gettysburg, PA]]\n\n==1863 service==\nDuring the early stages of the Battle of Chancellorsville in May, the 74th was among the XI Corps troops that were surprised in camp by the furious flank attack of Jackson's Corps.

It was one of many [[German-Americans in the Civil War|all-German regiments]] in the army, most notably in the [[XI Corps (ACW)|XI Corps]] of the [[Army of the Potomac]]. Its combat record was marred by the perceived poor performance of the entire corps at [[Battle of Chancellorsville|Chancellorsville]] and [[Battle of Gettysburg|Gettysburg]], when parts of the corps routed during [[Confederate States Army|Confederate]] attacks.\n\n==Organization==\nThe volunteer regiment was recruited during August and September 1861, primarily of recent German immigrants and descendants of Germans.  It was officially mustered into service in mid-September as the '''35th Pennsylvania Infantry Regiment''' at Camp Wilkens, near [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]. On September 22, the 35th was posted to [[Washington, D.C.]]  However, due to internal intrigue arising while its first [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]], [[Alexander Schimmelfennig]], was ill, it was to lose that designation, and its men were in a state of limbo until Pittsburgh and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] interests convinced the [[U.S. War Department]] to reinstate the colonel.  The regiment was then redesignated as the 74th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry Regiment, but its men and its communities knew it as \"The German Regiment\" or the \"1st German Regiment.\"\n\nThe companies were from the following counties:<br>\nCompany A [[Columbia County, Pennsylvania|Columbia]] and [[Wyoming County, Pennsylvania|Wyoming]] Counties<br>\nCompany B [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]]<br>\nCompany C [[Northumberland County, Pennsylvania|Northumberland]] County<br>\nCompany D [[Snyder County, Pennsylvania|Snyder]] and [[Union County, Pennsylvania|Union]] Counties<br>\nCompany E Northumberland County<br>\nCompany F [[Indiana County, Pennsylvania|Indiana]] and [[Westmoreland County, Pennsylvania|Westmoreland]] Counties<br>\nCompany G [[Adams County, Pennsylvania|Adams]] and [[Berks County, Pennsylvania|Berks]] Counties<br>\nCompany H Unknown<br>\nCompany I Pittsburgh<br>\nCompany K [[Allegheny County, Pennsylvania|Allegheny]] and [[Philadelphia County, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] Counties\n\n==Early service - 1862==\nThe 74th Infantry received its colors on March 5, 1862, while encamped near the nation's capital.  [[U.S. House of Representatives|Representative]] [[Robert McKnight]] made the presentation.  The regiment was part of the \"mud march\" in [[Virginia]]'s [[Shenandoah Valley]] in the spring of 1862 in the effort to confront General [[Stonewall Jackson]].<ref>Bates, p. 893.</ref>\n\nIts first significant battle was at [[Battle of Cross Keys|Cross Keys]]. The 74th was on the far left of the Union line, where it was engaged in a heated battle in the latter part of the day.  Six men were killed and another thirteen were wounded.  Its second battle was at [[Battle of Rappahannock Station I|Freeman's Ford]], when Schimmelfennig advanced the regiment into the rear column of the Confederate forces.  The enemy turned its full force on the regiment forced the 74th to retreat. 12 men were killed, 37 were wounded, and 3 drowned trying to cross the river and get back within Union lines. An additional 16 men were missing. It was here that [[Brigadier General|Brig. Gen.]] [[Henry Bohlen]] was killed.  Colonel Schimmelfennig was eventually promoted to take his place.\n\nIn the following days, the regiment was participated in the battles of Sulphur Springs and  Waterloo Bridge before joining the [[Army of the Potomac]] for the [[Northern Virginia Campaign]]. It participated in heated fighting at [[Second Battle of Manassas|Second Bull Run]]. When the regiment returned to the Washington D.C. area, its command changed. [[Major (United States)|Maj.]] Adolph von Hartung was promoted to colonel and commander of the regiment, which was stationed near [[Stafford, Virginia|Stafford Court House]]. There, some of its men who took ill were treated at the XI Corps Reserve Hospital in [[Fairfax, Virginia]].
