This instrument was traded and traveled to different parts of the [[Middle East]]. Each country customized and designed its own versions to adapt to their musical scales and tunings. The santur was originated in the country that is known today as Iran. The original santur was made with tree bark and stones, and strung with goat intestines. The Mesopotamian santur has been claimed to be the father of the harp, the Chinese yangqin, the harpsichord, the qanun, the cimbalom, and the American and European hammered dulcimers.<ref name=Touma>{{cite book|last1=Touma|first1=Habib Hasan|title=The Music of the Arabs|date=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=0-931340-88-8}}</ref>\n\n\n\n\nHei (:\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'santur' has several possible derivations.

A typical Persian santur has two sets of nine bridges, providing a range of approximately three  [[octave]]s.  The right-hand strings are made of brass or copper,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bass strings made of Brass or Copper|url=http://artmax.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=67&Itemid=119|work=Art Max Academy}}</ref> while the left-hand strings are made of steel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Different kinds of Steel exist|url=http://artmax.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=67&Itemid=119|work=Art Max Academy}}</ref>\nA total of 18 bridges divide the santur into three positions.  Over each bridge cross four strings tuned in unison, spanning horizontally across the right and left side of the instrument. There are three sections of nine pitches: each for the bass, middle and higher octave called behind the left bridges comprising 27 notes altogether. The top \"F\" note is repeated twice, creating a total of 25 separate tones in the santur. The Persian santur is primarily tuned to a variety of different diatonic scales utilizing 1/4 tones which are designated into 12 modes (''[[dastgah|dastgahs]]'') of [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical music]]. These 12 Dastgahs are the repertory of Persian classical music known as the ''[[Radif (music)|Radif]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farhat |first=Hormoz |date=1990 |title=The Dastgah Concept in Persian Music |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=052130542X }}</ref> They also had 16 inch botos.\n\n==Derivations==\nSimilar musical instruments have been present since medieval times all over the world, including  Armenia, China, Greece, India, etc. The Indian [[santoor]] is wider, more rectangular and has more strings. Its corresponding mallets are also held differently and played with a different technique. The eastern European version of the santur called the ''[[cimbalom]]'', which is much larger and chromatic, is used to accompany Hungarian folk music, Eastern European Jewish music, and Slavic music, as well as [[Romani music]].<ref name=\"Kenrick2010\">{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=Donald |title=The A to Z of the Gypsies (Romanies)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcAm-VTW_CQC&pg=PA43|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-7561-6|page=43}}</ref>\n\n==Iraqi santur==\n{{Infobox instrument\n| name                  =\n| names                 =\n| image                 = Santur babylon2.jpg\n| image_capt            = The archetype of the instrument carried horizontally and struck with two sticks, found in iconographical documents in ancient Babylon (1600-911 BCE) and neo-Assyria (911-612 BCE). \n| background            = string\n| classification        = Struck\n| hornbostel_sachs      =\n| hornbostel_sachs_desc =\n| inventors             =\n| developed             =\n| range                 =\n| related               = [[Qanun (instrument)|Qanun]]\n| musicians             =\n| builders              =\n| articles              =\n}}\n\n[[File:Iraqi Santur.tiff|thumb|Typical Iraqi santur]]\n[[File:Iraqi Santur Player.jpg|thumb|Chalghi santur player playing on a non-standard Iraqi santur]]\nThe '''Iraqi santur'''  (also santour, santoor ) ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0646\u0637\u0648\u0631}}) is a hammered dulcimer of Mesopotamian origin.<ref>--- Rashid, Subhi Anwar (1989).

The strings, tuned to the same pitch in groups of four, are struck with two wooden mallets called \"midhrab\". The tuning of these 23 sets of strings extends from the lower ''yakah'' (G) up to ''jawab jawab husayni'' (a). The bridges are called ''dama'' (chessmen in Iraqi Arabic) because they look like pawns. It is native to Iraq, syria, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Greece (the Aegean coasts) and Azerbaijan.\n\nIt is the main instrument used in the classical [[Maqam al-iraqi]] tradition along with the Iraqi spike fiddle [[Rebab|joza]]. ('Music of the Arabs' {{ISBN|0-931340-88-8}}).\nThe instrument was brought to Europe by the Arabs through North Africa and Spain during the Middle Ages and also to China where it was referred to as the \"foreign ''qin''\".<ref name=Touma/>\n\nThe Iraqi santur has, since its inception, been fully chromatic allowing for full maqam modulations. It uses 12 bridges of steel strings on both sides. Three of these bridges are movable: B half flat qaraar, E half flat, and B half flat jawaab. The non-standard version of the Iraqi santur includes extra bridges so that there's no need to move those three bridges. However, playing it is a bit harder than playing the standard 12-bridge santur.<ref name=Touma/> For a video demonstration, see Wesam al-Azzawy's video links in the sections below.\n\n==Notable santur

This instrument was traded and traveled to different parts of the [[Middle East]]. Each country customized and designed its own versions to adapt to their musical scales and tunings. The santur was originated in the country that is known today as Iran. The original santur was made with tree bark and stones, and strung with goat intestines. The Mesopotamian santur has been claimed to be the father of the harp, the Chinese yangqin, the harpsichord, the qanun, the cimbalom, and the American and European hammered dulcimers.<ref name=Touma>{{cite book|last1=Touma|first1=Habib Hasan|title=The Music of the Arabs|date=1996|publisher=Amadeus Press|location=Portland, Oregon|isbn=0-931340-88-8}}</ref>\n\n==Name==\nThe name 'santur' has several possible derivations.

A typical Persian santur has two sets of nine bridges, providing a range of approximately three  [[octave]]s.  The right-hand strings are made of brass or copper,<ref>{{cite web|title=Bass strings made of Brass or Copper|url=http://artmax.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=67&Itemid=119|work=Art Max Academy}}</ref> while the left-hand strings are made of steel.<ref>{{cite web|title=Different kinds of Steel exist|url=http://artmax.org/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=67&Itemid=119|work=Art Max Academy}}</ref>\nA total of 18 bridges divide the santur into three positions.  Over each bridge cross four strings tuned in unison, spanning horizontally across the right and left side of the instrument. There are three sections of nine pitches: each for the bass, middle and higher octave called behind the left bridges comprising 27 notes altogether. The top \"F\" note is repeated twice, creating a total of 25 separate tones in the santur. The Persian santur is primarily tuned to a variety of different diatonic scales utilizing 1/4 tones which are designated into 12 modes (''[[dastgah|dastgahs]]'') of [[Persian traditional music|Persian classical music]]. These 12 Dastgahs are the repertory of Persian classical music known as the ''[[Radif (music)|Radif]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Farhat |first=Hormoz |date=1990 |title=The Dastgah Concept in Persian Music |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=052130542X }}</ref> They also had 16 inch botos.\n\n==Derivations==\nSimilar musical instruments have been present since medieval times all over the world, including  Armenia, China, Greece, India, etc. The Indian [[santoor]] is wider, more rectangular and has more strings. Its corresponding mallets are also held differently and played with a different technique. The eastern European version of the santur called the ''[[cimbalom]]'', which is much larger and chromatic, is used to accompany Hungarian folk music, Eastern European Jewish music, and Slavic music, as well as [[Romani music]].<ref name=\"Kenrick2010\">{{cite book|last=Kenrick|first=Donald |title=The A to Z of the Gypsies (Romanies)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pcAm-VTW_CQC&pg=PA43|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press, Inc|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-8108-7561-6|page=43}}</ref>\n\n==Iraqi santur==\n{{Infobox instrument\n| name                  =\n| names                 =\n| image                 = Santur babylon2.jpg\n| image_capt            = The archetype of the instrument carried horizontally and struck with two sticks, found in iconographical documents in ancient Babylon (1600-911 BCE) and neo-Assyria (911-612 BCE). \n| background            = string\n| classification        = Struck\n| hornbostel_sachs      =\n| hornbostel_sachs_desc =\n| inventors             =\n| developed             =\n| range                 =\n| related               = [[Qanun (instrument)|Qanun]]\n| musicians             =\n| builders              =\n| articles              =\n}}\n\n[[File:Iraqi Santur.tiff|thumb|Typical Iraqi santur]]\n[[File:Iraqi Santur Player.jpg|thumb|Chalghi santur player playing on a non-standard Iraqi santur]]\nThe '''Iraqi santur'''  (also santour, santoor ) ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0646\u0637\u0648\u0631}}) is a hammered dulcimer of Mesopotamian origin.<ref>--- Rashid, Subhi Anwar (1989).

The strings, tuned to the same pitch in groups of four, are struck with two wooden mallets called \"midhrab\". The tuning of these 23 sets of strings extends from the lower ''yakah'' (G) up to ''jawab jawab husayni'' (a). The bridges are called ''dama'' (chessmen in Iraqi Arabic) because they look like pawns. It is native to Iraq, syria, India, Pakistan, Turkey, Iran, Greece (the Aegean coasts) and Azerbaijan.\n\nIt is the main instrument used in the classical [[Maqam al-iraqi]] tradition along with the Iraqi spike fiddle [[Rebab|joza]]. ('Music of the Arabs' {{ISBN|0-931340-88-8}}).\nThe instrument was brought to Europe by the Arabs through North Africa and Spain during the Middle Ages and also to China where it was referred to as the \"foreign ''qin''\".<ref name=Touma/>\n\nThe Iraqi santur has, since its inception, been fully chromatic allowing for full maqam modulations. It uses 12 bridges of steel strings on both sides. Three of these bridges are movable: B half flat qaraar, E half flat, and B half flat jawaab. The non-standard version of the Iraqi santur includes extra bridges so that there's no need to move those three bridges. However, playing it is a bit harder than playing the standard 12-bridge santur.<ref name=Touma/> For a video demonstration, see Wesam al-Azzawy's video links in the sections below.\n\n==Notable santur

There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball.

For example, ''calcio'' players could punch, shoulder charge, and kick opponents. Blows below the belt were allowed. The game is said to have originated as a military training exercise. In 1580, Count Giovanni de' Bardi di Vernio wrote ''Discorso sopra 'l giuoco del Calcio Fiorentino''. This is sometimes said to be the earliest code of rules for any football game. The game was not played after January 1739 (until it was revived in May 1930).\n\n=== Official disapproval and attempts to ban football ===\n{{Main|Attempts to ban football games}}\nThere have been many attempts to ban football, from the [[middle ages]] through to the modern day.

Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.\n\n== Establishment of modern codes ==\n\n=== English public schools ===\n{{Main|English public school football games}}\nWhile football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \"mob\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \"kicking\" and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games first became clear.\n\nThe earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools \u2013 mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes \u2013 comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach.

Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\". Mulcaster's \"footeball\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:\n\n{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>\nFrancis Peabody Magoun.

Wedderburn refers to what has been translated into modern English as \"keeping goal\" and makes an allusion to passing the ball (\"strike it here\"). There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball\", suggesting that some handling was allowed.

He also mentions tactics (\"leaving some of their best players to guard the goal\"); scoring (\"they that can strike the ball through their opponents' goal first win\") and the way teams were selected (\"the players being equally divided according to their strength and nimbleness\").

In particular, they devised the first ''[[offside (sport)|offside]]'' rules, during the late 18th century.<ref name=Carosi>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf |title=Julian Carosi, 2006, \"The History of Offside\" |access-date=5 January 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150502105003/http://www.kenaston.org/download/KenAstonRefereeSociety/offside_history-JulianCarosi.pdf |archive-date=2 May 2015 |url-status=live }}</ref> In the earliest manifestations of these rules, players were \"off their side\" if they simply stood between the ball and the goal which was their objective. Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes \u2013 in the sense of a set of rules \u2013 were those of Eton in 1815<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |access-date=23 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325125959/https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\"/>)\n\nDuring the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.\n\nFootball was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|Although the [[Rugby School]] (pictured) became famous due to a version that [[rugby football]] was invented there in 1823, most sports historians refuse this version stating it is apocryphal]]\n[[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \"with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of [[Rugby football]], but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding \"Foot-Ball\", as played at [[Scone, Scotland]], Scotland:\n:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it.

Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host \"home\" school, and the other half by the visiting \"away\" school.\n\nThe ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\nApart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).\n\n[[File:The Football Game. Thomas Webster, 1839, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Football Game'' (1839) by British painter [[Thomas Webster (painter)|Thomas Webster]]]]\nPublic schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.\n\nThe earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:\n[[File:Foot Ball, Kingston-upon-Thames, Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 24th, 1846.jpg|thumb|230px|Football match in the 1846 [[Shrove Tuesday]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[England]]]]\n* 9 December 1834: Eton School v.

The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.\n\nThe code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41\u201343 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.

The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].\n\nIn July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.\n\n[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]\nWills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118\u2013119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].\n\nThe Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.\n\n=== Football Association ===\n{{Main|The Football Association}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 4\n| total_width = 600\n | image1 = 1872_engl_v_scotland_ralston.jpg\n | width1 =  \n | alt1 =  \n | image2 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-2.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | width2 =  \n | image3 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-3.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | width3 =  \n | image4 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-4.jpg\n | width4 =  \n | footer = The first [[Association football|football]] international, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] versus [[England national football team|England]]. Once kept by the [[Rugby Football Union]] as an early example of [[rugby football]].\n}}\n\nDuring the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called \"The Simplest Game\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.\n\nAt the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:\n\n{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->\nX. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell.

Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \"hacking is the true football\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \"[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term \"soccer\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford \"-er\"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of \"Association\".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.\n\n=== Rugby football ===\n{{Main|History of rugby union}}\n[[File:Last scrimmage buckman.jpg|thumb|''The Last Scrimmage'' by Edwin Buckman, depicting a rugby scrum in 1871]]\nIn [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Rugby Football History|website=rugbyfootballhistory.com|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> There were also \"rugby\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU).

One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \"cross-country game\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\n\nBy the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\" which allowed tripping.\n\nThere was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usgaa.org/gaelic-football/|title=Gaelic Football|website=USGAA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\n\n=== Schism in Rugby football ===\n[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:\n\nMarshall: \"Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can\u2019t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!\"\n\nMiller: \"Yes, that's just you to a T; you\u2019d make it so that no lad whose father wasn\u2019t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn\u2019t have a share in the spending of it.\"]]\n{{Further|History of rugby league}}\nThe [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world.rugby/news/204311?lang=en|title=IRFB Formed|last=worldrugby.org|website=world.rugby|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref>, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.\n\nIn England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.\n\nThe demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \"spectator\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the \"play-the-ball ruck\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.\n\nOver time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].\n\n=== Globalisation of association football ===\n{{Main|History of FIFA}}\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Its first president was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.\n\n=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===\nRugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].\n\nWith the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.\n\nThe laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.\n\nIn 1995, rugby union became an \"open\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared \u2013 and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification \u2013 the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\n== Use of the word \"football\" ==\n{{details|Football (word)}}\nThe word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word \"football\" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word \"football\" means usually depends on where one says it.\n[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word \"football\" to encompass both association football and rugby]]\nIn each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as \"football\", while the others generally require a qualifier. In New Zealand, \"football\" historically referred to [[rugby union]], but more recently may be used unqualified to refer to association football. The sport meant by the word \"football\" in Australia is either [[Australian rules football]] or [[rugby league]], depending on local popularity (which largely conforms to the [[Barassi Line]]). In [[francophone]] [[Quebec]], where [[Canadian football]] is more popular, the Canadian code is known as {{lang|fr|le football}} while American football is known as {{lang|fr|le football am\u00e9ricain}} and association football is known as {{lang|fr|le soccer}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.federation-soccer.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149&Itemid=34 |title=The governing body is the \"F\u00e9d\u00e9ration de soccer du Qu\u00e9bec\" |publisher=Federation-soccer.qc.ca |accessdate=16 April 2012 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120304192131/http://www.federation-soccer.qc.ca/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=149&Itemid=34 |archivedate=4 March 2012 }}</ref> \n\nOf the 45 national [[FIFA]] (F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association) affiliates in which English is an official or primary language, most currently use ''Football'' in their organisations' official names; the FIFA affiliates in [[Canadian Soccer Association|Canada]] and the [[United States Soccer Federation|United States]] use ''Soccer'' in their names.

There is evidence for schoolboys playing a \"football\" ball game in Aberdeen in 1633 (some references cite 1636) which is notable as an early allusion to what some have considered to be passing the ball. The word \"pass\" in the most recent translation is derived from \"huc percute\" (strike it here) and later \"repercute pilam\" (strike the ball again) in the original Latin. It is not certain that the ball was being struck between members of the same team. The original word translated as \"goal\" is \"metum\", literally meaning the \"pillar at each end of the circus course\" in a Roman chariot race. There is a reference to \"get hold of the ball before [another player] does\" (Praeripe illi pilam si possis agere) suggesting that handling of the ball was allowed. One sentence states in the original 1930 translation \"Throw yourself against him\" (Age, objice te illi).\n\nKing [[Henry IV of England]] also presented one of the earliest documented uses of the English word \"football\", in 1409, when he issued a proclamation forbidding the levying of money for \"foteball\".<ref name=Magoun/><ref name=Etymology>{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |title=Online Etymology Dictionary (no date), \"football\" |publisher=Etymonline.com |accessdate=19 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628050902/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=football |archive-date=28 June 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nThere is also an account in [[Latin]] from the end of the 15th century of football being played at [[Caunton|Caunton, Nottinghamshire]].

Female footballers still face similar problems in some parts of the world.\n\n== Establishment of modern codes ==\n\n=== English public schools ===\n{{Main|English public school football games}}\nWhile football continued to be played in various forms throughout Britain, its [[public school (England)|public schools]] (equivalent to private schools in other countries) are widely credited with four key achievements in the creation of modern football codes. First of all, the evidence suggests that they were important in taking football away from its \"mob\" form and turning it into an organised team sport. Second, many early descriptions of football and references to it were recorded by people who had studied at these schools. Third, it was teachers, students and former students from these schools who first codified football games, to enable matches to be played between schools. Finally, it was at English public schools that the division between \"kicking\" and \"running\" (or \"carrying\") games first became clear.\n\nThe earliest evidence that games resembling football were being played at English public schools \u2013 mainly attended by boys from the upper, upper-middle and professional classes \u2013 comes from the ''Vulgaria'' by William Herman in 1519. Herman had been headmaster at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Winchester College|Winchester]] colleges and his [[Latin]] textbook includes a translation exercise with the phrase \"We wyll playe with a ball full of wynde\".<ref>A history of Winchester College. by Arthur F Leach.

Mulcaster's writings refer to teams (\"sides\" and \"parties\"), positions (\"standings\"), a referee (\"judge over the parties\") and a coach \"(trayning maister)\". Mulcaster's \"footeball\" had evolved from the disordered and violent forms of traditional football:\n\n{{quote|[s]ome smaller number with such overlooking, sorted into sides and standings, not meeting with their bodies so boisterously to trie their strength: nor shouldring or shuffing one an other so barbarously ... may use footeball for as much good to the body, by the chiefe use of the legges.<ref>\nFrancis Peabody Magoun.

Players were not allowed to pass the ball forward, either by foot or by hand. They could only dribble with their feet, or advance the ball in a ''[[Scrum (rugby)|scrum]]'' or similar ''formation''. However, offside laws began to diverge and develop differently at each school, as is shown by the rules of football from Winchester, [[Rugby School|Rugby]], [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Cheltenham School|Cheltenham]], during between 1810 and 1850.<ref name=Carosi/> The first known codes \u2013 in the sense of a set of rules \u2013 were those of Eton in 1815<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\">{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of British Football |first=Richard William |last=Cox |first2=Dave |last2=Russell |first3=Wray |last3=Vamplew |publisher=Routledge |year=2002 |isbn=978-0-7146-5249-8 |page=243 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |access-date=23 July 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160325125959/https://books.google.com/books?id=JKbb02bg6zYC |archive-date=25 March 2016 |url-status=live }}</ref> and [[Aldenham]] in 1825.<ref name=\"Richard William Cox 2002 243\"/>)\n\nDuring the early 19th century, most working class people in Britain had to work six days a week, often for over twelve hours a day. They had neither the time nor the inclination to engage in sport for recreation and, at the time, many [[Child labour#Industrial Revolution|children were part of the labour force]]. [[Feast day]] football played on the streets was in decline. Public school boys, who enjoyed some freedom from work, became the inventors of organised football games with formal codes of rules.\n\nFootball was adopted by a number of public schools as a way of encouraging competitiveness and keeping youths fit. Each school drafted its own rules, which varied widely between different schools and were changed over time with each new intake of pupils. Two schools of thought developed regarding rules. Some schools favoured a game in which the ball could be carried (as at Rugby, [[Marlborough College|Marlborough]] and Cheltenham), while others preferred a game where kicking and dribbling the ball was promoted (as at Eton, Harrow, [[Westminster School|Westminster]] and [[Charterhouse School|Charterhouse]]). The division into these two camps was partly the result of circumstances in which the games were played. For example, Charterhouse and Westminster at the time had restricted playing areas; the boys were confined to playing their ball game within the school [[cloisters]], making it difficult for them to adopt rough and tumble running games.{{Citation needed|date=June 2009|reason=For the whole paragraph}}\n\n[[File:Rugby School 850.jpg|thumb|Although the [[Rugby School]] (pictured) became famous due to a version that [[rugby football]] was invented there in 1823, most sports historians refuse this version stating it is apocryphal]]\n[[William Webb Ellis]], a pupil at Rugby School, is said to have \"with a fine disregard for the rules of football, ''as played in his time'' [emphasis added], first took the ball in his arms and ran with it, thus creating the distinctive feature of the rugby game.\" in 1823. This act is usually said to be the beginning of [[Rugby football]], but there is little evidence that it occurred, and most sports historians believe the story to be apocryphal. The act of 'taking the ball in his arms' is often misinterpreted as 'picking the ball up' as it is widely believed that Webb Ellis' 'crime' was handling the ball, as in modern association football, however handling the ball at the time was often permitted and in some cases compulsory,<ref>example of ball handling in early football from English writer [[William Hone]], writing in 1825 or 1826, quotes the social commentator Sir [[Frederick Morton Eden]], regarding \"Foot-Ball\", as played at [[Scone, Scotland]], Scotland:\n:''The game was this: he who at any time got the ball into his hands, run [sic] with it till overtaken by one of the opposite part; and then, if he could shake himself loose from those on the opposite side who seized him, he run on; if not, he threw the ball from him, unless it was wrested from him by the other party'', but no person was allowed to kick it.

Inter-school sporting competitions became possible. However, it was difficult for schools to play each other at football, as each school played by its own rules. The solution to this problem was usually that the match be divided into two halves, one half played by the rules of the host \"home\" school, and the other half by the visiting \"away\" school.\n\nThe ''modern'' rules of many football codes were formulated during the mid- or late- 19th century. This also applies to other sports such as lawn bowls, lawn tennis, etc. The major impetus for this was the patenting of the world's first [[lawnmower]] in 1830. This allowed for the preparation of modern ovals, playing fields, pitches, grass courts, etc.<ref>ABC Radio National ''Ockham's Razor'', first broadcast 6 June 2010.</ref>\n\nApart from Rugby football, the public school codes have barely been played beyond the confines of each school's playing fields. However, many of them are still played at the schools which created them (see [[Football#Surviving UK school games|Surviving UK school games]] below).\n\n[[File:The Football Game. Thomas Webster, 1839, 1.jpg|thumb|300px|''A Football Game'' (1839) by British painter [[Thomas Webster (painter)|Thomas Webster]]]]\nPublic schools' dominance of sports in the UK began to wane after the [[Factory Act 1850|''Factory Act'' of 1850]], which significantly increased the recreation time available to working class children. Before 1850, many British children had to work six days a week, for more than twelve hours a day. From 1850, they could not work before 6&nbsp;a.m. (7&nbsp;a.m. in winter) or after 6&nbsp;p.m. on weekdays (7&nbsp;p.m. in winter); on Saturdays they had to cease work at 2&nbsp;p.m. These changes meant that working class children had more time for games, including various forms of football.\n\nThe earliest known matches between public schools are as follows:\n[[File:Foot Ball, Kingston-upon-Thames, Shrove Tuesday, Feb. 24th, 1846.jpg|thumb|230px|Football match in the 1846 [[Shrove Tuesday]] in [[Kingston upon Thames]], [[England]]]]\n* 9 December 1834: Eton School v.

The code was largely independent of the public school rules, the most significant difference being the lack of an ''offside'' rule.\n\nThe code was responsible for many innovations that later spread to association football. These included [[wikt:free kick|free kick]]s, [[corner kick]]s, handball, [[throw-in]]s and the crossbar.<ref>{{cite book |first=Brendan |last=Murphy |title=From Sheffield with Love |year=2007 |pages=41\u201343 |publisher=Sports Book Limited |isbn=978-1-899807-56-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D9PVkQEACAAJ }}</ref> By the 1870s they became the dominant code in the north and midlands of England.

The origins of an organised game of football known today as Australian rules football can be traced back to 1858 in [[Melbourne]], the capital city of [[Victoria (state)|Victoria]].\n\nIn July 1858, [[Tom Wills]], an Australian-born cricketer educated at [[Rugby School]] in England, wrote a letter to ''[[Bell's Life in Victoria|Bell's Life in Victoria & Sporting Chronicle]]'', calling for a \"foot-ball club\" with a \"code of laws\" to keep cricketers fit during winter.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letter from Tom Wills |work=MCG website |url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&articleid=37 |archivedate=25 June 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> This is considered by historians to be a defining moment in the creation of Australian rules football.

One week later, Wills umpired a schoolboys match between [[Melbourne Grammar School]] and [[Scotch College (Melbourne)|Scotch College]]. Following these matches, organised football in Melbourne rapidly increased in popularity.\n\n[[File:Australianfootball1866.jpg|thumb|Wood engraving of an Australian rules football match at the [[Yarra Park|Richmond Paddock]], [[Melbourne]], 1866]]\nWills and others involved in these early matches formed the [[Melbourne Football Club]] (the oldest surviving Australian football club) on 14 May 1859. Club members Wills, [[William Hammersley]], [[J. B. Thompson]] and [[Thomas H. Smith]] met with the intention of forming a set of rules that would be widely adopted by other clubs. The committee debated rules used in English public school games; Wills pushed for various [[rugby football]] rules he learnt during his schooling. The first rules share similarities with these games, and were shaped to suit to Australian conditions. [[H. C. A. Harrison]], a seminal figure in Australian football, recalled that his cousin Wills wanted \"a game of our own\".<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Hibbins |first1=Gillian |last2=Mancini |first2=Anne |title=Running with the Ball: Football's Foster Father |publisher=Lynedoch Publications |year=1987 |pages=118\u2013119 |isbn=978-0-7316-0481-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oR3wAAAAMAAJ }}</ref> The code was distinctive in the prevalence of the [[Mark (Australian football)|mark]], [[Free kick (Australian rules football)|free kick]], [[Tackle (football move)#Australian rules football|tackling]], lack of an offside rule and that players were specifically penalised for [[Handball (Australian rules football)|throwing the ball]].\n\nThe Melbourne football rules were widely distributed and gradually adopted by the other Victorian clubs. The rules were updated several times during the 1860s to accommodate the rules of other influential Victorian football clubs. A significant redraft in 1866 by H. C. A. Harrison's committee accommodated the [[Geelong Football Club]]'s rules, making the game then known as \"Victorian Rules\" increasingly distinct from other codes. It soon adopted cricket fields and an oval ball, used specialised goal and behind posts, and featured [[running bounce|bouncing the ball while running]] and [[specky|spectacular high marking]]. The game spread quickly to other [[Australian states and territories|Australian colonies]]. Outside its heartland in southern Australia, the code experienced a significant period of decline following World War I but has since grown throughout Australia and in [[Australian football around the world|other parts of the world]], and the [[Australian Football League]] emerged as the dominant professional competition.\n\n=== Football Association ===\n{{Main|The Football Association}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| perrow = 4\n| total_width = 600\n | image1 = 1872_engl_v_scotland_ralston.jpg\n | width1 =  \n | alt1 =  \n | image2 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-2.jpg\n | alt2 =\n | width2 =  \n | image3 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-3.jpg\n | alt3 =\n | width3 =  \n | image4 = 1872_engl_v_scotland-4.jpg\n | width4 =  \n | footer = The first [[Association football|football]] international, [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] versus [[England national football team|England]]. Once kept by the [[Rugby Football Union]] as an early example of [[rugby football]].\n}}\n\nDuring the early 1860s, there were increasing attempts in England to unify and reconcile the various public school games. In 1862, J. C. Thring, who had been one of the driving forces behind the original Cambridge Rules, was a master at [[Uppingham School]] and he issued his own rules of what he called \"The Simplest Game\" (these are also known as the Uppingham Rules). In early October 1863 another new revised version of the Cambridge Rules was drawn up by a seven member committee representing former pupils from Harrow, Shrewsbury, Eton, Rugby, Marlborough and Westminster.\n\nAt the [[Freemasons' Tavern]], Great Queen Street, London on the evening of 26 October 1863, representatives of several football clubs in the [[County of London|London Metropolitan area]] met for the inaugural meeting of [[The Football Association]] (FA). The aim of the Association was to establish a single unifying code and regulate the playing of the game among its members. Following the first meeting, the public schools were invited to join the association. All of them declined, except Charterhouse and Uppingham. In total, six meetings of the FA were held between October and December 1863. After the third meeting, a draft set of rules were published. However, at the beginning of the fourth meeting, attention was drawn to the recently published Cambridge Rules of 1863. The Cambridge rules differed from the draft FA rules in two significant areas; namely running with (carrying) the ball and [[hacking (rugby)|hacking]] (kicking opposing players in the shins). The two contentious FA rules were as follows:\n\n{{quote|IX. A player shall be entitled to run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal if he makes a fair catch, or catches the ball on the first bound; but in case of a fair catch, if he makes his mark he shall not run.<br /><!--Leave it here: two rules, two lines. -->\nX. If any player shall run with the ball towards his adversaries' goal, any player on the opposite side shall be at liberty to charge, hold, trip or hack him, or to wrest the ball from him, but no player shall be held and hacked at the same time.<ref>Peter Shortell.

Most of the delegates supported this, but [[F. M. Campbell]], the representative from [[Blackheath Rugby Club|Blackheath]] and the first FA treasurer, objected. He said: \"hacking is the true football\". However, the motion to ban running with the ball in hand and hacking was carried and Blackheath withdrew from the FA. After the final meeting on 8 December, the FA published the \"[[Laws of the Game (association football)|Laws of Football]]\", the first comprehensive set of rules for the game later known as Association Football. The term \"soccer\", in use since the late 19th century, derives from an [[Oxford \"-er\"|Oxford University abbreviation]] of \"Association\".<ref name=OEDsoccer>{{cite journal |date=June 2011 |title=soccer, n |journal=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/183733 |accessdate=1 July 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe first FA rules still contained elements that are no longer part of association football, but which are still recognisable in other games (such as Australian football and rugby football): for instance, a player could make a fair catch and claim a ''[[Mark (Australian football)|mark]]'', which entitled him to a free kick; and if a player touched the ball behind the opponents' goal line, his side was entitled to a ''free kick'' at goal, from 15&nbsp;yards (13.5&nbsp;metres) in front of the goal line.\n\n=== Rugby football ===\n{{Main|History of rugby union}}\n[[File:Last scrimmage buckman.jpg|thumb|''The Last Scrimmage'' by Edwin Buckman, depicting a rugby scrum in 1871]]\nIn [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]], by 1870, there were 49 clubs playing variations of the Rugby school game.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rugbyfootballhistory.com/timeline1870s.htm|title=Rugby Football History|website=rugbyfootballhistory.com|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> There were also \"rugby\" clubs in Ireland, Australia, Canada and New Zealand. However, there was no generally accepted set of rules for rugby until 1871, when 21 clubs from London came together to form the [[Rugby Football Union]] (RFU). The first official RFU rules were adopted in June 1871.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.englandrugby.com/about-rfu/the-rfu|title=RFU|website=englandrugby.com|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> These rules allowed passing the ball.

One observer, Father W. Ferris, described two main forms of ''caid'' during this period: the \"field game\" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees; and the epic \"cross-country game\" which took up most of the daylight hours of a Sunday on which it was played, and was won by one team taking the ball across a parish boundary. \"Wrestling\", \"holding\" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.\n\nBy the 1870s, Rugby and Association football had started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College Dublin]] was an early stronghold of Rugby (see the [[Football#Other developments in the 1850s|Developments in the 1850s]] section, above). The rules of the English FA were being distributed widely. Traditional forms of ''caid'' had begun to give way to a \"rough-and-tumble game\" which allowed tripping.\n\nThere was no serious attempt to unify and codify Irish varieties of football, until the establishment of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) in 1884. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as [[hurling]] and to reject imported games like Rugby and Association football. The first Gaelic football rules were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://usgaa.org/gaelic-football/|title=Gaelic Football|website=USGAA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Davin's rules showed the influence of games such as hurling and a desire to formalise a distinctly Irish code of football. The prime example of this differentiation was the lack of an offside rule (an attribute which, for many years, was shared only by other Irish games like hurling, and by Australian rules football).\n\n=== Schism in Rugby football ===\n[[File:Reverend marshall.jpg|thumb|An English cartoon from the 1890s lampooning the divide in rugby football which led to the formation of [[rugby league]]. The caricatures are of Rev. Frank Marshall, an arch-opponent of player payments, and James Miller, a long-time opponent of Marshall. The caption reads:\n\nMarshall: \"Oh, fie, go away naughty boy, I don't play with boys who can\u2019t afford to take a holiday for football any day they like!\"\n\nMiller: \"Yes, that's just you to a T; you\u2019d make it so that no lad whose father wasn\u2019t a millionaire could play at all in a really good team. For my part I see no reason why the men who make the money shouldn\u2019t have a share in the spending of it.\"]]\n{{Further|History of rugby league}}\nThe [[International Rugby Board|International Rugby Football Board]] (IRFB) was founded in 1886<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.world.rugby/news/204311?lang=en|title=IRFB Formed|last=worldrugby.org|website=world.rugby|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref>, but rifts were beginning to emerge in the code. [[professional sports|Professionalism]] had already begun to creep into the various codes of football.\n\nIn England, by the 1890s, a long-standing [[Rugby Football Union]] ban on ''professional'' players was causing regional tensions within rugby football, as many players in northern England were working class and could not afford to take time off to train, travel, play and recover from injuries. This was not very different from what had occurred ten years earlier in soccer in Northern England but the authorities reacted very differently in the RFU, attempting to alienate the working class support in Northern England. In 1895, following a dispute about a player being paid broken time payments, which replaced wages lost as a result of playing rugby, representatives of the northern clubs met in [[Huddersfield]] to form the [[Rugby Football League|Northern Rugby Football Union]] (NRFU). The new body initially permitted only various types of player wage replacements. However, within two years, NRFU players could be paid, but they were required to have a job outside sport.\n\nThe demands of a professional league dictated that rugby had to become a better \"spectator\" sport. Within a few years the NRFU rules had started to diverge from the RFU, most notably with the abolition of the ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]''. This was followed by the replacement of the ''[[Playing rugby union#Ruck|ruck]]'' with the \"play-the-ball ruck\", which allowed a two-player ruck contest between the tackler at marker and the player tackled. ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|Mauls]]'' were stopped once the ball carrier was held, being replaced by a play-the ball-ruck. The separate Lancashire and Yorkshire competitions of the NRFU merged in 1901, forming the Northern Rugby League, the first time the name [[rugby league]] was used officially in England.\n\nOver time, the RFU form of rugby, played by clubs which remained members of national federations affiliated to the IRFB, became known as [[rugby union]].\n\n=== Globalisation of association football ===\n{{Main|History of FIFA}}\nThe need for a single body to oversee association football had become apparent by the beginning of the 20th century, with the increasing popularity of international fixtures. The English Football Association had chaired many discussions on setting up an international body, but was perceived as making no progress. It fell to associations from seven other European countries: France, Belgium, Denmark, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland, to form an international association. The ''F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association'' ([[FIFA]]) was founded in Paris on 21 May 1904.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> Its first president was [[Robert Gu\u00e9rin]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fifa.com/about-fifa/who-we-are/history/index.html|title=History of FIFA - Foundation|last=FIFA.com|publisher=FIFA|access-date=7 November 2019}}</ref> The French name and acronym has remained, even outside French-speaking countries.\n\n=== Further divergence of the two rugby codes ===\nRugby league rules diverged significantly from rugby union in 1906, with the reduction of the team from 15 to 13 players. In 1907, a New Zealand professional rugby team toured Australia and Britain, receiving an enthusiastic response, and professional [[rugby league in Australia|rugby leagues were launched in Australia]] the following year. However, the rules of professional games varied from one country to another, and negotiations between various national bodies were required to fix the exact rules for each international match. This situation endured until 1948, when at the instigation of the French league, the [[Rugby League International Federation]] (RLIF) was formed at a meeting in [[Bordeaux]].\n\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the rules changed further. In 1966, rugby league officials borrowed the American football concept of ''[[Down (football)|downs]]'': a team was allowed to retain possession of the ball for four tackles (rugby union retains the original rule that a player who is tackled and brought to the ground must release the ball immediately).  The maximum number of tackles was later increased to six (in 1971), and in rugby league this became known as the [[Playing rugby league#Six tackle rule|''six tackle rule'']].\n\nWith the advent of full-time professionals in the early 1990s, and the consequent speeding up of the game, the five metre off-side distance between the two teams became 10&nbsp;metres, and the replacement rule was superseded by various interchange rules, among other changes.\n\nThe laws of rugby union also changed during the 20th century, although less significantly than those of rugby league. In particular, goals from ''[[mark (rugby)|marks]]'' were abolished, kicks directly ''[[Touch (rugby)|into touch]]'' from outside the ''[[Rugby pitch|22 metre]]'' line were penalised, new laws were put in place to determine who had possession following an inconclusive ''[[Ruck (Rugby union)|ruck]]'' or ''[[Rugby union gameplay#Maul|maul]]'', and the lifting of players in ''[[line-out (rugby union)|line-out]]s'' was legalised.\n\nIn 1995, rugby union became an \"open\" game, that is one which allowed professional players.<ref>{{cite web |title=History of the RFU |url=http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |publisher=[[Rugby Football Union]] |accessdate=28 September 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100422210444/http://www.rfu.com/AboutTheRFU/History.aspx |archivedate=22 April 2010}}</ref> Although the original dispute between the two codes has now disappeared \u2013 and despite the fact that officials from both forms of rugby football have sometimes mentioned the possibility of re-unification \u2013 the rules of both codes and their culture have diverged to such an extent that such an event is unlikely in the foreseeable future.\n\n== Use of the word \"football\" ==\n{{details|Football (word)}}\nThe word ''football'', when used in reference to a specific game can mean any one of those described above. Because of this, much friendly controversy has occurred over the term ''football'', primarily because it is used in different ways in different parts of the [[English-speaking world]]. Most often, the word \"football\" is used to refer to the code of football that is considered dominant within a particular region. So, effectively, what the word \"football\" means usually depends on where one says it.\n[[File:The Sportsman 1910-11-25 Football.png|thumb|Heading from The Sportsman (London) front page of 25 November 1910, illustrating the continued use of the word \"football\" to encompass both association football and rugby]]\nIn each of the United Kingdom, the United States, and Canada, one football code is known solely as \"football\", while the others generally require a qualifier.

I found my lower body in the car but my upper half sticking out of a broken window. I was basically hanging upside down. There were glass shards right in front of my eyes and I knew I could have suffered a big injury if I was dropped.\n\nI started crying the minute I saw all of the glass. Then Hyoseong told me to stop crying and stay awake. When she asked where I was, I could hear their shock as I said that I was hanging outside. Hyoseong then said that she'll take me out. I felt someone grab my foot and felt Hyoseong use her leg to support the rest of my body. She had not yet recovered from her own leg injury and yet she still used her leg to hold me up.

In the most striking shots, the actors seem to blend into the architecture like the figures in Persian miniatures.

Each film is dedicated to a different city in Israel: \"Devarim\" takes place in Tel Aviv, and is after the novel by Yaakov Shabtai, Past Continuous. The film depicts the spiritual disarray of three men in their thirties and forties, in the agitation and turmoil of Tel Aviv, the city created by Jewish pioneers in 1909. None of them has the life he had imagined. \"Yom Yom\" draws upon Haifa's tradition of peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jewish neighbours to tell a dark comic tale of characters driven by divided loyalties and neurotic inhibitions. Leslie Camhi wrote \"Gita\u00ef\u2019s genius is to show the conflict infiltrating every encounter, from the marketplace to the bedroom and beyond; the vivid portraits of Israeli social types, whether arrogant reservists or hapless nebbishes, stand in sharp contrast to images promoted in the media.\" (Leslie Camhi, Village Voice, 20 February 2001). \n''[[Kadosh]]'' is set in [[Mea Shearim]], the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem and tells the story of Me\u00efr and Rivka, that have been married for ten years but have to divorce because they have no children.

Among them are the demands of ultra-orthodox religion, which confines as it sustains, and the suffering of men and women whose religion comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain. Yet Kadosh is also foreign in the extreme, an austere and shocking portrait of daily life in Mea Shearim, the Hasidic Jewish quarter of Jerusalem.

A subculture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure Talmudic ruling. The prominent right wing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. \nAnd the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it.

But we have to be modest about it: art is not the most efficient way to change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects. I hope that this is something that we do with this multi-format presentation, with a film installation, a performance, and research materials about and around the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin\" (Amos Gitai).\n\nIn 2017, Amos Gitai returns to the occupied territories for the first time since his 1982 documentary \"Field Diary\". \"WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER\" describes the efforts of Israelis and Palestinians citizens, who try to overcome the consequences of the occupation. Gitai's documentary shows the human ties woven by the military, human rights activists, journalists, mourning mothers and even Jewish settlers. Faced with the failure of politics to solve the occupation, these men and women rise and act in the name of their civic consciousness. This human energy is a proposal for long overdue change. The film was premiered in Cannes International Film Festival 2017 \u2013 Directors' Fortnight.\n\n2018 is a year of intense activity for Amos Gitai, who presents at [[the Venice Film Festival]] \"A TRAMWAY IN JERUSALEM\", a light-hearted and dramatic fare on a tramway that connects several of Jerusalem's neighborhoods from East to West, bringing together a mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"The film describes an ironic, almost utopian situation in which most of the conflicts are contained and this beautiful city of Jerusalem charged with thousands of years of history facilitates people\u2019s way of living side by side.\" (Amos Gitai) \nCast: [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Pippo Delbono]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Hanna Laszlo]], among 36 Israeli, Palestinian and European actors and actresses.\n\nThe film is preceded by Amos Gitai's \"[[A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GAZA]]\" (2018, 34 mins, in Hebrew & Arabic). The film responds to the current crisis between Israel and Gaza. 2 Palestinians and 2 Israelis read texts inspired by [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Yizhar Smilansky]], [[Emile Habibi]] and [[Amira Hass]], as an homage to a famous letter written by [[Albert Camus]] in 1943, which gives its title to the film.\n\n===Novel adaptations===\nGitai created several novel adaptations. ''One day you'll understand'' (\"Plus tard tu comprendras\", 2008) is based on an autobiographical book by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]], president of the Arte television channel and one of the leading figures of French culture, and tells the story of a French writer tracing the story of his Jewish mother ([[Jeanne Moreau]]) and her family during World War II.<ref>[[:fr:J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n<ref>A.

If I remained true to the facts, no one would believe me. But the moment I chose a girl, a little older than I was at that time, I removed ''the story of my life'' from the mighty grip of memory and gave it over to the creative laboratory. There memory is not the only proprietor. There one needs a causal explanation, a thread to tie things together. The exceptional is permissible only if it is part of an overall structure and contributes to its understanding. \nWhen I wrote ''Tsili'' I was interested in the possibilities of naiveness in art. Can there be a naive modern art? It seemed to me that without the naivete still found among children and old people and, to some extent, in ourselves, the work of art would be flawed.

He achieves one of the most beautiful things a camera can register 'live', as it were; people who look at the same thing but see different things - and who are moved by that vision. In this crumbling shell of a house, real hallucinations begin to take shape. The film's central idea is simple and the film has simply the force of that idea, no more, no less.\" (Serge Daney, Lib\u00e9ration, 1 March 1982)\n\nWadi (''Wadi'' 1981, ''Wadi Ten Years After'' 1991, ''Wadi Grand Canyon'' 2001), similar to House is dealing with a specific location and examines the complex relationships between the residents of the former stone quarry: Eastern European immigrants, survivors of the camps and Arabs who have also been expelled from their homes. Gitai turns the valley into a symbol of a possible coexistence.<ref>http://www.amosgitai.com/html/film.asp?docid=39&lang=1</ref>\n \nIn 1982 he directed \"Field Diary\" (1982).

Events are re-enacted in a sequence of ritual tableaux shot in the ruins of Wadi Salib, the old Arab neighbourhood of Haifa that the Palestinians abandoned after the 1948 war. The sense of ancient unsettled scores that have simmered for centuries is almost palpable in this beautiful but ravaged territory. In the most striking shots, the actors seem to blend into the architecture like the figures in Persian miniatures. These shots are pointedly contrasted with others photographed in the same vicinity, which make it look like a squalid contemporary junkyard. The juxtapositions suggest how overwhelmingly the region's history continues to haunt Israel's present.\" (Stephen Holden, ''The New York Times'', 19 May 1989)\n\n[[File:Gitai88.jpg|thumb|250px|Amos Gitai and [[Henri Alekan]], shooting Esther, 1986.]]\n\nThe \"City Trilogy\" (''[[Devarim (film)|Devarim]]'', 1995 ; ''[[Yom Yom]]'', 1998 ; ''[[Kadosh]]'', 1999), was created after Gitai's return to Israel in 1993, after [[Yitzhak Rabin]]\u2019s victory in the elections and the [[Oslo Accords]]. Each film is dedicated to a different city in Israel: \"Devarim\" takes place in Tel Aviv, and is after the novel by Yaakov Shabtai, Past Continuous. The film depicts the spiritual disarray of three men in their thirties and forties, in the agitation and turmoil of Tel Aviv, the city created by Jewish pioneers in 1909. None of them has the life he had imagined. \"Yom Yom\" draws upon Haifa's tradition of peaceful coexistence between Arab and Jewish neighbours to tell a dark comic tale of characters driven by divided loyalties and neurotic inhibitions. Leslie Camhi wrote \"Gita\u00ef\u2019s genius is to show the conflict infiltrating every encounter, from the marketplace to the bedroom and beyond; the vivid portraits of Israeli social types, whether arrogant reservists or hapless nebbishes, stand in sharp contrast to images promoted in the media.\" (Leslie Camhi, Village Voice, 20 February 2001). \n''[[Kadosh]]'' is set in [[Mea Shearim]], the ultra-orthodox neighbourhood of Jerusalem and tells the story of Me\u00efr and Rivka, that have been married for ten years but have to divorce because they have no children. Actors: [[Yael Abecassis]], Samuel Calderon, [[Lea Koenig]], [[Yussuf Abu-Warda]], Uri Klauzner, [[Rivka Michaeli]], Yoram Hattab.\n<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C06E6D81531F935A25751C0A9669C8B63</ref>\nThe review in ''The Wall Street Journal'':\n''Kadosh'' - \"the title means \"sacred\" - addresses universal themes. Among them are the demands of ultra-orthodox religion, which confines as it sustains, and the suffering of men and women whose religion comes before love, but whose culture lacks a vocabulary for expressing personal pain.

We never know for certain and then we realise that this uncertainty is in fact the most profound truth of war, as cinema has hardly ever shown it, with a force and an intensity that takes your breath away. [\u2026] The principle for filming warfare in Kippur is simple, limpid. Favouring real time spaces, [\u2026] making the camera an extra person walking with the soldiers, running behind the others to get on the helicopter before it takes off. The viewer is inside the war while remaining outside the group, accompanying them.

His killer apprehended at the scene turned out to be a 25-year-old Jewish observant. Investigation into this brutal murder reveals a dark and frightening world that made this tragic deed possible. A subculture of hate fueled by hysterical rhetoric, paranoia and political intrigue. The extremist rabbis who condemned Rabin by invoking an obscure Talmudic ruling. The prominent right wing politicians who joined in a campaign of incitement against Rabin. The militant Israeli settlers for whom peace meant betrayal. \nAnd the security agents who saw what was coming and failed to prevent it. The film sheds light on an ever-growing crisis of hate in Israeli society today. \nGitai combines staged re-enactments with actual news footage of the shooting and its aftermath to create a thought-provoking political thriller.<ref>https://charlierose.com/videos/23077.htm{{Dead link|date=April 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\n\"A few years ago we decided to make this project on the assassination of Rabin as a kind of a gesture about memory and even in the hope that sometimes when you resurrect memory, it can create movements. But we have to be modest about it: art is not the most efficient way to change reality. Politics or machine guns have a much more direct effect. But sometimes art has some delayed effect, because it conserves memory when big powers want to erase it, because they call for obedience, they don't want to be disturbed, they don't want dissent. But if artists are loyal to their inner truth, they produce works which voyage in time, which don't always have immediate effects, sometimes they have delayed effects. I hope that this is something that we do with this multi-format presentation, with a film installation, a performance, and research materials about and around the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin\" (Amos Gitai).\n\nIn 2017, Amos Gitai returns to the occupied territories for the first time since his 1982 documentary \"Field Diary\". \"WEST OF THE JORDAN RIVER\" describes the efforts of Israelis and Palestinians citizens, who try to overcome the consequences of the occupation. Gitai's documentary shows the human ties woven by the military, human rights activists, journalists, mourning mothers and even Jewish settlers. Faced with the failure of politics to solve the occupation, these men and women rise and act in the name of their civic consciousness. This human energy is a proposal for long overdue change. The film was premiered in Cannes International Film Festival 2017 \u2013 Directors' Fortnight.\n\n2018 is a year of intense activity for Amos Gitai, who presents at [[the Venice Film Festival]] \"A TRAMWAY IN JERUSALEM\", a light-hearted and dramatic fare on a tramway that connects several of Jerusalem's neighborhoods from East to West, bringing together a mosaic of people from different religious and ethnic backgrounds. \"The film describes an ironic, almost utopian situation in which most of the conflicts are contained and this beautiful city of Jerusalem charged with thousands of years of history facilitates people\u2019s way of living side by side.\" (Amos Gitai) \nCast: [[Mathieu Amalric]], [[Pippo Delbono]], [[Yael Abecassis]], [[Hanna Laszlo]], among 36 Israeli, Palestinian and European actors and actresses.\n\nThe film is preceded by Amos Gitai's \"[[A LETTER TO A FRIEND IN GAZA]]\" (2018, 34 mins, in Hebrew & Arabic). The film responds to the current crisis between Israel and Gaza. 2 Palestinians and 2 Israelis read texts inspired by [[Mahmoud Darwish]], [[Yizhar Smilansky]], [[Emile Habibi]] and [[Amira Hass]], as an homage to a famous letter written by [[Albert Camus]] in 1943, which gives its title to the film.\n\n===Novel adaptations===\nGitai created several novel adaptations. ''One day you'll understand'' (\"Plus tard tu comprendras\", 2008) is based on an autobiographical book by [[J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]], president of the Arte television channel and one of the leading figures of French culture, and tells the story of a French writer tracing the story of his Jewish mother ([[Jeanne Moreau]]) and her family during World War II.<ref>[[:fr:J\u00e9r\u00f4me Cl\u00e9ment]]</ref>{{Circular reference|date=March 2019}}\n<ref>A.

''[[Tsili]]'' (2014) is inspired by the novel by [[Aharon Appelfeld]], and tells the story of the wandering of its heroine submerged in the nightmare of the war. Tsili, a young Jewish woman, gathers all the forces of intuition and vitality to survive in this desperate universe. \nstarring [[Sarah Adler]], Meshi Olinski, and [[Lea Koenig]].\n<ref>https://www.huffingtonpost.com/e-nina-rothe/best-of-venice-with-tsili_b_5815176.html</ref>\n\"I was inspired by what Aharon Appelfeld told Philip Roth :The reality of the Holocaust surpassed any imagination. If I remained true to the facts, no one would believe me. But the moment I chose a girl, a little older than I was at that time, I removed ''the story of my life'' from the mighty grip of memory and gave it over to the creative laboratory. There memory is not the only proprietor. There one needs a causal explanation, a thread to tie things together. The exceptional is permissible only if it is part of an overall structure and contributes to its understanding. \nWhen I wrote ''Tsili'' I was interested in the possibilities of naiveness in art. Can there be a naive modern art? It seemed to me that without the naivete still found among children and old people and, to some extent, in ourselves, the work of art would be flawed. I tried to correct that flaw.\" (Amos Gitai)\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller\".jpg|thumb|Amos Gitai and Arthur Miller]] -->\n\n===Exhibitions, publications and performances===\nGitai\u2019s work include film installations, stage work and books publications.

In Yitzhak Rabin : chronique d\u2019un assassinat, Gitai uses the memories of Leah Rabin, the Prime Minister's widow, as a springboard. Four voices (two actresses, Hiam Abbass and Sarah Adler, and two musicians, Edna Stern (piano) and [[Sonia Wieder-Atherton]] (cello) create a recitative, \u201chalfway between lament and lullaby,\u201d to travel back through History and explore the incredible violence with which the nationalist forces fought the peace project, tearing Israel apart. Four voices caught \u201clike in an echo chamber,\u201d between image-documents and excerpts from classic and contemporary literature.\n\nIn July 2016, a 540-page book on Amos Gitai was published by Galerie Enrico Navarra and S\u00e9bastien Moreu.
