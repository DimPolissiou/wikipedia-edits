But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

Its motives range from the desire of the Chinese to dominate Manila, to their desire to abort the Spaniards' moves which seemed to lead to their elimination. The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in directly fighting against the Spanish during the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]. Spain also upheld a plan to conquer China, but it never materialized.<ref>Samuel Hawley.

However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, \"[[tax per head|head taxes]]\" were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under \"special circumstances\". The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967, when all racial restrictions on [[immigration to Canada]] were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points based immigration system.

But in just 11 of the 38 nations surveyed was China actually viewed unfavorably by at least half of those surveyed. Japan was polled to have the most anti-China sentiment, where 93% see the People's Republic in a negative light, including 48% of Japanese who have a very unfavorable view of China. There were also majorities in Germany (64%), Italy (62%) and Israel (60%) who held negative views of China. The rise in anti-China sentiment in Germany was particularly striking:  from 33% disfavor in 2006 to 64% under the 2013 survey, with such views existing despite Germany's success exporting to China.<ref name=pewglobal />\n\nDespite China's general appeal to the young, half or more of those people surveyed in 26 of 38 nations felt that China acted unilaterally in international affairs, notably increasing tensions between China and other neighboring countries, excluding Russia, over territorial disputes.

About half or more of those in the seven Middle Eastern nations surveyed also thought China acted unilaterally. This includes 79% of Israelis, 71% of Jordanians and 68% of Turks.

After the [[Nagasaki incident|violence]] in [[Nagasaki]] caused by Chinese sailors, it stemmed anti-Chinese sentiment in Japan and following Qing China's non-apology, it even strained further. After the end of the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], Japan defeated China and soon acquired colonial possessions of [[Taiwan]] and [[Ryukyu Islands]].\n\nThroughout the 1920s, Sinophobia was still common in Europe, notably in Britain. Chinese men had been a fixture on [[London]]'s docks since the mid-eighteenth century, when they arrived as sailors who were employed by the East India Company, importing tea and spices from the Far East. Conditions on those long voyages were so dreadful that many sailors decided to abscond and take their chances on the streets rather than face the return journey. Those who stayed generally settled around the bustling docks, running laundries and small lodging houses for other sailors or selling exotic Asian produce. By the 1880s, a small but recognizable Chinese community had developed in the Limehouse area, to the consternation of white native-born Londoners, who feared [[Miscegenation|racial mixing]] and an influx of cheap labor. The entire Chinese population of London was only in the low hundreds\u2014in a city whose entire population was roughly estimated to be seven million\u2014but [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] feelings ran high, as was evidenced by the Aliens Act of 1905, a bundle of legislation which sought to restrict entry to poor and low-skilled foreign workers.<ref name=theparisreview>[https://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2017/05/05/unspeakable-affections/ Unspeakable Affections] - Paris Review.

Its motives range from the desire of the Chinese to dominate Manila, to their desire to abort the Spaniards' moves which seemed to lead to their elimination. The Spaniards quelled the rebellion and massacred around 20,000 Chinese. The Chinese responded by fleeing to the [[Sulu Sultanate]] and supporting the Moro Muslims in their war against the Spanish. The Chinese supplied the Moros with weapons and joined them in directly fighting against the Spanish during the [[Spanish\u2013Moro conflict]]. Spain also upheld a plan to conquer China, but it never materialized.<ref>Samuel Hawley.

However, they were denied by law the rights of citizenship, including the right to vote, and in the 1880s, \"[[tax per head|head taxes]]\" were implemented to curtail immigration from China. In 1907, a riot in [[Vancouver, British Columbia|Vancouver]] targeted Chinese and Japanese-owned businesses. In 1923, the federal government passed the ''[[Chinese Immigration Act of 1923|Chinese Immigration Act]]'', commonly known as the ''Exclusion Act'', prohibiting further Chinese immigration except under \"special circumstances\". The Exclusion Act was repealed in 1947, the same year in which [[Chinese Canadian]]s were given the right to vote. Restrictions would continue to exist on immigration from Asia until 1967, when all racial restrictions on [[immigration to Canada]] were repealed, and Canada adopted the current points based immigration system.
