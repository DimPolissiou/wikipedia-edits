The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth installment is scheduled for May 21st 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus' attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, he is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, gets strapped in a chair connected to computers, and touches the silver from a broken mirror that was magically fixed, his reality disintegrates, and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies to Neo, that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded, kills him.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia.

The ''Matrix'' franchise was further expanded through the production of comic books, video games and animated short films, with which the Wachowskis were heavily involved. The ''Matrix'' franchise has also inspired books and theories expanding on some of the religious and philosophical ideas alluded to in the films. A fourth installment is scheduled for May 21st 2021.\n\n==Plot==\nAt an abandoned hotel within a major city, a woman (later revealed to be [[Trinity (The Matrix)|Trinity]]) is cornered by a police squad but quickly overpowers them with superhuman abilities. She flees, pursued by the police and a group of mysterious suited [[Agent (The Matrix)|Agents]] capable of similar superhuman feats. She answers a ringing public telephone and vanishes an instant before the Agents crash a truck into the booth.\n\n[[Programmer|Computer programmer]] Thomas Anderson, known in the [[Security hacker|hacking]] scene by his [[Alter ego|alias]] \"[[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]\", feels something is wrong with the world and is puzzled by repeated online encounters with the phrase \"the Matrix.\" Trinity contacts him and tells him a man named [[Morpheus (The Matrix)|Morpheus]] has the answers he seeks. A team of Agents and police, led by [[Agent Smith]], arrives at Neo's workplace in search of him. Despite Morpheus' attempt to guide Neo to safety via telephone, he is captured and coerced into helping the Agents locate Morpheus, whom they regard as a \"known terrorist.\" Undeterred, Neo later meets Morpheus, who offers him a choice between [[red pill and blue pill|two pills]]; red to show him the truth about the Matrix, and blue to return him to his former life. After Neo swallows the red pill, his reality disintegrates, and he awakens in a liquid-filled pod among countless others attached to an elaborate electrical system. He is retrieved and brought aboard Morpheus' hovercraft, the ''[[Nebuchadnezzar (The Matrix)|Nebuchadnezzar]]''.\n\nAs Neo recuperates from a lifetime of physical inactivity in the pod, Morpheus explains the truth. In the early 21st century, there was a war between humans and [[artificial intelligence|intelligent machines]]. When humans blocked the machines' access to solar energy, the machines responded by harvesting the humans' [[bioelectromagnetics|bioelectric]] power, keeping them pacified in the Matrix, a shared [[simulated reality]] modeled after the world as it was at the end of the 20th century. While the machines have taken over the world, the city of [[Zion (The Matrix)|Zion]] still remains as the last refuge of free humans. Morpheus and his crew are a group of rebels who hack into the Matrix to \"unplug\" enslaved humans and recruit them; their understanding of the Matrix's simulated nature enables them to bend its physical laws, granting them superhuman abilities. Morpheus warns Neo that death within the Matrix also kills the physical body, and that the Agents he met are powerful sentient computer programs that eliminate threats to the system, while machines called Sentinels search to destroy rebels in the real world. Neo's prowess during virtual combat training lends credibility to Morpheus's belief that Neo is \"the One\", an especially powerful human prophesied to free humanity and end the war.\n\nThe group enters the Matrix to visit [[The Oracle (The Matrix)|the Oracle]], the prophet who predicted the emergence of the One. She implies to Neo, that he is not the One and warns that he will have to choose between Morpheus's life and his own. The group is ambushed by Agents and tactical police, tipped by [[Cypher (The Matrix)|Cypher]], a disgruntled crew member who seeks to betray Morpheus in exchange for a comfortable life in the Matrix. Morpheus allows himself to be captured so the rest of the crew can escape. Cypher exits the Matrix first and murders several crew members as they lie defenseless in the real world. Before he can kill Neo, [[Tank (The Matrix)|Tank]], a crewman whom he had only wounded, kills him.\n\nIn the Matrix, the Agents interrogate Morpheus to learn his access codes to the [[mainframe computer]] in Zion. Tank proposes killing Morpheus to prevent this, but Neo resolves to return to the Matrix to rescue Morpheus, as prophesied by the Oracle; Trinity insists she accompany him. While rescuing Morpheus, Neo gains confidence in his abilities, performing feats comparable to the Agents'. Morpheus and Trinity exit the Matrix, but Smith ambushes and kills Neo before he can leave. As a group of Sentinels attack the ''Nebuchadnezzar'', Trinity whispers to Neo that he cannot be dead, because she loves him and the Oracle told her that she would fall in love with the One. She kisses Neo and he revives with newfound power to perceive and control the Matrix. He effortlessly defeats Smith, and leaves the Matrix just in time for the ship's [[electromagnetic pulse]] to disable the Sentinels.\n\nLater, Neo makes a telephone call inside the Matrix, promising the machines that he will show their prisoners \"a world where anything is possible\". He hangs up and flies into the sky.\n\n==Cast==\n{{See also|List of Matrix series characters}}\n* [[Keanu Reeves]] as [[Neo (The Matrix)|Neo]]: <br />A computer programmer, born Thomas A.

The Meditation hypothesizes that the perceived world might be a comprehensive illusion created to deceive us.<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\">{{cite web |url=http://www.salon.com/2002/12/05/matrix_2/ |title=\"The Matrix and Philosophy\" by William Irwin, ed. |work=[[Salon (website)|Salon]] |date=December 5, 2002 |author=Miller, Laura |accessdate=November 15, 2012}}</ref> The same premise can be found in [[Hilary Putnam]]'s [[brain in a vat]] scenario proposed in the [[1980s]].<ref name=\"Salon philosophy\" /> A connection between the premise of ''The Matrix'' and [[Plato]]'s [[Allegory of the Cave]] has also been suggested. The allegory is related to Plato's [[theory of Forms]], which holds that the true essence of an object is not what we perceive with our senses, but rather its quality, and that most people perceive only the shadow of the object and are thus limited to false perception.<ref name=\"Influence Screened\" />\n\nThe philosophy of [[Immanuel Kant]] has also been claimed as another influence on the film, and in particular how individuals within the Matrix interact with one another and with the system. Kant states in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' that people come to know and explore our world through synthetic means (language, etc.), and thus this makes it rather difficult to discern truth from falsely perceived views. This means people are their own agents of deceit, and so in order for them to know truth, they must choose to openly pursue truth. This idea can be examined in Agent Smith's monologue about the first version of the Matrix, which was designed as a human [[utopia]], a perfect world without suffering and with total happiness. Agent Smith explains that, \"it was a disaster. No one accepted the program. Entire crops [of people] were lost.\" The machines had to amend their choice of programming in order to make people subservient to them, and so they conceived the Matrix in the image of the world in 1999. The world in 1999 was far from a utopia, but still humans accepted this over the suffering-less utopia. According to William Irwin this is Kantian, because the machines wished to impose a perfect world on humans in an attempt to keep people content, so that they would remain completely submissive to the machines, both consciously and subconsciously, but humans were not easy to make content.<ref>Irwin, William. \"We Are (the) One!\" ''The Matrix and Philosophy: Welcome to the Desert of the Real''.

However, Embargo may be necessary in various economic situations of the State forced to impose it, not necessarily therefore in case of war.\n\n==Politics of sanctions==\nEconomic sanctions are used as a tool of [[foreign policy]] by many governments. Economic sanctions are usually imposed by a larger country upon a smaller country for one of two reasons.  \u2014either the latter is a perceived threat to the security of the former nation or that country treats its citizens unfairly. They can be used as a coercive measure for achieving particular policy goals related to trade or for humanitarian violations.

A single carefully-planned and well-executed stroke removed the United States Navy's battleship force as a possible threat to the Japanese Empire's southward expansion. [...] The Japanese military, deeply engaged in the seemingly endless war it had started against China in mid-1937, badly needed oil and other raw materials. Commercial access to these was gradually curtailed as the conquests continued. In July 1941 the Western powers effectively halted trade with Japan. From then on, as the desperate Japanese schemed to seize the oil and mineral-rich East Indies and Southeast Asia, a Pacific war was virtually inevitable.\n}}\n</ref>\n\nDuring the Suez Canal crisis in 1956 an attempt by Anglo-French forces to take control of the Canal from Egypt was called off largely because of US hostility to the invasion and President Eisenhower's threat to impose economic sanctions against Britain.

Economic sanctions are usually imposed by a larger country upon a smaller country for one of two reasons.  \u2014either the latter is a perceived threat to the security of the former nation or that country treats its citizens unfairly. They can be used as a coercive measure for achieving particular policy goals related to trade or for humanitarian violations.

The goal is to reach the [[Summit (topography)|summit]] of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined [[Climbing route|route]] without falling (and to have fun!). Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper [[climbing technique]]s and use of specialized [[climbing equipment]] is crucial for the safe completion of routes. \n\nBecause of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, <ref name=freedom>{{cite book |title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] |publisher=Swan Hill Press |author=The Mountaineers Books |edition=8th |year=2010 |isbn=9781594851384 |oclc=688611213 |pages=592 }}</ref> such as [[scrambling]], another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, [[wikt:differentiation|differentiated]] by rock climbing's sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.\n\nProfessional rock [[climbing competitions]] have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route.\n\n== History of rock climbing == \n{{main|History of rock climbing}}\n[[File:Fotothek df ps 0002300 Sport ^ Klettersport.jpg|thumb|Climbing in Germany, circa 1965.]]\n\nPaintings dating from 200 BC show [[Chinese people|Chinese]] men rock climbing. In early America, the cliff-dwelling [[Anasazi]] in the 12th century are thought to have been excellent climbers. Early [[Europe]]an climbers used rock climbing techniques as a skill required to reach the summit in their [[mountaineering]] exploits. In the 1880s, European rock climbing became an independent pursuit outside of mountain climbing.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Timothy W. Kidd |first2=Jennifer |last2=Hazelrigs |title=Rock Climbing |year=2009 |publisher=Human Kinetics 10% |isbn=9781450409001 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nAlthough rock climbing was an important component of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[mountaineering]] in the [[Alps]], it is generally thought that the sport of rock climbing began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in various parts of [[Europe]]. Rock climbing evolved gradually from an alpine necessity to a distinct athletic activity.\n\n[[Aid climbing]], climbing using equipment that acts as artificial handhold or footholds, became popular during the period 1920\u20131960, leading to ascents in the [[Alps]] and in [[Yosemite Valley]] that were considered impossible without such means. However, climbing techniques, equipment and ethical considerations have evolved steadily.  Today, [[free climbing]], climbing using holds made entirely of natural rock while using gear solely for protection and not for upward movement, is the most popular form of the sport. Free climbing has since been divided into several [[Climbing styles|sub-styles of climbing]] dependent on [[belaying|belay]] configuration.\n\nOver time, [[Grade (climbing)|grading systems]] have also been created in order to compare more accurately the relative difficulties of the rock climbs.\n\n== Style ==\nIn ''How to Rock Climb'', [[John Long (climber)|John Long]] notes that for moderately skilled climbers simply getting to the top of a route is not enough; how one gets to the top matters.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Long |first=John |authorlink=John Long (climber) |title=How to Rock Climb |page=155 |year=2004 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=9780762724710}}</ref> Within free climbing, there are distinctions given to ascents: [[on-sight]], [[flash (climbing)|flash]], and [[redpoint (climbing)|redpoint]]. To on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. Flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the [[Beta_(climbing)|beta]] with other climbers. Redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first tried it.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Timothy W.

Free climbing is typically divided into several styles that differ from one another depending on the choice of equipment used and the configurations of their belay, rope and [[Anchor (climbing)|anchor]] systems.\n\nAs routes get higher off the ground, the increased risk of life-threatening injuries necessitates additional safety measures.  A variety of specialized [[climbing techniques]] and [[climbing equipment]] exists to provide that safety.  Climbers will usually work in pairs and utilize a system of ropes and [[Anchor (climbing)|anchors]] designed to catch falls.  Ropes and anchors can be configured in different ways to suit many styles of climbing, and roped climbing are thus divided into further sub-types that vary based on how their [[belay]] systems are set up.  Generally speaking, beginners will start with [[top roping]] and/or easy [[bouldering]] and work their way up to [[lead climbing]] and beyond.\n\nDue to the length of time and extended endurance required, and because accidents are most likely to happen on the descent, rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route, or \"downclimb\", especially on the larger multiple [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] class III\u2013IV, or multi-day [[Grade (climbing)|grade]] IV\u2013VI climbs.\n\n=== Aid ===\n{{main|Aid climbing}}\nStill the most popular method of climbing big walls, aid climbers make progress up a wall by repeatedly placing and weighting gear that is used directly to aid ascent and enhance safety. This form of climbing is typically used when ascent is too technically difficult or impossible for free climbing.\n\n[[File:Under a roof.jpg|thumb|left|Man sport climbing under overhang]]\n\n=== Free ===\n{{main|Free climbing}}\nThe most commonly used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's own physical strength and skill are relied upon to accomplish the climb. Free climbing may rely on top rope belay systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay stations. Anchors, ropes and protection are used to back up the climber and are passive as opposed to active ascending aids. Sub-types of free climbing are [[trad climbing]] and [[sport climbing]]. Free climbing is generally done as \"clean lead\" meaning no pitons or pins are used as protection.<ref>{{cite book |title=Traditional Lead Climbing: A Rock Climber's Guide to Taking the Sharp End of the Rope |first=Heidi |last=Pesterfield |edition=2nd |publisher=Wilderness Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780899975597 |page=11}}</ref>\n\n=== Bouldering ===\n[[File:Joshua Tree bouldering - Stem Gem 2.jpg|thumb|Bouldering in [[Joshua Tree National Park]], [[United States]]]]\n{{main|Bouldering}}\nClimbing on short, low routes without the use of the safety rope that is typical of most other styles.  Protection, if used at all, typically consists of a cushioned [[bouldering pad]] below the route and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting in exceptionally high difficulty standards.\n\n=== Solo ===\n{{main|Solo climbing}}Solo climbing, or soloing, is a style of [[climbing]] in which the climber climbs alone, without the assistance of a [[Belaying|belay]].\n\n==== Deep-water solo (DWS) ====\n{{main|Deep-water soloing}}\nDeep-water soloing (or psicobloc) is similar to free soloing in that the climber is unprotected and without a rope, but should the climber fall, it is into deep water instead of onto the ground.\n\n==== Free solo ====\n{{main|Free soloing}}\nFree soloing, referred to as \"soloing\" in the UK, is single-person climbing without the use of any rope or protection system.  If a fall occurs and the climber is not over water (as in the case of [[deep water soloing]]), the climber is likely to be killed or seriously injured.  Though technically similar to bouldering, free solo climbing typically refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering. The term \"highball\" is used to refer to climbing on the boundary between free soloing and bouldering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a fall to cause serious injury (20&nbsp;ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be a free solo.\n\n==== Roped solo ====\n{{main|Roped solo climbing}}\nSolo climbing with a rope secured at the beginning of the climb allowing a climber to self-belay as they advance.  Once the pitch is completed the soloist must descend the rope to retrieve their gear, and then reclimb the pitch.  This form of climbing can be conducted free or as a form of aid climbing.\n\n=== Lead ===\n{{main|Lead climbing}}\n[[File:Joshua Tree - Illusion Dweller 10.jpg|thumb|Leader belays the second on ''Illusion Dweller'' in [[Joshua Tree National Park]], United States.]]\nLead climbing is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends with the rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, rather than through a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses they use a runner and carabiners to clip the rope into intermediate points of protection such as active [[Spring-loaded camming device|cams]], or passive protection such as [[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]; this limits the length of a potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]]. Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.\n\nUnlike top-rope climbing, where the climber is always supported by an anchor located above the climber, lead climbing often involves scenarios where the climber will be attached to a point under him or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much greater than that of top-rope and this is one of the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The [[fall factor]] is the ratio of the height a climber falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before lead climbing on their own.\n\n===Multi-pitch ===\n{{main article|Multi-pitch climbing}}\nThe climbing rope is of a fixed length; the climber can only climb the length of the rope. Routes longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments called pitches; this is known as [[multi-pitch climbing]]. At the top of a pitch, the first climber to ascend (also known as the leader), sets up an anchor and then belays the second climber (also known as the follower) up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route taken by the leader, the second climber removes (\"cleans\") the carabiners and anchors placed along the way in order to use them again on the next pitch. While \"cleaning\" the route, the follower attaches the carabiners and anchors to his or her harness belt loops. Once both climbers are at the top anchor, the leader begins climbing the next pitch, and so on, until the top of the route is reached.\n\nIn either case, upon completion of a route, climbers can walk back down if an alternate descent path exists, or [[abseiling|rappel (abseil)]] down with the rope.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{main|Sport climbing}}\nthe act of climbing single- or multi-pitch routes, protected by permanently-fixed bolts and anchors drilled into the rock, using a rope and the aid of a belayer.\nUnlike traditional rock climbing, sport climbing involves the use of protection (bolts) placed with power drills or on rappel or permanent anchors which are attached to the rock walls. This is separate from bolted trad face climbing.\n\n=== Traditional ===\n{{main|Traditional climbing}}\nTraditional or ''trad'' climbing involves rock climbing routes in which protection against falls is placed by the climber while ascending. In the unusual event bolts are used, these are placed on lead (usually with a manual drill). More commonly removable gear called cams, hexes, and nuts are placed in constrictions or cracks in the rock to protect against falls (in place of bolts) but not to aid the ascent directly. Due to the difficulty of placing bolts on lead, bolts tend to be placed farther apart than on many sport climbs. Once bolted on lead, if repeat ascensions can repeat the route using only the previously placed bolts for protection, the route would then be considered a sport climb, and repeat ascents would be considered to be done in the sport climbing rather than trad climbing style. Routes which are protected by a mixture of preplaced bolts and traditional climbing protection (cams/nuts/hexes) are commonly referred to as \"mixed\" routes, as in a mix of trad and sport climbing. Historically, pitons (a kind of deformable a nail) were placed in constrictions in the rock instead of hexes, nuts and cams. These are difficult to remove and often destructive, resulting in a number of unremovable \"fixed\" pitons on many older traditionally protected routes. These are frequently used in a similar fashion to bolts, although they are not as trustworthy and by convention are not considered when evaluating if a route is a trad climb, sport climb or mixed climb the way bolts might be.\n\n===Top rope===\n[[File:Morialta Toproping.JPG|thumb|[[Top roping]] ''Balthazar'' (12), in the [[Morialta Conservation Park]] near [[Adelaide, South Australia]].  Top roping is the most accessible style of climbing for beginners.]]\nCommonly known as ''top roping'', top rope climbing is climbing in which a climber is belayed from the ground or the base of the route. A belay system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created at the top of a climb, through which the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground ''(position before starting the climb)''. The rope is \"taken-in\", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so in the event of a fall, the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared to that of the belayer, among other things.\n\n===Top belaying===\nBelaying a climber from the top of a route, bringing them up to walk off or continue on to next pitch. A similarly safe system of climbing a route as top-roping, except the belayer has set the anchors at the top of the climb (normally after leading a route, in which case the climber is \"seconding\") to belay the climber either indirectly (belayer is part of the system and can be vulnerable when exposed to unexpected directions of pull and loading of the rope) or directly (belayer is not part of the system and belaying is done directly from the anchors using either an [[Munter hitch|Italian / Munter Hitch]] or adapted use of a belay device), up the route from the top. If bolts have been clipped or traditional gear placements have been made, it is the job of the climber to collect and clean the route.\n\n=== Via ferrata ===\n{{main|Via ferrata}}\nA method of fairly easily ascending a route, heavily dependent on permanent protection rather than using natural rock features to proceed.\n\n[[File:Tuolumne Meadows - Daff Dome - Climber on Guide Cracks - 4.JPG|thumb|Climber with climbing gear attached at his harness]]\n\n== Techniques ==\nDifferent types of rock require different techniques to successfully climb.\n\n=== Crack ===\n{{main|Crack climbing}}\nCrack climbing is a type of rock climbing that ascends cracks and uses specialized climbing techniques. Cracks used in climbing vary in size from the width of a finger to those that fit an entire body. Climbers use techniques such as jamming, laybacking, and stemming. Some climbers use gloves made out of athletic tape to protect their hands.\n\n=== Face ===\n{{main|Face climbing}}\nFace climbing is a type of climbing where climbers use features and irregularities in the rock such as finger pockets and edges to ascend a vertical rock face.\n\n=== Slab ===\n{{main|Slab climbing}}\nSlab climbing is a type of rock climbing where the rock face is at an angle of less steep than vertical. It is characterized by balance- and friction-dependent moves on very small holds.\n\n=== Simul ===\n{{main|Simul climbing}}\nWhen two climbers move at the same time.  The pseudo-lead climber places gear that the pseudo-follower collects.  When the leader runs low on gear they construct a belay station where the follower can join them to exchange gear.  The stronger climber is often the pseudo-follower since a fall by the follower would pull the leader from below towards the last piece of gear\u2014a potentially devastating fall for the leader.  In contrast, a fall from the leader would pull the follower from above, resulting in a less serious fall.  Most speed ascents involve some form of simul climbing but may also include sections of standard free climbing and the use of placed gear for advancement (i.e. partial aid or pulling on gear).\n\n== Grading systems ==\n{{main|Grade (climbing)|Grade (bouldering)}}\nClimbing communities in many countries and regions have developed their own rating systems for routes. Ratings, or grades, record and communicate consensus appraisals of difficulty. Systems of ratings are inherently subjective in nature, and  variation of difficulty can be seen between two climbs of the same grade. Hence, there may be occasional disagreements arising from physiological or stylistic differences among climbers. The practice of rating a climb below its actual difficulty is known as [[Glossary of climbing terms#sandbag|sandbagging]].\n\nThe most commonly used rating systems in the United States are the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] and the Hueco V-scale [[Grade (bouldering)|bouldering grade.]] The current ranges for climbing routes are 5.0 for easy beginner routes to 5.15 being world class and V0\u2013V16, respectively. As the limit of human climbing ability has not yet been reached, neither grading system has a definite endpoint and they are thus subject to revision.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luebben|first=Craig|title=Rock Climbing:  Mastering Basic Skills|year=2004|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89886-743-5|pages=286\u2013287}}</ref>\n[[File:Climbing ratings.png|thumb|Climbing grades simplified. There are many other grades but these are the most used.]]\nThe ratings take into account multiple factors affecting a route, such as the slope of the ascent, the quantity and quality of available handholds, the distance between holds, ease of placing protection and whether advanced technical maneuvers are required. Typically the rating for the hardest move on the wall will be the rating for the whole climb. While height of a route is generally not considered a factor, a long series of sustained hard moves will often merit a higher grade than a single move of the same technical difficulty. For example,  a climb with multiple 5.11 moves with no rests may thus be rated a 5.12.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{main|Glossary of climbing terms}}\nAs climbing routes or problems increase in difficulty, climbers learn to develop skills that help them complete the climbs clean. There are several techniques for hands and feet as well as terms for motions that combine the two. For indoor gyms, route setters visualize and create routes for climbers, placing different kinds of holds in specific parts of the wall at particular angles because they intend climbers to use certain techniques.\n\n== Environments ==\n[[File:Female student climbing.JPG|thumb|An indoor climbing wall]]\n\n=== Indoor ===\n{{main|Indoor climbing}}\nIndoor climbing occurs in buildings on artificial rock structures. This permits for climbing in all types of weather and at all times of the day. Climbers climb indoors to improve their skills and techniques, as well as for general exercise or fun. Indoor climbing gyms typically provide rope setups and ensure that new climbers know safe techniques.\n\n===Outdoor===\nOutdoors, climbs usually take place on sunny days when the holds are dry and provide the best grip, but climbers can also attempt to climb at night or in adverse weather conditions if they have the proper training and equipment. However, night climbing or climbing in adverse weather conditions will increase the difficulty and danger on any climbing route.\n\n== Equipment ==\n{{Main|Rock-climbing equipment}}\n\nMost climbers choose to wear specialized rubber climbing [[Climbing shoe|shoes]] which are often of a smaller size than their normal street shoes in order to improve sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage.  [[MgCO3|Climbing chalk (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)]] is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use [[Protection (climbing)|protection]]. The most basic protective equipment is a [[climbing rope]]. Climbing [[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]] would attach the rope to themselves; in the event of a fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized [[climbing harness|harnesses]], [[carabiners]] which are used for clipping into belay and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and [[belay device]]s which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]] with the use of [[quickdraws]] led to the rise of [[sport climbing]]. [[Traditional climbers]] developed the [[spring-loaded camming device]], which allowed a wider variety of climbing styles to be adequately protected compared to [[Chock (climbing)|chocks]] and [[Hexes (climbing)|hexes]]. Traditionally [[Piton|pitons]] were used however in most areas protection which damages the rock is discouraged. Most climbers choose to wear a specialized [[climbing helmet]] to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.<ref>Luebben, Craig, Rock Climbing: Mastering Basic Skills, 2004, Washington.  {{ISBN|0-89886-743-6}}</ref>\n\n== Injuries ==\n{{main|Climbing injuries}}\n\nInjuries in rock climbing are mainly [[sports injuries]] that occur due to falls or overuse. Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; the vast majority of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders.<ref>{{cite book |title=Training for Climbing: The Definitive Guide to Improving Your Climbing |last=H\u00f6rst |first=Erik J. |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Falcon Publishing |location=Guilford, Connecticut, Helena, Montana |isbn=0-7627-2313-0 |page=151 |pages= |url=http://www.trainingforclimbing.com/ |accessdate=}}</ref> Such injuries are often no worse than torn [[callus]]es, cuts, burns and bruises. There are a number of skincare products specifically for climbers available in the market. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage especially to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and capsules.\n\n== Site access ==\n\n=== Indigenous cultural considerations ===\nSome areas that are popular for climbing, for example in the United States and Australia, are also sacred places for indigenous peoples.  Many such indigenous people would prefer that climbers not climb these sacred places and have made this information well known to climbers.  A well-known example is the rock formation that Americans have named [[Devils Tower National Monument]].<ref>{{Cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223095918/http://www.nps.gov/archive/deto/deto_climbing/detosumm.html |archivedate=23 February 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/deto/deto_climbing/detosumm.html |title=Devils Tower National Monument Final Climbing Management Plan |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service |author=Rocky Mountain Region |date=February 1995 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> Native American cultural concerns also led to complete climbing closures at Cave Rock at [[Lake Tahoe]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/projects/cave-rock/ |title=Cave Rock Climbing Closure Becomes Permanent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019072351/http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/projects/cave-rock/ |archivedate=19 October 2008 |date=17 February 2008 |publisher=United States Forest Service |author=Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> [[Monument Valley]], [[Shiprock]] and [[Canyon de Chelly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorp.away.com/gorp/books/excerpts/ship.htm |title=Climbing Shiprock: Going Up On Native Land |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219030917/http://gorp.away.com/gorp/books/excerpts/ship.htm |archivedate=19 February 2008 |author=Cameron M. Burns |publisher=GORP |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nClimbing activities can sometimes encroach on [[rock art]] sites created by various Native American cultures and early European explorers and settlers. The potential threat to these resources has led to climbing restrictions and closures in places like [[Hueco Tanks]], [[Texas]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huecotanks.com/TPWD/TPWDdraft2.htm |title=Review of the Public Use Plan for Hueco Tanks SHP |author=Texas Park and Wildlife Department |date=December 1999 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> and portions of [[City of Rocks National Reserve]], [[Idaho]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the monolith [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) is sacred to local indigenous communities and climbing is banned on anything but [[Uluru#Climbing|the established ascent route]] (and even then climbing is discouraged, and soon to be discontinued).\n\nIndigenous peoples are not the only cultures that object to climbing on certain rock formations. Professional climber [[Dean Potter]] kicked off a major controversy when he ignored long-accepted convention to scale [[Delicate Arch]] in 2006, resulting in strict new climbing regulation in [[Arches National Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2010/07/arches-national-park-developing-formal-climbing-canyoneering-management-plan6224 |title=Arches National Park Developing Formal Climbing and Canyoneering Plan |author=Kurt Repanshek |date=15 July 2010 |publisher=National Parks Traveler |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Private property ===\nMany significant rock [[outcrop]]s exist on private land. Some people within the rock climbing [[community]] have been guilty of [[trespassing]] in many cases, often after land ownership transfers and previous access permission is withdrawn. In the U.S. the climbing community responded to access closures by forming the [[Access Fund]]. This is an \"advocacy organization that keeps U.S. climbing areas open and conserves the climbing environment. Five core programs support the mission on national and local levels: public policy, stewardship and conservation (including grants), grassroots activism, climber education and land acquisition.\"<ref>[http://www.accessfund.org/ The Access Fund]</ref> In the U.K. the [[British Mountaineering Council]] represents climbers and their interest of public access to crags, cliffs and boulders.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\n{{main|Clean climbing}}\n\nAlthough many climbers adhere to \"minimal impact\" and \"[[leave no trace]]\" practices, rock climbing is sometimes damaging to the environment.  Common environmental damages include: soil [[erosion]], breaking rock features, chalk accumulation, litter, abandoned bolts and ropes, human excrement, introduction of foreign plants through seeds on shoes and clothing, as well as damage to native plant species (especially those growing in cracks and on ledges as these are often intentionally removed during new route development through a process commonly referred to as ''cleaning)''.\n\n[[Clean climbing]] is a style of rock climbing which seeks to minimize some of the aesthetically damaging side effects of some techniques used in [[trad climbing]] and more often, [[aid climbing]] by avoiding using equipment such as pitons, which damage rock.\n\nClimbing can also interfere with [[Bird of prey|raptor]] nesting since the two activities often take place on the same precipitous cliffs. Many climbing area land managers institute nesting season closures of [[cliff]]s known to be used by protected [[birds of prey]] like [[eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s and [[osprey]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://flatironsclimbing.net/climbing/wildlife.php |title=Flatirons Climbing, wildlife closures |access-date=2008-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205034504/http://flatironsclimbing.net/climbing/wildlife.php |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMany non-climbers also object to the appearance of climbing chalk marks, anchors, bolts and slings on visible cliffs. Since these features are small, visual impacts can be mitigated through the selection of neutral, rock-matching colors for bolt hangers, webbing and chalk. The use of certain types of climbing gear is banned altogether at some [[Cliff|crags]] due to the risk of damage to the rock face. In such cases,  climbers use knotted slings and ropes for [[climbing protection]].\n\nBlowtorching is another climbing induced impact that affects the rocks themselves. Blowtorching is when a climber uses a blowtorch to dry holds on a wet route. This mainly happens in areas that tend to have wet climbing conditions. Blowtorching is not only detrimental to the rock itself and can have permanent damage but it also leaves a very large burn mark that most non-climbers would object to the appearance of.\n\n=== Vandalism ===\nThe most significant form of vandalism directly attributable to rock climbers is the alteration of the climbing surface to render it more climber-friendly.\n\nWith the advent of hard, bolted [[sport climbing]] in the 1980s, many routes were \"chipped\" and \"glued\" to provide additional features, allowing them to be climbed at the standard of the day. This attitude quickly changed as the safer sport climbing technique allowed climbers to push hard without much risk, causing the formerly more-or-less fixed grades to steadily rise. Altering routes began to be seen as limiting and pointless.\n\nUnlike [[traditional climbing]] which generally uses protection only as a backup in case of falls, some forms of climbing\u2014like [[sport climbing]], [[canyoneering]] or, especially, [[aid climbing]]\u2014rely heavily on artificial protection to advance, either by frequent falls or by directly pulling on the gear. Often these types of climbing involve multiple drilled holes in which to place temporary bolts and rivets, but in recent years an emphasis on clean techniques has grown.\n\nToday, the charge of [[vandalism]] in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]] and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in the difference between life and death. But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure for long periods of time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations such that fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements led to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act.<ref>Dolan, Timothy. \"Fixed Anchors and the Wilderness Act: Is the Adventure Over.\" University of San Francisco Law Review 34.2 (2000): 355-378.</ref> Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore do not require as much protection.{{Clarify|date=January 2015|reason=The last part about not requiring as much protection seems to conflict with common sense}} Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form.{{POV statement|date=August 2014}} Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like [[Yosemite National Park]], many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Climbing|Mountains}}\n* Lists and glossaries\n** [[List of climbers]]\n** [[List of climbing topics]]\n** [[Deaf climbers]]\n** [[:Category:Climbing organizations|Climbing organizations]]\n** [[Glossary of knots common in climbing]]\n* Related activities\n** [[Outdoor education]]\n** [[Salto del pastor]] (aboriginal rock [[gymnastic]] sport of [[Canary Islands]])\n** [[International Federation of Sport Climbing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Sister project links|v=no|s=no|n=no|q=no|voy=Rock climbing}}\n* {{cite book |author=Long, John |title=How to Rock Climb!

The goal is to reach the [[Summit (topography)|summit]] of a formation or the endpoint of a usually pre-defined [[Climbing route|route]] without falling. Rock climbing is a physically and mentally demanding sport, one that often tests a climber's strength, endurance, agility and balance along with mental control. Knowledge of proper [[climbing technique]]s and use of specialized [[climbing equipment]] is crucial for the safe completion of routes. \n\nBecause of the wide range and variety of rock formations around the world, rock climbing has been separated into several different styles and sub-disciplines, <ref name=freedom>{{cite book |title=[[Mountaineering: The Freedom of the Hills]] |publisher=Swan Hill Press |author=The Mountaineers Books |edition=8th |year=2010 |isbn=9781594851384 |oclc=688611213 |pages=592 }}</ref> such as [[scrambling]], another activity involving the scaling of hills and similar formations, [[wikt:differentiation|differentiated]] by rock climbing's sustained use of hands to support the climber's weight as well as to provide balance.\n\nProfessional rock [[climbing competitions]] have the objectives of either completing the route in the quickest possible time or attaining the farthest point on an increasingly difficult route.\n\n== History of rock climbing == \n{{main|History of rock climbing}}\n[[File:Fotothek df ps 0002300 Sport ^ Klettersport.jpg|thumb|Climbing in Germany, circa 1965.]]\n\nPaintings dating from 200 BC show [[Chinese people|Chinese]] men rock climbing. In early America, the cliff-dwelling [[Anasazi]] in the 12th century are thought to have been excellent climbers. Early [[Europe]]an climbers used rock climbing techniques as a skill required to reach the summit in their [[mountaineering]] exploits. In the 1880s, European rock climbing became an independent pursuit outside of mountain climbing.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Timothy W. Kidd |first2=Jennifer |last2=Hazelrigs |title=Rock Climbing |year=2009 |publisher=Human Kinetics 10% |isbn=9781450409001 |page=4}}</ref>\n\nAlthough rock climbing was an important component of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[mountaineering]] in the [[Alps]], it is generally thought that the sport of rock climbing began in the last quarter of the nineteenth century in various parts of [[Europe]]. Rock climbing evolved gradually from an alpine necessity to a distinct athletic activity.\n\n[[Aid climbing]], climbing using equipment that acts as artificial handhold or footholds, became popular during the period 1920\u20131960, leading to ascents in the [[Alps]] and in [[Yosemite Valley]] that were considered impossible without such means. However, climbing techniques, equipment and ethical considerations have evolved steadily.  Today, [[free climbing]], climbing using holds made entirely of natural rock while using gear solely for protection and not for upward movement, is the most popular form of the sport. Free climbing has since been divided into several [[Climbing styles|sub-styles of climbing]] dependent on [[belaying|belay]] configuration.\n\nOver time, [[Grade (climbing)|grading systems]] have also been created in order to compare more accurately the relative difficulties of the rock climbs.\n\n== Style ==\nIn ''How to Rock Climb'', [[John Long (climber)|John Long]] notes that for moderately skilled climbers simply getting to the top of a route is not enough; how one gets to the top matters.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Long |first=John |authorlink=John Long (climber) |title=How to Rock Climb |page=155 |year=2004 |publisher=Globe Pequot |isbn=9780762724710}}</ref> Within free climbing, there are distinctions given to ascents: [[on-sight]], [[flash (climbing)|flash]], and [[redpoint (climbing)|redpoint]]. To on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. Flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the [[Beta_(climbing)|beta]] with other climbers. Redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first tried it.<ref>{{Cite book |last1=Kidd |first1=Timothy W.

Free climbing is typically divided into several styles that differ from one another depending on the choice of equipment used and the configurations of their belay, rope and [[Anchor (climbing)|anchor]] systems.\n\nAs routes get higher off the ground, the increased risk of life-threatening injuries necessitates additional safety measures.  A variety of specialized [[climbing techniques]] and [[climbing equipment]] exists to provide that safety.  Climbers will usually work in pairs and utilize a system of ropes and [[Anchor (climbing)|anchors]] designed to catch falls.  Ropes and anchors can be configured in different ways to suit many styles of climbing, and roped climbing are thus divided into further sub-types that vary based on how their [[belay]] systems are set up.  Generally speaking, beginners will start with [[top roping]] and/or easy [[bouldering]] and work their way up to [[lead climbing]] and beyond.\n\nDue to the length of time and extended endurance required, and because accidents are most likely to happen on the descent, rock climbers do not usually climb back down the route, or \"downclimb\", especially on the larger multiple [[Pitch (ascent/descent)|pitch]] class III\u2013IV, or multi-day [[Grade (climbing)|grade]] IV\u2013VI climbs.\n\n=== Aid ===\n{{main|Aid climbing}}\nStill the most popular method of climbing big walls, aid climbers make progress up a wall by repeatedly placing and weighting gear that is used directly to aid ascent and enhance safety. This form of climbing is typically used when ascent is too technically difficult or impossible for free climbing.\n\n[[File:Under a roof.jpg|thumb|left|Man sport climbing under overhang]]\n\n=== Free ===\n{{main|Free climbing}}\nThe most commonly used method to ascend climbs refers to climbs where the climber's own physical strength and skill are relied upon to accomplish the climb. Free climbing may rely on top rope belay systems, or on lead climbing to establish protection and the belay stations. Anchors, ropes and protection are used to back up the climber and are passive as opposed to active ascending aids. Sub-types of free climbing are [[trad climbing]] and [[sport climbing]]. Free climbing is generally done as \"clean lead\" meaning no pitons or pins are used as protection.<ref>{{cite book |title=Traditional Lead Climbing: A Rock Climber's Guide to Taking the Sharp End of the Rope |first=Heidi |last=Pesterfield |edition=2nd |publisher=Wilderness Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780899975597 |page=11}}</ref>\n\n=== Bouldering ===\n[[File:Joshua Tree bouldering - Stem Gem 2.jpg|thumb|Bouldering in [[Joshua Tree National Park]], [[United States]]]]\n{{main|Bouldering}}\nClimbing on short, low routes without the use of the safety rope that is typical of most other styles.  Protection, if used at all, typically consists of a cushioned [[bouldering pad]] below the route and a spotter, a person who watches from below and directs the fall of the climber away from hazardous areas. Bouldering may be an arena for intense and relatively safe competition, resulting in exceptionally high difficulty standards.\n\n=== Solo ===\n{{main|Solo climbing}}Solo climbing, or soloing, is a style of [[climbing]] in which the climber climbs alone, without the assistance of a [[Belaying|belay]].\n\n==== Deep-water solo (DWS) ====\n{{main|Deep-water soloing}}\nDeep-water soloing (or psicobloc) is similar to free soloing in that the climber is unprotected and without a rope, but should the climber fall, it is into deep water instead of onto the ground.\n\n==== Free solo ====\n{{main|Free soloing}}\nFree soloing, referred to as \"soloing\" in the UK, is single-person climbing without the use of any rope or protection system.  If a fall occurs and the climber is not over water (as in the case of [[deep water soloing]]), the climber is likely to be killed or seriously injured.  Though technically similar to bouldering, free solo climbing typically refers to routes that are far taller and/or far more lethal than bouldering. The term \"highball\" is used to refer to climbing on the boundary between free soloing and bouldering, where what is usually climbed as a boulder problem may be high enough for a fall to cause serious injury (20&nbsp;ft. and higher) and hence could also be considered to be a free solo.\n\n==== Roped solo ====\n{{main|Roped solo climbing}}\nSolo climbing with a rope secured at the beginning of the climb allowing a climber to self-belay as they advance.  Once the pitch is completed the soloist must descend the rope to retrieve their gear, and then reclimb the pitch.  This form of climbing can be conducted free or as a form of aid climbing.\n\n=== Lead ===\n{{main|Lead climbing}}\n[[File:Joshua Tree - Illusion Dweller 10.jpg|thumb|Leader belays the second on ''Illusion Dweller'' in [[Joshua Tree National Park]], United States.]]\nLead climbing is a climbing technique. The lead climber ascends with the rope passing through intermittent anchors that are below them, rather than through a top anchor, as in a top-roped climb. A partner belays from below the lead climber, by feeding out enough rope to allow upward progression without undue slack. As the leader progresses they use a runner and carabiners to clip the rope into intermediate points of protection such as active [[Spring-loaded camming device|cams]], or passive protection such as [[Nut (climbing)|nuts]]; this limits the length of a potential fall. The leader also may clip into pre-placed [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]]. Indoor gyms might have short runners pre-attached to fixed anchor points in the wall.\n\nUnlike top-rope climbing, where the climber is always supported by an anchor located above the climber, lead climbing often involves scenarios where the climber will be attached to a point under him or her. In these cases, if the climber were to fall, the distance fallen would be much greater than that of top-rope and this is one of the main reasons lead climbing can be dangerous. The [[fall factor]] is the ratio of the height a climber falls and the length of rope available to absorb the fall. The higher the fall factor, the more force placed on the climber as the ropes decelerates them. The maximum fall factor is 2. It is often advised that climbers who are interested in lead climbing should learn from experienced climbers and participate in training sessions before lead climbing on their own.\n\n===Multi-pitch ===\n{{main article|Multi-pitch climbing}}\nThe climbing rope is of a fixed length; the climber can only climb the length of the rope. Routes longer than the rope length are broken up into several segments called pitches; this is known as [[multi-pitch climbing]]. At the top of a pitch, the first climber to ascend (also known as the leader), sets up an anchor and then belays the second climber (also known as the follower) up to the anchor; as the second climber follows the route taken by the leader, the second climber removes (\"cleans\") the carabiners and anchors placed along the way in order to use them again on the next pitch. While \"cleaning\" the route, the follower attaches the carabiners and anchors to his or her harness belt loops. Once both climbers are at the top anchor, the leader begins climbing the next pitch, and so on, until the top of the route is reached.\n\nIn either case, upon completion of a route, climbers can walk back down if an alternate descent path exists, or [[abseiling|rappel (abseil)]] down with the rope.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{main|Sport climbing}}\nthe act of climbing single- or multi-pitch routes, protected by permanently-fixed bolts and anchors drilled into the rock, using a rope and the aid of a belayer.\nUnlike traditional rock climbing, sport climbing involves the use of protection (bolts) placed with power drills or on rappel or permanent anchors which are attached to the rock walls. This is separate from bolted trad face climbing.\n\n=== Traditional ===\n{{main|Traditional climbing}}\nTraditional or ''trad'' climbing involves rock climbing routes in which protection against falls is placed by the climber while ascending. In the unusual event bolts are used, these are placed on lead (usually with a manual drill). More commonly removable gear called cams, hexes, and nuts are placed in constrictions or cracks in the rock to protect against falls (in place of bolts) but not to aid the ascent directly. Due to the difficulty of placing bolts on lead, bolts tend to be placed farther apart than on many sport climbs. Once bolted on lead, if repeat ascensions can repeat the route using only the previously placed bolts for protection, the route would then be considered a sport climb, and repeat ascents would be considered to be done in the sport climbing rather than trad climbing style. Routes which are protected by a mixture of preplaced bolts and traditional climbing protection (cams/nuts/hexes) are commonly referred to as \"mixed\" routes, as in a mix of trad and sport climbing. Historically, pitons (a kind of deformable a nail) were placed in constrictions in the rock instead of hexes, nuts and cams. These are difficult to remove and often destructive, resulting in a number of unremovable \"fixed\" pitons on many older traditionally protected routes. These are frequently used in a similar fashion to bolts, although they are not as trustworthy and by convention are not considered when evaluating if a route is a trad climb, sport climb or mixed climb the way bolts might be.\n\n===Top rope===\n[[File:Morialta Toproping.JPG|thumb|[[Top roping]] ''Balthazar'' (12), in the [[Morialta Conservation Park]] near [[Adelaide, South Australia]].  Top roping is the most accessible style of climbing for beginners.]]\nCommonly known as ''top roping'', top rope climbing is climbing in which a climber is belayed from the ground or the base of the route. A belay system resembling a pulley in which an anchor has been created at the top of a climb, through which the rope runs through from the belayer on the ground, to the climber on the ground ''(position before starting the climb)''. The rope is \"taken-in\", to clear up the slack as the climber moves upwards, so in the event of a fall, the climber falls the shortest distance possible. The length of a fall is normally no more than a meter, but can vary depending on the length of the route (the longer the rope, the more stretch the rope will undergo when weighted) and the weight of the climber compared to that of the belayer, among other things.\n\n===Top belaying===\nBelaying a climber from the top of a route, bringing them up to walk off or continue on to next pitch. A similarly safe system of climbing a route as top-roping, except the belayer has set the anchors at the top of the climb (normally after leading a route, in which case the climber is \"seconding\") to belay the climber either indirectly (belayer is part of the system and can be vulnerable when exposed to unexpected directions of pull and loading of the rope) or directly (belayer is not part of the system and belaying is done directly from the anchors using either an [[Munter hitch|Italian / Munter Hitch]] or adapted use of a belay device), up the route from the top. If bolts have been clipped or traditional gear placements have been made, it is the job of the climber to collect and clean the route.\n\n=== Via ferrata ===\n{{main|Via ferrata}}\nA method of fairly easily ascending a route, heavily dependent on permanent protection rather than using natural rock features to proceed.\n\n[[File:Tuolumne Meadows - Daff Dome - Climber on Guide Cracks - 4.JPG|thumb|Climber with climbing gear attached at his harness]]\n\n== Techniques ==\nDifferent types of rock require different techniques to successfully climb.\n\n=== Crack ===\n{{main|Crack climbing}}\nCrack climbing is a type of rock climbing that ascends cracks and uses specialized climbing techniques. Cracks used in climbing vary in size from the width of a finger to those that fit an entire body. Climbers use techniques such as jamming, laybacking, and stemming. Some climbers use gloves made out of athletic tape to protect their hands.\n\n=== Face ===\n{{main|Face climbing}}\nFace climbing is a type of climbing where climbers use features and irregularities in the rock such as finger pockets and edges to ascend a vertical rock face.\n\n=== Slab ===\n{{main|Slab climbing}}\nSlab climbing is a type of rock climbing where the rock face is at an angle of less steep than vertical. It is characterized by balance- and friction-dependent moves on very small holds.\n\n=== Simul ===\n{{main|Simul climbing}}\nWhen two climbers move at the same time.  The pseudo-lead climber places gear that the pseudo-follower collects.  When the leader runs low on gear they construct a belay station where the follower can join them to exchange gear.  The stronger climber is often the pseudo-follower since a fall by the follower would pull the leader from below towards the last piece of gear\u2014a potentially devastating fall for the leader.  In contrast, a fall from the leader would pull the follower from above, resulting in a less serious fall.  Most speed ascents involve some form of simul climbing but may also include sections of standard free climbing and the use of placed gear for advancement (i.e. partial aid or pulling on gear).\n\n== Grading systems ==\n{{main|Grade (climbing)|Grade (bouldering)}}\nClimbing communities in many countries and regions have developed their own rating systems for routes. Ratings, or grades, record and communicate consensus appraisals of difficulty. Systems of ratings are inherently subjective in nature, and  variation of difficulty can be seen between two climbs of the same grade. Hence, there may be occasional disagreements arising from physiological or stylistic differences among climbers. The practice of rating a climb below its actual difficulty is known as [[Glossary of climbing terms#sandbag|sandbagging]].\n\nThe most commonly used rating systems in the United States are the [[Yosemite Decimal System]] and the Hueco V-scale [[Grade (bouldering)|bouldering grade.]] The current ranges for climbing routes are 5.0 for easy beginner routes to 5.15 being world class and V0\u2013V16, respectively. As the limit of human climbing ability has not yet been reached, neither grading system has a definite endpoint and they are thus subject to revision.<ref>{{cite book|last=Luebben|first=Craig|title=Rock Climbing:  Mastering Basic Skills|year=2004|publisher=The Mountaineers Books|location=Washington|isbn=978-0-89886-743-5|pages=286\u2013287}}</ref>\n[[File:Climbing ratings.png|thumb|Climbing grades simplified. There are many other grades but these are the most used.]]\nThe ratings take into account multiple factors affecting a route, such as the slope of the ascent, the quantity and quality of available handholds, the distance between holds, ease of placing protection and whether advanced technical maneuvers are required. Typically the rating for the hardest move on the wall will be the rating for the whole climb. While height of a route is generally not considered a factor, a long series of sustained hard moves will often merit a higher grade than a single move of the same technical difficulty. For example,  a climb with multiple 5.11 moves with no rests may thus be rated a 5.12.\n\n== Terminology ==\n{{main|Glossary of climbing terms}}\nAs climbing routes or problems increase in difficulty, climbers learn to develop skills that help them complete the climbs clean. There are several techniques for hands and feet as well as terms for motions that combine the two. For indoor gyms, route setters visualize and create routes for climbers, placing different kinds of holds in specific parts of the wall at particular angles because they intend climbers to use certain techniques.\n\n== Environments ==\n[[File:Female student climbing.JPG|thumb|An indoor climbing wall]]\n\n=== Indoor ===\n{{main|Indoor climbing}}\nIndoor climbing occurs in buildings on artificial rock structures. This permits for climbing in all types of weather and at all times of the day. Climbers climb indoors to improve their skills and techniques, as well as for general exercise or fun. Indoor climbing gyms typically provide rope setups and ensure that new climbers know safe techniques.\n\n===Outdoor===\nOutdoors, climbs usually take place on sunny days when the holds are dry and provide the best grip, but climbers can also attempt to climb at night or in adverse weather conditions if they have the proper training and equipment. However, night climbing or climbing in adverse weather conditions will increase the difficulty and danger on any climbing route.\n\n== Equipment ==\n{{Main|Rock-climbing equipment}}\n\nMost climbers choose to wear specialized rubber climbing [[Climbing shoe|shoes]] which are often of a smaller size than their normal street shoes in order to improve sensitivity towards foot placements and use the tightness to their advantage.  [[MgCO3|Climbing chalk (MgCO<sub>3</sub>)]] is commonly used as a drying agent to minimize sweating of the hands. Most other equipment is of a protective nature. Rock climbing is inherently dangerous, so to minimize the potential consequences resulting from a fall, climbers use [[Protection (climbing)|protection]]. The most basic protective equipment is a [[climbing rope]]. Climbing [[wikt:pioneer|pioneers]] would attach the rope to themselves; in the event of a fall, the rope would usually cause injury to the climber in the hope that it prevented death. With advances in technology came the development of specialized [[climbing harness|harnesses]], [[carabiners]] which are used for clipping into belay and rappel anchors and connecting gear, and [[belay device]]s which are used to catch a falling climber, hold or lower a climber and for rappelling. Eventually, the placement of [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]] with the use of [[quickdraws]] led to the rise of [[sport climbing]]. [[Traditional climbers]] developed the [[spring-loaded camming device]], which allowed a wider variety of climbing styles to be adequately protected compared to [[Chock (climbing)|chocks]] and [[Hexes (climbing)|hexes]]. Traditionally [[Piton|pitons]] were used however in most areas protection which damages the rock is discouraged. Most climbers choose to wear a specialized [[climbing helmet]] to protect them from falling rocks or equipment or head injuries from crashing into rocks.<ref>Luebben, Craig, Rock Climbing: Mastering Basic Skills, 2004, Washington.  {{ISBN|0-89886-743-6}}</ref>\n\n== Injuries ==\n{{main|Climbing injuries}}\n\nInjuries in rock climbing are mainly [[sports injuries]] that occur due to falls or overuse. Injuries due to falls are relatively uncommon; the vast majority of injuries result from overuse, most often occurring in the fingers, elbows, and shoulders.<ref>{{cite book |title=Training for Climbing: The Definitive Guide to Improving Your Climbing |last=H\u00f6rst |first=Erik J. |coauthors= |year=2003 |publisher=Falcon Publishing |location=Guilford, Connecticut, Helena, Montana |isbn=0-7627-2313-0 |page=151 |pages= |url=http://www.trainingforclimbing.com/ |accessdate=}}</ref> Such injuries are often no worse than torn [[callus]]es, cuts, burns and bruises. There are a number of skincare products specifically for climbers available in the market. However, overuse symptoms, if ignored, may lead to permanent damage especially to tendons, tendon sheaths, ligaments, and capsules.\n\n== Site access ==\n\n=== Indigenous cultural considerations ===\nSome areas that are popular for climbing, for example in the United States and Australia, are also sacred places for indigenous peoples.  Many such indigenous people would prefer that climbers not climb these sacred places and have made this information well known to climbers.  A well-known example is the rock formation that Americans have named [[Devils Tower National Monument]].<ref>{{Cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080223095918/http://www.nps.gov/archive/deto/deto_climbing/detosumm.html |archivedate=23 February 2008 |url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/deto/deto_climbing/detosumm.html |title=Devils Tower National Monument Final Climbing Management Plan |publisher=U.S. Department of the Interior National Park Service |author=Rocky Mountain Region |date=February 1995 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> Native American cultural concerns also led to complete climbing closures at Cave Rock at [[Lake Tahoe]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/projects/cave-rock/ |title=Cave Rock Climbing Closure Becomes Permanent |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081019072351/http://www.fs.fed.us/r5/ltbmu/projects/cave-rock/ |archivedate=19 October 2008 |date=17 February 2008 |publisher=United States Forest Service |author=Lake Tahoe Basin Management Unit |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> [[Monument Valley]], [[Shiprock]] and [[Canyon de Chelly]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gorp.away.com/gorp/books/excerpts/ship.htm |title=Climbing Shiprock: Going Up On Native Land |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080219030917/http://gorp.away.com/gorp/books/excerpts/ship.htm |archivedate=19 February 2008 |author=Cameron M. Burns |publisher=GORP |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\nClimbing activities can sometimes encroach on [[rock art]] sites created by various Native American cultures and early European explorers and settlers. The potential threat to these resources has led to climbing restrictions and closures in places like [[Hueco Tanks]], [[Texas]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.huecotanks.com/TPWD/TPWDdraft2.htm |title=Review of the Public Use Plan for Hueco Tanks SHP |author=Texas Park and Wildlife Department |date=December 1999 |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref> and portions of [[City of Rocks National Reserve]], [[Idaho]].\n\nIn [[Australia]], the monolith [[Uluru]] (Ayers Rock) is sacred to local indigenous communities and climbing is banned on anything but [[Uluru#Climbing|the established ascent route]] (and even then climbing is discouraged, and soon to be discontinued).\n\nIndigenous peoples are not the only cultures that object to climbing on certain rock formations. Professional climber [[Dean Potter]] kicked off a major controversy when he ignored long-accepted convention to scale [[Delicate Arch]] in 2006, resulting in strict new climbing regulation in [[Arches National Park]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalparkstraveler.com/2010/07/arches-national-park-developing-formal-climbing-canyoneering-management-plan6224 |title=Arches National Park Developing Formal Climbing and Canyoneering Plan |author=Kurt Repanshek |date=15 July 2010 |publisher=National Parks Traveler |accessdate=19 February 2013}}</ref>\n\n=== Private property ===\nMany significant rock [[outcrop]]s exist on private land. Some people within the rock climbing [[community]] have been guilty of [[trespassing]] in many cases, often after land ownership transfers and previous access permission is withdrawn. In the U.S. the climbing community responded to access closures by forming the [[Access Fund]]. This is an \"advocacy organization that keeps U.S. climbing areas open and conserves the climbing environment. Five core programs support the mission on national and local levels: public policy, stewardship and conservation (including grants), grassroots activism, climber education and land acquisition.\"<ref>[http://www.accessfund.org/ The Access Fund]</ref> In the U.K. the [[British Mountaineering Council]] represents climbers and their interest of public access to crags, cliffs and boulders.\n\n== Environmental impact ==\n{{main|Clean climbing}}\n\nAlthough many climbers adhere to \"minimal impact\" and \"[[leave no trace]]\" practices, rock climbing is sometimes damaging to the environment.  Common environmental damages include: soil [[erosion]], breaking rock features, chalk accumulation, litter, abandoned bolts and ropes, human excrement, introduction of foreign plants through seeds on shoes and clothing, as well as damage to native plant species (especially those growing in cracks and on ledges as these are often intentionally removed during new route development through a process commonly referred to as ''cleaning)''.\n\n[[Clean climbing]] is a style of rock climbing which seeks to minimize some of the aesthetically damaging side effects of some techniques used in [[trad climbing]] and more often, [[aid climbing]] by avoiding using equipment such as pitons, which damage rock.\n\nClimbing can also interfere with [[Bird of prey|raptor]] nesting since the two activities often take place on the same precipitous cliffs. Many climbing area land managers institute nesting season closures of [[cliff]]s known to be used by protected [[birds of prey]] like [[eagle]]s, [[falcon]]s and [[osprey]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://flatironsclimbing.net/climbing/wildlife.php |title=Flatirons Climbing, wildlife closures |access-date=2008-07-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205034504/http://flatironsclimbing.net/climbing/wildlife.php |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nMany non-climbers also object to the appearance of climbing chalk marks, anchors, bolts and slings on visible cliffs. Since these features are small, visual impacts can be mitigated through the selection of neutral, rock-matching colors for bolt hangers, webbing and chalk. The use of certain types of climbing gear is banned altogether at some [[Cliff|crags]] due to the risk of damage to the rock face. In such cases,  climbers use knotted slings and ropes for [[climbing protection]].\n\nBlowtorching is another climbing induced impact that affects the rocks themselves. Blowtorching is when a climber uses a blowtorch to dry holds on a wet route. This mainly happens in areas that tend to have wet climbing conditions. Blowtorching is not only detrimental to the rock itself and can have permanent damage but it also leaves a very large burn mark that most non-climbers would object to the appearance of.\n\n=== Vandalism ===\nThe most significant form of vandalism directly attributable to rock climbers is the alteration of the climbing surface to render it more climber-friendly.\n\nWith the advent of hard, bolted [[sport climbing]] in the 1980s, many routes were \"chipped\" and \"glued\" to provide additional features, allowing them to be climbed at the standard of the day. This attitude quickly changed as the safer sport climbing technique allowed climbers to push hard without much risk, causing the formerly more-or-less fixed grades to steadily rise. Altering routes began to be seen as limiting and pointless.\n\nUnlike [[traditional climbing]] which generally uses protection only as a backup in case of falls, some forms of climbing\u2014like [[sport climbing]], [[canyoneering]] or, especially, [[aid climbing]]\u2014rely heavily on artificial protection to advance, either by frequent falls or by directly pulling on the gear. Often these types of climbing involve multiple drilled holes in which to place temporary bolts and rivets, but in recent years an emphasis on clean techniques has grown.\n\nToday, the charge of [[vandalism]] in climbing is more often a disagreement about the appropriateness of drilling and placing permanent [[Bolt (climbing)|bolts]] and other anchors. Although new fixed anchors are rarely placed by climbers, their dependency on the existing fixed anchors results in the difference between life and death. But the existing anchors remain on the climbing structure for long periods of time, changing the dynamic of the structure itself. Due to the permanent impact of the fixed anchors in wilderness areas, it was prohibited by the Wilderness Act. However, in 1990, there was a movement by the Forest Service and the Task Group to change the regulations such that fixed anchors would be allowed but still regulated in wilderness areas. These improvements led to protection for both the climbers and the Wilderness Act.<ref>Dolan, Timothy. \"Fixed Anchors and the Wilderness Act: Is the Adventure Over.\" University of San Francisco Law Review 34.2 (2000): 355-378.</ref> Typically in the USA, the first ascensionists decide where to place protection on a new route and later climbers are supposed to live with these choices.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} This can cause friction and retro-bolting when the route is perceived to be dangerous to climbers who actually lead at the grade of the climb, since the first ascensionists often lead at a higher grade and therefore do not require as much protection.{{Clarify|date=January 2015|reason=The last part about not requiring as much protection seems to conflict with common sense}} Failing to properly design a new route at its grade is considered arrogant and very poor form.{{POV statement|date=August 2014}} Even in strongholds of rock-climbing tradition like [[Yosemite National Park]], many routes are being gradually upgraded to safer standards of protection.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{portal|Climbing|Mountains}}\n* Lists and glossaries\n** [[List of climbers]]\n** [[List of climbing topics]]\n** [[Deaf climbers]]\n** [[:Category:Climbing organizations|Climbing organizations]]\n** [[Glossary of knots common in climbing]]\n* Related activities\n** [[Outdoor education]]\n** [[Salto del pastor]] (aboriginal rock [[gymnastic]] sport of [[Canary Islands]])\n** [[International Federation of Sport Climbing]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|2}}\n\n== Further reading ==\n{{Sister project links|v=no|s=no|n=no|q=no|voy=Rock climbing}}\n* {{cite book |author=Long, John |title=How to Rock Climb!

Comyns Carr]], a dramatist and art critic. His mother, [[Alice Comyns Carr]] (1850\u20131927), was a costume designer for the theatre. He was born in [[Marylebone]] and educated at [[Winchester College]] and [[Trinity College, Oxford]]. In 1907 he married Cicely Raikes Bromage, the daughter of a [[Minister (Christianity)|clergyman]]. They had three sons including Richard Strettell Comyns Carr who was the second husband of the avant garde English novelist [[Barbara Comyns Carr]].<ref>Roy Douglas, \"Sir Arthur Comyns Carr\", Brack et al. (eds.) ''Dictionary of Liberal Biography''; Politico\u2019s 1998, pp. 84-85</ref>\n\n==Career==\nIn 1908, Comyns Carr was [[called to the Bar]] at [[Gray's Inn]]. He became a [[Queen's Counsel|King\u2019s Counsel]] in 1924, a [[Bencher]] of the Inn in 1938<ref>The Times, 5.5.38</ref> and eventually Treasurer in 1951. Comyns Carr\u2019s reputation as a barrister was confirmed in a libel action brought by [[Horatio Bottomley]] against an associate named Reuben Bigland.<ref>Alan Hyman, ''The Rise and Fall of Horatio Bottomley: The Biography of a Swindler''; Cassell, 1972</ref> Carr\u2019s cross-examination of Bottomley and another key witness destroyed his case and was instrumental in Bottomley\u2019s eventual imprisonment on charges of fraud and his expulsion from the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]].<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Douglas, ''Dictionary of Liberal Biography''</ref> Comyns Carr later began to specialize in the law relating to [[rates (tax)|local taxation]] and as a result of appearing in landmark rating appeals he was engaged as counsel to government departments. He also became an expert in the subject of [[national insurance]]. Much later Comyns Carr was a prosecutor in trials of German and Japanese war criminals,<ref>Maureen Mulholland, Brian S. Pullan, Anne Pullan, R. A. Melikan, ''The Trial in History'';  Manchester University Press, 2003 p139</ref> and he was [[knighted]] for this work in 1949.<ref>Mark Pottle, entry on Comyns Carr in ''Dictionary of National Biography'', OUP 2004-2008</ref>\n\n==War service==\nAt the outbreak of the First World War Comyns Carr he joined the [[Royal Naval Reserve|Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve]] and later served on the staff at the [[Ministry of Munitions]]. He also acted as an adviser to the [[Ministry of Reconstruction]]. In the last months of the war he joined the army as a private soldier but did not serve overseas.<ref>Pottle, DNB</ref>\n\n==Politics==\nComyns Carr\u2019s expertise in National Insurance led him to co-author a book on the subject in 1912 to which [[David Lloyd George]] wrote the preface.<ref>The Times, 7.2.12</ref> He was a member of the Liberal land inquiry committee of 1912 and also sat on the land acquisition committee in 1917.\n\nHis ambition to become a Liberal [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) led Comyns Carr to stand for Parliament on eleven occasions in all. He first stood for election in [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918]] in [[St Pancras South West (UK Parliament constituency)|St Pancras South West]] against a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] opponent who had received [[the Coalition Coupon]] <ref>The Times, 10.12.18</ref> and fought the same seat again in [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922]].<ref>The Times, 8.11.22</ref> At the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]] Comyns Carr had his only success, becoming Liberal MP for [[Islington East (UK Parliament constituency)|Islington East]] turning a Unionist majority of nearly 4,000 <ref>The Times, 22.11.23</ref> into a Liberal majority of 1,632 <ref>The Times 30.10.24</ref> but he lost the seat at the [[1924 United Kingdom general election|general election of 1924]] like many other Liberals swept away as British politics seemed to be reverting to its traditional two party model. In 1928, he was Liberal candidate at the [[by-election]] for the constituency of [[Ilford (UK Parliament constituency)|Ilford]] <ref>The Times, 13.2.28</ref> and fought the seat again in the [[1929 United Kingdom general election|general election of the following year]].<ref>The Times, 31.5.29</ref>\n\nIn 1930, Comyns Carr published an influential and controversial booklet, ''Escape from the Dole'', which gained him significant public attention. In it he queried the policy of spending large sums of money supporting the unemployed when the government could be investing in providing work for them.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> He then challenged [[Winston Churchill]] in his constituency at [[Epping (UK Parliament constituency)|Epping]] in the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]] <ref>The Times, 10.10.31</ref> and in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935]] he suffered his heaviest defeat ever at [[Nottingham East (UK Parliament constituency)|Nottingham East]].<ref>''Who was Who'', OUP 2007</ref> In June 1936 he was elected to serve on the Liberal Party Council.<ref>The Liberal Magazine, 1936</ref> He stood again in [[1945 United Kingdom general election|1945]] when he lost at [[Shrewsbury (UK Parliament constituency)|Shrewsbury]].<ref>http://www.psr.keele.ac.uk/area/uk/ge45/i17.htm</ref> In October 1945 he was a candidate at another by-election, this time in  the [[City of London (UK Parliament constituency)|City of London]].<ref>https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/by_elections/45.html%23london&date=2009-10-25+16:44:50</ref>\n\n==Other public appointments==\nIn later life Comyns Carr served as chairman of the [[Foreign Compensation Commission]] (1950\u20131958) and was a president of the Institute of Industrial Administration and of the Association of Approved Societies.<ref>The Times, 21 April 1965</ref> He was also President of the Liberal Party in 1958-59.<ref>The Times, 16 November 1960</ref> Comyns-Carr was also one of the British prosecutors at the [[Tokyo Trials]].\n\n==Death==\nHe died in [[Hampstead]] on 20 April 1965. A memorial service was held for him in the chapel of Gray\u2019s Inn on 24 May 1965.<ref>The Times, 25.5.65</ref>\n\n==Ancestry==\n{{ahnentafel\n|collapsed=yes |align=center\n|boxstyle_1=background-color: #fcc;\n|boxstyle_2=background-color: #fb9;\n|boxstyle_3=background-color: #ffc;\n|boxstyle_4=background-color: #bfc;\n|boxstyle_5=background-color: #9fe;\n|1= 1.

Draughts developed from [[alquerque]].<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Draughts.htm |title = Draughts, Checkers - Online Guide |first=James |last=Masters |website=www.tradgames.org.uk }}</ref> The name derives from the verb to draw or to move.<ref name=strutt/>\n\nThe most popular forms are [[English draughts]], also called '''American checkers''', played on an 8\u00d78 [[checkerboard]]; [[Russian draughts]], also played on an 8\u00d78, and [[international draughts]], played on a 10\u00d710 board. There are many other variants played on 8\u00d78 boards. [[Canadian checkers]] and Singaporean/Malaysian checkers (also locally known as ''dum'') are played on a 12\u00d712 board.\n\nEnglish draughts was [[Solved game|weakly solved]] in 2007 by the team of Canadian computer scientist [[Jonathan Schaeffer]]. From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with [[perfect play]].\n\n==General rules {{anchor|Rules}}==\nDraughts is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.\n\nOnly the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. When presented, capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional.<ref>As is standard in modern Variants; see more at [http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Draughts.htm The Online Guide to Traditional Games]</ref> In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.\n\n===Men===\nUncrowned pieces (''men'') move one step diagonally forwards, and capture an opponent's piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the piece on the first step. Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may \"zigzag\" (change diagonal direction). In [[English draughts]] men can jump only forwards; in [[international draughts]] and [[Russian draughts]] men can jump both forwards and backwards.\n\n===Kings {{anchor|King|king}}===\n[[File:Probl\u00e8me Jeu de dames SR.gif|right|thumb|A game in international draughts, featuring a flying king]]\n\nWhen a man reaches the ''kings row'' (also called ''crownhead'', the farthest row forward), it becomes a ''king'', and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man (crowning), and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and (in variants where they cannot already do so) capture backwards. Like men, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king.\n\nIn international draughts, kings (also called ''flying kings'') move any distance along unblocked diagonals, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped.\n\nFlying kings are not used in English draughts; a king's only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards.\n\n==Naming==\nIn most non-English languages (except those that acquired the game from English speakers), draughts is called ''dame'', ''dames'', ''damas'', or a similar term that refers to ladies. The pieces are usually called ''men'', ''stones'', \"pe\u00f3n\" (pawn) or a similar term; men promoted to kings are called ''dames'' or ladies. In these languages, the [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[chess]] or in card games is usually called by the same term as the kings in draughts. A case in point includes the Greek terminology, in which draughts is called \"\u03bd\u03c4\u03ac\u03bc\u03b1\" (dama), which is also one term for the queen in chess.\n\n==National and regional variants==\n<gallery widths=\"160px\" heights=\"160px\">\nFile:International draughts.jpg|Starting position in [[international draughts]] which is played on a 10\u00d710 board\nFile:Draughts.svg|Starting position in [[Russian draughts|Russian]], [[Brazilian draughts|Brazilian]], [[Czech draughts|Czech]] draughts and [[Pool checkers]]\nFile:Canadian Checkers gameboard and init config.PNG|Starting position in [[Canadian draughts]]\nFile:TurkishDraughts (trad).png|Board and starting position in [[Turkish draughts]]\nFile:Damiera.JPG|Starting position in [[Italian draughts|Italian]] and Portuguese draughts\nFile:Column draughts game.gif|A Russian column draughts game\n</gallery>\n\n===Russian Column draughts===\nColumn draughts (Russian towers) is a kind of draughts, known in Russia since the beginning of the nineteenth century, in which the game is played according to the usual rules of draughts, but with the difference that the beaten draught is not removed from the playing field, and is captured under the beating figure (draught or tower).\n\nThe resulting towers move around the board as a whole, \"obeying\" the upper draught. When taking the tower, only the upper draught is removed from it. If on the top there is a draught of other color than removed as a result of fight, the tower becomes a tower of the rival. Rules of moves of draughts and kings correspond to the rules of Russian draughts.\n* Russian Wikipedia article on [[:ru:\u0421\u0442\u043e\u043b\u0431\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0435 \u0448\u0430\u0448\u043a\u0438|Russian Column draughts]]\n\n===Flying kings; men can capture backwards===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" border=\"1\"\n|+ <big>''International draughts / American Pool checkers family''</big>\n!National variant\n!Board size \n!Pieces per side\n!Double-corner or light square on player's near-right?\n!First move\n!Capture constraints\n!Notes\n|-\n|[[International draughts]] (or Polish draughts)\n|align=\"center\"|10\u00d710\n|align=\"center\"|20\n|align=\"center\"|Yes\n|align=\"center\"|White\n|A sequence must capture the maximum possible number of pieces.\n|Pieces promote only when ending their move on the final rank, not when passing through it.

The winners in men's have been from the United Kingdom, United States, [[Barbados]], and most recently Italy (3-Move division). The women's championship in English draughts started in 1993. The women's winners have been from Ireland, [[Turkmenistan]], and Ukraine.\n\nThe World Championship in international draughts began in 1885 in France, and since 1948 has been organized by the [[World Draughts Federation]] (FMJD, F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Mondiale du Jeu de Dames). It occurs every two years. In even years following the tournament, the World Title match takes place. The men's championship has had winners from the Netherlands, Canada, the Soviet Union, [[Senegal]], [[Latvia]], and Russia. The first Women's World Championship was held in 1973. The World Junior Championship has been played since 1971. European Championships have been held since 1965 (men's) and 2000 (women's).\n\nOther official World Championships began as follows: [[Brazilian draughts]], in 1985; [[Russian draughts]], in 1993; [[Turkish draughts]], in 2014.\n\n==Invented variants==\n* [[Blue and Gray (board game)|Blue and Gray]]: On a 9\u00d79 board, each side has 17 guard pieces that move and jump in any direction, to escort a captain piece which races to the center of the board to win.\n* [[Cheskers]]: A variant invented by [[Solomon Golomb]].  Each player begins with a [[bishop (chess)|bishop]] and a [[camel (chess)|camel]] (which jumps with coordinates (3,1) rather than (2,1) so as to stay on the black squares), and men reaching the back rank promote to a bishop, camel, or king.\n* [[Damath]]: A variant utilizing math principles and numbered chips popular in the [[Philippines]].\n* [[Dameo]]: A variant played on an 8\u00d78 board, move and capture rules are similar to those of [[Armenian draughts]]. A special \"sliding\" move is used for moving a line of checkers similar to the movement rule in [[Epaminondas (game)|Epaminondas]]. By [[Christian Freeling]] (2000). \n* [[Hexdame]]: A literal adaptation of [[international draughts]] to a hexagonal gameboard. By Christian Freeling (1979).\n* [[Lasca]]: A checkers variant on a 7\u00d77 board, with 25 fields used. Jumped pieces are placed under the jumper, so that towers are built. Only the top piece of a jumped tower is captured. This variant was invented by [[World Chess Championship|World Chess Champion]] [[Emanuel Lasker]].\n* [[Philosophy shogi checkers]]: A variant on a 9\u00d79 board, game ending with capturing opponent's king. Invented by [[Inoue Enry\u014d]] and described in Japanese book in 1890.\n* [[Suicide checkers]] (also called ''Anti-Checkers'', ''Giveaway Checkers'' or ''Losing Draughts''): A variant where the objective of each player is to lose all of their pieces.\n* [[Ultra checkers|Tiers]]: A complex variant which allows players to upgrade their pieces beyond kings.\n* [[Vladimir Vigman|Vigman's]] draughts: Each player has 24 pieces (two full sets) \u2013 one on the light squares, a second set on dark squares. Each player plays two games simultaneously: one on light squares, the other on dark squares. The total result is the sum of results for both games.\n\n==Games sometimes confused with draughts variants==\n* [[Halma]]: A game in which pieces move in any direction and jump over any other piece (but no captures), friend or enemy, and players try to move them all into an opposite corner.\n* [[Chinese Checkers]]: Based on Halma, but uses a star-shaped board divided into equilateral triangles.\n* [[Konane]]: \"Hawaiian checkers\".\n\n==History==\n\n===Ancient games===\nA similar game has been played for millennia.<ref name=strutt>{{cite book|last=Strutt|first=Joseph|title=The sports and pastimes of the people of England|location=London|year=1801|pages=255|url=https://books.google.com/?id=eJwSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA255#v=onepage&q=}}</ref>\nA board resembling a draughts board was found in [[Ur]] dating from 3000 BC.<ref name=\"gameplay\">{{cite book|last=Oxland|first=Kevin|title=Gameplay and design|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2004 |edition=Illustrated|pages=333|isbn=978-0-321-20467-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=l05TkZFbS24C}}</ref> In the [[British Museum]] are specimens of [[ancient Egyptian]] checkerboards, found with their pieces in burial chambers, and the game was played by [[Hatshepsut|Queen Hatasu]].<ref name=strutt/><ref name=Ellensburgh/> [[Plato]] mentioned a game, \u03c0\u03b5\u03c4\u03c4\u03b5\u03af\u03b1 or ''[[petteia]]'', as being of Egyptian origin,<ref name=Ellensburgh/> and [[Homer]] also mentions it.<ref name=Ellensburgh/> The method of capture was placing two pieces on either side of the opponent's piece.

There are many other variants played on 8\u00d78 boards. [[Canadian checkers]] and Singaporean/Malaysian checkers (also locally known as ''dum'') are played on a 12\u00d712 board.\n\nEnglish draughts was [[Solved game|weakly solved]] in 2007 by the team of Canadian computer scientist [[Jonathan Schaeffer]]. From the standard starting position, both players can guarantee a draw with [[perfect play]].\n\n==General rules {{anchor|Rules}}==\nDraughts is played by two opponents, on opposite sides of the gameboard. One player has the dark pieces; the other has the light pieces. Players alternate turns. A player may not move an opponent's piece. A move consists of moving a piece diagonally to an adjacent unoccupied square. If the adjacent square contains an opponent's piece, and the square immediately beyond it is vacant, the piece may be captured (and removed from the game) by jumping over it.\n\nOnly the dark squares of the checkered board are used. A piece may move only diagonally into an unoccupied square. When presented, capturing is mandatory in most official rules, although some rule variations make capturing optional.<ref>As is standard in modern Variants; see more at [http://www.tradgames.org.uk/games/Draughts.htm The Online Guide to Traditional Games]</ref> In almost all variants, the player without pieces remaining, or who cannot move due to being blocked, loses the game.\n\n===Men===\nUncrowned pieces (''men'') move one step diagonally forwards, and capture an opponent's piece by moving two consecutive steps in the same line, jumping over the piece on the first step. Multiple enemy pieces can be captured in a single turn provided this is done by successive jumps made by a single piece; the jumps do not need to be in the same line and may \"zigzag\" (change diagonal direction). In [[English draughts]] men can jump only forwards; in [[international draughts]] and [[Russian draughts]] men can jump both forwards and backwards.\n\n===Kings {{anchor|King|king}}===\n[[File:Probl\u00e8me Jeu de dames SR.gif|right|thumb|A game in international draughts, featuring a flying king]]\n\nWhen a man reaches the ''kings row'' (also called ''crownhead'', the farthest row forward), it becomes a ''king'', and is marked by placing an additional piece on top of the first man, and acquires additional powers including the ability to move backwards and (in variants where they cannot already do so) capture backwards. Like men, a king can make successive jumps in a single turn provided that each jump captures an enemy man or king.\n\nIn international draughts, kings (also called ''flying kings'') move any distance along unblocked diagonals, and may capture an opposing man any distance away by jumping to any of the unoccupied squares immediately beyond it. Because jumped pieces remain on the board until the turn is complete, it is possible to reach a position in a multi-jump move where the flying king is blocked from capturing further by a piece already jumped.\n\nFlying kings are not used in English draughts; a king's only advantage over a man is the ability to move and capture backwards as well as forwards.\n\n==Naming==\nIn most non-English languages (except those that acquired the game from English speakers), draughts is called ''dame'', ''dames'', ''damas'', or a similar term that refers to ladies. The pieces are usually called ''men'', ''stones'', \"pe\u00f3n\" (pawn) or a similar term; men promoted to kings are called ''dames'' or ladies. In these languages, the [[queen (chess)|queen]] in [[chess]] or in card games is usually called by the same term as the kings in draughts.

The men's championship has had winners from the Netherlands, Canada, the Soviet Union, [[Senegal]], [[Latvia]], and Russia. The first Women's World Championship was held in 1973. The World Junior Championship has been played since 1971. European Championships have been held since 1965 (men's) and 2000 (women's).\n\nOther official World Championships began as follows: [[Brazilian draughts]], in 1985; [[Russian draughts]], in 1993; [[Turkish draughts]], in 2014.\n\n==Invented variants==\n* [[Blue and Gray (board game)|Blue and Gray]]: On a 9\u00d79 board, each side has 17 guard pieces that move and jump in any direction, to escort a captain piece which races to the center of the board to win.\n* [[Cheskers]]: A variant invented by [[Solomon Golomb]].
