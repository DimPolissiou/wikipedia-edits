Notably, as the tabligh event at Sri Petaling Mosque was held from 27 February to 1 March, Malaysia did not possess any ruling government as the [[Pakatan Harapan]] administration had collapsed due to the [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|political crisis]] caused by the [[Perikatan Nasional]] ruling coalition which came to power without any general election taking place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-health-minister-blames-previous-ph-govt-for-failure-to-contain-covid-19-surge|title=Malaysia's Health Minister blames previous PH govt for failure to contain Covid-19 surge|last=|first=|date=2020-04-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Ministry of Health was without any Health Minister until 10 March, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Another important fact that Adham conveniently omnited, is that Ministry of Health under the previous health minister Dr. [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] had prepared for the Covid-19 infections since December 2019, when seven hospitals were planned and identified to treat Covid-19 patients even before the first cases were reported on 25 January 2020. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/fact-checking-dr-adham-baba-s-claim-that-previous-govt-failed-to-contain-the-tabligh-covid-19-cluster|title=Fact-Checking Dr Adham Baba's Claim That PH Failed To Contain The Tabligh Cluster|work=Says}}</ref>\n\n===WHO Conference Call with 500 Countries===\nOn 19 April 2020, Adham was ridiculed once again for erroneously claiming that he conducted video-conferencing with 500 countries within the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) members during a Facebook live session with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]]. He also boasted that he was confident that his accomplishments as a Health Minister was recognised globally. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/238783|title=Health minister mocked over \u2018500 countries\u2019 claim|work=The Malaysian Insight}}</ref> This event highlighted Adham\u2018s overconfidence, ineptitude, incompetence and a lack of attention to detail when fulfilling his ministerial duties, as there are less than 200 countries present in the world today. As a minister who gained the position through the formation of a Backdoor government (formation of a new government without any general election), Adham has little to no credibility in making his own assertions (that were subsequently proven false). \n\n==Personal life==\n\nAdham is married to Taibah Tabrani and has 3 children and 2 adopted children.  On April 23, 2007, Adham's wife suffered from asthma and fainting at her home after suffering a respiratory problem.  She was later rushed to the hospital but she passed away.  At the time, Adham was in Auckland, New Zealand on official duty.\n\n==Honours==\n\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Malacca.svg|30px]] {{flag|Malacca}} :\n**[[File:MY-MAL Exalted Order of Malacca.svg|50px]] Darjah Mulia Seri Melaka (DMSM) \u2013 '''Datuk''' (2003)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2003.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2003.}}</ref>\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Pahang.svg|25px]] {{flag|Pahang}} :\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of the Crown of Pahang - Grand Knight - SIMP.svg|50px]] [[Pahang honours list|Sri Indera Mahkota Pahang]] (SIMP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Indera''' (2013)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2013.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2013.}}</ref>\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang - Grand Knight - SSAP.svg|50px]] Sri Sultan Ahmad Shah Pahang (SSAP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Sri''' (2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2016.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2016.}}</ref>\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ '''[[Johor State Legislative Assembly]]'''<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://semak.spr.gov.my/spr/laporan/5_KedudukanAkhir.php |title=Keputusan Pilihan Raya Umum Parlimen/Dewan Undangan Negeri |publisher=[[Election Commission of Malaysia]] |accessdate=14 April 2010}} Percentage figures based on total turnout, including votes for third parties.

Dr Nur Amalina Che Bakri had criticised Adham saying that there was no scientific evidence that the stomach's acid can kill the virus. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2020/03/20/health-minister039s-039warm-water-method039-to-kill-coronavirus-questioned|title=Health Minister's 'warm water method' to kill coronavirus questioned|work=The Star}}</ref> [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) has also refuted the claim, noting that while staying hydrated by drinking water is important for overall health, it does not prevent the coronavirus infection. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/health-minister-wrongly-claims-hot-water-can-kill-coronavirus-because-it-doesn-t-like-heat|title=Health Minister Claims Warm Water Can Kill Coronavirus Because It \"Doesn't Like Heat\"|work=Says}}</ref> Health Director-General Dr Noor Hisham Abdullah later refuted   Adham's statement, commenting that the Health Ministry's approach for patient treatment and management is always based on scientific evidence. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.therakyatpost.com/2020/03/22/health-dg-appears-to-disagree-with-health-minister-on-warm-water-claim/|title=Health DG appears to disagree with Health Minister on Warm Water claim|work=The Rakyat Post}}</ref>\n\n===Pakatan Harapan Blamed for Failing to Contain Tabligh Cluster===\nOn 18 April 2020, Adham in a live-streamed video conference call with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]], he erroneously claimed that the previous [[Pakatan Harapan]] government has failed to contain the tabligh cluster happened from 27 February to 3 March, which grew to become a source of the largest [[Coronavirus disease 2019|Covid-19]] infections. Notably, as the tabligh event at Sri Petaling Mosque was held from 27 February to 1 March, Malaysia did not possess any ruling government as the [[Pakatan Harapan]] administration had collapsed due to the [[2020 Malaysian political crisis|political crisis]] caused by the [[Perikatan Nasional]] ruling coalition which came to power without any general election taking place.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/malaysias-health-minister-blames-previous-ph-govt-for-failure-to-contain-covid-19-surge|title=Malaysia's Health Minister blames previous PH govt for failure to contain Covid-19 surge|last=|first=|date=2020-04-18|website=The Straits Times|language=en|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-19}}</ref> The Ministry of Health was without any Health Minister until 10 March, amidst the Covid-19 pandemic in the country. Another important fact that Adham conveniently omnited, is that Ministry of Health under the previous health minister Dr. [[Dzulkefly Ahmad]] had prepared for the Covid-19 infections since December 2019, when seven hospitals were planned and identified to treat Covid-19 patients even before the first cases were reported on 25 January 2020. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://says.com/my/news/fact-checking-dr-adham-baba-s-claim-that-previous-govt-failed-to-contain-the-tabligh-covid-19-cluster|title=Fact-Checking Dr Adham Baba's Claim That PH Failed To Contain The Tabligh Cluster|work=Says}}</ref>\n\n===WHO Conference Call with 500 Countries===\nOn 19 April 2020, Adham was ridiculed once again for erroneously claiming that he conducted video-conferencing with 500 countries within the [[World Health Organisation]] (WHO) members during a Facebook live session with [[United Malays National Organisation|UMNO]] President [[Ahmad Zahid Hamidi]]. He also boasted that he was confident that his accomplishments as a Health Minister was recognised globally. <ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.themalaysianinsight.com/s/238783|title=Health minister mocked over \u2018500 countries\u2019 claim|work=The Malaysian Insight}}</ref> This event highlighted Adham\u2018s overconfidence, ineptitude, incompetence and a lack of attention to detail when fulfilling his ministerial duties, as there are less than 200 countries present in the world today. As a minister who gained the position through the formation of a Backdoor government (formation of a new government without any general election), Adham has little to no credibility in making his own assertions (that were subsequently proven false). \n\n==Personal life==\n\nAdham is married to Taibah Tabrani and has 3 children and 2 adopted children.  On April 23, 2007, Adham's wife suffered from asthma and fainting at her home after suffering a respiratory problem.  She was later rushed to the hospital but she passed away.  At the time, Adham was in Auckland, New Zealand on official duty.\n\n==Honours==\n\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Malacca.svg|30px]] {{flag|Malacca}} :\n**[[File:MY-MAL Exalted Order of Malacca.svg|50px]] Darjah Mulia Seri Melaka (DMSM) \u2013 '''Datuk''' (2003)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2003.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2003.}}</ref>\n*[[File:Coat_of_arms_of_Pahang.svg|25px]] {{flag|Pahang}} :\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of the Crown of Pahang - Grand Knight - SIMP.svg|50px]] [[Pahang honours list|Sri Indera Mahkota Pahang]] (SIMP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Indera''' (2013)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2013.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2013.}}</ref>\n**[[File:MY-PAH Order of Sultan Ahmad Shah of Pahang - Grand Knight - SSAP.svg|50px]] Sri Sultan Ahmad Shah Pahang (SSAP) \u2013 '''Dato\u2019 Sri''' (2016)<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.istiadat.gov.my/v8/images/stories/2016.pdf|title=Senarai Penerima Darjah Kebesaran, Bintang dan Pingat Persekutuan 2016.}}</ref>\n\n==Election results==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:0.5em ; font-size:95%\"\n|+ '''[[Johor State Legislative Assembly]]'''<ref name=\"election results\">{{cite web|url=http://semak.spr.gov.my/spr/laporan/5_KedudukanAkhir.php |title=Keputusan Pilihan Raya Umum Parlimen/Dewan Undangan Negeri |publisher=[[Election Commission of Malaysia]] |accessdate=14 April 2010}} Percentage figures based on total turnout, including votes for third parties.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side.

Unfortunately the weather did not oblige and it was in fact described as \"the worst experienced this season ... in one place there was a miniature lake.\" This resulted in a crowd many times smaller, however thousands came into the ground to watch the main match between North Island and South Island, won by the former 27 points to 9.<ref>{{cite news \n| title =The Minor Trial Games/A Win for South Auckland/Play Marred by the Rain\n| page =12 \n| work= [[The New Zealand Herald]] |volume=LXII |issue=19056\n| date = 1925-06-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19250629.2.140.4\n| accessdate = 2019-09-12}}</ref> Auckland then played against the [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] team and lost 9 points to 16. Following this they played a Northern Union Challenge Cup match against the holders South Auckland and were victorious by 24 points to 16. After the New Zealand team returned from their tour of [[Australia]] they again played Auckland at [[Carlaw Park]] and they used the experience they had gained to trounce Auckland by 41 points to 17, employing tactics that the Auckland team were not prepared for. Two weeks later Auckland played [[Queensland rugby league team|Queensland]] who were being touted as the finest league team in the world at the time in the first of three matches. They drew the first, before narrowly losing the second and then being well and truly outclassed in the 3rd match by 54 points to 14.\n\n===Representative Fixtures===\nAfter the trial matches were played the New Zealand team was selected by Mr Liversedge, Pearce, and Harding, and 14 Auckland players made the side. They were: C. Dufty, P. Gregory, Lou Brown, A. Brisbane, F. Delgrosso, J. Kirwan, B. Laing, M. Wetherill, W. Wilson-Hall, C. Webb, B. Avery, E. Herring, J. O'Brien, and H. Dixon.

It had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Jewish religious music]], inspiring later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], [[8th Day (Jewish band)|8th Day]], [[Reva L'Sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]]. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revived the band under the name '''Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora''' and produced several more albums.\n\n== Background ==\nThe '''Diaspora Yeshiva''' <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/ Website of the Diaspora Yeshiva]</ref> was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the [[Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim|Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}  It is the only Jewish institution located on [[Mount Zion]]. The yeshiva offers programs ranging from basic Judaism to advanced Talmud - employing a methodology based on [[Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto#Bibliography|Ramchal]] - and emphasizes ''[[mussar]]'' (character development);\nsee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]].\n'''Machon Roni''', a [[machon|Women's Torah Seminary]] is operated in parallel.\n\nDiaspora Yeshiva was the first [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] [[yeshiva]] for [[Baal teshuva movement|''baalei teshuva'']].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013|p=291}} Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional [[Torah study|Torah]] or [[Talmud]] study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} To appeal to students who identified with the [[hippie]] [[subculture]] prevalent on American college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a [[Neo-Hasidism|neo-Hasidic]] approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}\n\nNumerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>\n\n==History==\nThe Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the [[Gerard Behar Center|Beit Ha'Am]] hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth;

It had a considerable influence on [[contemporary Jewish religious music]], inspiring later bands such as [[Blue Fringe]], [[8th Day (Jewish band)|8th Day]], [[Reva L'Sheva]], [[Soulfarm]], the [[Moshav (band)|Moshav Band]], and [[Shlock Rock]]. Fifteen years after it disbanded, band leader Avraham Rosenblum revived the band under the name '''Avraham Rosenblum & Diaspora''' and produced several more albums.\n\n== Background ==\nThe '''Diaspora Yeshiva''' <ref>[https://diasporayeshiva.weebly.com/ Website of the Diaspora Yeshiva]</ref> was founded in 1967 by Rabbi Mordechai Goldstein, an alumnus of the [[Yeshivas Chofetz Chaim|Chofetz Chaim Yeshiva]] in [[Queens]], New York, and a colleague of Rabbi [[Shlomo Carlebach (musician)|Shlomo Carlebach]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}  It is the only Jewish institution located on [[Mount Zion]]. The yeshiva offers programs ranging from basic Judaism to advanced Talmud - employing a methodology based on [[Moshe_Chaim_Luzzatto#Bibliography|Ramchal]] - and emphasizes ''[[mussar]]'' (character development);\nsee [[Yeshiva #Curriculum]].\n\nIt was the first [[Orthodox Jewish outreach|outreach]] [[yeshiva]] for [[Baal teshuva movement|''baalei teshuva'']].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}}{{sfn|Kaplan|2013|p=291}} Unlike traditional rabbinic academies, the yeshiva reached out to young Jewish men who had never been exposed to traditional [[Torah study|Torah]] or [[Talmud]] study. It offered introductory and intermediate courses together with acclimation to an Orthodox Jewish lifestyle.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=330}} To appeal to students who identified with the [[hippie]] [[subculture]] prevalent on American college campuses in those years, the yeshiva adopted a [[Neo-Hasidism|neo-Hasidic]] approach. Students were encouraged to keep their long hair and their musical instruments.{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}\n\nNumerous students were professional or semi-professional musicians, and several musical collaborations were spawned in the yeshiva dorms.<ref name=mish/> In 1975 student Avraham Rosenblum, a rock guitarist who had started his own band in New York in 1970, founded the Diaspora Yeshiva Band.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Strom|2011|p=196}} The band became an outreach tool for other hippie students and, later, post-hippie seekers, using [[Jewish music]] to draw them into the milieu of [[Torah study]].{{sfn|Lange|Diethard Romheld|Weigol|2011|p=331}}<ref name=mish/>\n\n==History==\nThe Diaspora Yeshiva Band staged its first concert at the [[Gerard Behar Center|Beit Ha'Am]] hall in the [[Nachlaot]] neighborhood of Jerusalem during [[Hanukkah]] 1975.<ref name=mish/> After that, the band became well known for its weekly Saturday-night concerts held in a room adjacent to [[David's Tomb]] (located in the same courtyard as the yeshiva) on Mount Zion.<ref name=mish/>{{sfn|Selavan|1993|p=88}}{{sfn|Sofer|1995|p=92}} These concerts attracted American, British and French secular youth;
