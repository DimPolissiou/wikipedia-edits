the black hole. G2 has been observed to be disrupting since 2009,<ref name=\"Gillessen 2012 51\u201354\"/> and was predicted by some to be completely destroyed by the encounter, which could have led to a significant brightening of X-ray and other emission from the black hole.

Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas stream.<ref name=nature140721>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/why-galactic-black-hole-fireworks-were-a-flop-1.15591 |title=Why galactic black hole fireworks were a flop : Nature News & Comment |journal=Nature |accessdate=2015-02-27|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15591 |year=2014 |last1=Cowen |first1=Ron }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pfuhl|first=Oliver|last2=Gillessen|first2=Stefan|last3=Eisenhauer|first3=Frank|last4=Genzel|first4=Reinhard|last5=Plewa|first5=Philipp M.|last6=Thomas Ott|last7=Ballone|first7=Alessandro|last8=Schartmann|first8=Marc|last9=Burkert|first9=Andreas|date=2015|title=The Galactic Center Cloud G2 and its Gas Streamer|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=798|issue=2|page=111|doi=10.1088/0004-637x/798/2/111|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1407.4354|bibcode=2015ApJ...798..111P}}</ref>\n\nProfessor [[Andrea M.

According to the team's analysis, the data ruled out the possibility that Sgr A* contains a cluster of dark stellar objects or a mass of [[Degenerate matter|degenerate fermions]], strengthening the evidence for a massive black hole.<ref>[[#Schodel|Sch\u00f6del ''et al.'' 2002]]</ref> The observations of S2 used [[near-infrared]] (NIR) [[Astronomical interferometer|interferometry]] (in the K-band, i.e. 2.2&nbsp;[[Micrometre|\u03bcm]]) because of reduced [[Extinction (astronomy)|interstellar extinction]] in this band. SiO [[Astrophysical maser|maser]]s were used to align NIR images with radio observations, as they can be observed in both NIR and radio bands. The rapid motion of S2 (and other nearby stars) easily stood out against slower-moving stars along the line-of-sight so these could be subtracted from the images.\n\n[[File:Dusty cloud G2 passes the supermassive black hole at the centre of the Milky Way.jpg|thumb|Dusty cloud G2 passes the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way<ref>{{cite web|title=Best View Yet of Dusty Cloud Passing Galactic Centre Black Hole|url=http://www.eso.org/public/news/eso1512/|accessdate=16 June 2015}}</ref>]]\nThe VLBI radio observations of Sagittarius A* could also be aligned centrally with the NIR images, so the focus of S2's elliptical orbit was found to coincide with the position of Sagittarius A*.

Using the [[List of instruments at the Very Large Telescope|GRAVITY]] [[Interferometry|interferometer]] and the four telescopes of the [[Very Large Telescope]] (VLT) to create a virtual telescope 130 metres in diameter, astronomers detected clumps of gas moving at about 30% of the speed of light. Emission from highly energetic electrons very close to the black hole was visible as three prominent bright flares. These exactly match theoretical predictions for hot spots orbiting close to a black hole of four million solar masses. The flares are thought to originate from magnetic interactions in the very hot gas orbiting very close to Sagittarius A*.<ref name=\"DetectionOfBlackHoleSrgA\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/0004-6361/201834294|title=Detection of orbital motions near the last stable circular orbit of the massive black hole SgrA|journal=Astronomy & Astrophysics|volume=618|pages=L10|year=2018|last1=Abuter|first1=R.|last2=Amorim|first2=A.|last3=Baub\u00f6ck|first3=M.|last4=Berger|first4=J.

the black hole. G2 has been observed to be disrupting since 2009,<ref name=\"Gillessen 2012 51\u201354\"/> and was predicted by some to be completely destroyed by the encounter, which could have led to a significant brightening of X-ray and other emission from the black hole.

Supporting this hypothesis, G1, a cloud that passed near the black hole 13 years ago, had an orbit almost identical to G2, consistent with both clouds, and a gas tail thought to be trailing G2, all being denser clumps within a large single gas stream.<ref name=nature140721>{{Cite journal|url=http://www.nature.com/news/why-galactic-black-hole-fireworks-were-a-flop-1.15591 |title=Why galactic black hole fireworks were a flop : Nature News & Comment |journal=Nature |accessdate=2015-02-27|doi=10.1038/nature.2014.15591 |year=2014 |last1=Cowen |first1=Ron }}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Pfuhl|first=Oliver|last2=Gillessen|first2=Stefan|last3=Eisenhauer|first3=Frank|last4=Genzel|first4=Reinhard|last5=Plewa|first5=Philipp M.|last6=Thomas Ott|last7=Ballone|first7=Alessandro|last8=Schartmann|first8=Marc|last9=Burkert|first9=Andreas|date=2015|title=The Galactic Center Cloud G2 and its Gas Streamer|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|language=en|volume=798|issue=2|page=111|doi=10.1088/0004-637x/798/2/111|issn=0004-637X|arxiv=1407.4354|bibcode=2015ApJ...798..111P}}</ref>\n\nProfessor [[Andrea M.

[http://www.slate.com/id/2067175/ \"If I Were a Rich Dad\"] in ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'', June 20, 2002.</ref> The titular \"rich dad\" is his friend's father who accumulated wealth due to entrepreneurship and savvy investing, while the \"poor dad\" is claimed to be Kiyosaki's own father who he says worked hard all his life but never obtained financial security. No one has ever proven that Rich Dad, the man who supposedly gave Kiyosaki all his advice for wealthy living, ever existed. Nor has anyone ever documented any vast reserves of wealth earned by Kiyosaki prior to the publication of Rich Dad, Poor Dad in 1997.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/helaineolen/2012/10/10/rich-dad-poor-dad-bankrupt-dad/|title=Rich Dad, Poor Dad, Bankrupt Dad?|last=Olen|first=Helaine|website=Forbes|language=en|access-date=2020-01-02}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n===Praise and support===\n''Rich Dad Poor Dad'' has sold over 32 million copies<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150316005267/en/Top-Selling-Personal-Finance-Book-Time-Rich|title=Top Selling Personal Finance Book of All Time; Rich Dad Poor Dad NOW Available for FREE Download!|website=www.businesswire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-07-30}}</ref> in more than 51 languages across more than 109 countries,  been on the New York Times bestsellers list for over six years,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/new-york-times-best-selling-author-rich-dad-poor-robert-rico-racosky|title=New York Times Best Selling Author of Rich Dad Poor Dad Robert Kiyosaki|date=2016-05-06|access-date=2017-07-30|language=en}}</ref>, launched a series of books and related products; and received positive reviews from some critics.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://investorjunkie.com/11194/rich-dad-poor-dad-review/|title=Rich Dad, Poor Dad Review - Revisited Ten Years Later|work=Investor Junkie|accessdate=24 January 2016}}</ref> American talk show host and media mogul [[Oprah Winfrey]] endorsed the book on her show.
