In Old English, the day was called \u201cLong Friday\u201d (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\" {{IPA-ang|\u02c8l\u0251\u014b.\u0261\u0251 \u02c8fri\u02d0.je\u02ccd\u00e6j|}}), and this term was adopted from Old English and is still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0522.html ]</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was ''Feria sexta in Parasceve'' (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed ''Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to ''Feria sexta in Passione Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\").\n\nIn Dutch, Good Friday is known as ''Goede Vrijdag'', in Frisian as ''Goedfreed''. In German-speaking countries, it is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (\"Mourning Friday\", with ''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''\u201a \"bewail\", \"grieve\"\u201a \"mourn\", which is related to the English word \"care\" in the sense of cares and woes), but it is sometimes also called ''Stiller Freitag'' (\"Silent Friday\") and ''Hoher Freitag'' (\"High Friday, Holy Friday\"). In the Scandinavian languages and Finnish (\"pitk\u00e4perjantai\"), it is called the equivalent of \"Long Friday\" as it was in Old English (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\").\n\nIn Greek, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian it is generally referred to as the equivalent of \"Great Friday\" (''\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae'', ''Wielki Pi\u0105tek'', ''Nagyp\u00e9ntek'', ''Vinerea Mare'').

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\".

Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]]. Just before the sixth Gospel reading, which recounts Jesus being nailed to the cross, a large [[Christian cross|cross]] is carried out of the sanctuary by the priest, accompanied by [[incense]] and candles, and is placed in the center of the [[nave]] (where the congregation gathers)''S\u0113meron Krem\u0101tai Ep\u00ed X\u00fdlou'':\n\n<blockquote>Today He who hung the earth upon the waters is hung upon the Cross ''(three times)''.<br>He who is King of the angels is arrayed in a crown of thorns.<br>He who wraps the Heavens in clouds is wrapped in the purple of mockery. <br>He who in Jordan set Adam free receives blows upon His face.<br>The Bridegroom of the Church is transfixed with nails. <br>The Son of the Virgin is pierced with a spear.<br>We venerate Thy Passion, O Christ ''(three times)''.<br>Show us also Thy glorious Resurrection.<ref>{{Cite book\n|last = Archimandrite Kallistos (Ware) and Mother Mary\n|year = 2002\n|title = The Lenten Triodion\n|chapter = Service of the Twelve Gospels\n|page = 587\n|place = South Cannan, PA\n|publisher = St. Tikhon's Seminary Press\n|postscript = <!--None-->}}</ref><ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2QNbTDjvJ0 Today He who hung the earth upon the waters ] Chanted by the Byzantine Choir of Athens</ref>\n</blockquote>\n\nThe readings are:\n\n# {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} \u2013 Christ's last sermon, Jesus prays for the [[apostles]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201328|KJV}} \u2013 The agony in the [[Garden of Gethsemane|garden]], the mockery and denial of Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201375|KJV}} \u2013 The mockery of Christ, [[Saint Peter|Peter]] denies Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|18:28\u201319:16|KJV}} \u2013 [[Pontius Pilate|Pilate]] questions Jesus; Jesus is condemned; Jesus is mocked by the Romans.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:3\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Judas]] commits suicide; Jesus is condemned; Jesus mocked by the Romans; [[Simon of Cyrene]] compelled to carry the cross.\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:16\u201332|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:33\u201354|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:32\u201349|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:25\u201337|KJV}} \u2013 [[Crucifixion of Jesus|Jesus dies]].\n# {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:43\u201347|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||John|19:38\u201342|KJV}} \u2013 [[Joseph of Arimathea]] buries Christ.\n# {{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:62\u201366|KJV}} \u2013 The Jews set a guard.\n\nDuring the service, all come forward to kiss the feet of Christ on the cross.

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown. Their High Attic linguistic style suggests a dating around the 6th century, possibly before the time of [[St. Romanos the Melodist]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n[[File:Epitaph Adelaide.jpg|thumb|The Epitaphios mounted upon return of procession, at an Orthodox Church in Adelaide, Australia.]]\nAt the end of the [[Great Doxology]], while the [[Trisagion]] is sung, the epitaphios is taken in [[crucession|procession]] around the outside the church, and is then returned to the tomb. Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ. The epitaphios will lay in the tomb until the Paschal Service early Sunday morning.

During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ.

In Old English, the day was called \u201cLong Friday\u201d (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\" {{IPA-ang|\u02c8l\u0251\u014b.\u0261\u0251 \u02c8fri\u02d0.je\u02ccd\u00e6j|}}), and this term was adopted from Old English and is still used in Scandinavian languages and Finnish.<ref>[http://runeberg.org/svetym/0522.html ]</ref>\n\n===Other languages===\nIn Latin, the name used by the Catholic Church until 1955 was ''Feria sexta in Parasceve'' (\"Friday of Preparation [for the Sabbath]\"). In the 1955 reform of Holy Week, it was renamed ''Feria sexta in Passione et Morte Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion and Death of the Lord\"), and in the new rite introduced in 1970, shortened to ''Feria sexta in Passione Domini'' (\"Friday of the Passion of the Lord\").\n\nIn Dutch, Good Friday is known as ''Goede Vrijdag'', in Frisian as ''Goedfreed''. In German-speaking countries, it is generally referred to as ''Karfreitag'' (\"Mourning Friday\", with ''Kar'' from [[Old High German]] ''kara''\u201a \"bewail\", \"grieve\"\u201a \"mourn\", which is related to the English word \"care\" in the sense of cares and woes), but it is sometimes also called ''Stiller Freitag'' (\"Silent Friday\") and ''Hoher Freitag'' (\"High Friday, Holy Friday\"). In the Scandinavian languages and Finnish (\"pitk\u00e4perjantai\"), it is called the equivalent of \"Long Friday\" as it was in Old English (\"Langa friged\u00e6g\").\n\nIn Greek, Polish, Hungarian, and Romanian it is generally referred to as the equivalent of \"Great Friday\" (''\u039c\u03b5\u03b3\u03ac\u03bb\u03b7 \u03a0\u03b1\u03c1\u03b1\u03c3\u03ba\u03b5\u03c5\u03ae'', ''Wielki Pi\u0105tek'', ''Nagyp\u00e9ntek'', ''Vinerea Mare''). In Bulgarian, it is called either ''\u0412\u0435\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u043a'' (\"Great Friday\"), or, more commonly, ''\u0420\u0430\u0437\u043f\u0435\u0442\u0438 \u043f\u0435\u0442\u044a\u043a'' (\"Crucified Friday\"). In French, it is referred to as ''Vendredi saint'' (\"Holy Friday\").

Judas received money ([[30 pieces of silver]]) ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:14\u201316|KJV}}) for [[Bargain of Judas|betraying Jesus]] and told the guards that whomever [[Kiss of Judas|he kisses]] is the one they are to arrest. Following his arrest, Jesus was taken to the house of [[Annas]], the father-in-law of the [[Cohen Gadol|high priest]], [[Caiaphas]]. There he was interrogated with little result and sent bound to Caiaphas the high priest where the [[Sanhedrin]] had assembled ({{Bibleverse||John|18:1\u201324|KJV}}).\n\nConflicting testimony against Jesus was brought forth by many witnesses, to which Jesus answered nothing. Finally the high priest adjured Jesus to respond under solemn oath, saying \"I adjure you, by the Living God, to tell us, are you the Anointed One, the Son of God?\" Jesus testified ambiguously, \"You have said it, and in time you will see the Son of Man seated at the right hand of the Almighty, coming on the clouds of Heaven.\" The high priest condemned Jesus for [[blasphemy]], and the [[Sanhedrin Trial of Jesus|Sanhedrin concurred with a sentence of death]] ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|26:57\u201366|KJV}}). Peter, waiting in the courtyard, also [[Denial of Peter|denied Jesus]] three times to bystanders while the interrogations were proceeding just as Jesus had predicted.\n\nIn the morning, the whole assembly brought Jesus to the Roman governor [[Pontius Pilate]] under charges of subverting the nation, opposing taxes to Caesar, and making himself a king ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:1\u20132|KJV}}). Pilate authorized the Jewish leaders to judge Jesus according to their own law and execute sentencing; however, the Jewish leaders replied that they were not allowed by the Romans to carry out a sentence of death ({{Bibleverse||John|18:31|KJV}}).\n\n[[Pilate's court|Pilate questioned]] Jesus and told the assembly that there was no basis for sentencing. Upon learning that Jesus was from Galilee, Pilate referred the case to the ruler of [[Galilee]], [[Herod Antipas|King Herod]], who was in [[Jerusalem]] for the [[Passover]] Feast. [[Jesus at Herod's court|Herod questioned]] Jesus but received no answer; Herod sent Jesus back to Pilate. Pilate told the assembly that neither he nor Herod found Jesus to be guilty; Pilate resolved to have Jesus whipped and released ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:3\u201316|KJV}}). Under the guidance of the chief priests, the crowd asked for [[Barabbas]], who had been imprisoned for committing murder during an insurrection. Pilate asked what they would have him do with Jesus, and they demanded, \"Crucify him\" ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:6\u201314|KJV}}). [[Pontius Pilate's wife|Pilate's wife]] had seen Jesus in a dream earlier that day, and she forewarned Pilate to \"have nothing to do with this righteous man\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:19|KJV}}). Pilate had Jesus [[Flagellation of Christ|flogged]] and then brought him out to the crowd to release him. The chief priests informed Pilate of a new charge, demanding Jesus be sentenced to death \"because he claimed to be God's son.\" This possibility filled Pilate with fear, and he brought Jesus back inside the palace and demanded to know from where he came ({{Bibleverse||John|19:1\u20139|KJV|}}).\n\n[[File:Ecce homo by Antonio Ciseri (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Antonio Ciseri]]'s depiction of ''[[Ecce Homo]]'' with Jesus and [[Pontius Pilate]], 19th century]]\nComing before the crowd one last time, Pilate declared Jesus innocent and washed his own hands in water to show he had no part in this condemnation. Nevertheless, Pilate handed Jesus over to be crucified in order to forestall a riot ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:24\u201326|KJV}}) and ultimately to keep his job. The sentence written was \"Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews.\" Jesus carried his cross to the site of execution (assisted by [[Simon of Cyrene]]), called the \"place of the Skull\", or \"[[Golgotha]]\" in Hebrew and in Latin \"Calvary\". There he was crucified along with two criminals ({{Bibleverse||John|19:17\u201322|KJV}}).\n\nJesus agonized on the cross for six hours. During his last three hours on the cross, from noon to 3&nbsp;pm, [[Crucifixion darkness|darkness fell over the whole land]].<ref>{{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45}}; {{Bibleverse||Mark|15:13}}; {{Bibleverse||Luke|23:44}}</ref> Jesus [[Sayings of Jesus on the cross|spoke from the cross]], quoting the messianic [[Psalm 22]]: \"My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?\"\n\nWith a loud cry, Jesus gave up his spirit. There was an earthquake, tombs broke open, and the curtain in the Temple was torn from top to bottom. The [[centurion]] on guard at the site of crucifixion declared, \"Truly this was God's Son!\" ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:45\u201354|KJV}})\n\n[[Joseph of Arimathea]], a member of the Sanhedrin and a secret follower of Jesus, who had not consented to his condemnation, went to Pilate to request the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:50\u201352|KJV}}). Another secret follower of Jesus and member of the Sanhedrin named [[Nicodemus]] brought about a hundred-pound weight mixture of spices and helped wrap the body of Jesus ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). Pilate asked confirmation from the centurion of whether Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:44|KJV}}). A soldier pierced the side of Jesus with a lance causing blood and water to flow out ({{Bibleverse||John|19:34|KJV}}), and the centurion informed Pilate that Jesus was dead ({{Bibleverse||Mark|15:45|KJV}}).\n\nJoseph of Arimathea took Jesus' body, wrapped it in a clean linen shroud, and placed it in his own new tomb that had been carved in the rock ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:59\u201360|KJV}}) in a garden near the site of the crucifixion. Nicodemus ({{Bibleverse||John|3:1|KJV}}) also brought 75 pounds of [[myrrh]] and [[aloes]], and placed them in the linen with the body, in keeping with Jewish burial customs ({{Bibleverse||John|19:39\u201340|KJV}}). They rolled a large rock over the entrance of the tomb ({{Bibleverse||Matthew|27:60|KJV}}). Then they returned home and rested, because [[Shabbat]] had begun at sunset ({{Bibleverse||Luke|23:54\u201356|KJV}}). Matt. 28:1 \"After the Shabbat, at dawn on the first day of the week, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary went to look at the tomb\". i.e. \"After the Sabbath, at dawn on the first day of the week,...\". \"He is not here; he has risen, just as he said....\". (Matt. 28:6)\n\n==In Eastern and Oriental Orthodox Christianity==\n[[File:Crucifixion by Theophanes the Cretan.jpg|thumb|[[Icon]] of the Crucifixion, 16th century, by [[Theophanes the Cretan]] ([[Stavronikita Monastery]], [[Mount Athos]])]]\nByzantine Christians ([[Eastern Christians]] who follow the [[Rite of Constantinople]]: [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]] and [[Greek Catholic Church|Greek-Catholics]]) call this day \"Great and Holy Friday\", or simply \"Great Friday\".<ref>{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Theology|author=Gerald O'Collins, Edward G. Farrugia|p=108|publisher=Paulist Press|year=2013|isbn=978-1-587-68236-0}}</ref>\n\nBecause the sacrifice of Jesus through his crucifixion is recalled on this day, the [[Divine Liturgy]] (the sacrifice of bread and wine) is never celebrated on Great Friday, except when this day coincides with the [[Great Feast]] of the [[Annunciation]], which falls on the fixed date of 25 March (for those churches which follow the traditional [[Julian Calendar]], 25 March currently falls on 7 April of the modern [[Gregorian Calendar]]). Also on Great Friday, the clergy no longer wear the purple or red that is customary throughout [[Great Lent]],<ref>There is a wide variety of uses regarding the [[liturgical colors]] worn during Great Lent and Holy Week in the Rite of Constantinople.</ref> but instead don [[black vestments]]. There is no \"stripping of the altar\" on [[Maundy Thursday|Holy and Great Thursday]] as in the West; instead, all of the [[antipendia|church hangings]] are changed to black, and will remain so until the Divine Liturgy on [[Great Saturday]].\n\nThe faithful revisit the events of the day through the public reading of specific [[Psalms]] and the [[Gospel]]s, and singing [[hymn]]s about Christ's death. Rich visual imagery and symbolism, as well as stirring hymnody, are remarkable elements of these observances. In the [[Orthodox theology|Orthodox understanding]], the events of [[Holy Week]] are not simply an annual commemoration of past events, but the faithful actually participates in the death and the [[resurrection of Jesus]].\n\n<blockquote>Each hour of this day is the new suffering and the new effort of the expiatory suffering of the Savior. And the echo of this suffering is already heard in every word of our worship service \u2013 unique and incomparable both in the power of tenderness and feeling and in the depth of the boundless compassion for the suffering of the Savior. The Holy Church opens before the eyes of believers a full picture of the redeeming suffering of the Lord beginning with the bloody sweat in the Garden of Gethsemane up to the crucifixion on Golgotha. Taking us back through the past centuries in thought, the Holy Church brings us to the foot of the cross of Christ erected on Golgotha and makes us present among the quivering spectators of all the torture of the Savior.<ref name=\"Bulg\">{{Cite book\n|last = Bulgakov\n|first = Sergei V.\n|year = 1900\n|title = Handbook for Church Servers|edition= 2nd\n|page = 543\n|chapter = Great Friday\n|place = Kharkov\n|publisher = Tr.

If someone is unable or has become very old [or is] unable to fast, he may be given bread and water after sunset. In this way we come to the holy commandment of the Holy Apostles not to eat on Great Friday.\"<ref name=\"Bulg\"/>\n\n===Matins of Holy and Great Friday===\nThe Byzantine Christian observance of Holy and Great Friday, which is formally known as '''The Order of Holy and Saving Passion of our Lord Jesus Christ''', begins on Thursday night with the '''''Matins of the Twelve Passion Gospels'''''. Scattered throughout this [[Matins]] service are twelve readings from all four of the Gospels which recount the events of the [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]] from the [[Last Supper]] through the [[Crucifixion]] and [[Holy Sepulchre|burial]] of Jesus. Some churches have a candelabrum with twelve candles on it, and after each Gospel reading one of the candles is extinguished.\n[[File:Agias Triados frescos cross.jpg|thumb|upright|Good Friday cross from the [[Katholikon|Catholicon]] at Holy Trinity Monastery, [[Meteora]], Greece]]\n\nThe first of these twelve readings {{Bibleverse||John|13:31\u201318:1|KJV}} is the longest Gospel reading of the [[Eastern Orthodox liturgical calendar|liturgical year]], and is a [[concatenation]] from all [[four Gospels]].

This service is also sometimes called ''Jerusalem Matins''. Much of the service takes place around the tomb of Christ in the center of the nave.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nA unique feature of the service is the chanting of the Lamentations or Praises (''[[Encomium|Enk\u014dmia]]''), which consist of verses chanted by the clergy interspersed between the verses of [[Psalm 119]] (which is, by far, the longest [[psalm]] in the Bible). The ''Enk\u014dmia'' are the best-loved hymns of Byzantine hymnography, both their poetry and their music being uniquely suited to each other and to the spirit of the day. They consist of 185 [[tercet]] [[antiphon]]s arranged in three parts (''st\u00e1seis'' or \"stops\"), which are interjected with the verses of Psalm 119, and nine short ''doxastik\u00e1'' (\"[[Gloria in excelsis Deo|Gloriae]]\") and ''Theot\u00f3kia'' (invocations to the Virgin Mary). The three ''st\u00e1seis'' are each set to its own music, and are commonly known by their initial antiphons: {{lang|grc|\u1f29 \u03b6\u03c9\u1f74 \u1f10\u03bd \u03c4\u03ac\u03c6\u1ff3}}, \"Life in a grave\", {{lang|grc|\u1f0c\u03be\u03b9\u03bf\u03bd \u1f10\u03c3\u03c4\u03af}}, \"Worthy it is\", and {{lang|grc|\u0391\u1f31 \u03b3\u03b5\u03bd\u03b5\u03b1\u1f76 \u03c0\u1fb6\u03c3\u03b1\u03b9}}, \"All the generations\".  Musically they can be classified as [[strophic]], with 75, 62, and 48 tercet [[stanza]]s each, respectively. The climax of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' comes during the third ''st\u00e1sis'', with the antiphon \"''\u014c glyk\u00fd mou \u00c9ar''\", a lamentation of the Virgin for her dead Child (\"O, my sweet spring, my sweetest child, where has your beauty gone?\"). The author(s) and date of the ''Enk\u014dmia'' are unknown.

Some churches observe the practice of holding the epitaphios at the door, above waist level, so the faithful most bow down under it as they come back into the church, symbolizing their entering into the death and resurrection of Christ.

During that time, Lutheranism had no restrictions on the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] on Good Friday; on the contrary, it was a prime day on which to receive the Eucharist, and services were often accentuated by special music such as the ''[[St Matthew Passion]]'' by [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\"/>\n\nMore recently, Lutheran liturgical practice has recaptured Good Friday as part of the larger sweep of the great Three Days: Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and the Vigil of Easter. The Three Days remain one liturgy which celebrates the death and resurrection of Jesus. As part of the liturgy of the Three Days, Lutherans generally fast from the Eucharist on Good Friday. Rather, it is celebrated in remembrance of the [[Last Supper]] on [[Maundy Thursday]] and at the [[Vigil of Easter]]. One practice among Lutheran churches is to celebrate a [[tenebrae]] service on Good Friday, typically conducted in candlelight and consisting of a collection of passion accounts from the four gospels. While being called \"Tenebrae\" it holds little resemblance to the now-suppressed Catholic monastic rite of the same name.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.historiclectionary.com/2010/03/a-word-about-tenebrae |title=A Word About Tenebrae &#124; |publisher=Historiclectionary.com |date=22 March 2010 |accessdate=23 April 2014}}</ref> The Good Friday liturgy appointed in ''[[Evangelical Lutheran Worship]]'', the worship book of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, specifies a liturgy similar to the revised Roman Catholic liturgy. A rite for adoration of the crucified Christ includes the optional singing of the Solemn Reproaches in an updated and revised translation which eliminates some of the anti-Jewish overtones in previous versions. Many Lutheran churches have Good Friday services, such as the [[Three Hours' Agony]] centered on the remembrance of the \"Seven Last Words,\" sayings of Jesus assembled from the four gospels, while others hold a liturgy that places an emphasis on the triumph of the cross, and a singular biblical account of the Passion narrative from the Gospel of John.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nAlong with observing a general Lenten fast,<ref name=\"GassmannOldenburg2011\">{{cite book|last1=Gassmann|first1=G\u00fcnther|last2=Oldenburg|first2=Mark W.|title=Historical Dictionary of Lutheranism|year=2011|publisher=Scarecrow Press|language=English|isbn=978-0810874824|page=229|quote=In many Lutheran churches, the Sundays during the Lenten season are called by the first word of their respective Latin Introitus (with the exception of Palm/Passion Sunday): Invocavit, Reminiscere, Oculi, Laetare, and Judica.

Easter falls on the first Sunday following the Paschal Full Moon, the full moon on or after 21 March, taken to be the date of the vernal [[equinox]]. The Western calculation uses the [[Gregorian calendar]], while the Eastern calculation uses the [[Julian calendar]], whose 21 March now corresponds to the Gregorian calendar's 3 April. The calculations for identifying the date of the full moon also differ. See [[Computus]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn Eastern Christianity, Easter can fall between 22 March and 25 April on Julian Calendar (thus between 4 April and 8 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar, during the period 1900 and 2099), so Good Friday can fall between 20 March and 23 April, inclusive (or between 2 April and 6 May in terms of the Gregorian calendar).{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n{{Lent_calendar.svg|none{{!}}400px\n}}\n\n==Cultural references==\nGood Friday assumes a particular importance in the plot of [[Richard Wagner]]'s music drama ''[[Parsifal]]'', which contains an orchestral interlude known as the \"Good Friday Music\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/arts/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/good-friday-music|title=Good Friday Music \u2013 Dictionary definition of Good Friday Music |publisher=Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|accessdate=17 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Criticism from non-observers==\nSome [[Baptist]] congregations,<ref>{{cite web|first=L.

U.S. recessions have increasingly affected economies on a worldwide scale, especially as countries' economies [[Economic globalization|become more intertwined]].\n\nThe unofficial beginning and ending dates of recessions in the United States have been defined by the [[National Bureau of Economic Research]] (NBER), an American [[Privately held company|private]] nonprofit research organization. The NBER defines a [[recession]] as \"a significant decline in economic activity spread across the [[Economy of the United States|economy]], lasting more than two quarters which is 6 months, normally visible in real [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), real income, employment, industrial production, and wholesale-retail sales\".<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions.html|title=The NBER's Recession Dating Procedure |publisher=National Bureau of Economic Research|date=October 21, 2003|author=Hall, Robert }}</ref>{{#tag:ref|The rule of thumb defining recession as two [[Fiscal year|quarters]] of negative GDP growth is not used by NBER.<ref>{{cite web|title=The NBER's Recession Dating Procedure: Frequently Asked Questions|url=https://www.nber.org/cycles/recessions_faq.html|publisher=[[National Bureau of Economic Research]]|accessdate=October 21, 2009}}</ref> The NBER looks for monthly dating (GDP is a quarterly figure) and GDP will sometimes be positive even in clear periods of decline, e.g. in the second quarter of 1974, GDP was slightly positive even in the middle of the severe [[1973\u201375 recession]].|group=\"nb\"}}\n\nIn the 19th century, recessions frequently coincided with [[Financial crisis|financial crises]]. Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of [[economic statistics]], so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions. Their work is aided by historical patterns, in that recessions often follow external shocks to the [[economic system]] such as wars and variations in the weather affecting agriculture, as well as banking crises.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=February 29, 2008|url=https://www.bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|title=Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product Accounts 1929 through Second Quarter 2003|publisher=[[Bureau of Economic Analysis]]|date=December 10, 2003|author=Brent Moulton|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920053305/http://bea.gov/newsreleases/national/nipa/2003/2003cr_newsrelease.htm|archive-date=2008-09-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nMajor modern economic statistics, such as [[unemployment]] and GDP, were not compiled on a regular and standardized basis until after World War II.

The downturn was exacerbated by the absence of any significant interstate trade.

Compared to today, the era from 1834 to the Great Depression was characterized by relatively severe and more frequent banking panics and recessions.]]\nIn the 1830s, U.S. President [[Andrew Jackson]] fought to end the [[Second Bank of the United States]]. Following the [[Bank War]], the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was [[Free banking era|no national presence in banking]], but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the [[National Banking Act]], creating [[History of central banking in the United States#1863\u20131913: National Banks|nationally chartered banks]]. There was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, and thus banking panics were common. Recessions often led to bank panics and financial crises, which in turn worsened the recession.{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as [[gross domestic product]] and unemployment, were not gathered during this period. [[Victor Zarnowitz]] evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions. From 1834 to 1929, one measure of recessions is the Cleveland Trust Company index, which measured business activity and, beginning in 1882, an index of trade and industrial activity was available, which can be used to compare recessions.<ref group=\"nb\" name=Zarn/>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"width: 100%\"\n|+ US recessions, Free Banking Era to the Great Depression\n! style=\"width:100px;\" class=\"unsortable\"|Name\n! style=\"width:100px;\"|Dates{{#tag:ref|The NBER's monthly chronology of recessions begins in 1854.

Determining the occurrence of pre-20th-century recessions is more difficult due to the dearth of [[economic statistics]], so scholars rely on historical accounts of economic activity, such as contemporary newspapers or business ledgers. Although the NBER does not date recessions before 1857, economists customarily extrapolate dates of U.S. recessions back to 1790 from business annals based on various contemporary descriptions.

Following the [[Bank War]], the Second Bank lost its charter in 1836. From 1837 to 1862, there was [[Free banking era|no national presence in banking]], but still plenty of state and even local regulation, such as laws against branch banking which prevented diversification. In 1863, in response to financing pressures of the Civil War, Congress passed the [[National Banking Act]], creating [[History of central banking in the United States#1863\u20131913: National Banks|nationally chartered banks]]. There was neither a central bank nor deposit insurance during this era, and thus banking panics were common. Recessions often led to bank panics and financial crises, which in turn worsened the recession.{{Citation Needed|date=March 2020}}\n\nThe dating of recessions during this period is controversial. Modern economic statistics, such as [[gross domestic product]] and unemployment, were not gathered during this period. [[Victor Zarnowitz]] evaluated a variety of indices to measure the severity of these recessions.

That causes confusion for school children, who need to learn which words to write with ''ei'' and which with ''ij''. To distinguish between the two, the ''ij'' is referred to as the {{Lang|nl|lange ij|italic=yes}} (\"long ''ij''\"), the ''ei'' as {{Lang|nl|korte ei|italic=yes}} (\"short ''ei''\") or simply ''E{{snd}}I''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal | language = Dutch | pages = 22\u201323}}.</ref> In certain Dutch dialects (notably [[West Flemish]] and [[Zeelandic]]) and the [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects of [[Low German]], a difference in the pronunciation of ''ei'' and ''ij'' is maintained. Whether it is pronounced identically to ''ei'' or not, the pronunciation of ''ij'' is often perceived as being difficult by people who do not have either sound in their native language.\n\nThe ''ij'' originally represented a 'long i'.<ref name=\"IJ origins\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-oorsprong-van-de-lange-ij |title=IJ: oorsprong van de lange ij |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch}}</ref> This can still be seen in the etymology of some words and in the Dutch form of several foreign placenames: [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] are spelled {{Lang|nl|Berlijn}} and {{Lang|nl|Parijs}}. Nowadays, the pronunciation follows the spelling, and they are pronounced with {{IPA |[\u025bi]}}. The ''ij'' is distinct from the letter ''[[Y|y]]''. Particularly when writing capitals, Y used to be common instead of IJ.That practice has long been deprecated and occurs instead in the derived language [[Afrikaans]], but the standard Dutch pronunciation of the letter Y is still ''ij'' when the alphabet is read.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\">{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1194/ij_alfabetiseren |title=IJ - alfabetiseren |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> In scientific disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the symbol ''y'' is usually pronounced ''ij''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-plaats-in-alfabet |title=IJ: plaats in alfabet |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo distinguish the ''Y'' from ''IJ'' in common speech, however, ''Y'' is often called {{Lang|nl|Griekse ij|italic=yes}} (\"Greek ''Y''\"), ''{{Lang|fr|i-grec}}'' (the latter from [[French language|French]], with the stress on ''grec'': {{IPA-nl|i\u02c8\u0261r\u025bk|}}), or ''[[Ypsilon]]''.

Furthermore, the names of Dutch immigrants to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were often [[anglicised]], with the ''IJ'' becoming a ''Y''. For example, the surname ''{{Lang|nl|Spijker}}'' was often changed into ''Spyker'' and ''Snijder'' into ''[[Snyder (surname)|Snyder]]''.\n[[File:IJ (letter).svg|thumb|The words ''{{Lang|nl|ijsvrij}}'' and ''yoghurt'' in various forms. Depending on the form of handwriting or font used, the IJ and Y can look either nearly identical or very different.]]\n[[File:Comparison of normal and italic of ij and \u00ff.svg|thumb|Apt to confusion: (1) i + j, (2) ligature ij, (3) y with diaeresis, (4) y in [[Garamond]]]]\n[[File:Rijks museum logo.png|thumb|Logo of the [[Rijksmuseum]] in Amsterdam]]\n[[File:Station Rijssen.jpg|thumb|The name of a railway station]]\n[[File:Spandoek Hengelo.jpg|thumb|IJ here is written as one letter.]]\n[[File:Graffiti viaduct boven A1.jpg|thumb|Here, IJ is written as Y.]]\n\n==History==\n{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}\n''IJ'' probably developed out of ''ii'', representing a long {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} sound (which it still does in some cases, such as in the word ''{{Lang|nl|bijzonder}}'' and in several Dutch dialects).<ref name=\"IJ origins\" /> In the [[Middle Ages]], the ''i'' was written without a [[tittle|dot]] in handwriting, and the combination ''\u0131\u0131'' was often confused with ''u''.  Therefore, the second ''i'' was elongated: ''\u0131\u0237''. Later, the dots were added, albeit not in [[Afrikaans]], a language that has its roots in Dutch. In this language ''y'' is used instead.\n\nAlternatively, the letter [[J]] may have developed as a [[swash (typography)|swash]] form of ''i''. In other European languages it was first used for the final ''i'' in [[Roman numerals]] when there was more than one ''i'' in a row, such as ''iij'' for \"three\", to prevent the fraudulent addition of an extra ''i'' to change the number. In Dutch, which had a native ''ii'', the \"final ''i'' in a row elongated\" rule was applied as well, leading to ''ij''.\n\nAnother theory is that ''IJ'' might have arisen from the lowercase ''y'' being split into two strokes in handwriting. At some time in the 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ''ij''. An argument against this theory is that even in handwriting which does not join letters, ''ij'' is often written as a single sign.\n\nSome time after the birth of this new letter, the sound which was now represented by ''ij'', in most cases, began to be pronounced much like ''ei'' instead, but words containing it were still spelled the same. Nowadays, ''ij'' in most cases represents the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, except in the suffix ''-lijk'', where it is usually pronounced as a [[schwa]]. In one special case, the Dutch word ''bijzonder'', the (old) sound {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} is correct standard pronunciation, although {{IPA|[i]}} is more common and {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} is also allowed.\n\nIn [[proper noun|proper names]], ''ij'' often appears instead of ''i'' at the end of other [[diphthong]]s, where it does not affect the pronunciation: ''aaij'', ''eij'', ''oeij'', ''ooij'' and ''uij'' are pronounced identically to ''aai'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0i]}}, ''ei'' {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, ''oei'' {{IPA|[ui]}}, ''ooi'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0i]}} and ''ui'' {{IPA|[\u0153y]}}. This derives from an old orthographic practice (also seen in older French and German) of writing ''y'' instead of ''i'' after another vowel; later, when ''y'' and ''ij'' came to be seen as interchangeable, the spellings with ''ij'' came to be used. [[History of Dutch orthography|Spelling reforms and standardization]] have removed the redundant ''j''s in common words, but proper names continue to use these archaic spellings.\n\n==Status==\n[[File:Dutch handwriting sample.png|thumb|A poster showing the letters of the alphabet used for writing education in the Netherlands. The final three letter pairs read \"Xx IJij Zz\".]]\n[[File:Leesplankje van Hoogeveen (2).png|thumb|In this version the ij is a single glyph.]]\nAs the rules of usage for the ''IJ'' differ from those that apply to the many other digraphs in the Dutch language{{snd}}in some situations behaving more as a single ligature or letter than a digraph{{snd}}the ''IJ'' is not only confusing to foreigners, but also a source of discussion among native speakers of Dutch. Its actual usage in the [[Netherlands]] and in Flanders ([[Belgium]]) sometimes differs from the official recommendations.\n\n===Official status===\nBoth the [[Dutch Language Union]] and the [[Genootschap Onze Taal]] consider the ''ij'' to be a digraph of the letters ''i'' and ''j''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /><ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" /> The descriptive dictionary ''[[Van Dale|Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal]]'' states that ''ij'' is a \"letter combination consisting of the signs i and j, used, in some words, to represent the diphthong \u025bi.\"<ref name=\"dikkevandale\">''Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'': \"lettercombinatie bestaande uit de tekens i en j, gebruikt om, in een aantal woorden, de tweeklank \u025bi weer te geven\"</ref> The ''[[Winkler Prins]]'' encyclopedia states that ''ij'' is the 25th letter of the Dutch alphabet, placed between ''X'' and ''Y''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, this definition is not generally accepted.\n\nIn words where ''i'' and ''j'' are in different syllables, they [[#Not as a digraph|do not]] form the digraph ''ij''.

However, ''ij'' is according to Onze Taal not part of the Dutch alphabet and is usually sorted under the ''i'' as it is considered to consist of two letters.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" />\n* When a word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: {{Lang|nl|[[IJsselmeer]]}}, {{Lang|nl|[[IJmuiden]]}}.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" />\n* On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces 'ij' (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the ''L''). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.\n* In word puzzles, ''ij'' often fills one square.\n\n===Flanders===\nIn Flanders (Belgium), ''IJ'' is generally described in schools as a combination of two separate characters.\n\n* As in the Netherlands, words that begin with ''IJ'' usually capitalise the entire pair: ''[[Yser|IJzer]]'', ''[[IJzertoren]]''.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Capitalisation===\nWhen a Dutch word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: ''IJsselmeer'', ''IJmuiden''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1188 |title=Ijsland / IJsland |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firefox]] version 14.0 and above knows that ''ijsselmeer'' can be capitalized as ''IJsselmeer'' with [[CSS]] property <code>text-transform: capitalize</code>, this is requiring <code>lang=\"nl\"</code> attribute to indicate Dutch locale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform |title=text-transform - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets {{!}} MDN |work=MDN Web Docs |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Collation===\n[[Dutch dictionaries]] since about 1850 invariably sort ''ij'' as an ''i'' followed by a ''j'', i.e. between ''ih'' and ''ik''. This is the preferred sorting by the [[Taalunie]].<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /> On the other hand, some encyclopedias, like the ''[[Winkler Prins]]'', 7th edition, sort ''ij'' as a single letter positioned between ''x'' and ''y''.\n\n[[Telephone directory|Telephone directories]] as well as the [[Yellow Pages]] in the Netherlands (but not those in Belgium) sort ''ij'' and ''y'' together, as if they were the same, between ''x'' and ''z''. Thanks to this, surnames like ''Bruijn'' and ''Bruyn'' which sound the same (and even look similar), can be found in the same area. However, ''Bruin'', though it sounds the same as well, is placed with \"Brui-\" and not with \"Bruy-\".\n\n===Abbreviations===\nWhen words or (first) names are shortened to their initials, in the Netherlands a word or proper name starting with ''IJ'' is abbreviated to ''IJ''. For example, ''IJsbrand Eises Ypma'' is shortened to ''IJ. E. Ypma''.<ref name =\"eu\">{{cite web| first =Yuri | last = Demchenko |url= http://www.uazone.org/multiling/euroml/annex02.html | title =European rules for the use of the IJ in public records |publisher=UA zone |accessdate=2012-07-19}}</ref> Note that the digraph \"ei\" in \"Eises\", like other digraphs in Dutch, is shortened to one letter.\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Bijna.png|thumb|The Dutch word \"bijna\" (almost, nearly) with ''ad hoc'' stress on the first syllable indicated by two acute accents on the digraph ''ij''.]]\nIn Dutch orthography, ''ad hoc'' indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] can be marked by placing an [[acute accent]] on the vowel of the stressed syllable. In case of a diphthong or double vowel, both vowels should be marked with an acute accent; this also applies to the ''IJ'' (even though ''J'' by itself is not a vowel, the digraph ''IJ'' represents one distinct vowel sound). However, due to technical limitations the accent on the ''j'' is often omitted in electronic documents: \"b\u00edjna\".<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/tekst/16/klemtoonteken_algemeen/ Klemtoonteken (algemeen)], Nederlandse Taalunie</ref> Nevertheless, in [[Unicode]] it is possible to [[Combining character|combine characters]] into a ''j'' with an acute accent{{snd}}\"b\u00edj\u0301na\" {{snd}}though this might not be supported or rendered correctly by some [[Computer font|fonts]] or systems.

The [[Feijenoord district]] in [[Rotterdam]], where the team is from, still writes its name using the original ''ij''.\n\n===Phonetic Radio Alphabet===\nIn the Dutch phonetic [[radio alphabet]], the codeword {{Lang|nl|IJmuiden|italic=yes}} represents the ''IJ''. This is clearly different from the codeword ''Ypsilon'', which is used to represent the ''Y''. Dutch and Belgian armed forces use the official [[NATO phonetic alphabet]], \"Y\" is \"Yankee\" and \"IJ\" is spelled out \"India Juliett\".\n\n===Word games===\nIn [[crossword puzzle]]s (except for [[Scrabble]]{{snd}}see next paragraph), and in the game [[Lingo (Dutch game show)|Lingo]], ''IJ'' is considered one letter, filling one square, but the ''IJ'' and the ''Y'' are considered distinct. In other word games, the rules may vary.\n\nThe Dutch version of Scrabble has a ''Y'' with a face value of eight.  Some players used it to represent ''IJ'' or ''Y''. The recent Dutch version comes with an example game, which clearly indicates that ''Y'' is only ''Y'', and ''IJ'' should be composed of ''I'' and ''J''. In previous editions of Scrabble there was a single IJ sign.<!-- http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/details/dutch/ is definitely incorrect - the face values differ too-->\n\nIn word games that make a distinction between vowels and consonants, ''IJ'' is considered to be a vowel, if it is considered one letter. Whether ''Y'' is a vowel or a consonant, is another matter of discussion, since ''Y'' can represent both a vowel or a (half-)consonant.\n\n==Technical details==\n===Print and handwriting===\n[[File:Amsterdamse tram - De Red Crosser - from Flickr 2838709455 cropped lijnbus.jpg|thumb|{{lang|nl|Lijnbus}} ([[public bus]], literally \"line bus\") road marking with IJ as a \"broken U\" glyph]]\nIn print, the letter ''\u00ff'' (lowercase [[y]] with [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and ''ij'' look very different, but [[handwriting]] usually makes  ''\u00ff'', ''ij'' and ''Y'', ''IJ'' look identical. However, since ''y'' occurs only in loanwords, the letter ''\u00ff'' is extremely rare (if not altogether nonexistent) in Dutch.\n\nThe ''long ij'' extends below the baseline and so is written with a long stroke. It is often written as a single sign, even in handwriting that does not join letters.\n\nOn some road signs in the Netherlands, ''IJ'' appears as a single glyph formed like a ''U'' with a break in the left-hand stroke.\n[[File:\u0132 uppercase ligature.svg|thumb|upright|Uppercase IJ glyph with the distinctive \"broken U\" [[Typographical ligature|ligature]] in a [[Helvetica]] font for [[Omega (TeX)|Omega TeX]]]]\n\n===Braille===\n[[Dutch Braille]], which is used in the Netherlands, has {{angbr|ij}} represented by {{bc|y}}, which represents {{angbr|y}} in other varieties of Braille. {{angbr|y}} is written as {{bc|6|y}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kim |last=Bols |url=http://www.kimbols.be/hulp/braille/brailleschrift.php |title=Het brailleschrift |publisher=Kimbols |place=[[Belgium|BE]] |access-date=2007-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209075837/http://kimbols.be/hulp/braille/brailleschrift.php |archive-date=2009-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, [[French Braille]] is used, in which {{angbr|ij}} is written simply as {{angbr|i}} + {{angbr|j}}: {{bc|i|j}}.\n\n===Encoding===\nThe Dutch ''ij'' is not present in the [[ASCII]] code, nor in any of the [[ISO 8859]] [[character encoding]]s.

To distinguish between the two, the ''ij'' is referred to as the {{Lang|nl|lange ij|italic=yes}} (\"long ''ij''\"), the ''ei'' as {{Lang|nl|korte ei|italic=yes}} (\"short ''ei''\") or simply ''E{{snd}}I''.<ref>{{Citation | title = Woordenlijst Nederlandse Taal | language = Dutch | pages = 22\u201323}}.</ref> In certain Dutch dialects (notably [[West Flemish]] and [[Zeelandic]]) and the [[Dutch Low Saxon]] dialects of [[Low German]], a difference in the pronunciation of ''ei'' and ''ij'' is maintained. Whether it is pronounced identically to ''ei'' or not, the pronunciation of ''ij'' is often perceived as being difficult by people who do not have either sound in their native language.\n\nThe ''ij'' originally represented a 'long i'.<ref name=\"IJ origins\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-oorsprong-van-de-lange-ij |title=IJ: oorsprong van de lange ij |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch}}</ref> This can still be seen in the etymology of some words and in the Dutch form of several foreign placenames: [[Berlin]] and [[Paris]] are spelled {{Lang|nl|Berlijn}} and {{Lang|nl|Parijs}}. Nowadays, the pronunciation follows the spelling, and they are pronounced with {{IPA |[\u025bi]}}. The ''ij'' is distinct from the letter ''[[Y|y]]''. Particularly when writing capitals, Y used to be common instead of IJ.That practice has long been deprecated and occurs instead in the derived language [[Afrikaans]], but the standard Dutch pronunciation of the letter Y is still ''ij'' when the alphabet is read.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\">{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1194/ij_alfabetiseren |title=IJ - alfabetiseren |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> In scientific disciplines such as [[mathematics]] and [[physics]], the symbol ''y'' is usually pronounced ''ij''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\">{{cite web |url=https://onzetaal.nl/taaladvies/advies/ij-plaats-in-alfabet |title=IJ: plaats in alfabet |work=Genootschap Onze Taal |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nTo distinguish the ''Y'' from ''IJ'' in common speech, however, ''Y'' is often called ''{{Lang|nl|Griekse ij}}'' (\"Greek ''Y''\"), ''{{Lang|fr|i-grec}}'' (the latter from [[French language|French]], with the stress on ''grec'': {{IPA-nl|i\u02c8\u0261r\u025bk|}}), or ''[[Ypsilon]]''.

Furthermore, the names of Dutch immigrants to the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] were often [[anglicised]], with the ''IJ'' becoming a ''Y''. For example, the surname ''{{Lang|nl|Spijker}}'' was often changed into ''Spyker'' and ''Snijder'' into ''[[Snyder (surname)|Snyder]]''.\n[[File:IJ (letter).svg|thumb|The words ''{{Lang|nl|ijsvrij}}'' and ''yoghurt'' in various forms.

Therefore, the second ''i'' was elongated: ''\u0131\u0237''. Later, the dots were added, albeit not in [[Afrikaans]], a language that has its roots in Dutch. In this language ''y'' is used instead.\n\nAlternatively, the letter [[J]] may have developed as a [[swash (typography)|swash]] form of ''i''. In other European languages it was first used for the final ''i'' in [[Roman numerals]] when there was more than one ''i'' in a row, such as ''iij'' for \"three\", to prevent the fraudulent addition of an extra ''i'' to change the number. In Dutch, which had a native ''ii'', the \"final ''i'' in a row elongated\" rule was applied as well, leading to ''ij''.\n\nAnother theory is that ''IJ'' might have arisen from the lowercase ''y'' being split into two strokes in handwriting. At some time in the 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ''ij''. An argument against this theory is that even in handwriting which does not join letters, ''ij'' is often written as a single sign.\n\nSome time after the birth of this new letter, the sound which was now represented by ''ij'', in most cases, began to be pronounced much like ''ei'' instead, but words containing it were still spelled the same. Nowadays, ''ij'' in most cases represents the [[diphthong]] {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, except in the suffix ''-lijk'', where it is usually pronounced as a [[schwa]]. In one special case, the Dutch word ''bijzonder'', the (old) sound {{IPA|[i\u02d0]}} is correct standard pronunciation, although {{IPA|[i]}} is more common and {{IPA|[\u025bi]}} is also allowed.\n\nIn [[proper noun|proper names]], ''ij'' often appears instead of ''i'' at the end of other [[diphthong]]s, where it does not affect the pronunciation: ''aaij'', ''eij'', ''oeij'', ''ooij'' and ''uij'' are pronounced identically to ''aai'' {{IPA|[a\u02d0i]}}, ''ei'' {{IPA|[\u025bi]}}, ''oei'' {{IPA|[ui]}}, ''ooi'' {{IPA|[o\u02d0i]}} and ''ui'' {{IPA|[\u0153y]}}. This derives from an old orthographic practice (also seen in older French and German) of writing ''y'' instead of ''i'' after another vowel; later, when ''y'' and ''ij'' came to be seen as interchangeable, the spellings with ''ij'' came to be used. [[History of Dutch orthography|Spelling reforms and standardization]] have removed the redundant ''j''s in common words, but proper names continue to use these archaic spellings.\n\n==Status==\n[[File:Dutch handwriting sample.png|thumb|A poster showing the letters of the alphabet used for writing education in the Netherlands. The final three letter pairs read \"Xx IJij Zz\".]]\n[[File:Leesplankje van Hoogeveen (2).png|thumb|In this version the ij is a single glyph.]]\nAs the rules of usage for the ''IJ'' differ from those that apply to the many other digraphs in the Dutch language{{snd}}in some situations behaving more as a single ligature or letter than a digraph{{snd}}the ''IJ'' is not only confusing to foreigners, but also a source of discussion among native speakers of Dutch. Its actual usage in the [[Netherlands]] and in Flanders ([[Belgium]]) sometimes differs from the official recommendations.\n\n===Official status===\nBoth the [[Dutch Language Union]] and the [[Genootschap Onze Taal]] consider the ''ij'' to be a digraph of the letters ''i'' and ''j''.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /><ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" /> The descriptive dictionary ''[[Van Dale|Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal]]'' states that ''ij'' is a \"letter combination consisting of the signs i and j, used, in some words, to represent the diphthong \u025bi.\"<ref name=\"dikkevandale\">''Van Dale Groot woordenboek van de Nederlandse taal'': \"lettercombinatie bestaande uit de tekens i en j, gebruikt om, in een aantal woorden, de tweeklank \u025bi weer te geven\"</ref> The ''[[Winkler Prins]]'' encyclopedia states that ''ij'' is the 25th letter of the Dutch alphabet, placed between ''X'' and ''Y''.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} However, this definition is not generally accepted.\n\nIn words where ''i'' and ''j'' are in different syllables, they [[#Not as a digraph|do not]] form the digraph ''ij''. In [[compound (linguistics)|compound words]], a [[hyphen]] is added, as in ''gummi-jas''.<ref>[http://woordenlijst.org/leidraad/7/1 Welke klinkers botsen?], Taalunie {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n===Netherlands===\nIn the Netherlands, ''IJ'' is often used as a ligature:\n\n* In Dutch primary schools, ''ij'' used to be taught as being the 25th letter of the alphabet, and some primary school writing materials list 'ij' as the 25th letter of the alphabet. However, ''ij'' is according to Onze Taal not part of the Dutch alphabet and is usually sorted under the ''i'' as it is considered to consist of two letters.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" />\n* When a word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: {{Lang|nl|[[IJsselmeer]]}}, {{Lang|nl|[[IJmuiden]]}}.<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Onze Taal\" />\n* On mechanical Dutch typewriters, there is a key that produces 'ij' (in a single letterspace, located directly to the right of the ''L''). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.\n* In word puzzles, ''ij'' often fills one square.\n\n===Flanders===\nIn Flanders (Belgium), ''IJ'' is generally described in schools as a combination of two separate characters.\n\n* As in the Netherlands, words that begin with ''IJ'' usually capitalise the entire pair: ''[[Yser|IJzer]]'', ''[[IJzertoren]]''.\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Capitalisation===\nWhen a Dutch word starting with ''IJ'' is capitalised, the entire digraph is capitalised: ''IJsselmeer'', ''IJmuiden''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/vraag/1188 |title=Ijsland / IJsland |work=Nederlandse Taalunie |language=Dutch |accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[Firefox]] version 14.0 and above knows that ''ijsselmeer'' can be capitalized as ''IJsselmeer'' with [[CSS]] property <code>text-transform: capitalize</code>, this is requiring <code>lang=\"nl\"</code> attribute to indicate Dutch locale.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/text-transform |title=text-transform - CSS: Cascading Style Sheets {{!}} MDN |work=MDN Web Docs |accessdate=30 September 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Collation===\n[[Dutch dictionaries]] since about 1850 invariably sort ''ij'' as an ''i'' followed by a ''j'', i.e. between ''ih'' and ''ik''. This is the preferred sorting by the [[Taalunie]].<ref name=\"IJ in alphabet Taalunie\" /> On the other hand, some encyclopedias, like the ''[[Winkler Prins]]'', 7th edition, sort ''ij'' as a single letter positioned between ''x'' and ''y''.\n\n[[Telephone directory|Telephone directories]] as well as the [[Yellow Pages]] in the Netherlands (but not those in Belgium) sort ''ij'' and ''y'' together, as if they were the same, between ''x'' and ''z''. Thanks to this, surnames like ''Bruijn'' and ''Bruyn'' which sound the same (and even look similar), can be found in the same area. However, ''Bruin'', though it sounds the same as well, is placed with \"Brui-\" and not with \"Bruy-\".\n\n===Abbreviations===\nWhen words or (first) names are shortened to their initials, in the Netherlands a word or proper name starting with ''IJ'' is abbreviated to ''IJ''. For example, ''IJsbrand Eises Ypma'' is shortened to ''IJ. E. Ypma''.<ref name =\"eu\">{{cite web| first =Yuri | last = Demchenko |url= http://www.uazone.org/multiling/euroml/annex02.html | title =European rules for the use of the IJ in public records |publisher=UA zone |accessdate=2012-07-19}}</ref> Note that the digraph \"ei\" in \"Eises\", like other digraphs in Dutch, is shortened to one letter.\n\n===Stress===\n[[File:Bijna.png|thumb|The Dutch word \"bijna\" (almost, nearly) with ''ad hoc'' stress on the first syllable indicated by two acute accents on the digraph ''ij''.]]\nIn Dutch orthography, ''ad hoc'' indication of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] can be marked by placing an [[acute accent]] on the vowel of the stressed syllable. In case of a diphthong or double vowel, both vowels should be marked with an acute accent; this also applies to the ''IJ'' (even though ''J'' by itself is not a vowel, the digraph ''IJ'' represents one distinct vowel sound). However, due to technical limitations the accent on the ''j'' is often omitted in electronic documents: \"b\u00edjna\".<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [http://taaladvies.net/taal/advies/tekst/16/klemtoonteken_algemeen/ Klemtoonteken (algemeen)], Nederlandse Taalunie</ref> Nevertheless, in [[Unicode]] it is possible to [[Combining character|combine characters]] into a ''j'' with an acute accent{{snd}}\"b\u00edj\u0301na\" {{snd}}though this might not be supported or rendered correctly by some [[Computer font|fonts]] or systems. This ''j\u0301'' is the combination of the regular (soft-dotted) ''j'' (U+006A) and the combining acute accent &nbsp;\u0301 (U+0301).\n\n===Spelling===\n{{Lang|nl|Vrijdag}} can be spelled out in two ways, depending on whether the speller considers ''ij'' to be one letter or not:\n\n* ''V \u2013 R \u2013 IJ \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 G''\n* ''V \u2013 R \u2013 I \u2013 J \u2013 D \u2013 A \u2013 G''\n\n===Wide inter-letter spacing===\n[[File:Signboard-slijterij.jpg|thumb|upright|On this signboard of an alcohol store ({{Lang|nl|slijterij}}), IJ occupies the same space as single letters. The I is put over the lower end of the J to reinforce their unity, but this is optional and I and J can also be found separately on other signs]]\n\nWhen words are written with large inter-letter spacing, ''IJ'' is often, but not always, kept together. ''F&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp;r&nbsp;ij&nbsp;k'' or ''F&nbsp;r&nbsp;a&nbsp;n&nbsp;k&nbsp;r&nbsp;i&nbsp;j&nbsp;k''.\n\nWhen words are written from top to bottom, with non-rotated letters, ''IJ'' is usually, but not always, kept together. Keeping it together is the preferred way.<ref name=\"eu\"/>\n\n{| cellspacing=\"20\"\n|\n''F''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''a''<br />\n''n''<br />\n''k''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''ij''<br />\n''k''\n|or\n|\n''F''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''a''<br />\n''n''<br />\n''k''<br />\n''r''<br />\n''i''<br />\n''j''<br />\n''k''\n|}\n\n===Spelling of proper names===\nIn Dutch names, interchangeability of ''i'', ''ij'' and ''y'' is frequent. Some names are changed unofficially for commercial reasons or by indifference:\n\n* [[Johan Cruyff|Johan Cruijff/Cruyff]], former football player and manager\n* [[Ruud van Nistelrooy|Ruud van Nistelrooij/Nistelrooy]], football player\n* [[Piet Pieterszoon Hein|Piet Heijn/Heyn/Hein]], a [[Dutch West India Company]] admiral\n* [[Dirk Kuyt|Dirk Kuijt/Kuyt]], football player\n* [[Arie Luyendyk|Arie Luijendijk/Luyendyk]], a race-driver\n* [[Spyker|Spijker/Spyker]], car manufacturer\n* [[Anner Bylsma|Anner Bijlsma/Bylsma]], cellist\n\nThe Dutch football team of [[Feyenoord Rotterdam|Feyenoord]] changed its name from the original \"{{Lang|nl|Feijenoord|italic=unset}}\" to \"{{Lang|nl|Feyenoord|italic=unset}}\" after achieving international successes. This was done as a reaction to foreign people often mispronouncing the name. The [[Feijenoord district]] in [[Rotterdam]], where the team is from, still writes its name using the original ''ij''.\n\n===Phonetic Radio Alphabet===\nIn the Dutch phonetic [[radio alphabet]], the codeword {{Lang|nl|IJmuiden|italic=yes}} represents the ''IJ''. This is clearly different from the codeword ''Ypsilon'', which is used to represent the ''Y''. Dutch and Belgian armed forces use the official [[NATO phonetic alphabet]], \"Y\" is \"Yankee\" and \"IJ\" is spelled out \"India Juliett\".\n\n===Word games===\nIn [[crossword puzzle]]s (except for [[Scrabble]]{{snd}}see next paragraph), and in the game [[Lingo (Dutch game show)|Lingo]], ''IJ'' is considered one letter, filling one square, but the ''IJ'' and the ''Y'' are considered distinct. In other word games, the rules may vary.\n\nThe Dutch version of Scrabble has a ''Y'' with a face value of eight.  Some players used it to represent ''IJ'' or ''Y''. The recent Dutch version comes with an example game, which clearly indicates that ''Y'' is only ''Y'', and ''IJ'' should be composed of ''I'' and ''J''. In previous editions of Scrabble there was a single IJ sign.<!-- http://www.gtoal.com/wordgames/details/dutch/ is definitely incorrect - the face values differ too-->\n\nIn word games that make a distinction between vowels and consonants, ''IJ'' is considered to be a vowel, if it is considered one letter. Whether ''Y'' is a vowel or a consonant, is another matter of discussion, since ''Y'' can represent both a vowel or a (half-)consonant.\n\n==Technical details==\n===Print and handwriting===\n[[File:Amsterdamse tram - De Red Crosser - from Flickr 2838709455 cropped lijnbus.jpg|thumb|{{lang|nl|Lijnbus}} ([[public bus]], literally \"line bus\") road marking with IJ as a \"broken U\" glyph]]\nIn print, the letter ''\u00ff'' (lowercase [[y]] with [[diaeresis (diacritic)|diaeresis]]) and ''ij'' look very different, but [[handwriting]] usually makes  ''\u00ff'', ''ij'' and ''Y'', ''IJ'' look identical. However, since ''y'' occurs only in loanwords, the letter ''\u00ff'' is extremely rare (if not altogether nonexistent) in Dutch.\n\nThe ''long ij'' extends below the baseline and so is written with a long stroke. It is often written as a single sign, even in handwriting that does not join letters.\n\nOn some road signs in the Netherlands, ''IJ'' appears as a single glyph formed like a ''U'' with a break in the left-hand stroke.\n[[File:\u0132 uppercase ligature.svg|thumb|upright|Uppercase IJ glyph with the distinctive \"broken U\" [[Typographical ligature|ligature]] in a [[Helvetica]] font for [[Omega (TeX)|Omega TeX]]]]\n\n===Braille===\n[[Dutch Braille]], which is used in the Netherlands, has {{angbr|ij}} represented by {{bc|y}}, which represents {{angbr|y}} in other varieties of Braille. {{angbr|y}} is written as {{bc|6|y}}.<ref>{{cite web |first=Kim |last=Bols |url=http://www.kimbols.be/hulp/braille/brailleschrift.php |title=Het brailleschrift |publisher=Kimbols |place=[[Belgium|BE]] |access-date=2007-06-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090209075837/http://kimbols.be/hulp/braille/brailleschrift.php |archive-date=2009-02-09 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nIn Belgium, [[French Braille]] is used, in which {{angbr|ij}} is written simply as {{angbr|i}} + {{angbr|j}}: {{bc|i|j}}.\n\n===Encoding===\nThe Dutch ''ij'' is not present in the [[ASCII]] code, nor in any of the [[ISO 8859]] [[character encoding]]s.

The standard US layout (often in \"[[US-International|International Mode]]\") is widely used, although a specific but rarely used Dutch variant (KBD143) does exist. In Belgium, a specific Belgian variant of [[AZERTY]] keyboard layout (KBD120) is widely used. None of these keyboards feature a key for ''\u0133'' or ''\u0132''.\n\n==Not as a digraph==\n[[File:Bijoux fout gespeld.jpg|thumb|upright|This Dutch shopkeeper wrote 'byoux' instead of '{{Lang|fr|[[Bijou (jewellery)|bijoux]]|italic=unset}}<nowiki/>'.]]\nIf the ''i'' and the ''j'' belong to different syllables, such as in the mathematical term {{Lang|nl|[[bijection|bijectie]]}} (syllablised \"bi\u00b7jec\u00b7tie\"), they do not form a ligature or a single letter.
