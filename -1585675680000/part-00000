It forbids the creation among them of \"environmental sacrifice zones.\"{{sfn|Aloni|2017|p=16}} Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a \"sacrifice\" zone for placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment. The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations. These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.{{sfn|Aloni|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nWithin Israel strict environment laws apply. Of 121 settlements studied in 2007, 81 had wastewater facilities, many subject to breakdown, with sewage flowing into streams affecting Palestinian villages nearby. Few pollution indictments result in action. Israel built 4 plants for Palestinian waste in the 1970s: only one was functioning (2007), and Israeli budgetary problems were cited for the lack of adequate infrastructure that left most Palestinian sewage untreated.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} The landfill near [[Al-Jiftlik]] in the [[Jericho Governorate]], built on [[Israeli land and property laws|absentee Palestinian property]] without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage.

In 2019 the Israeli High Court ruled that Israeli archaeological work in the West Bank may be kept off the public record.{{sfn|Hasson|2019}}\n\n[[Albert Glock]], among others, argued that the thrust of archaeology has been to interpret the Palestinian past in [[Christian Zionism|Christian]] and Jewish Zionist terms, in the latter instance, providing a charter for the occupation, to the detriment of the Palestinian cultural heritage.{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}} Many sites with dual cultural value have been wrested from Palestinian control, such as the [[Herodium]], [[Joseph's Tomb]] in Nablus, the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in Hebron, [[Rachel's Tomb]] the [[Tomb of Jesse and Ruth]] in [[Tel Rumeida]], Hebron and at [[Qumran]] near the Palestinian villager of [[Shuqba]] is a garbage dump for settlement waste.{{sfn|Yahya|2010|pp=145\u2013147}} Many Palestinian heritage sites within the West Bank have been added to the Jewish heritage list.{{sfn|Yahya|2010|pp=146\u2013142}} Aside from the destruction of villages, in Jerusalem and elsewhere, significant losses were incurred by the expropriation of libraries with extensive historical resources regarding Palestine's Arabic past.{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}\n\n===Tourism===\nThe West Bank is a key attraction for pilgrims and tourists and has a rich heritage of deep significance for members of the [[Abrahamic religions]]. After 1967 the loss of East Jerusalem cut off potential gains to the West Bank economy from tourism.{{sfn|Tuma|Darin-Drabkin|1978|pp=37\u201338}} From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel, which exercises a virtual monopoly.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=144}} Israel controls all access points to the major tourist attractions in East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho, and Palestinian hotels in most West Bank areas remain half-empty.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=147}}\n\nIsraeli obstacles make Palestinian recreational access to, or development of tourist infrastructure around, the Dead Sea difficult. The World Bank estimates that $126&nbsp;million annually and 2,900 jobs would accrue to the local economy if Palestinians were allowed to operate on similar terms available to Israel entrepreneurs.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=65\u201366}} Palestinians have been blocked at checkpoints from beaches there putatively because their presence would harm Israeli tourist businesses.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008}}\n\n===Resource extraction===\nAccording to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55 an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets: the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to the transfer of mining rights to the Palestinian Authority.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsrael has given concessions for 11 settlement quarries to operate. The [[World Bank]] estimates that 275 quarries could be opened in Area C, and that Israeli restrictions cost the Palestinian economy US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} Palestinians are also denied permits to process Dead Sea minerals, such as [[bromine]], about 75% of world production of which comes from this area,{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} while Israeli firms such as [[Ahava]] do so and export to the EU.

[[Human Rights Watch]] claims that the \"physical imprint\", with 20 Israeli industrial zones covering by 2016 some 1,365 hectares, of such commercial operations, agricultural and otherwise, is more extensive than that of the settlements themselves. The restrictions on Palestinian enterprise in Area C cause unemployment which is then mopped up by industrial parks that can draw on a pool of people without job prospects if not in settlements. Some Palestinian workers at the [[Barkan Industrial Park]] have complained anonymously that they were paid less than the minimum Israeli wage per hour ($5.75), with payments ranging from $1.50 to 2-4&nbsp;dollars, with shifts of up to 12 hours, no vacations, sick days, pay slips or social benefits.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Many such businesses export abroad, making the world complicit in the settlement project.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsraeli policy aimed to impede any form of Palestinian competition with Israeli economic interests. The approach was set forth by Israel's then Defense Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1986, who stated:\n<blockquote>\"there will be no development initiated by the Israeli Government, and no permits will be given for expanding agriculture or industry, which may compete with the State of Israel\".{{sfn|Isaac|Khalil|Rishmawi|Dabouqi|2015|p=4}}</blockquote>\n\nThe [[World Bank]] estimated that the annual economic costs to the Palestinian economy of the Israeli occupation of Area C alone in 2015 was 23% of GNP in direct costs, and 12% in indirect costs, totally 35% which, together with fiscal loss of revenue at 800&nbsp;million dollars, totals an estimated 5.2&nbsp;billion dollars.{{sfn|Unctad|2016|p=14}} Fiscally, one estimate places the \"leakage\" of Palestinian revenue back to the Israeli treasury at 17% of total Palestinian public revenue, 3.6% of GNP.{{sfn|Quigley|2018|p=3}} A 2015 estimate put annual Israeli government expenditure on settlements at $US1.1&nbsp;billion, though this is an inference given that the government does not report its expenditures on settlements.{{sfn|Anthony|Egal|Ries|Bond|2015|pp=14\u201315}} By 1982 subsidized Israeli agricultural productions and unhampered flow of Israeli manufactures hindered the growth of manufacturing industries in the Palestinian territories. High tariffs imposed by Israel on imports from countries outside the area of Israel meant Palestinian consumers had a choice of paying high prices for imported goods from foreign countries, or purchasing them from high-cost Israeli suppliers.{{sfn|De Waart|1994|p=171}}{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=111\u2013112}} Palestinian goods exporting to Israel were hit by tariffs, which down to 1991 earned Israel annually $1,000,000, but Israeli exports to the Palestinian territories were exempted from import duties.{{sfn|Ziai|2013|p=137}} Since internal economic growth is hampered by Israeli restrictions, and, to compensate, 40% of the Palestinian economy relies on international aid, it is argued that such aid constitutes a subsidy to the occupation itself, making it \"one of the cheapest occupations\", for Israel.{{efn|\"These economic costs are partially paid by the international community's funds which are creating one of the cheapest occupations and relieve Israel from its duties and responsibilities as an Occupying Power\". {{harv|Beckouche|2017|pp=154\u2013155,154}}}}\nThe [[Protocol on Economic Relations|Paris Protocol]] undersigned in 1994 allowed Israel to collect [[VAT]] on all Palestinian imports and good from that country or in transit through its ports, with the system of [[Clearing (finance)|clearance revenue]] giving it effective control over roughly 75% of PA income. Israel can withhold that revenue as a punitive measure, as it did in response to the decision by the PA to adhere to the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2015.{{sfn|Quigley|2018|p=26}}\n\nA 2009 World Bank study concluded that \"Very few economies have faced such a comprehensive array of obstacles to investment -- not just of physical impediments to movement, but also comprehensive institutional and administrative barriers to economies of scale and natural resources, along with an unclear political horizon and the inability to predictably plan movement of people and goods\".{{sfn|World Bank|2009|p=6}}\n\n===Communications===\n{{main|Communications in the Palestinian territories}}\nUnder the Oslo Accords, Israel agreed that the Palestinian territories had a right to construct and operate an independent communications network. In 2016 a World Bank analysis concluded the provisions of this agreement had not been applied, causing notable detrimental effects to Palestinian development. It took 8 years for Israel to agree to a request for frequencies for [[Broadband|3G services]], though they were limited, causing a bottleneck which left Israeli competitors with a distinct market advantage. The local [[Wataniya Mobile|Wataniya mobile operator]]'s competitiveness suffered from Israeli restrictions and delays, and illegal Israeli operators in the West Bank, with 4G services available by that date, still maintained an unfair advantage over Palestinian companies. Israel imposes three other constraints that hamper Palestinian competitiveness: restrictions are imposed on imports of equipment for telecom and [[Information and communications technology|ICT companies]], and movement to improve the development and maintenance of infrastructure in Area C, and finally, Palestinian telecommunications accessing international links must go through companies with Israeli registration. From 2008 to 2016, they concluded, progress in negotiating resolutions to these problems had been \"very slim\".{{sfn|World Bank|2016|pp=6\u20137,43}}\n\n===Overall economic costs===\nA joint study by the [[Finance Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Ministry of National Economy]] and researchers at the [[Applied Research Institute\u2013Jerusalem]] argued that by 2010 the costs of occupation amounted in 2010 alone rose to 84.9% of the total Palestinian GDP ($US 6.897&nbsp;billion).{{sfn|ARIJPMNE|2011|p=1}} Their estimate for 2014 states that the total economic cost of Israel's occupation amounted to 74.27% of Palestinian nominal GDP, or some $(US) 9.46&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Isaac|Khalil|Rishmawi|Dabouqi|2015|p=3}} The cost to Israel's economy by 2007 was estimated at $50&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Shauli|2007}}\n\n===Indirect costs to Israel===\nThe indirect cost to the Israeli economy for defense outlays and maintaining operations in the territories has also been substantial. One analysis has concluded that the costs of maintaining Israel's occupation is a contributing factor to the rise of poverty in Israel, where poverty levels have jumped from one in ten families in the 1970s, compared to one in five at present.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|pp=26,28\u201329}} The high costs of subsidizing the settlement project shifted investment from Israel's development towns on its periphery and led to cutbacks in sectors like health care, education and welfare.{{efn|Dr Ruby Nathanzon of the Macro Center for Political Economy: \"Imagine how much less poverty there could have been in Israel.. There's a terrible distortion, an enormous economic cost in addition to the huge military burden\". {{harv|Shauli|2007}}}}\nThe settlement surge under Begin's Likud government was detrimental to housing development for Israelis in Israel: 44% of the entire budget of the [[Ministry of Construction (Israel)|Ministry of Housing and Construction]] in 1982 went to West Bank settlements.{{sfn|Lustick|2018|p=11}} The substitution of imported foreign labour for Palestinians has also arguably lowered the bargaining power of Israeli blue-collar workers.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|p=26}} In the aftermath of the Second Intifada, the budgetary allocations for Israel's social security net were reduced drastically: between 2001 and 2005 as defense outlays ratcheted up, child allowances were cut by 45%, unemployment compensation by 47%, and income maintenance by 25%.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|p=28}} The annual growth, NIS 4.6&nbsp;billion, in the defence budget for the decade 2007 onwards recommended by the Brodet Commission was close to Israel's total annual expenditure on higher education.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|p=28}} Defense specialists also claim that guarding settlers lowers the combat readiness of soldiers, since they have far less time to train.{{sfn|Gordis|Levi|2017|p=19}} It is also argued that the logic of settlements undermines Israel's rule of law.{{efn|\"the settlements systematically undermine Israel's rule of law. The project of settling the West Bank was based on flaunting Israeli law from the outset (the Passover feast held to stake a claim in Hebron, the settling of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], and later the proliferation of outposts that are illegal even under Israeli law). Forging documents, deceiving authorities, flagrantly breaching the law \u2013 all these are what made the massive land grab possible, along with the covert mechanisms for channelling taxpayer funds into the settlements far from the public eye\". {{harv|Gordis|Levi|2017|p=24}}}}\n\n===Cultural impact===\nMany studies, following the work of [[Daniel Bar-Tal]] and [[Gavriel Salomon]], have analyzed the emergence and consolidation of an \"ethos of conflict\", one of what they see as three key components of Israeli Jewish society \u2013 the others being collective memory of the conflict and collective emotional orientations \u2013 which have developed to cope with the stress of an intractable conflict. This complex can be broken down into eight societal values informing a unilateral outlook: (a) The justice of Israel's cause; (b) Security (including national survival) (c) Positive collective ethnocentric in-group images; (d) One's Own Victimization; (e) Delegitimizing the adversary by denying their humanity, allowing one to harm them; (f) Patriotism; (g) Beliefs reinforcing social solidarity, by ignoring internal disagreements; (h) Belief that peace is the goal.{{sfn|Bar-Tal|Salomon|2006|pp=24ff}}{{sfn|Bar-Tal|Alon|2017|pp=317\u2013318}} Recent research suggests that four of these \u2013 the persistence of a sense of historic trauma and an ethos of conflict (delegitimization of the opponent, security, own victimization and justness of one's own goals) \u2013 consistently influence decision-making on the conflict in the Israeli Supreme Court itself.{{sfn|Levanon|2015|pp=4,212\u2013214}} The same model has been applied to Palestinian society, emphasizing that of all themes patriotism in the form of ''m\u016bq\u0101wama'' (resistance and readiness for self-sacrifice) form the keynote of Palestinian identity.{{sfn|Shaked|2016|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\n==Wider implications==\nA concern for security in Israel has been said to \"vastly exceed the norm for other Western countries\".{{sfn|Mintz|1983|p=626}} Israel's [[Military\u2013industrial complex|military-industrial sector]], which by the early 1980s employed a quarter of all industrial workers with 28% of GNP devoted to defense expenditures, became the fastest growing sector of the economy after 1967.{{sfn|Mintz|1983|pp=623,628}} In 1981, [[Ya'akov Meridor]] stated Israel aspired to play the role of \"top proxy\" for the United States in Central America.{{efn|\"In 1981, [[Ya'akov Meridor]] told a gathering of Israeli businessmen: 'Israel coveted the job of top Washington proxy in Central America'.\" {{harv|Pieterse|1984|p=71}}}} By 1984, according to [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]], Israel had become one of the world's major arms exporters, the largest arms supplier to Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, and globally active in the business of counterinsurgency, expertise in which was gained in enforcing land expropriations and settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Galilee. Knowledge of this background, he argued,{{sfn|Pieterse|1984|pp=60,64}} was useful for assessing Israel's \"export\" of its methods, to countries like [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Sri Lanka]], in some of which existed similar configurations of policy involving land, domination and exploitation, population policy, and terror.{{sfn|Pieterse|1984|p=64,67}} One settlement project in [[Costa Rica]] for example is thought to be based on Israeli expertise honed in West Bank projects.{{sfn|Bahbah|Butler|1986|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe Israeli techniques of [[urban warfare]] against Palestinians in their towns and villages territories has influenced many other military powers.{{efn|\"One of the main reasons why Israeli military doctrine on urban operations became so influential among other militaries is that Israel's conflict with the Palestinians since the Intifada has had a distinct urban dimension.\" {{harv|Weizman|2012|p=188}}}} Many argue that Israeli methods developed in their conflict with Palestinians have been a significant influence on U.S. military doctrines developed under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Graham|2010|pp=134,136\u2013138}}{{sfn|Cook|2013b|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Zureik|2010|p=23}}{{sfn|Denes|2010|pp=171\u2013195}}{{sfn|Gordon|2010|pp=153\u2013169}} The American claim that new methods developed for the [[war on terror]] were necessary since the situation was unprecedented and therefore was a legal no man's land had a precedent in Israeli claims the war on terror in the West Bank was a legal [[terra nullius|''terra nulla'']],{{sfn|Hajjar|2006|p=32}} and thus allowed approaches like extrajudicial and preemptive assassination,{{efn|In 2002, the United States began employing the tactic of assassination, which had been prohibited by executive orders since1977. Officials utilized Israeli-like reasoning to justify the assassination of [[Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi|'Ali Qaed Sinan al-Harithi]] and five\nothers (including a U.S.citizen) in Yemen by a pilotless drone.' {{harv|Hajjar|2006|p=34}}}} a terminology already used by Israel with regard to its approach to resistance in the West Bank and Gaza.  The high-tech security and urban warfare systems, and the surveillance devices developed while securing the occupation particularly during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, have turned Israel into one of the major exporters of such systems in the world. Israel has become a pioneering leader in the manufacture of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], border [[Sensor|surveillance sensors]], with the commercial advantage of having these devices \"battle-tested\" in the \"laboratories\" of the occupied territory.{{sfn|Graham|2010|pp=136\u2013138}}{{sfn|Cook|2013b|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Zureik|2010|p=23}}{{sfn|Denes|2010|pp=171\u2013195}}{{sfn|Gordon|2010|pp=153\u2013169}}\n\n[[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution Fellow]] and Senior Fellow at the [[Joint Special Operations University]] Thomas H.

The proclamation kept in force local law that existed on 7 June 1967, excepting where contradicted by any new proclamation or military order.{{sfn|Weill|2007|p=401}} {{harv|Weill|2014|p=19}}}} The status of the West Bank as an occupied territory has been affirmed by the [[International Court of Justice]] and, [[Status of territories occupied by Israel in 1967|with the exception of East Jerusalem]], by the [[Israeli Supreme Court]].{{sfn|Domb|2007|pp=511\u2013513}} The official Israeli government view is that the law of occupation does not apply and it claims the territories are \"disputed\".{{sfn|Benvenisti|2012|pp=208\u2013209}}{{sfn|Kimmerling|2003|p=78, n.17}}{{efn|Jordan claimed it had a provisional sovereignty over the West Bank, a claim revoked in 1988 when it accepted the [[Palestinian National Council]]'s declaration of statehood in that year. Israel did not accept this passage of a claim to sovereignty, nor asserted its counter claim, holding that the Palestinian claim of sovereignty is incompatible with the fact that Israel is, in law, a belligerent occupant of the territory.{{sfn|Quigley|2009|pp=47\u201348}} Secondly it regards the West Bank as a disputed territory on the technical argument that the Fourth Geneva Convention's stipulations do not apply since, in its view, the legal status of the territory is [[sui generis]] and not covered by international law, a position rejected by the [[International Court of Justice|ICJ]]. {{harv|Dinstein|2009|pp=20\u201321}}}} Considered to be a classic example of an \"intractable\" conflict,{{sfn|Bar-Tal|Alon|2017|p=317}}{{efn|\"The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is as prototypical case of a conflict which meets the criteria describing an intractable conflict: it is prolonged, irreconcilable, violent and perceived as having zero-game nature and total\". {{harv|Shaked|2016|p=134}}}} the length of Israel's occupation was already regarded as exceptional after two decades and is now the longest in modern history.{{sfn|Roberts|1990|p=44}}{{efn|\"Decisions of the Israeli Supreme Court have held that the Israeli occupation of the territories has endured far longer than any occupation contemplated by the drafters of the rules of international law\". {{harv|Lazar|1990|p=7}}}}{{sfn|Karayanni|2014|p=xv}}{{sfn|Hajjar|2005|p=2}} Israel has cited several reasons for retaining the West Bank within its ambit: a claim based on the notion of historic rights to this as a homeland as affirmed in the [[Balfour Declaration]]; security grounds, internal and external; and the deep symbolic value for Jews of the area occupied.{{sfn|Rathbun|2014|p=205}}\n\nPerhaps the most closely researched modern conflict,{{efn|\"The Israel-Palestine issue has a strong claim to be the most closely studied conflict on earth. 'Voluminous' does not even begin to capture the sheer quantity of the material about it.\" {{harv|Black|2017|p=ii}}}} controversies abound even as to what terminology is the most appropriate, with pro-Israeli sources favouring one set of terms and the [[Palestinian Authority]] [[Palestinian terminology guide|advocating a different nomenclature]]. Disputes arise over the bias of keywords, and whether the Israeli or Palestinian viewpoint dominates media representations.  Public discussion of the occupation is also contested, especially on [[Campus|university campuses]]. Pro-Israeli Jewish students complain they vilified or harassed;{{sfn|Richman|2018}} some proposed talks on Palestinian perspectives have been cancelled on the grounds that audiences might not be able to objectively evaluate the material. In response to attempts to silence several high-profile critics of Israeli territorial policies{{sfn|Roy|2010|pp=27\u201328}} concerns have been expressed that the topic itself is at risk, and that the political pressures restricting research and discussion undermine [[academic freedom]].{{sfn|Findlay|2010|pp=5\u201318}}{{sfn|Beinin|2004|pp=101\u2013115,106ff.}}\n\nAmong the most controversial policies enacted as part of its occupation,{{sfn|Kumaraswamy|2015|p=409}} Israel has established numerous [[Israeli settlement]]s throughout the West Bank, including East Jerusalem. The international community considers these settlements [[International law and Israeli settlements|illegal under international law]], though Israel disputes this.

It forbids the creation among them of \"environmental sacrifice zones.\"{{sfn|Aloni|2017|p=16}} Israel, it is argued, uses the West Bank as a \"sacrifice\" zone for placing 15 waste treatment plants, which are there under less stringent rules that those required in Israel because a different legal system has been organized regarding hazardous materials that can be noxious to local people and the environment. The military authorities do not render public the details of these operations. These materials consist of such things as sewage sludge, infectious medical waste, used oils, solvents, metals, electronic waste and batteries.{{sfn|Aloni|2017|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nWithin Israel strict environment laws apply. Of 121 settlements studied in 2007, 81 had wastewater facilities, many subject to breakdown, with sewage flowing into streams affecting Palestinian villages nearby. Few pollution indictments result in action. Israel built 4 plants for Palestinian waste in the 1970s: only one was functioning (2007), and Israeli budgetary problems were cited for the lack of adequate infrastructure that left most Palestinian sewage untreated.{{sfn|Hareuveni|2009|pp=19\u201321}} The landfill near [[Al-Jiftlik]] in the [[Jericho Governorate]], built on [[Israeli land and property laws|absentee Palestinian property]] without planning or an environment impact analysis, is for the exclusive use of waste, 1,000 tons per day, produced by Israeli settlements and cities within Israel.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Palestinians are restricted to 3 landfills, and permits for more have been denied unless the sites can be used to dump settlement garbage.

In 2019 the Israeli High Court ruled that Israeli archaeological work in the West Bank may be kept off the public record.{{sfn|Hasson|2019}}\n\n[[Albert Glock]], among others, argued that the thrust of archaeology has been to interpret the Palestinian past in [[Christian Zionism|Christian]] and Jewish Zionist terms, in the latter instance, providing a charter for the occupation, to the detriment of the Palestinian cultural heritage.{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=77}} Many sites with dual cultural value have been wrested from Palestinian control, such as the [[Herodium]], [[Joseph's Tomb]] in Nablus, the [[Cave of the Patriarchs]] in Hebron, [[Rachel's Tomb]] the [[Tomb of Jesse and Ruth]] in [[Tel Rumeida]], Hebron and at [[Qumran]] near the Palestinian villager of [[Shuqba]] is a garbage dump for settlement waste.{{sfn|Yahya|2010|pp=145\u2013147}} Many Palestinian heritage sites within the West Bank have been added to the Jewish heritage list.{{sfn|Yahya|2010|pp=146\u2013142}} Aside from the destruction of villages, in Jerusalem and elsewhere, significant losses were incurred by the expropriation of libraries with extensive historical resources regarding Palestine's Arabic past.{{sfn|Glock|1994|p=71}}\n\n===Tourism===\nThe West Bank is a key attraction for pilgrims and tourists and has a rich heritage of deep significance for members of the [[Abrahamic religions]]. After 1967 the loss of East Jerusalem cut off potential gains to the West Bank economy from tourism.{{sfn|Tuma|Darin-Drabkin|1978|pp=37\u201338}} From 92 to 94 cents in every dollar of the tourist trade goes to Israel, which exercises a virtual monopoly.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=144}} Israel controls all access points to the major tourist attractions in East Jerusalem, Bethlehem and Jericho, and Palestinian hotels in most West Bank areas remain half-empty.{{sfn|Isaac|2013|p=147}}\n\nIsraeli obstacles make Palestinian recreational access to, or development of tourist infrastructure around, the Dead Sea difficult. The World Bank estimates that $126&nbsp;million annually and 2,900 jobs would accrue to the local economy if Palestinians were allowed to operate on similar terms available to Israel entrepreneurs.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|pp=65\u201366}} Palestinians have been blocked at checkpoints from beaches there putatively because their presence would harm Israeli tourist businesses.{{sfn|Macintyre|2008}}\n\n===Resource extraction===\nAccording to the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] (Article 55 an occupying power may reap some value from the resources of the country occupied but not deplete its assets: the [[usufruct]] must benefit the people under occupation. The Oslo Accords agreed to the transfer of mining rights to the Palestinian Authority.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsrael has given concessions for 11 settlement quarries to operate. The [[World Bank]] estimates that 275 quarries could be opened in Area C, and that Israeli restrictions cost the Palestinian economy US$241&nbsp;million per year.{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} Palestinians are also denied permits to process Dead Sea minerals, such as [[bromine]], about 75% of world production of which comes from this area,{{sfn|Niksic|Eddin|Cali|2014|p=58}} while Israeli firms such as [[Ahava]] do so and export to the EU.

[[Human Rights Watch]] claims that the \"physical imprint\", with 20 Israeli industrial zones covering by 2016 some 1,365 hectares, of such commercial operations, agricultural and otherwise, is more extensive than that of the settlements themselves. The restrictions on Palestinian enterprise in Area C cause unemployment which is then mopped up by industrial parks that can draw on a pool of people without job prospects if not in settlements. Some Palestinian workers at the [[Barkan Industrial Park]] have complained anonymously that they were paid less than the minimum Israeli wage per hour ($5.75), with payments ranging from $1.50 to 2-4&nbsp;dollars, with shifts of up to 12 hours, no vacations, sick days, pay slips or social benefits.{{sfn|HRW|2016}} Many such businesses export abroad, making the world complicit in the settlement project.{{sfn|HRW|2016}}\n\nIsraeli policy aimed to impede any form of Palestinian competition with Israeli economic interests. The approach was set forth by Israel's then Defense Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] in 1986, who stated:\n<blockquote>\"there will be no development initiated by the Israeli Government, and no permits will be given for expanding agriculture or industry, which may compete with the State of Israel\".{{sfn|Isaac|Khalil|Rishmawi|Dabouqi|2015|p=4}}</blockquote>\n\nThe [[World Bank]] estimated that the annual economic costs to the Palestinian economy of the Israeli occupation of Area C alone in 2015 was 23% of GNP in direct costs, and 12% in indirect costs, totally 35% which, together with fiscal loss of revenue at 800&nbsp;million dollars, totals an estimated 5.2&nbsp;billion dollars.{{sfn|Unctad|2016|p=14}} Fiscally, one estimate places the \"leakage\" of Palestinian revenue back to the Israeli treasury at 17% of total Palestinian public revenue, 3.6% of GNP.{{sfn|Quigley|2018|p=3}} A 2015 estimate put annual Israeli government expenditure on settlements at $US1.1&nbsp;billion, though this is an inference given that the government does not report its expenditures on settlements.{{sfn|Anthony|Egal|Ries|Bond|2015|pp=14\u201315}} By 1982 subsidized Israeli agricultural productions and unhampered flow of Israeli manufactures hindered the growth of manufacturing industries in the Palestinian territories. High tariffs imposed by Israel on imports from countries outside the area of Israel meant Palestinian consumers had a choice of paying high prices for imported goods from foreign countries, or purchasing them from high-cost Israeli suppliers.{{sfn|De Waart|1994|p=171}}{{sfn|Van Arkadie|1977|pp=111\u2013112}} Palestinian goods exporting to Israel were hit by tariffs, which down to 1991 earned Israel annually $1,000,000, but Israeli exports to the Palestinian territories were exempted from import duties.{{sfn|Ziai|2013|p=137}} Since internal economic growth is hampered by Israeli restrictions, and, to compensate, 40% of the Palestinian economy relies on international aid, it is argued that such aid constitutes a subsidy to the occupation itself, making it \"one of the cheapest occupations\", for Israel.{{efn|\"These economic costs are partially paid by the international community's funds which are creating one of the cheapest occupations and relieve Israel from its duties and responsibilities as an Occupying Power\". {{harv|Beckouche|2017|pp=154\u2013155,154}}}}\nThe [[Protocol on Economic Relations|Paris Protocol]] undersigned in 1994 allowed Israel to collect [[VAT]] on all Palestinian imports and good from that country or in transit through its ports, with the system of [[Clearing (finance)|clearance revenue]] giving it effective control over roughly 75% of PA income. Israel can withhold that revenue as a punitive measure, as it did in response to the decision by the PA to adhere to the [[International Criminal Court]] in 2015.{{sfn|Quigley|2018|p=26}}\n\nA 2009 World Bank study concluded that \"Very few economies have faced such a comprehensive array of obstacles to investment -- not just of physical impediments to movement, but also comprehensive institutional and administrative barriers to economies of scale and natural resources, along with an unclear political horizon and the inability to predictably plan movement of people and goods\".{{sfn|World Bank|2009|p=6}}\n\n===Communications===\n{{main|Communications in the Palestinian territories}}\nUnder the Oslo Accords, Israel agreed that the Palestinian territories had a right to construct and operate an independent communications network. In 2016 a World Bank analysis concluded the provisions of this agreement had not been applied, causing notable detrimental effects to Palestinian development. It took 8 years for Israel to agree to a request for frequencies for [[Broadband|3G services]], though they were limited, causing a bottleneck which left Israeli competitors with a distinct market advantage. The local [[Wataniya Mobile|Wataniya mobile operator]]'s competitiveness suffered from Israeli restrictions and delays, and illegal Israeli operators in the West Bank, with 4G services available by that date, still maintained an unfair advantage over Palestinian companies. Israel imposes three other constraints that hamper Palestinian competitiveness: restrictions are imposed on imports of equipment for telecom and [[Information and communications technology|ICT companies]], and movement to improve the development and maintenance of infrastructure in Area C, and finally, Palestinian telecommunications accessing international links must go through companies with Israeli registration. From 2008 to 2016, they concluded, progress in negotiating resolutions to these problems had been \"very slim\".{{sfn|World Bank|2016|pp=6\u20137,43}}\n\n===Overall economic costs===\nA joint study by the [[Finance Minister of the Palestinian National Authority|Palestinian Ministry of National Economy]] and researchers at the [[Applied Research Institute\u2013Jerusalem]] argued that by 2010 the costs of occupation amounted in 2010 alone rose to 84.9% of the total Palestinian GDP ($US 6.897&nbsp;billion).{{sfn|ARIJPMNE|2011|p=1}} Their estimate for 2014 states that the total economic cost of Israel's occupation amounted to 74.27% of Palestinian nominal GDP, or some $(US) 9.46&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Isaac|Khalil|Rishmawi|Dabouqi|2015|p=3}} The cost to Israel's economy by 2007 was estimated at $50&nbsp;billion.{{sfn|Shauli|2007}}\n\n===Indirect costs to Israel===\nThe indirect cost to the Israeli economy for defense outlays and maintaining operations in the territories has also been substantial. One analysis has concluded that the costs of maintaining Israel's occupation is a contributing factor to the rise of poverty in Israel, where poverty levels have jumped from one in ten families in the 1970s, compared to one in five at present.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|pp=26,28\u201329}} The high costs of subsidizing the settlement project shifted investment from Israel's development towns on its periphery and led to cutbacks in sectors like health care, education and welfare.{{efn|Dr Ruby Nathanzon of the Macro Center for Political Economy: \"Imagine how much less poverty there could have been in Israel.. There's a terrible distortion, an enormous economic cost in addition to the huge military burden\". {{harv|Shauli|2007}}}}\nThe settlement surge under Begin's Likud government was detrimental to housing development for Israelis in Israel: 44% of the entire budget of the [[Ministry of Construction (Israel)|Ministry of Housing and Construction]] in 1982 went to West Bank settlements.{{sfn|Lustick|2018|p=11}} The substitution of imported foreign labour for Palestinians has also arguably lowered the bargaining power of Israeli blue-collar workers.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|p=26}} In the aftermath of the Second Intifada, the budgetary allocations for Israel's social security net were reduced drastically: between 2001 and 2005 as defense outlays ratcheted up, child allowances were cut by 45%, unemployment compensation by 47%, and income maintenance by 25%.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|p=28}} The annual growth, NIS 4.6&nbsp;billion, in the defence budget for the decade 2007 onwards recommended by the Brodet Commission was close to Israel's total annual expenditure on higher education.{{sfn|Swirski|2010|p=28}} Defense specialists also claim that guarding settlers lowers the combat readiness of soldiers, since they have far less time to train.{{sfn|Gordis|Levi|2017|p=19}} It is also argued that the logic of settlements undermines Israel's rule of law.{{efn|\"the settlements systematically undermine Israel's rule of law. The project of settling the West Bank was based on flaunting Israeli law from the outset (the Passover feast held to stake a claim in Hebron, the settling of [[Sebastia, Nablus|Sebastia]], and later the proliferation of outposts that are illegal even under Israeli law). Forging documents, deceiving authorities, flagrantly breaching the law \u2013 all these are what made the massive land grab possible, along with the covert mechanisms for channelling taxpayer funds into the settlements far from the public eye\". {{harv|Gordis|Levi|2017|p=24}}}}\n\n===Cultural impact===\nMany studies, following the work of [[Daniel Bar-Tal]] and [[Gavriel Salomon]], have analyzed the emergence and consolidation of an \"ethos of conflict\", one of what they see as three key components of Israeli Jewish society \u2013 the others being collective memory of the conflict and collective emotional orientations \u2013 which have developed to cope with the stress of an intractable conflict. This complex can be broken down into eight societal values informing a unilateral outlook: (a) The justice of Israel's cause; (b) Security (including national survival) (c) Positive collective ethnocentric in-group images; (d) One's Own Victimization; (e) Delegitimizing the adversary by denying their humanity, allowing one to harm them; (f) Patriotism; (g) Beliefs reinforcing social solidarity, by ignoring internal disagreements; (h) Belief that peace is the goal.{{sfn|Bar-Tal|Salomon|2006|pp=24ff}}{{sfn|Bar-Tal|Alon|2017|pp=317\u2013318}} Recent research suggests that four of these \u2013 the persistence of a sense of historic trauma and an ethos of conflict (delegitimization of the opponent, security, own victimization and justness of one's own goals) \u2013 consistently influence decision-making on the conflict in the Israeli Supreme Court itself.{{sfn|Levanon|2015|pp=4,212\u2013214}} The same model has been applied to Palestinian society, emphasizing that of all themes patriotism in the form of ''m\u016bq\u0101wama'' (resistance and readiness for self-sacrifice) form the keynote of Palestinian identity.{{sfn|Shaked|2016|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\n==Wider implications==\nA concern for security in Israel has been said to \"vastly exceed the norm for other Western countries\".{{sfn|Mintz|1983|p=626}} Israel's [[Military\u2013industrial complex|military-industrial sector]], which by the early 1980s employed a quarter of all industrial workers with 28% of GNP devoted to defense expenditures, became the fastest growing sector of the economy after 1967.{{sfn|Mintz|1983|pp=623,628}} In 1981, [[Ya'akov Meridor]] stated Israel aspired to play the role of \"top proxy\" for the United States in Central America.{{efn|\"In 1981, [[Ya'akov Meridor]] told a gathering of Israeli businessmen: 'Israel coveted the job of top Washington proxy in Central America'.\" {{harv|Pieterse|1984|p=71}}}} By 1984, according to [[Jan Nederveen Pieterse]], Israel had become one of the world's major arms exporters, the largest arms supplier to Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa, and globally active in the business of counterinsurgency, expertise in which was gained in enforcing land expropriations and settlements in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and the Galilee. Knowledge of this background, he argued,{{sfn|Pieterse|1984|pp=60,64}} was useful for assessing Israel's \"export\" of its methods, to countries like [[Guatemala]], [[Honduras]], [[Nicaragua]], [[El Salvador]] and [[Sri Lanka]], in some of which existed similar configurations of policy involving land, domination and exploitation, population policy, and terror.{{sfn|Pieterse|1984|p=64,67}} One settlement project in [[Costa Rica]] for example is thought to be based on Israeli expertise honed in West Bank projects.{{sfn|Bahbah|Butler|1986|pp=158\u2013159}}\n\nThe Israeli techniques of [[urban warfare]] against Palestinians in their towns and villages territories has influenced many other military powers.{{efn|\"One of the main reasons why Israeli military doctrine on urban operations became so influential among other militaries is that Israel's conflict with the Palestinians since the Intifada has had a distinct urban dimension.\" {{harv|Weizman|2012|p=188}}}} Many argue that Israeli methods developed in their conflict with Palestinians have been a significant influence on U.S. military doctrines developed under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|administration of George W. Bush]].{{sfn|Graham|2010|pp=134,136\u2013138}}{{sfn|Cook|2013b|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Zureik|2010|p=23}}{{sfn|Denes|2010|pp=171\u2013195}}{{sfn|Gordon|2010|pp=153\u2013169}} The American claim that new methods developed for the [[war on terror]] were necessary since the situation was unprecedented and therefore was a legal no man's land had a precedent in Israeli claims the war on terror in the West Bank was a legal [[terra nullius|''terra nulla'']],{{sfn|Hajjar|2006|p=32}} and thus allowed approaches like extrajudicial and preemptive assassination,{{efn|In 2002, the United States began employing the tactic of assassination, which had been prohibited by executive orders since1977. Officials utilized Israeli-like reasoning to justify the assassination of [[Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi|'Ali Qaed Sinan al-Harithi]] and five\nothers (including a U.S.citizen) in Yemen by a pilotless drone.' {{harv|Hajjar|2006|p=34}}}} a terminology already used by Israel with regard to its approach to resistance in the West Bank and Gaza.  The high-tech security and urban warfare systems, and the surveillance devices developed while securing the occupation particularly during the Al-Aqsa Intifada, have turned Israel into one of the major exporters of such systems in the world. Israel has become a pioneering leader in the manufacture of [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]], border [[Sensor|surveillance sensors]], with the commercial advantage of having these devices \"battle-tested\" in the \"laboratories\" of the occupied territory.{{sfn|Graham|2010|pp=136\u2013138}}{{sfn|Cook|2013b|pp=16\u201317}}{{sfn|Zureik|2010|p=23}}{{sfn|Denes|2010|pp=171\u2013195}}{{sfn|Gordon|2010|pp=153\u2013169}}\n\n[[Hoover Institution|Hoover Institution Fellow]] and Senior Fellow at the [[Joint Special Operations University]] Thomas H.

The record was released on the [[Blue Note Records|Blue Note]] label in 2003.\n\n== Reception ==\nThom Jurek of [[AllMusic]] wrote: \"On Glamoured, Wilson composed half the album, and her songs are as provocative and deserve the same weight of grace critically afforded her covers. She uses her trademark fluid, smoky delivery to redefine songs such as the old soul nugget '[[If Loving You Is Wrong]]'; the poignancy it was written with tells of a woman lost in the delirium of a forbidden love with a married man. The ache and euphoria in her voice shot through with producer [[Fabrizio Sotti]]'s stunning acoustic guitar interplay is nearly overwhelming in its emotion.\"<ref name=\"AM\" /> Nick Dedina of [[Napster]] commented: \"The name of this album refers to those under a spell, which is exactly the effect of this hypnotizing mix of jazz, blues and folk.

{"title_page": "Geographical renaming", "text_new": "'''Geographical renaming''' is the changing of the [[Geonym|name]] of a [[geography|geographical]] feature or area.  This can range from the change of a [[street name]] to a change to the name of a country.  Some names are changed locally but the new names are not recognised by other countries, especially when there is a difference in language.  Other names may not be officially recognised but remain in common use.\nMany places have different names in different languages, and a change of language in official or general use has often resulted in what is arguably a change of name. \nThere are many reasons to undertake renaming, with political motivation being the primary cause; for example many places in the former Soviet Union and its satellites were [[List of places named after Stalin|renamed to honour Stalin]]. Sometimes a place reverts to its former name (see for example [[de-Stalinization]]). One of the most common reasons for a country changing its name is newly acquired independence.  When borders are changed, sometimes due to a country splitting or two countries joining together, the names of the relevant areas can change.  This, however, is more the creation of a different entity than an act of geographical renaming.\n\nOther more unusual reasons for renaming have included:\n*To get rid of an inappropriate or embarrassing name\n*As part of a [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship deal or publicity stunt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/02/google.kansas.topeka/index.html|title=Topeka 'renames' itself 'Google, Kansas' |first=John D. |last=Sutter|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nA change might see a completely different name being adopted or may only be a slight change in spelling.\n\nIn some cases established institutions preserve the old names of the renamed places in their names, such as the [[Pusan National University]] in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]; the [[Peking University]] in [[Beijing]]; [[Bombay Stock Exchange]], [[IIT Bombay]] and the [[Bombay High Court]] in [[Mumbai]]; [[University of Madras]], [[Madras Stock Exchange]], the [[Madras High Court]],  and [[IIT Madras]] in [[Chennai]]; the [[University of Malaya]], [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]], in [[Malaysia]]; and [[SWAPO]] (South West Africa People's Organization), the ruling party of [[Namibia]].\n\nOften the older name will persist in colloquial expressions. For example, the dish known in English as \"[[Peking duck]]\" retained that name even when the Chinese capital changed its [[transliteration]] to \"Beijing\".\n\n==Romanisation==\nChanges in [[romanisation]] systems can result in minor or major changes in spelling in the Roman alphabet for geographical entities, even without any change in name pronunciation or spelling in the local alphabet or other writing system. Names in non-Roman characters can also be spelled very differently when Romanised in different European languages.\n\n===Chinese names===\nChina developed and adopted the [[pinyin]] romanisation system in February 1958 in place of previous systems such as the [[postal romanization]] and [[Wade\u2013Giles]]. Many Chinese geographical entities (and associated entities named after geographical names) thus had their English names changed. The changes sometimes appear drastic, since it is sometimes the case that the former romanisations were derived from Cantonese\u2014the common language in British-held Hong Kong\u2014while the newer romanisations are derived entirely from Mandarin. However, the pronunciation in Mandarin has mostly stayed the same both before and after the change. Pinyin was adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardisation]] in 1982 and officially adopted in [[Singapore]] (resulting in several geographical name changes of its own). However it is usually not applied in the [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] of the PRC (e.g.: [[Lhasa]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[Hohhot]], [[Xigaz\u00ea]], [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]], [[Altay City|Altay]], [[Kashgar|Kaxgar]], [[Hulunbuir]], [[Erenhot]], with a notable exception being place names in Ningxia, whose native [[Hui people]] speak Mandarin as their native language) and has not resulted in any geographical name change in the [[special administrative region|SARs]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and is adopted only in parts of [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], particularly within [[Taipei]] and other Kuomintang controlled cities and counties, in a recent push to adopt Pinyin by the [[Kuomintang]] government.\n\nExamples of changes:\n\nIn the '''People's Republic of China'''\n*Peking \u2192 [[Beijing]]\n*Canton \u2192 [[Guangdong]]\n*Nanking \u2192 [[Nanjing]]\n*Sian \u2192 [[Xi'an]]\n*Chengtu \u2192 [[Chengdu]]\n*Chungking \u2192 [[Chongqing]]\n*Tientsin \u2192 [[Tianjin]]\n*Sinkiang \u2192 [[Xinjiang]]\n*Heilungkiang \u2192 [[Heilongjiang]]\n\nIn the '''Republic of China''' (Taiwan)\n*Shih-lin \u2192 [[Shilin District|Shilin]]\n*Chung-cheng \u2192 [[Zhongzheng District|Zhongzheng]]\n*[[Tamsui]] \u2192 Danshui (since reverted)\n\nIn '''Singapore'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-491.htm|title=yax-491 Road names as markers of history|work=yawningbread.org|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n*Peck San \u2192 [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]]\n*Ao Kang \u2192 [[Hougang]]\n*Nee Soon \u2192 [[Yishun]]\n\n===Korean names===\n{{unreferenced section|reason=This is a change in romanization system, which is not what the rest of this article is about.

In theory, if some reliable sources have discussed the romanization change in comparison with the geographical renaming that the rest of this article is about, this can be included here, but failing that this is essentially OR.|date=February 2017}}\nThe introduction of the [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] in place of the [[McCune\u2013Reischauer]] system in 7 July 2000 by the [[South Korea]]n government has resulted in a string of changes to geographical names. The system is not used by [[North Korea]]. Examples of changes include:\n*Inch\u014fn \u2192 [[Incheon]]\n*Ky\u014fngju \u2192 [[Gyeongju]]\n*Pusan \u2192 [[Busan]]\n*Taegu \u2192 [[Daegu]]\n*Taej\u014fn \u2192 [[Daejeon]]\n\n==Exonyms and endonyms==\nFor geographical entities with multiple pre-existing names in one or more languages, an [[exonym and endonym|exonym or endonym]] may gradually be substituted and used in the English language.\n\n*Transfer of a city between countries with very different patterns of [[phonology]] can result in seeming changes of name. Changes can be as slight as Stra\u00dfburg (Germany) and [[Strasbourg]] (France). Some are less subtle: [[Thessaloniki]], built in 4th century BC in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]] became Selanik in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and sometimes being referred to as Salonica, now [[Thessaloniki]] in [[Greece]]; Pilsen in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] became [[Plze\u0148]] in Czechoslovakia; [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], now the capital of Moldova, was in Russian and Soviet times part of Romania and known as [[Kishinev]] (the latter name is used in English in certain historical contexts, e.g. [[Kishinev pogrom]]). Some are translations; Karlsbad become [[Karlovy Vary]].    \n*When the formerly-German city of [[Danzig]] came under Polish rule, it became known in English by its Polish name of [[Gda\u0144sk]]. But when [[Winston Churchill]] gave his [[Iron Curtain]] speech he still spoke of a city in Poland by its German name ([[Stettin]]) instead of its contemporary Polish name [[Szczecin]] even though Churchill fully accepted the transfer of the formerly-German city to Poland, probably because it is [[German phonology]], not [[Polish phonology|Polish]], that is closer to [[English phonology|English]]. The pattern is far from uniform, and it takes time. \n*The Soviet Union replaced German city names in the former East Prussia that became the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and Japanese place names in southern [[Sakhalin Island]] with Russian names unrelated to the old German and Japanese place names after annexing them in the aftermath of World War II.\n*The military junta changed the official English name of [[Burma]] to [[Myanmar]] in 1988, even though both were pre-existing names which originated from the Burmese language and used interchangeably depending on contexts (see [[Names of Myanmar]]).\n*Decolonisation in India saw a trend to [[Renaming of cities in India|change the established English names of cities to the names in the local language.]] Since then, changes have included [[Chennai]] (from Madras in August 1996), [[Kolkata]] (from Calcutta in January 2001) and [[Mumbai]] (from Bombay in 1995), amongst many others.\n*The People's Republic of China, upon its founding and new nationalities policy, changed the names of cities in [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic minority]] regions from sometimes patronising [[Chinese language]] names to those of the native language. For example, it changed Dihua to [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] and Zhenxi to [[Barkol]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinaembassycanada.org/eng/zt/zfbps/t37787.htm|title=Full text of white paper on history, development of Xinjiang|date=2003-10-24|accessdate=2010-08-23|agency=[[Xinhua]]|publisher=[[Chinese Embassy, Ottawa]]}}</ref>\n*After the occupation of the communist [[North Vietnam]] at the end of the [[Vietnam War]], the city of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] changed its name to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (after the late leader of North Vietnam [[Ho Chi Minh]]) to symbolize the north's victory in the war.

This can range from the change of a [[street name]] to a change to the name of a country.  Some names are changed locally but the new names are not recognised by other countries, especially when there is a difference in language.  Other names may not be officially recognised but remain in common use.\nMany places have different names in different languages, and a change of language in official or general use has often resulted in what is arguably a change of name. \nThere are many reasons to undertake renaming, with political motivation being the primary cause; for example many places in the former Soviet Union and its satellites were [[List of places named after Stalin|renamed to honour Stalin]]. Sometimes a place reverts to its former name (see for example [[de-Stalinization]]). One of the most common reasons for a country changing its name is newly acquired independence.  When borders are changed, sometimes due to a country splitting or two countries joining together, the names of the relevant areas can change.  This, however, is more the creation of a different entity than an act of geographical renaming.\n\nOther more unusual reasons for renaming have included:\n*To get rid of an inappropriate or embarrassing name\n*As part of a [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship deal or publicity stunt<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/TECH/03/02/google.kansas.topeka/index.html|title=Topeka 'renames' itself 'Google, Kansas' |first=John D. |last=Sutter|publisher=CNN}}</ref>\n\nA change might see a completely different name being adopted or may only be a slight change in spelling.\n\nIn some cases established institutions preserve the old names of the renamed places in their names, such as the [[Pusan National University]] in [[Busan]], [[South Korea]]; the [[Peking University]] in [[Beijing]]; [[Bombay Stock Exchange]], [[IIT Bombay]] and the [[Bombay High Court]] in [[Mumbai]]; [[University of Madras]], [[Madras Stock Exchange]], the [[Madras High Court]],  and [[IIT Madras]] in [[Chennai]]; the [[University of Malaya]], [[Keretapi Tanah Melayu]], in [[Malaysia]]; and [[SWAPO]] (South West Africa People's Organization), the ruling party of [[Namibia]].\n\nOften the older name will persist in colloquial expressions. For example, the dish known in English as \"[[Peking duck]]\" retained that name even when the Chinese capital changed its [[transliteration]] to \"Beijing\".\n\n==Romanisation==\nChanges in [[romanisation]] systems can result in minor or major changes in spelling in the Roman alphabet for geographical entities, even without any change in name pronunciation or spelling in the local alphabet or other writing system. Names in non-Roman characters can also be spelled very differently when Romanised in different European languages.\n\n===Chinese names===\nChina developed and adopted the [[pinyin]] romanisation system in February 1958 in place of previous systems such as the [[postal romanization]] and [[Wade\u2013Giles]]. Many Chinese geographical entities (and associated entities named after geographical names) thus had their English names changed. The changes sometimes appear drastic, since it is sometimes the case that the former romanisations were derived from Cantonese\u2014the common language in British-held Hong Kong\u2014while the newer romanisations are derived entirely from Mandarin. However, the pronunciation in Mandarin has mostly stayed the same both before and after the change. Pinyin was adopted by the [[International Organization for Standardisation]] in 1982 and officially adopted in [[Singapore]] (resulting in several geographical name changes of its own). However it is usually not applied in the [[Autonomous regions of China|autonomous regions]] of the PRC (e.g.: [[Lhasa]], [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]], [[Hohhot]], [[Xigaz\u00ea]], [[Ili Kazakh Autonomous Prefecture|Ili]], [[Altay City|Altay]], [[Kashgar|Kaxgar]], [[Hulunbuir]], [[Erenhot]], with a notable exception being place names in Ningxia, whose native [[Hui people]] speak Mandarin as their native language) and has not resulted in any geographical name change in the [[special administrative region|SARs]] of [[Hong Kong]] and [[Macau]], and is adopted only in parts of [[Republic of China|Taiwan]], particularly within [[Taipei]] and other Kuomintang controlled cities and counties, in a recent push to adopt Pinyin by the [[Kuomintang]] government.\n\nExamples of changes:\n\nIn the '''People's Republic of China'''\n*Peking \u2192 [[Beijing]]\n*Canton \u2192 [[Guangdong]]\n*Nanking \u2192 [[Nanjing]]\n*Sian \u2192 [[Xi'an]]\n*Chengtu \u2192 [[Chengdu]]\n*Chungking \u2192 [[Chongqing]]\n*Tientsin \u2192 [[Tianjin]]\n*Sinkiang \u2192 [[Xinjiang]]\n*Heilungkiang \u2192 [[Heilongjiang]]\n\nIn the '''Republic of China''' (Taiwan)\n*Shih-lin \u2192 [[Shilin District|Shilin]]\n*Chung-cheng \u2192 [[Zhongzheng District|Zhongzheng]]\n*[[Tamsui]] \u2192 Danshui (since reverted)\n\nIn '''Singapore'''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.yawningbread.org/arch_2005/yax-491.htm|title=yax-491 Road names as markers of history|work=yawningbread.org|accessdate=2 April 2017}}</ref>\n*Peck San \u2192 [[Bishan, Singapore|Bishan]]\n*Ao Kang \u2192 [[Hougang]]\n*Nee Soon \u2192 [[Yishun]]\n\n===Korean names===\n{{unreferenced section|reason=This is a change in romanization system, which is not what the rest of this article is about.

In theory, if some reliable sources have discussed the romanization change in comparison with the geographical renaming that the rest of this article is about, this can be included here, but failing that this is essentially OR.|date=February 2017}}\nThe introduction of the [[Revised Romanization of Korean]] in place of the [[McCune\u2013Reischauer]] system in 7 July 2000 by the [[South Korea]]n government has resulted in a string of changes to geographical names. The system is not used by [[North Korea]]. Examples of changes include:\n*Inch\u014fn \u2192 [[Incheon]]\n*Ky\u014fngju \u2192 [[Gyeongju]]\n*Pusan \u2192 [[Busan]]\n*Taegu \u2192 [[Daegu]]\n*Taej\u014fn \u2192 [[Daejeon]]\n\n==Exonyms and endonyms==\nFor geographical entities with multiple pre-existing names in one or more languages, an [[exonym and endonym|exonym or endonym]] may gradually be substituted and used in the English language.\n\n*Transfer of a city between countries with very different patterns of [[phonology]] can result in seeming changes of name. Changes can be as slight as Stra\u00dfburg (Germany) and [[Strasbourg]] (France). Some are less subtle: [[Thessaloniki]], built in 4th century BC in [[Macedonia (ancient kingdom)|ancient Macedonia]] became Selanik in the [[Ottoman Empire]] and sometimes being referred to as Salonica, now [[Thessaloniki]] in [[Greece]]; Pilsen in the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] became [[Plze\u0148]] in Czechoslovakia; [[Chi\u0219in\u0103u]], now the capital of Moldova, was in Russian and Soviet times part of Romania and known as [[Kishinev]] (the latter name is used in English in certain historical contexts, e.g. [[Kishinev pogrom]]). Some are translations; Karlsbad become [[Karlovy Vary]].    \n*When the formerly-German city of [[Danzig]] came under Polish rule, it became known in English by its Polish name of [[Gda\u0144sk]]. But when [[Winston Churchill]] gave his [[Iron Curtain]] speech he still spoke of a city in Poland by its German name ([[Stettin]]) instead of its contemporary Polish name [[Szczecin]] even though Churchill fully accepted the transfer of the formerly-German city to Poland, probably because it is [[German phonology]], not [[Polish phonology|Polish]], that is closer to [[English phonology|English]]. The pattern is far from uniform, and it takes time. \n*The Soviet Union replaced German city names in the former East Prussia that became the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] and Japanese place names in southern [[Sakhalin Island]] with Russian names unrelated to the old German and Japanese place names after annexing them in the aftermath of World War II.\n*The military junta changed the official English name of [[Burma]] to [[Myanmar]] in 1988, even though both were pre-existing names which originated from the Burmese language and used interchangeably depending on contexts (see [[Names of Myanmar]]).\n*Decolonisation in India saw a trend to [[Renaming of cities in India|change the established English names of cities to the names in the local language.]] Since then, changes have included [[Chennai]] (from Madras in August 1996), [[Kolkata]] (from Calcutta in January 2001) and [[Mumbai]] (from Bombay in 1995), amongst many others.\n*The People's Republic of China, upon its founding and new nationalities policy, changed the names of cities in [[List of ethnic groups in China|ethnic minority]] regions from sometimes patronising [[Chinese language]] names to those of the native language. For example, it changed Dihua to [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] and Zhenxi to [[Barkol]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.chinaembassycanada.org/eng/zt/zfbps/t37787.htm|title=Full text of white paper on history, development of Xinjiang|date=2003-10-24|accessdate=2010-08-23|agency=[[Xinhua]]|publisher=[[Chinese Embassy, Ottawa]]}}</ref>\n*After the occupation of the communist [[North Vietnam]] at the end of the [[Vietnam War]], the city of [[Ho Chi Minh City|Saigon]] changed its name to [[Ho Chi Minh City]] (after the late leader of North Vietnam [[Ho Chi Minh]]) to symbolize the north's victory in the war. Despite the official name change, however, many older Americans (especially those who fought in the Vietnam War) still refer to the city as Saigon. Even many Vietnamese still refer to the city as Saigon.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.tripsavvy.com/where-is-saigon-1458405|title=Which Name to Use for Vietnam's Largest City|work=TripSavvy|access-date=2018-10-27}}</ref> The name of the river, however, remains unchanged, the [[Saigon River]].\n\n==Changes resulting from splits and mergers==\n*[[Czechoslovakia]] got its name from the agglomeration of the [[Czechs|Czech]] and [[Slovaks|Slovak]] peoples in 1918. It [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|peacefully dissolved]] into the [[Czech Republic|Czech]] and [[Slovak Republic]]s in 1993.\n*[[Yugoslavia]] (\"Land of the South Slavs\") was originally ''Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes'', created by joining [[Kingdom of Serbia]], [[Kingdom of Montenegro]] and parts of [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] inhabited by [[South Slavs]] (today comprising [[Croatia]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Slovenia]] and [[Vojvodina]] (i.e. the Northern part of modern [[Serbia]])) . It became Yugoslavia in 1929. It subsequently split into the modern states of Serbia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Slovenia, North Macedonia and Montenegro between 1991\u20132006. Serbia's [[Autonomous Province of Kosovo and Metohija|autonomous province of Kosovo and Metohija]] unilaterally declared its independence in 2008.\n*[[The Gambia]] and [[Senegal]] became one as [[Senegambia Confederation]] 1982\u20131989\n*[[Tanganyika]] and [[Zanzibar]] joined to become [[Tanzania]]\n*[[Egypt]] and [[Syria]] were briefly joined as the [[United Arab Republic]]\n*[[Federation of Malaya|Malaya]] merged with the northern Borneo territories of [[Sabah]] and [[Sarawak]] to become [[Malaysia]] in 1963.\n*Various places split by compass directions, such as [[North Dakota|North]] and [[South Dakota]], [[West Virginia]] and [[Virginia]], [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]], [[East Germany|East]] and [[West Germany]], etc. South Yemen was previously known as the [[Aden Protectorate]] and by other names.

This was reaffirmed in a High Court decision in January 2007 when Derry City Council sought guidance on the procedure for effecting a name change.  The name ''Derry'' is preferred by [[Irish nationalism|nationalists]] and it is broadly used throughout [[Northern Ireland]]'s [[Roman Catholicism in Northern Ireland|Catholic]] community, as well as that of the [[Republic of Ireland]], whereas many [[Unionists (Ireland)|unionists]] prefer ''Londonderry''; however in everyday conversation ''Derry'' is used by most [[Protestantism in Northern Ireland|Protestant]] residents of the city.
