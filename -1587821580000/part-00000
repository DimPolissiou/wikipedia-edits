King Jaipal then sent a new message to the Sultan and his Amir, stating \"You have seen the impetuosity of the Hindus and their indifference to death. If you insist on war in the hope of obtaining plunder, tribute, elephants and slaves, then you leave us no alternative but to destroy our property, take the eyes out of our elephants, cast our families in fire, and commit mass suicide, so that all that will be left to you to conquer and seize is stones and dirt, dead bodies, and scattered bones.\"<ref name= Sabuktigin >Al-Utbi, [[Tarikh Yamini]], For English translation, see: Elliot and Dowson, The History of India, as Told by Its Own Historians - The Muhammadan Period, Vol 2, Trubner London, pp. 18\u201324</ref> Amir Sabuktigin then promised peace in exchange for a large ransom.
