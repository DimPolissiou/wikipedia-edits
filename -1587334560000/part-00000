Fistoulari also gave orchestral concerts during this time.<ref name=\"Brook\"/>\n\nIn 1939 he joined the [[French army]], but was invalided out and after the [[Fall of France]] managed to get to Cherbourg having left all his possessions in Paris, and escaped to England where he remained for the rest of [[World War II]]. In 1943, he was appointed principal conductor of the [[London Philharmonic Orchestra]]. During this period, he had a contract for 120 concerts, a great responsibility for the youthful conductor. His repertoire widened to include items like his father-in-law's [[Symphony No. 4 (Mahler)|Fourth Symphony]] in his busy concert schedule. In 1948, he became a British citizen. He conducted opera and concert schedules especially with either the London Philharmonic or [[London Symphony Orchestra]]s. He conducted operas in New York and was a guest conductor in many countries. In 1956, he toured France and the [[USSR]] with the London Philharmonic Orchestra.\n\nOperatic work in Britain began with a ''[[Sorochintsy Fair]]'' production that toured the country,<ref name=\"Operaobit\"/> starting at the Savoy Theatre in 1941 and notching up 200 perforamcnes around the UK.

''Opera'', March 1951, Vol.2 No.4, p198</ref>\n\nHe made a number of studio recordings from the late 1940s through the mid-1960s, most of them dance or ballet music, overtures and concertos as accompanist. Fistoulari specialised in the interpretation of [[ballet music]]. He was also a noted conductor of Tchaikovsky and the [[The Mighty Handful|Russian School]], as well as romantic and impressionistic French music. In the 1950s his recordings were mostly for [[MGM]], [[Decca Records|Decca]], [[EMI]], [[RCA]] and [[Mercury Records|Mercury]]. Of special note, the Mercury performances of ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' by [[L\u00e9o Delibes]] and ''[[Giselle]]'' by [[Adolphe Adam]].

Kulhavy (1977), who wrote an educational review focusing on students and the correction process. Kulhavy discovered that those students who had confidently answered incorrectly on tests or other modes of examination such as homework, when corrected, were much more likely to remember the material on later tests.<ref name=\"Kulhavy\">{{cite journal|last1=Kulhavy|first1=Raymond W.|title=Feedback in Written Instruction|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1977|volume=47|issue=2|pages=211\u2013232|jstor=1170128|doi=10.2307/1170128}}</ref>\n\nIn a study by the same researchers in 2006, Metcalfe and Butterfield, hypercorrection effect and its implications are further examined. Beginning with the presupposition that an error committed with high confidence would require a great deal of effort to overwrite, the researchers concluded that errors committed with a great deal of confidence were among the easiest errors to correct.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11409-006-6894-z|title=The correction of errors committed with high confidence|year=2006|last1=Butterfield|first1=Brady|last2=Metcalfe|first2=Janet|journal=Metacognition and Learning|volume=1|pages=69\u201384}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nEven though conceptions about hypercorrection emerged in [[educational research]], it is not limited only to the learning environment. General knowledge errors can be learned from books, movies, or television, especially with the natural tendencies to believe things are true.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=A.

Understandably, many believe this because of depictions of such raindrops on [[weather channel]]s.\n\nHypercorrection has been replicated numerous times by various people. In the past few years, hypercorrection research has focused on the factors behind it and whether people of all ages exhibit this phenomenon. There has been evidence that surprise or embarrassment of getting the answer wrong has a role in hypercorrection. For example, a person says that [[scallop]]s come from trees. This person's friends laugh, pointing out that scallops come from the ocean. Embarrassed that the response was incorrect, the person makes sure to remember this fact to avoid embarrassment. Another factor implicated in hypercorrection is more vocabulary or knowledge about answers that the individual was certain instead of unsure about. Recent research has found that subjects are likely to guess or pick the correct answer on retests when they were sure about their response on the original test.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2014\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2014.04.001|title=Hypercorrection of high confidence errors: Prior testing both enhances delayed performance and blocks the return of the errors|year=2014|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Miele|first2=David B.|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition|volume=3|issue=3|pages=189\u2013197}}</ref> This suggests that familiarity with the information may be part of producing the hypercorrection effect.\n\nThe claims about the hypercorrection effect stating that it has a significant part in the correction of mistakes have also been supported by a study done using brain imaging. Janet Metcalfe, Brady Butterfield, Christian Habeck, and Yaakov Stern (2012) conducted an experiment using fMRI to observe neural correlations related to the hypercorrection effects in people. 15 people participated in the experiment; 10 women and 5 men. The experimenters delivered a questionnaire to the participants and recorded brain activities using fMRI, while correcting incorrect answers. It was discovered that while participants received their correction after committing a mistake, the brain was showing activation of the Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) which indicates that they were entertaining the original false belief as well as the true belief.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00228|title=Neural Correlates of People's Hypercorrection of Their False Beliefs|year=2012|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Butterfield|first2=Brady|last3=Habeck|first3=Christian|last4=Stern|first4=Yaakov|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1571\u20131583|pmid=22452558|pmc=3970786}}</ref>\n\nBecause the hypercorrection effect is all about our knowledge, knowledge errors, and their effects on our correction of knowledge errors, it seems likely that this effect will have been studied in genuine classroom settings. Yet, hypercorrection effects have mostly been studied by observation only of past scenarios. This effect has mostly been studied only in typical laboratory settings. A study done by Carpenter, Haynes, Corral, and Yeung (2018) is one of the first times this effect has been studied in an authentic educational context. This study was conducted in a certain university\u2019s introductory horticulture class. The students in this class were first presented with questionnaires related to the educational content of that course. They were then presented with the correct answers and were later given a post-test to test the same information in the same way once again. When analyzing the test, the researchers determined that there was a powerful hypercorrection effect present in the results. In analyzing these results, the researchers found that students who had a higher previous knowledge and understanding of the material not only showed a higher confidence in their original answers but exhibited a much more prevalent and more impressive hypercorrection effect of their inaccurate answers. We see from this and the other studies mentioned that a higher general knowledge of the topic seems to also bring along with it a more potent hypercorrection effect.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09658211.2018.1477164|title=Hypercorrection of high-confidence errors in the classroom|year=2018|last1=Carpenter|first1=Shana K.|last2=Haynes|first2=Cynthia L.|last3=Corral|first3=Daniel|last4=Yeung|first4=Kam Leung|journal=Memory|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1379\u20131384|pmid=29781391}}</ref>\n\nJanet Metcalfe (2017) explores the effect and possible repercussions of not using this hypercorrection effect to our advantage in the classroom. In an annual psychology review she wrote on this topic; she explains how focusing solely on avoiding errors completely before testing in the classroom may actually be a disadvantageous method of teaching and learning. This claim is made only for neurologically typical students. Metcalfe even goes as far to say that it may actually be a beneficial practice for students in education to commit and correct errors while in low-stakes situations as a method of coming to learn and understand the given material more unshakably.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2017\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022|title=Learning from Errors|year=2017|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=68|pages=465\u2013489|pmid=27648988|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Hypercorrection and age==\n\nThere have been implications that age plays a role because not all people show this effect. Most studies in the past have asked young adults to answer general knowledge questions. Recently, older adults have been tested and have not shown the hypercorrection effect, though this does not provide definitive evidence to state that older adults cannot exhibit this phenomenon. <ref name=\"Eich 2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13825585.2012.754399|title=The hypercorrection effect in younger and older adults|year=2013|last1=Eich|first1=Teal S.|last2=Stern|first2=Yaakov|last3=Metcalfe|first3=Janet|journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition|volume=20|issue=5|pages=511\u2013521|pmid=23241028|pmc=3604148}}</ref> However, whether older adults are better at correcting knowledge they are unsure about or they are worse at hypercorrection is still to be determined.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Casal-Roscum|first2=L.|last3=Radin|first3=A.|last4=Friedman|first4=D.|title=On Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks|journal=Psychological Science|date=2015|doi=10.1177/0956797615597912|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1833\u20131842|pmid=26494598|pmc=4679660}}</ref> The result for children are not concrete, but some say that the [[prefrontal cortex]] is important to hypercorrection. This would be a plausible explanation since elders may have impaired prefrontal cortices and children's may be underdeveloped.\n\nIn speaking about the difference in hypercorrection\u2019s effects relative to age, we learn from Metcalfe, Stern, and Eich (2014) that while older adults were seen to do a better job with general test accuracy, they had a low occurrence of the hypercorrection effect while younger adults were shown to display this phenomenon more frequently. <ref name=\"Eich 2013\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThe hypercorrection effect has been demonstrated and replicated in several settings and with many different types of participants in recent years. Metcalfe, J., & Miele, D. B. (2014).

When the test is returned, the answer has been corrected to Harrisburg. Shocked that the answer was incorrect, the student is more likely to make sure to remember the correct answer than the student who was originally unsure about the answer.\n\nThe hypercorrection effect explores whether making mistakes early on in the learning process can be beneficial to the learner and their encoding of the material.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2017\" /> \n\n==History==\nThe pattern was named \"hypercorrection\" by psychologists Janet Metcalfe and Brady Butterfield of [[Columbia University]] in 2001.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butterfield|first1=B.|last2=Metcalfe|first2=J.|title=Errors committed with high confidence are hypercorrected.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition|date=2001|volume=27|issue=6|pages=1491\u20131494|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/xlm/27/6/1491/|accessdate=April 19, 2016|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.27.6.1491}}</ref> However, it was originally noticed by Raymond W. Kulhavy (1977). He wrote an educational review focusing on students and the correction process. He discovered that those students who had confidently answered incorrectly on tests or other modes of examination such as homework, when corrected, were much more likely to remember the material on later tests.<ref name=\"Kulhavy\">{{cite journal|last1=Kulhavy|first1=Raymond W.|title=Feedback in Written Instruction|journal=Review of Educational Research|date=1977|volume=47|issue=2|pages=211\u2013232|jstor=1170128|doi=10.2307/1170128}}</ref>\n\nIn a study by these same researchers in 2006, Metcalfe and Butterfield, we are even more fully introduced to this hypercorrection effect and its implications. They begin with the presupposition that an error committed with high confidence would require a great deal of effort to overwrite. The finding though, as introduced earlier, was that errors committed with a great deal of confidence were among the easiest errors to correct.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s11409-006-6894-z|title=The correction of errors committed with high confidence|year=2006|last1=Butterfield|first1=Brady|last2=Metcalfe|first2=Janet|journal=Metacognition and Learning|volume=1|pages=69\u201384}}</ref>\n\n==Research==\n\nEven though conceptions about hypercorrection emerged in [[educational research]], it is not limited only to the learning environment. General knowledge errors can be learned from books, movies, or television, especially with the natural tendencies to believe things are true.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Butler|first1=A.

Understandably, many believe this because of depictions of such raindrops on [[weather channel]]s.\n\nHypercorrection has been replicated numerous times by various people. In the past few years, hypercorrection research has focused on the factors behind it and whether people of all ages exhibit this phenomenon. There has been evidence that surprise or embarrassment of getting the answer wrong has a role in hypercorrection. For example, a person says that [[scallop]]s come from trees. This person's friends laugh, pointing out that scallops come from the ocean. Embarrassed that the response was incorrect, the person makes sure to remember this fact to avoid embarrassment. Another factor implicated in hypercorrection is more vocabulary or knowledge about answers that the individual was certain instead of unsure about. Recent research has found that subjects are likely to guess or pick the correct answer on retests when they were sure about their response on the original test.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2014\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.jarmac.2014.04.001|title=Hypercorrection of high confidence errors: Prior testing both enhances delayed performance and blocks the return of the errors|year=2014|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Miele|first2=David B.|journal=Journal of Applied Research in Memory and Cognition|volume=3|issue=3|pages=189\u2013197}}</ref> This suggests that familiarity with the information may be part of producing the hypercorrection effect.\n\nThe claims about the hypercorrection effect stating that it has a significant part in the correction of mistakes have also been supported by a study done using brain imaging. Janet Metcalfe, Brady Butterfield, Christian Habeck, and Yaakov Stern (2012) conducted an experiment using fMRI to observe neural correlations related to the hypercorrection effects in people. 15 people participated in the experiment; 10 women and 5 men. The experimenters delivered a questionnaire to the participants and recorded brain activities using fMRI, while correcting incorrect answers. It was discovered that while participants received their correction after committing a mistake, the brain was showing activation of the Temporoparietal Junction (TPJ) which indicates that they were entertaining the original false belief as well as the true belief.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1162/jocn_a_00228|title=Neural Correlates of People's Hypercorrection of Their False Beliefs|year=2012|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|last2=Butterfield|first2=Brady|last3=Habeck|first3=Christian|last4=Stern|first4=Yaakov|journal=Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1571\u20131583|pmid=22452558|pmc=3970786}}</ref>\n\nBecause the hypercorrection effect is all about our knowledge, knowledge errors, and their effects on our correction of knowledge errors, it seems likely that this effect will have been studied in genuine classroom settings. Yet, hypercorrection effects have mostly been studied by observation only of past scenarios. This effect has mostly been studied only in typical laboratory settings. A study done by Carpenter, Haynes, Corral, and Yeung (2018) is one of the first times this effect has been studied in an authentic educational context. This study was conducted in a certain university\u2019s introductory horticulture class. The students in this class were first presented with questionnaires related to the educational content of that course. They were then presented with the correct answers and were later given a post-test to test the same information in the same way once again. When analyzing the test, the researchers determined that there was a powerful hypercorrection effect present in the results. In analyzing these results, the researchers found that students who had a higher previous knowledge and understanding of the material not only showed a higher confidence in their original answers but exhibited a much more prevalent and more impressive hypercorrection effect of their inaccurate answers. We see from this and the other studies mentioned that a higher general knowledge of the topic seems to also bring along with it a more potent hypercorrection effect.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/09658211.2018.1477164|title=Hypercorrection of high-confidence errors in the classroom|year=2018|last1=Carpenter|first1=Shana K.|last2=Haynes|first2=Cynthia L.|last3=Corral|first3=Daniel|last4=Yeung|first4=Kam Leung|journal=Memory|volume=26|issue=10|pages=1379\u20131384|pmid=29781391}}</ref>\n\nJanet Metcalfe (2017) explores the effect and possible repercussions of not using this hypercorrection effect to our advantage in the classroom. In an annual psychology review she wrote on this topic; she explains how focusing solely on avoiding errors completely before testing in the classroom may actually be a disadvantageous method of teaching and learning. This claim is made only for neurologically typical students. Metcalfe even goes as far to say that it may actually be a beneficial practice for students in education to commit and correct errors while in low-stakes situations as a method of coming to learn and understand the given material more unshakably.<ref name=\"Metcalfe 2017\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1146/annurev-psych-010416-044022|title=Learning from Errors|year=2017|last1=Metcalfe|first1=Janet|journal=Annual Review of Psychology|volume=68|pages=465\u2013489|pmid=27648988|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\n==Hypercorrection and age==\n\nThere have been implications that age plays a role because not all people show this effect. Most studies in the past have asked young adults to answer general knowledge questions. Recently, older adults have been tested and have not shown the hypercorrection effect, though this does not provide definitive evidence to state that older adults cannot exhibit this phenomenon. <ref name=\"Eich 2013\">{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13825585.2012.754399|title=The hypercorrection effect in younger and older adults|year=2013|last1=Eich|first1=Teal S.|last2=Stern|first2=Yaakov|last3=Metcalfe|first3=Janet|journal=Aging, Neuropsychology, and Cognition|volume=20|issue=5|pages=511\u2013521|pmid=23241028|pmc=3604148}}</ref> However, whether older adults are better at correcting knowledge they are unsure about or they are worse at hypercorrection is still to be determined.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Metcalfe|first1=J.|last2=Casal-Roscum|first2=L.|last3=Radin|first3=A.|last4=Friedman|first4=D.|title=On Teaching Old Dogs New Tricks|journal=Psychological Science|date=2015|doi=10.1177/0956797615597912|volume=26|issue=12|pages=1833\u20131842|pmid=26494598|pmc=4679660}}</ref> The result for children are not concrete, but some say that the [[prefrontal cortex]] is important to hypercorrection. This would be a plausible explanation since elders may have impaired prefrontal cortices and children's may be underdeveloped.\n\nIn speaking about the difference in hypercorrection\u2019s effects relative to age, we learn from Metcalfe, Stern, and Eich (2014) that while older adults were seen to do a better job with general test accuracy, they had a low occurrence of the hypercorrection effect while younger adults were shown to display this phenomenon more frequently. <ref name=\"Eich 2013\"/>\n\n==Recent developments==\nThe hypercorrection effect has been demonstrated and replicated in several settings and with many different types of participants in recent years.

Van Lear was named for Van Lear Black, one of the company's directors. Although most of Butcher Hollow lies outside of the old Van Lear city limits, the mailing address of those who have lived there has been Van Lear since the establishment of the Van Lear post office in 1909. Butcher Hollow is not an independent town or village in its own right.  Currently, Van Lear is an unincorporated community. There are no deep mines operating in Van Lear proper, although some mines operate nearby. Most of the residents work in locations outside Van Lear, including the nearby cities of Paintsville, Prestonsburg, and [[Pikeville, Kentucky|Pikeville]].

Colloquially, this has led to the somewhat tongue-in-cheek definition that a \"holler\" is called such because of the need to \"holler\" to communicate with the nearest neighbor. In the hills of Kentucky, most of the fertile, tillable property is adjacent to the creeks that run down the hollow. When people settled the region, they pulled their wagons into the hollow along the creek and built a cabin high enough on the hillside not to be flooded during seasonal high rainfall events. The roads were dirt, and/or the dry creek bed during periods of low water. The saying, \"We will be there come hell or high water,\" is related to the road being a part of and/or crossing the creek in a hollow.\n\n==Tours==\nHundreds of tourists visit the town of Van Lear each year to see the childhood home of Loretta Lynn, [[Crystal Gayle]], and their siblings. Herman Webb, one of Lynn's brothers, had traditionally conducted this tour, with other family members stepping in when Herman is unavailable.
