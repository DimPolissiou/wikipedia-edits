All of these materials have characteristic patterns in their visible-infrared reflections and are readily seen by CRISM.  In addition, CRISM is monitoring ice and dust particulates in the [[Atmosphere of Mars|Martian atmosphere]] to learn more about its climate and seasons.\n\n==Instrument overview==\nCRISM measures [[light|visible]] and [[infrared]] [[electromagnetic radiation]] from 370 to 3920 [[nanometer]]s in 6.55 nanometer increments.  The instrument has two modes, a [[multispectral]] untargeted mode and a [[hyperspectral]] targeted mode.  In the untargeted mode, CRISM reconnoiters Mars, recording approximately 50 of its 544 measurable wavelengths at a resolution of 100 to 200 meters per pixel.  In this mode CRISM will map half of Mars within a few months after aerobraking and most of the planet after one year.<ref name=science>{{cite web|url=http://crism.jhuapl.edu/science.html |title=Disappearing with a Trace |website=APL CRISM website |accessdate=2006-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430200256/http://crism.jhuapl.edu/science.html |archivedate=2006-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The objective of this mode is to identify new scientifically interesting locations that could be further investigated.<ref name=science/> In targeted mode, the spectrometer measures energy in all 544 wavelengths.

The extra time collecting data over a targeted area increases the [[signal to noise ratio]] as well as the spatial and spectral resolution of the image.  This scanning ability also allows the instrument to perform emission phase functions, viewing the same surface through variable amounts of atmosphere, which can be used to determine atmospheric properties.  The Data Processing Unit (DPU) of CRISM performs in-flight data processing including compressing the data before transmission.\n\n==Investigations==\nCRISM began its exploration of Mars in late 2006.

The minerals indicate where liquid water existed long enough to react chemically with rock. Which minerals form depends on temperature, salinity, [[pH]], and composition of the parent rock. Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments. The OMEGA spectrometer on the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter and the [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] rovers both uncovered evidence for aqueous minerals. OMEGA revealed two distinct kinds of past aqueous deposits.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars express data |vauthors=Bibring JP, Langevin Y, Mustard JF, Poulet F, Arvidson R, Gendrin A, Gondet B, Mangold N, Pinet P, Forget F | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n| volume = 312\n| issue = 5772\n| date = 2006\n| pages = 400\u2013404\n| doi=10.1126/science.1122659\n| pmid = 16627738 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B }}\n</ref> The first, containing sulfates such as gypsum and kieserite, is found in layered deposits of [[Hesperian]] age (Martian middle age, roughly from 3.7 to 3 billion years ago). The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of [[Noachian]] age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The [[Opportunity (rover)|MER Opportunity]] rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals.\n\nSoil forms from parent rocks through physical disintegration of rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can reveal if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals in the soil or regolith, the instrument is being used to help decipher ancient Martian environments.

Delta.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The delta in Eberswalde crater, as imaged by MOC]]\n\nLake and marine environments on Earth are favorable for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments they left behind are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps us to understand the sequence of events that formed the sedimentary rocks. The [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors ([[alluvial fans]]) or in crater lakes ([[River delta|deltas]]). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay.<ref>Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.)  2012.  Sedimentary Geology of Mars.  SEPM</ref><ref>Milliken, R. and T. Bish.  2010.  Sources and sinks of clay minerals on Mars.  [[Philosophical Magazine]]: 90. 2293-2308</ref> More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.\n\nNot all ancient Martian lakes were fed by inflowing valley networks. CRISM discovered several craters on the western slope of Tharsis that contain \"bathtub rings\" of sulfate minerals and a kind of phyllosilicate called kaolinite. Both minerals can form together by precipitating out of acidic, saline water. These craters lack inflowing valley networks, showing that they were not fed by rivers - instead, they must have been fed by inflowing groundwater.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035986 | doi=10.1029/2010JE003694| title=Columbus crater and other possible groundwater-fed paleolakes of Terra Sirenum, Mars| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research| volume=116| year=2011| last1=Wray| first1=J.

Some are associated with central peaks of impact craters, which are sites of heating driven by meteor impact. Silica has also been identified on the flanks of volcanic inside the caldera of the [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]] shield volcano, forming light-colored mounds that look like scaled-up versions of [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]]. Elsewhere, in the westernmost parts of Valles Marineris, near the core of the Tharsis volcanic province, there are sulfate and clay deposits suggestive of \"warm\" springs. Hot spring deposits are one of the most promising areas on Mars to search for evidence for past life.[[Image:PIA19817-Mars-NiliFossae-CarbonateRichDeposit-20150902.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Nili Fossae on Mars - largest known carbonate deposit.]]\n\nOne of the leading hypotheses for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, to try to solve this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in [[Nili Fossae]] in 2008.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |year=2008\n |title=Orbital identification of carbonate-bearing rocks on Mars\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=322 |pages=1828\u20131832\n |doi=10.1126/science.1164759\n |pmid=19095939\n |last2=Mustard\n |first2=JF\n |last3=Murchie\n |first3=SL\n |last4=Poulet\n |first4=F\n |last5=Bishop\n |first5=JL\n |last6=Brown\n |first6=AJ\n |last7=Calvin\n |first7=WM\n |last8=Clark\n |first8=RN\n |last9=Marais\n |first9=DJ\n |last10=Milliken\n |first10=R.

Remote and landed measurements prior to CRISM, and analysis of Martian meteorites, all suggest that the Martian crust is made mostly of basaltic igneous rock composed mostly of [[feldspar]] and [[pyroxene]]. Images from the [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] on MGS showed that in some places the upper few kilometers of the crust is composed of hundreds of thin volcanic lava flows. TES and THEMIS both found mostly basaltic igneous rock, with scattered olivine-rich and even some quartz-rich rocks.\n\nThe first recognition of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars came from the Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bibring | first1 = JP | last2 = Langevin | first2 = Y | last3 = Mustard | first3 = JF | last4 = Poulet | first4 = F | last5 = Arvidson | first5 = R | last6 = Gendrin | first6 = A | last7 = Gondet | first7 = B | last8 = Mangold | first8 = N | last9 = Pinet | first9 = P | last10 = Forget | first10 = F | year = 2006 | title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars express data | url = | journal = Science | volume = 312 | issue = 5772| pages = 400\u2013404 | doi = 10.1126/science.1122659 | pmid = 16627738 | bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B}}</ref> Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.\n\n===Modern climates===\nTo understand Mars' ancient climate, and whether it might have created environments habitable for life, first we need to understand Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During southern summer, when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole.\n\nMars' atmosphere is so thin and wispy that solar heating of dust and ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20\u201330% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.\n\nThe south polar seasonal cap has a bizarre variety of bright and dark streaks and spots that appear during spring, as carbon dioxide ice sublimates. Prior to MRO there were various ideas for processes that could form these strange features, a leading model being [[Geyser (Mars)|carbon dioxide geysers]].<ref>Piqueux, Sylvain; Shane Byrne; Mark I.

The instrument has two modes, a [[multispectral]] untargeted mode and a [[hyperspectral]] targeted mode.  In the untargeted mode, CRISM reconnoiters Mars, recording approximately 50 of its 544 measurable wavelengths at a resolution of 100 to 200 meters per pixel.  In this mode CRISM will map half of Mars within a few months after aerobraking and most of the planet after one year.<ref name=science>{{cite web|url=http://crism.jhuapl.edu/science.html |title=Disappearing with a Trace |website=APL CRISM website |accessdate=2006-06-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060430200256/http://crism.jhuapl.edu/science.html |archivedate=2006-04-30 |url-status=dead }}</ref>  The objective of this mode is to identify new scientifically interesting locations that could be further investigated.<ref name=science/> In targeted mode, the spectrometer measures energy in all 544 wavelengths.

Which aqueous minerals are present on Mars therefore provides important clues to understanding past environments. The OMEGA spectrometer on the ''[[Mars Express]]'' orbiter and the [[Mars Exploration Rover|MER]] rovers both uncovered evidence for aqueous minerals. OMEGA revealed two distinct kinds of past aqueous deposits.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars express data |vauthors=Bibring JP, Langevin Y, Mustard JF, Poulet F, Arvidson R, Gendrin A, Gondet B, Mangold N, Pinet P, Forget F | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]]\n| volume = 312\n| issue = 5772\n| date = 2006\n| pages = 400\u2013404\n| doi=10.1126/science.1122659\n| pmid = 16627738 |bibcode = 2006Sci...312..400B }}\n</ref> The first, containing sulfates such as gypsum and kieserite, is found in layered deposits of [[Hesperian]] age (Martian middle age, roughly from 3.7 to 3 billion years ago). The second, rich in several different kinds of phyllosilicates, instead occurs rocks of [[Noachian]] age (older than about 3.7 billion years). The different ages and mineral chemistries suggest an early water-rich environment in which phyllosilicates formed, followed by a dryer, more saline and acidic environment in which sulfates formed. The [[Opportunity (rover)|MER Opportunity]] rover spent years exploring sedimentary rocks formed in the latter environment, full of sulfates, salts, and oxidized iron minerals.\n\nSoil forms from parent rocks through physical disintegration of rocks and by chemical alteration of the rock fragments. The types of soil minerals can reveal if the environment was cool or warm, wet or dry, or whether the water was fresh or salty. Because CRISM is able to detect many minerals in the soil or regolith, the instrument is being used to help decipher ancient Martian environments. CRISM has found a characteristic layering pattern of aluminum-rich clays overlying iron- and magnesium-rich clays in many areas scattered through Mars' highlands.<ref>Murchie, S. et al.  2009.

Delta.jpg|left|thumb|200px|The delta in Eberswalde crater, as imaged by MOC]]\n\nLake and marine environments on Earth are favorable for fossil preservation, especially where the sediments they left behind are rich in carbonates or clays. Hundreds of highland craters on Mars have horizontally layered, sedimentary rocks that may have formed in lakes. CRISM has taken many targeted observations of these rocks to measure their mineralogy and how the minerals vary between layers. Variation between layers helps us to understand the sequence of events that formed the sedimentary rocks. The [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] found that where valley networks empty into craters, commonly the craters contain fan-shaped deposits. However it was not completely clear if the fans formed by sediment deposition on dry crater floors ([[alluvial fans]]) or in crater lakes ([[River delta|deltas]]). CRISM discovered that in the fans' lowermost layers, there are concentrated deposits of clay.<ref>Grotzinger, J. and R. Milliken (eds.)  2012.  Sedimentary Geology of Mars.  SEPM</ref><ref>Milliken, R. and T. Bish.  2010.  Sources and sinks of clay minerals on Mars.  [[Philosophical Magazine]]: 90. 2293-2308</ref> More clay occurs beyond the end of the fans on the crater floors, and in some cases there is also opal. On Earth, the lowermost layers of deltas are called bottom set beds, and they are made of clays that settled out of inflowing river water in quiet, deep parts of the lakes. This discovery supports the idea that many fans formed in crater lakes where, potentially, evidence for habitable environments could be preserved.\n\nNot all ancient Martian lakes were fed by inflowing valley networks. CRISM discovered several craters on the western slope of Tharsis that contain \"bathtub rings\" of sulfate minerals and a kind of phyllosilicate called kaolinite. Both minerals can form together by precipitating out of acidic, saline water. These craters lack inflowing valley networks, showing that they were not fed by rivers - instead, they must have been fed by inflowing groundwater.<ref>{{Cite journal | url=https://pubs.er.usgs.gov/publication/70035986 | doi=10.1029/2010JE003694| title=Columbus crater and other possible groundwater-fed paleolakes of Terra Sirenum, Mars| journal=Journal of Geophysical Research| volume=116| year=2011| last1=Wray| first1=J.

One of the signatures of hot springs on Earth is deposits of silica. The [[Spirit (rover)|MER Spirit]] rover explored a silica-rich deposit called \"Home Plate\" that is thought to have formed in a hot spring.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/mer/mer-20070521.html|title=Mars Rover Spirit Unearths Surprise Evidence of Wetter Past|accessdate=May 30, 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Science|volume=320|pages=1063\u20131067|author=Squyres|display-authors=8|title=Detection of Silica-Rich Deposits on Mars|doi=10.1126/science.1155429|date=2008|pmid=18497295|issue=5879|last2=Arvidson|first2=RE|last3=Ruff|first3=S|last4=Gellert|first4=R|last5=Morris|first5=RV|last6=Ming|first6=DW|last7=Crumpler|first7=L|last8=Farmer|first8=JD|last9=Marais|first9=DJ|last10=Yen|first10=A.|last11=McLennan|first11=S.

Some are associated with central peaks of impact craters, which are sites of heating driven by meteor impact. Silica has also been identified on the flanks of volcanic inside the caldera of the [[Syrtis Major Planum|Syrtis Major]] shield volcano, forming light-colored mounds that look like scaled-up versions of [[Home Plate (Mars)|Home Plate]]. Elsewhere, in the westernmost parts of Valles Marineris, near the core of the Tharsis volcanic province, there are sulfate and clay deposits suggestive of \"warm\" springs. Hot spring deposits are one of the most promising areas on Mars to search for evidence for past life.[[Image:PIA19817-Mars-NiliFossae-CarbonateRichDeposit-20150902.jpg|left|200px|thumb|Nili Fossae on Mars - largest known carbonate deposit.]]\n\nOne of the leading hypotheses for why ancient Mars was wetter than today is that a thick, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere created a global greenhouse, that warmed the surface enough for liquid water to occur in large amounts. Carbon dioxide ice in today's polar caps is too limited in volume to hold that ancient atmosphere. If a thick atmosphere ever existed, it was either blown into space by solar wind or impacts, or reacted with silicate rocks to become trapped as carbonates in Mars' crust. One of the goals that drove CRISM's design was to find carbonates, to try to solve this question about what happened to Mars' atmosphere. And one of CRISM's most important discoveries was the identification of carbonate bedrock in [[Nili Fossae]] in 2008.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |year=2008\n |title=Orbital identification of carbonate-bearing rocks on Mars\n |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]\n |volume=322 |pages=1828\u20131832\n |doi=10.1126/science.1164759\n |pmid=19095939\n |last2=Mustard\n |first2=JF\n |last3=Murchie\n |first3=SL\n |last4=Poulet\n |first4=F\n |last5=Bishop\n |first5=JL\n |last6=Brown\n |first6=AJ\n |last7=Calvin\n |first7=WM\n |last8=Clark\n |first8=RN\n |last9=Marais\n |first9=DJ\n |last10=Milliken\n |first10=R.

Remote and landed measurements prior to CRISM, and analysis of Martian meteorites, all suggest that the Martian crust is made mostly of basaltic igneous rock composed mostly of [[feldspar]] and [[pyroxene]]. Images from the [[Mars Orbiter Camera]] on MGS showed that in some places the upper few kilometers of the crust is composed of hundreds of thin volcanic lava flows. TES and THEMIS both found mostly basaltic igneous rock, with scattered olivine-rich and even some quartz-rich rocks.\n\nThe first recognition of widespread sedimentary rock on Mars came from the Mars Orbiter Camera which found that several areas of the planet - including Valles Marineris and Terra Arabia - have horizontally layered, light-toned rocks. Follow-up observations of those rocks' mineralogy by OMEGA found that some are rich in sulfate minerals, and that other layered rocks around Mawrth Vallis are rich in phyllosilicates.<ref>Bibring JP, Langevin Y, Mustard JF, Poulet F, Arvidson R, Gendrin A, Gondet B, Mangold N, Pinet P, Forget F (2006). \"Global mineralogical and aqueous mars history derived from OMEGA/Mars express data\" ''Science'' 312 (5772): 400\u2013404. {{Bibcode|2006Sci...312..400B}}. {{doi|10.1126/science.1122659}}. {{PMID|16627738}}</ref> Both class of minerals are signatures of sedimentary rocks. CRISM has used its improved spatial resolution to look for other deposits of sedimentary rock on Mars' surface, and for layers of sedimentary rock buried between layers of volcanic rock in Mars' crust.\n\n===Modern climates===\nTo understand Mars' ancient climate, and whether it might have created environments habitable for life, first we need to understand Mars' climate today. Each mission to Mars has made new advances in understanding its climate. Mars has seasonal variations in the abundances of water vapor, water ice clouds and hazes, and atmospheric dust. During southern summer, when Mars is closest to the Sun (at perihelion), solar heating can raise massive dust storms. Regional dust storms - ones having a 1000-kilometer scale - show surprising repeatability Mars-year to Mars-year. Once every decade or so, they grow into global-scale events. In contrast, during northern summer when Mars is furthest from the Sun (at aphelion), there is an equatorial water-ice cloud belt and very little dust in the atmosphere. Atmospheric water vapor varies in abundance seasonally, with the greatest abundances in each hemisphere's summer after the seasonal polar caps have sublimated into the atmosphere. During winter, both water and carbon dioxide frost and ices form on Mars' surface. These ices form the seasonal and residual polar caps. The seasonal caps - which form each autumn and sublimate each spring - are dominated by carbon dioxide ice. The residual caps - which persist year after year - consist mostly of water ice at the north pole and water ice with a thin veneer (a few 10's of meters thick) of carbon dioxide ice at the south pole.\n\nMars' atmosphere is so thin and wispy that solar heating of dust and ice in the atmosphere - not heating of the atmospheric gases - is more important in driving weather. Small, suspended particles of dust and water ice - aerosols - intercept 20\u201330% of incoming sunlight, even under relatively clear conditions. So variations in the amounts of these aerosols have a huge influence on climate. CRISM has taken three major kinds of measurements of dust and ice in the atmosphere: targeted observations whose repeated views of the surface provide a sensitive estimate of aerosol abundance; special global grids of targeted observations every couple of months designed especially to track spatial and seasonal variations; and scans across the planet's limb to show how dust and ice vary with height above the surface.\n\nThe south polar seasonal cap has a bizarre variety of bright and dark streaks and spots that appear during spring, as carbon dioxide ice sublimates. Prior to MRO there were various ideas for processes that could form these strange features, a leading model being [[Geyser (Mars)|carbon dioxide geysers]].<ref>Piqueux, Sylvain; Shane Byrne; Mark I.

Users can access Gmail on the [[Web application|web]] and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] protocols. Gmail started as a limited [[Software release life cycle|beta release]] on April 1, 2004 and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.\n\nAt launch, Gmail had an initial storage capacity offer of one [[gigabyte]] per user, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from [[Google Drive]] into the message. Gmail has a [[search engine|search]]-oriented interface and a [[Gmail interface#Conversation view|\"conversation view\"]] similar to an [[Internet forum]]. The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]].\n\nGoogle's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter [[Spamming|spam]] and [[malware]], and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited [[data retention]], ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage. The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues.

Users can access Gmail on the [[Web application|web]] and using third-party programs that synchronize email content through [[Post Office Protocol|POP]] or [[Internet Message Access Protocol|IMAP]] protocols. Gmail started as a limited [[Software release life cycle|beta release]] on April 1, 2004 and ended its testing phase on July 7, 2009.\n\nAt launch, Gmail had an initial storage capacity offer of one [[gigabyte]] per user, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time. Today, the service comes with 15 gigabytes of storage. Users can receive emails up to 50 megabytes in size, including attachments, while they can send emails up to 25 megabytes. In order to send larger files, users can insert files from [[Google Drive]] into the message. Gmail has a [[search engine|search]]-oriented interface and a [[Gmail interface#Conversation view|\"conversation view\"]] similar to an [[Internet forum]]. The service is notable among website developers for its early adoption of [[Ajax (programming)|Ajax]].\n\nGoogle's mail servers automatically scan emails for multiple purposes, including to filter [[Spamming|spam]] and [[malware]], and to add context-sensitive advertisements next to emails. This advertising practice has been significantly criticized by privacy advocates due to concerns over unlimited [[data retention]], ease of monitoring by third parties, users of other email providers not having agreed to the policy upon sending emails to Gmail addresses, and the potential for Google to change its policies to further decrease privacy by combining information with other Google data usage. The company has been the subject of lawsuits concerning the issues. Google has stated that email users must \"necessarily expect\" their emails to be subject to automated processing and claims that the service refrains from displaying ads next to potentially sensitive messages, such as those mentioning race, religion, sexual orientation, health, or financial statements. In June 2017, Google announced the end to the use of contextual Gmail content for advertising purposes, relying instead on data gathered from the use of its other services.<ref name=\"No contextual ads\" />\n\nBy 2018, Gmail had 1.5 billion active users worldwide.<ref name=\"Petrova\"/>\n\n==Features==\n\n===Storage===\n[[File:Gmail 2004.png|thumb|The Gmail webmail interface as it originally appeared]]\n\n# On April 1, 2004, Gmail was launched with one [[gigabyte]] (GB) of storage space, a significantly higher amount than competitors offered at the time.<ref>{{cite web |first=Michael |last=Singer |title=Google Testing Free Webmail |url=http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3334201 |website=Internet News |date=March 31, 2004 |access-date=October 27, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161223143809/http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/3334201 |archive-date=December 23, 2016 |url-status=live |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n# On April 1, 2005, the first anniversary of Gmail, the limit was doubled to two gigabytes of storage.

Following a period when he served in various armies in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], he wrote a well-researched book documenting the latest trends in fortification systems across Europe.<ref name=\"Versterckte Vesting\">Ruse's book ''Versterckte Vesting'' written in 1654 (see Bibliography) contains a short autobiography giving details of his early life.</ref> As a result, he was entrusted with commissions for improving defences in his native [[Amsterdam]], in [[Germany]], and finally in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] where, benefitting from the support of the monarchy, he first became a general and later a baron. Ruse died in [[Sauwerd]] near [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nRuse was born in the village of [[Ruinen]] in the Dutch province of [[Drenthe]]. His father, Johan Ruse, who was the parish priest in Ruinen, belonged to a [[Hugenot]] family from eastern France, sympathising with the Protestant theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Unlike his brothers who studied in [[Franeker]], at the age of 15 Ruse began a military career where he saw action under the flags of [[France]], [[Weimar]] and [[Venice]].<ref name=\"Versterckte Vesting\"/><ref>[http://bln.niederlandeweb.de/erfgoed/vestingbouwers.html Nederlandse Vestingbouwers].

In 1646, he went to [[Bergamo]] and [[Venice]] and served under General [[Leonardo Foscolo]] in [[Dalmatia]]. In 1648, the Venetian army occupied [[Dugopolje]] and moved up to the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].<ref>http://www.pkn-ruinen.nl/ruse.htm{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As the Turks had occupied the island of [[Crete]] the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] army went as far as [[Risan]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Budva]] in order to occupy [[Albania]]. When Foscolo was appointed in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in 1651, Ruse decided to leave the army because of problems with his legs, and on his way back, he paid great attention to defence systems and facilities.\n\nIn August 1651 he was appointed by the city is an engineer for [[Amsterdam]]'s defences.<ref>Abrahamse, J.E.

Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> In 1658 he had bought a small country estate in [[Sauwerd]].\n\nWithout being completely relieved of his duties in the Netherlands, Ruse went on to realise various fortification assignments for [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], including the huge citadel at [[Kalkar]], and for [[Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], the most important of which was the fortification of [[Hamburg-Harburg|Harburg]] in 1660.\n\n==Danish assignments==\n[[File:Kastelskirken Copenhagen Ruse plan.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan for the Copenhagen Citadel]]\n\nAfter the peace treaty at the end of the [[Second Northern War#Peace|Second Northern War]] in 1660, [[Frederick III of Denmark]] commissioned Ruse to reconstruct the damaged fortifications of [[Copenhagen]]. In 1661, he was appointed quartermaster general, chief inspector of fortifications and colonel of an infantry regiment. Ruse immediately submitted a plan for rebuilding the [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Copenhagen citadel]] which was accepted. Construction work, completed three years later, caused some bitterness among the local citizens, leading as far as threats to Ruse's life.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\">[http://runeberg.org/dbl/14/0466.html Rysensteen, Henrik Ruse. From Dansk biografisk Lexikon.] In Danish. Retrieved 3 January 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1667, Ruse also completed the defences of Frederiksort in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. He travelled around Denmark, inspecting and repairing the defences, especially those in [[Kronborg]], [[Nyborg]] and [[Fredericia]]. Thereafter he was involved in large-scale civil construction work in Copenhagen including cemeteries and monuments including the one to [[Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606\u20131664)|Corfitz Ulfeldt]]. But above all, he drew up plans for two new districts, one to the northeast of [[Kongens Nytorv]] and Gothersagde (Frederiksstaden) which included the [[Nyhavn|Nyhavn Canal]], the other southwest of [[Slotsholmen]] (Frederiksholm).<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/><ref>[http://www.rikkitikki.dk/index.php?id=256 Historien om Nyhavn 9. From RikkiTikki Company]. In Danish. Retrieved 4 January 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 1664, Ruse was appointed major general and member of the war cabinet. With the threat of war with England, he was sent to [[Norway]] together with [[Ahlefeldt|Frederik Ahlefeldt]] in 1667. In 1669, he became commander of [[Fredericia]] and, in 1671, commander in chief responsible for fortifications in the duchies. From 1667 to 1670, he also coordinated significant extensions to the Copenhagen and  [[Christianshavn]] ramparts.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\nHis next major work, during the last year of Frederick III's reign, was the rebuilding of the fortifications at [[Rendsburg]] in Schleswig. Ruse justified his efforts explaining that Denmark needed to be protected from the south, with additional defences in [[S\u00f8nderborg|Sonderburg]] and Friedrichsort on the western shore of [[Kiel Fjord]]. In this way, the entire area could be systematically defended.<ref>[http://www.uni-kiel.de/gza/5/Rendsburg/rendsburg/frrdexakerweiterung_der_befestigung.htm Erwiterung des Befestigung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607134450/http://www.uni-kiel.de/gza/5/Rendsburg/rendsburg/frrdexakerweiterung_der_befestigung.htm |date=7 June 2011 }}.

At the beginning of [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]]'s reign, he rebuilt the entrenchments on a small island in the [[River Elbe]] and completed a comprehensive report on the fortification system for the Danish-Norwegian monarchy.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Titles and property==\n\n[[File:Keizersgracht 281&283, designed by H. Ruse.jpg|thumb|Two [[canal house]]s, called twins, both with neckgables on [[Keizersgracht]], designed by H. Ruse]]\n\nIn 1664, Ruse obtained the property rights for B\u00f8vling Palace and its estate with responsibility for the B\u00f8vling district near [[Ringk\u00f8bing]] in the west of [[Jutland]]. He resigned his post in 1671. BOEVLING slot and estate estate were elevated to the status of feudal barony of Rysensteen in 1672. Ruse, who had already become a Danish nobleman in 1664, was among the earliest nobles who became feudal barons according to the law of 25 May 1671, which completely restructured the Danish nobility, creating the only two classes of feudal counts and feudal berons, who since then constituted Danish High Society.\n\nIn the same year he was awarded the [[Order of the Dannebrog]]. Ruse owned property in Copenhagen including Bremerholms Admiralsg\u00e5rd outside the old [[\u00d8sterport]]. In [[Holstein]], he had property in [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]] and in the Netherlands he had an establishment in Sauwerd near Groningen as well as property in the fourth [[urban planning]] of Amsterdam.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Assignments in Norway==\n\nUnder Christian V in 1673, with the support of the influential Hans von Schack, a Schleswig nobleman, Ruse was sent to [[Trondheim]] in Norway where he was appointed lieutenant general with responsibility for the Nordenfjells and Trondheim infantry regiments. In 1675, he was called to [[Oslo|Christiania]] to participate in preparations for the [[Scanian War]]. When war broke out in September, Ruse spent the winter with his troops between [[Frederiksstad]] and [[Halden|Frederikshald]]. In 1676, he joined [[Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl\u00f8ve]] on a campaign in [[Sweden]]. Despite considerable success in Norway, Ruse was not happy about his stay there as it caused him appreciable losses on his interests in Rendsburg while his professional expertise was no longer in demand.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Scanian War==\nIn 1677, the king allowed him to leave Norway and sent him to [[Scania]] to lead the infantry, artillery and fortifications staff during the [[Scanian War]]. But luck was not on Ruse's side. The [[Battle of Malm\u00f6|storming of Malm\u00f6]] on 26 June was not successful, nor was the [[Battle of Landskrona]] on 14 July. He was then appointed governor of [[Landskrona]] with orders to improve the fortifications. However, in the absence of manpower and supplies and in the face of opposition from Field Marshal Joachim R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz who was given the supreme command of Scania, he was unable to complete the assignment. In a letter dated 28 August, Ruse complained in quite bitter terms that he was unable to carry out his work and requested retirement. Without further hesitation, King Christian V suspended him from his command and set up a committee to examine his conduct during the entire campaign. Ruse's defence consisted of a lengthy complaint criticising lack of support from von der Goltz, a position which was upheld by the examining committee.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Decease==\n\nOn 4 December 1677, Ruse obtained his retirement and pending remuneration, with instructions not to serve Denmark's enemies and to return to Denmark without delay if the king so required. But already on 22 February 1679, he died and was buried in Sauwerd in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ruse, Hendrik: ''The strengthening of strong-holds: invented on several occasions and practised during the late wars, as well in the United Provinces, as in France, Germany, Italy, Dalmatia, Albania, and the neighbouring countries''.

Following a period when he served in various armies in [[Germany]] and [[Italy]], he wrote a well-researched book documenting the latest trends in fortification systems across Europe.<ref name=\"Versterckte Vesting\">Ruse's book ''Versterckte Vesting'' written in 1654 (see Bibliography) contains a short autobiography giving details of his early life.</ref> As a result, he was entrusted with commissions for improving defences in his native [[Amsterdam]], in [[Germany]], and finally in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] where, benefitting from the support of the monarchy, he first became a general and later a baron. Ruse died in [[Sauwerd]] near [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]].\n\n==Early life and education==\n\nRuse was born in the village of [[Ruinen]] in the Dutch province of [[Drenthe]]. His father, Johan Ruse, who was the parish priest in Ruinen, belonged to a [[Hugenot]] family from eastern France, sympathising with the Protestant theologian [[Jacobus Arminius]]. Unlike his brothers who studied in [[Franeker]], at the age of 15 Ruse began a military career where he saw action under the flags of [[France]], [[Weimar]] and [[Venice]].<ref name=\"Versterckte Vesting\"/><ref>[http://bln.niederlandeweb.de/erfgoed/vestingbouwers.html Nederlandse Vestingbouwers].

In 1646, he went to [[Bergamo]] and [[Venice]] and served under General [[Leonardo Foscolo]] in [[Dalmatia]]. In 1648, the Venetian army occupied [[Dugopolje]] and moved up to the [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]].<ref>http://www.pkn-ruinen.nl/ruse.htm{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> As the Turks had occupied the island of [[Crete]] the [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] army went as far as [[Risan]], [[Bar, Montenegro|Bar]] and [[Budva]] in order to occupy [[Albania]]. When Foscolo was appointed in [[Heraklion|Candia]] in 1651, Ruse decided to leave the army because of problems with his legs, and on his way back, he paid great attention to defence systems and facilities.\n\nIn August 1651 he was appointed by the city is an engineer for [[Amsterdam]]'s defences.<ref>Abrahamse, J.E.

Retrieved 5 January 2009.</ref> In 1658 he had bought a small country estate in [[Sauwerd]].\n\nWithout being completely relieved of his duties in the Netherlands, Ruse went on to realise various fortification assignments for [[John Maurice, Prince of Nassau-Siegen]], including the huge citadel at [[Kalkar]], and for [[Christian Louis, Duke of Brunswick-L\u00fcneburg]], the most important of which was the fortification of [[Hamburg-Harburg|Harburg]] in 1660.\n\n==Danish assignments==\n[[File:Kastelskirken Copenhagen Ruse plan.jpg|thumb|200px|Plan for the Copenhagen Citadel]]\n\nAfter the peace treaty at the end of the [[Second Northern War#Peace|Second Northern War]] in 1660, [[Frederick III of Denmark]] commissioned Ruse to reconstruct the damaged fortifications of [[Copenhagen]]. In 1661, he was appointed quartermaster general, chief inspector of fortifications and colonel of an infantry regiment. Ruse immediately submitted a plan for rebuilding the [[Kastellet, Copenhagen|Copenhagen citadel]] which was accepted. Construction work, completed three years later, caused some bitterness among the local citizens, leading as far as threats to Ruse's life.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\">[http://runeberg.org/dbl/14/0466.html Rysensteen, Henrik Ruse. From Dansk biografisk Lexikon.] In Danish. Retrieved 3 January 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 1667, Ruse also completed the defences of Frederiksort in the [[Duchy of Schleswig]]. He travelled around Denmark, inspecting and repairing the defences, especially those in [[Kronborg]], [[Nyborg]] and [[Fredericia]]. Thereafter he was involved in large-scale civil construction work in Copenhagen including cemeteries and monuments including the one to [[Corfitz Ulfeldt (1606\u20131664)|Corfitz Ulfeldt]]. But above all, he drew up plans for two new districts, one to the northeast of [[Kongens Nytorv]] and Gothersagde (Frederiksstaden) which included the [[Nyhavn|Nyhavn Canal]], the other southwest of [[Slotsholmen]] (Frederiksholm).<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/><ref>[http://www.rikkitikki.dk/index.php?id=256 Historien om Nyhavn 9. From RikkiTikki Company]. In Danish. Retrieved 4 January 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 1664, Ruse was appointed major general and member of the war cabinet. With the threat of war with England, he was sent to [[Norway]] together with [[Ahlefeldt|Frederik Ahlefeldt]] in 1667. In 1669, he became commander of [[Fredericia]] and, in 1671, commander in chief responsible for fortifications in the duchies. From 1667 to 1670, he also coordinated significant extensions to the Copenhagen and  [[Christianshavn]] ramparts.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\nHis next major work, during the last year of Frederick III's reign, was the rebuilding of the fortifications at [[Rendsburg]] in Schleswig. Ruse justified his efforts explaining that Denmark needed to be protected from the south, with additional defences in [[S\u00f8nderborg|Sonderburg]] and Friedrichsort on the western shore of [[Kiel Fjord]]. In this way, the entire area could be systematically defended.<ref>[http://www.uni-kiel.de/gza/5/Rendsburg/rendsburg/frrdexakerweiterung_der_befestigung.htm Erwiterung des Befestigung] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607134450/http://www.uni-kiel.de/gza/5/Rendsburg/rendsburg/frrdexakerweiterung_der_befestigung.htm |date=2011-06-07 }}.

At the beginning of [[Christian V of Denmark|Christian V]]'s reign, he rebuilt the entrenchments on a small island in the [[River Elbe]] and completed a comprehensive report on the fortification system for the Danish-Norwegian monarchy.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Titles and property==\n\n[[File:Keizersgracht 281&283, designed by H. Ruse.jpg|thumb|Two [[canal house]]s, called twins, both with neckgables on [[Keizersgracht]], designed by H. Ruse]]\n\nIn 1664, Ruse obtained the property rights for B\u00f8vling Palace and its estate with responsibility for the B\u00f8vling district near [[Ringk\u00f8bing]] in the west of [[Jutland]]. He resigned his post in 1671. BOEVLING slot and estate estate were elevated to the status of feudal barony of Rysensteen in 1672. Ruse, who had already become a Danish nobleman in 1664, was among the earliest nobles who became feudal barons according to the law of 25 May 1671, which completely restructured the Danish nobility, creating the only two classes of feudal counts and feudal berons, who since then constituted Danish High Society.\n\nIn the same year he was awarded the [[Order of the Dannebrog]]. Ruse owned property in Copenhagen including Bremerholms Admiralsg\u00e5rd outside the old [[\u00d8sterport]]. In [[Holstein]], he had property in [[Gl\u00fcckstadt]] and in the Netherlands he had an establishment in Sauwerd near Groningen as well as property in the fourth [[urban planning]] of Amsterdam.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Assignments in Norway==\n\nUnder Christian V in 1673, with the support of the influential Hans von Schack, a Schleswig nobleman, Ruse was sent to [[Trondheim]] in Norway where he was appointed lieutenant general with responsibility for the Nordenfjells and Trondheim infantry regiments. In 1675, he was called to [[Oslo|Christiania]] to participate in preparations for the [[Scanian War]]. When war broke out in September, Ruse spent the winter with his troops between [[Frederiksstad]] and [[Halden|Frederikshald]]. In 1676, he joined [[Ulrik Frederik Gyldenl\u00f8ve]] on a campaign in [[Sweden]]. Despite considerable success in Norway, Ruse was not happy about his stay there as it caused him appreciable losses on his interests in Rendsburg while his professional expertise was no longer in demand.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Scanian War==\nIn 1677, the king allowed him to leave Norway and sent him to [[Scania]] to lead the infantry, artillery and fortifications staff during the [[Scanian War]]. But luck was not on Ruse's side. The [[Battle of Malm\u00f6|storming of Malm\u00f6]] on 26 June was not successful, nor was the [[Battle of Landskrona]] on 14 July. He was then appointed governor of [[Landskrona]] with orders to improve the fortifications. However, in the absence of manpower and supplies and in the face of opposition from Field Marshal Joachim R\u00fcdiger von der Goltz who was given the supreme command of Scania, he was unable to complete the assignment. In a letter dated 28 August, Ruse complained in quite bitter terms that he was unable to carry out his work and requested retirement. Without further hesitation, King Christian V suspended him from his command and set up a committee to examine his conduct during the entire campaign. Ruse's defence consisted of a lengthy complaint criticising lack of support from von der Goltz, a position which was upheld by the examining committee.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Decease==\n\nOn 4 December 1677, Ruse obtained his retirement and pending remuneration, with instructions not to serve Denmark's enemies and to return to Denmark without delay if the king so required. But already on 22 February 1679, he died and was buried in Sauwerd in the Netherlands.<ref name=\"runeberg.org\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n*Ruse, Hendrik: ''The strengthening of strong-holds: invented on several occasions and practised during the late wars, as well in the United Provinces, as in France, Germany, Italy, Dalmatia, Albania, and the neighbouring countries''.

She is the second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[heir apparent]] to the British throne. Instead of using the title [[Princess of Wales]], she uses the title [[Duchess of Cornwall]], her husband's secondary designation. In Scotland, she is known as the [[Duchess of Rothesay]].\n\nCamilla is the eldest child of Major [[Bruce Shand]] and his wife [[Rosalind Cubitt]], the daughter of [[Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe]]. She was raised in [[East Sussex]] and [[South Kensington]] in England, and was educated in England, Switzerland, and France. In 1973, Camilla married [[British Army]] officer [[Andrew Parker Bowles]], with whom she has two children. They divorced in 1995.\n\nCamilla was periodically romantically involved with the Prince of Wales both before and during their first marriages.

{{postnominals|country=GBR|sep=,|GCVOf|CSM|PC}} (born '''Camilla Rosemary Shand''', later '''Parker Bowles'''; 17 July 1947) is a member of the [[British royal family]]. She is the second wife of [[Charles, Prince of Wales]], [[heir apparent]] to the British throne. Instead of using the title [[Princess of Wales]], she uses the title [[Duchess of Cornwall]], her husband's secondary designation. In Scotland, she is known as the [[Duchess of Rothesay]].\n\nCamilla is the eldest child of Major [[Bruce Shand]] and his wife [[Rosalind Cubitt]], the daughter of [[Roland Cubitt, 3rd Baron Ashcombe]]. She was raised in [[East Sussex]] and [[South Kensington]] in England, and was educated in England, Switzerland, and France. In 1973, Camilla married [[British Army]] officer [[Andrew Parker Bowles]], with whom she has two children. They divorced in 1995.\n\nCamilla was periodically romantically involved with the Prince of Wales both before and during their first marriages. The relationship became highly publicised in the media and attracted worldwide scrutiny.<ref group=fn>''Charles and Camilla: Portrait of a Love Affair'' by biographer [[Gyles Brandreth]] depicts Charles and Camilla's relationship as controversial due to its longevity and throughout the book shows the media's interest and representation to the public.</ref> In 2005, it culminated in a [[civil marriage]] at [[Windsor Guildhall]], which was followed by a televised [[Anglican]] blessing at [[St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]].\n\nAs Duchess of Cornwall, Camilla assists the Prince of Wales on his official duties. She is also the patron, president and a member of numerous charities and organisations. Since 1994, she has taken action on [[osteoporosis]], earning honours and awards. She has also raised awareness in areas including rape and sexual abuse, literacy, animal welfare and poverty.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Johnston|first1=Morgan|title=Camilla: the woman behind the image|url=http://www.nzwomansweekly.co.nz/front-page-carousel/camilla-the-woman-behind-the-image|accessdate=7 August 2015|publisher=[[New Zealand Woman's Weekly]]|date=19 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Camilla: The relaxed and friendly face of the monarchy|url=http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/life/features/camilla-the-relaxed-and-friendly-face-of-the-monarchy-31096366.html|accessdate=7 August 2015|newspaper=[[Belfast Telegraph]]|date=28 March 2015}}</ref>\n\n==Childhood and young adulthood==\nCamilla Rosemary Shand was born at [[King's College Hospital]], London, on 17 July 1947.<ref>Graham, p. 9</ref><ref group=fn>Some sources report that she was born in [[Plumpton, East Sussex|Plumpton]], but it seems that this is a confusion of her childhood home with her birthplace.</ref> She grew up in The Laines<ref>{{National Heritage List for England|num=1238285|desc=The Laines|access-date=28 June 2018}}</ref> \u2013 an 18th-century [[country house]] in [[Plumpton, East Sussex]]<ref name=\"Brand\">Brandreth, p. 104</ref> \u2013 and a three-storey house in [[South Kensington]], her family's second home.<ref name=\"pony\"/> Her parents were [[British Army]] officer turned businessman Major [[Bruce Shand]] (1917\u20132006) and his wife, [[Rosalind Shand|Rosalind]] (''[[Maiden and married names|n\u00e9e]]'' Cubitt; 1921\u20131994).

According to Fowler, because of the large number (when compared to monolithic application implementations) of services, decentralized continuous delivery and [[DevOps]] with holistic service monitoring are necessary to effectively develop, maintain, and operate such applications.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://martinfowler.com/bliki/MicroservicePrerequisites.html|title=Microservice Prerequisites|author=Martin Fowler|author-link=Martin Fowler (software engineer)}}</ref> A consequence of (and rationale for) following this approach is that the individual microservices can be individually scaled.

Therefore, the most important technology choices are the way microservices communicate with each other (synchronous, asynchronous, UI integration) and the protocols used for the communication ([[RESTful]] HTTP, messaging, [[GraphQL]] ...). In a traditional system, most technology choices like the programming language impact the whole system. Therefore, the approach for choosing technologies is quite different.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://practical-microservices.com|title=Microservices - A Practical Guide|isbn=978-1717075901|last1=Wolff|first1=Eberhard|date=2018-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eclipse Foundation]] has published a specification for developing microservices, Eclipse MicroProfile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile|title=Eclipse MicroProfile|first=Stephanie|last=Swart|date=14 December 2016|website=projects.eclipse.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Service mesh ===\n{{See also|Service mesh}}\n\nIn a service mesh, each service instance is paired with an instance of a reverse proxy server, called a service proxy, sidecar proxy, or sidecar. The service instance and sidecar proxy share a container, and the containers are managed by a container orchestration tool such as [[Kubernetes]], [[Nomad_(software)|Nomad]], [[Docker (software)|Docker Swarm]], or [[Mesosphere, Inc.|DC/OS]].\nThe service proxies are responsible for communication with other service instances and can support capabilities such as service (instance) discovery, load balancing, authentication and authorization, secure communications, and others.\n\nIn a service mesh, the service instances and their sidecar proxies are said to make up the data plane, which includes not only data management but also request processing and response. The service mesh also includes a control plane for managing the interaction between services, mediated by their sidecar proxies. There are several options for service mesh architecture: [[Istio]] (a joint project among Google, IBM, and Lyft), [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation#Linkerd|Linkerd]] (a [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation|CNCF]] project led by [[Buoyant (company)|Buoyant]]<ref>{{cite web |title=What's a service mesh? |url=https://blog.buoyant.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/ |website=Buoyant |publisher=Buoyant |accessdate=5 December 2018|date=2017-04-25 }}</ref>), [[Consul_(software)|Consul]] (a [[HashiCorp]] product)) and others.\n\n=== A comparison of platforms ===\nImplementing a [[microservice]] architecture is difficult. There are many concerns (see table below) that any microservice architecture needs to address. [[Netflix]] developed a microservice framework to support their internal applications, and then open-sourced<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Git Hub | url = https://netflix.github.io/ | title = Netflix OSS}}</ref> many portions of that framework. Many of these tools have been popularized via the [[Spring Framework]] \u2013 they have been re-implemented as Spring-based tools under the umbrella of the Spring Cloud<ref>{{Citation | url = http://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud | publisher = Spring | title = Cloud}}</ref> project. The table below shows a comparison of an implementing feature from the Kubernetes ecosystem with an equivalent from the Spring Cloud world.<ref>{{Citation | work = Developers | publisher = Red hat | date = 2016-12-09 | url = https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/09/spring-cloud-for-microservices-compared-to-kubernetes/ | title = Spring Cloud for Microservices Compared to Kubernetes}}</ref> One noteworthy aspect of the Spring Cloud ecosystem is that they are all Java-based technologies, whereas Kubernetes is a polyglot runtime platform.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;\"\n|-\n! Microservices concern\n! Spring Cloud & Netflix OSS\n! Kubernetes\n|-\n| Configuration management: configuration for a microservice application needs to be externalized from the code and be retrievable via a simple service call.\n| Spring Config Server, Netflix Archaius both support a Git-repository\u2014based location for configuration. Archaius supports data typing of configuration.\n| Kubernetes ConfigMaps exposes the configuration stored in etcd via services. Kubernetes Secrets supports the service-based secure deployment and usage of sensitive configuration information (such as passwords, certificates, etc.).\n|-\n| [[Service discovery]]: maintain a list of service instances that are available for work within a microservice domain.\n| Spring Cloud Eureka allows clients to register to it, maintains a heartbeat with registered clients, and maps service names to hostnames for clients that lookup services by service name.\n| Kubernetes Services provide deployment-time registration of instances of services that are internally available within the cluster. Ingress is a mechanism whereby a service can be exposed to clients outside the cluster.\n|-\n| Load balancing: The key to scaling a distributed system is being able to run more than one instance of a component. Load has to be then distributed across those instances via a load balancer.\n| Spring Cloud Ribbon provides the ability for service clients to load balance across instances of the service.\n| Kubernetes Service provides the ability for the service to be load-balanced across service instances. This is not the equivalent of what Ribbon provides.\n|-\n| API gateway: The granularity of APIs provided by microservices is often different than what a service client needs. API Gateways implement facades and provide additional services like proxying, and protocol translation, and other management functions.\n| Spring Cloud Zuul provides configuration-based API facades\n| Kubernetes Service and Ingress resources, Istio, Ambassador are solutions that provide both north\u2013south (traffic into and out of data center) as well as east\u2013west (traffic across data centers or clouds or regions) API gateway functions.\n|-\n| Security concerns: Many security concerns are pushed to the API gateway implementation. With distributed microservice applications, it makes sense to not reinvent the security wheel and allow for policy definition and implementation in components that are shared by all services.\n| Spring Cloud Security addresses many security concerns through Spring Cloud Zuul\n| The Kubernetes ecosystem provides service meshes like Istio, which are capable of providing security through their API gateway mechanisms.\n|-\n| Centralized logging: It is important to have a centralized log gathering and analysis infrastructure to manage a plethora of services \u2013 many of which are operating in a distributed fashion.\n| ELK Stack ([[Elasticsearch]], LogStash, [[Kibana]])\n| EFK Stack ([[Elasticsearch]], [[Fluentd]], [[Kibana]])\n|-\n| Centralized metrics: A centralized area where the health and performance of the individual services and overall system can be monitored is essential to proper operations.\n| Spring Spectator & Atlas\n| Heapster, Prometheus, & [[Grafana]]\n|-\n| Distributed tracing: Per-process logging and metric monitoring have their place, but neither can reconstruct the complex paths that transactions take as they propagate across a distributed system. Distributed tracing is an essential tool for a microservices platform.\n| Spring Cloud Sleuth\n| Hawkular, [[Linux_Foundation#Jaeger|Jaeger]]\n|-\n| Resilience and fault tolerance: Distributed systems must be capable of auto-routing around failures, and be capable of routing requests to the service instance that will provide an optimum response.\n| Spring Hystrix, Turbine, & Ribbon\n| Health check, [[#Service mesh|service meshes]] (example: Istio)<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Kubernetes | date = May 2017 | url = https://kubernetes.io/blog/2017/05/managing-microservices-with-istio-service-mesh/ | title = Managing microservices with the Istio service mesh}}</ref>\n|-\n| Autoscaling and self-healing: Distributed systems respond to higher load by scaling horizontally: the platform must detect and auto-respond to such conditions. Furthermore, the system needs to detect failures and attempt auto-restarts without operator input.\n| -\n| Health check, self-healing, and auto-scaling\n|-\n| Packaging, deployment, and scheduling: Large-scale systems require robust package management, and deployment systems to manage rolling or blue-green deployments, and rollbacks if necessary.

Therefore, the most important technology choices are the way microservices communicate with each other (synchronous, asynchronous, UI integration) and the protocols used for the communication ([[RESTful]] HTTP, messaging, [[GraphQL]] ...). In a traditional system, most technology choices like the programming language impact the whole system. Therefore, the approach for choosing technologies is quite different.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://practical-microservices.com|title=Microservices - A Practical Guide|isbn=978-1717075901|last1=Wolff|first1=Eberhard|date=2018-04-15}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Eclipse Foundation]] has published a specification for developing microservices, Eclipse MicroProfile.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.microprofile|title=Eclipse MicroProfile|first=Stephanie|last=Swart|date=14 December 2016|website=projects.eclipse.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Service mesh ===\n{{See also|Service mesh}}\n\nIn a service mesh, each service instance is paired with an instance of a reverse proxy server, called a service proxy, sidecar proxy, or sidecar. The service instance and sidecar proxy share a container, and the containers are managed by a container orchestration tool such as [[Kubernetes]], [[Nomad_(software)|Nomad]], [[Docker (software)|Docker Swarm]], or [[Mesosphere, Inc.|DC/OS]].\nThe service proxies are responsible for communication with other service instances and can support capabilities such as service (instance) discovery, load balancing, authentication and authorization, secure communications, and others.\n\nIn a service mesh, the service instances and their sidecar proxies are said to make up the data plane, which includes not only data management but also request processing and response. The service mesh also includes a control plane for managing the interaction between services, mediated by their sidecar proxies. There are several options for service mesh architecture: [[Istio]] (a joint project among Google, IBM, and Lyft), [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation#Linkerd|Linkerd]] (a [[Cloud Native Computing Foundation|CNCF]] project led by [[Buoyant (company)|Buoyant]]<ref>{{cite web |title=What's a service mesh? |url=https://blog.buoyant.io/2017/04/25/whats-a-service-mesh-and-why-do-i-need-one/ |website=Buoyant |publisher=Buoyant |accessdate=5 December 2018|date=2017-04-25 }}</ref>), [[Consul_(software)|Consul]] (a [[HashiCorp]] product)) and others.\n\n=== A comparison of platforms ===\nImplementing a [[microservice]] architecture is difficult. There are many concerns (see table below) that any microservice architecture needs to address. [[Netflix]] developed a microservice framework to support their internal applications, and then open-sourced<ref>{{Citation | publisher = Git Hub | url = https://netflix.github.io/ | title = Netflix OSS}}</ref> many portions of that framework. Many of these tools have been popularized via the [[Spring Framework]] \u2013 they have been re-implemented as Spring-based tools under the umbrella of the Spring Cloud<ref>{{Citation | url = http://spring.io/projects/spring-cloud | publisher = Spring | title = Cloud}}</ref> project. The table below shows a comparison of an implementing feature from the Kubernetes ecosystem with an equivalent from the Spring Cloud world.<ref>{{Citation | work = Developers | publisher = Red hat | date = 2016-12-09 | url = https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2016/12/09/spring-cloud-for-microservices-compared-to-kubernetes/ | title = Spring Cloud for Microservices Compared to Kubernetes}}</ref> One noteworthy aspect of the Spring Cloud ecosystem is that they are all Java-based technologies, whereas Kubernetes is a polyglot runtime platform.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 85%; text-align: left; width: auto;\"\n|-\n!

This is not the equivalent of what Ribbon provides.\n|-\n| API gateway: The granularity of APIs provided by microservices is often different than what a service client needs.

Add a test\n:In test-driven development, each new feature begins with writing a test. Write a test that defines a function or improvements of a function, which should be very succinct. To write a test, the developer must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements. The developer can accomplish this through [[use case]]s and [[user story|user stories]] to cover the requirements and exception conditions, and can write the test in whatever testing framework is appropriate to the software environment. It could be a modified version of an existing test. This is a differentiating feature of test-driven development versus writing unit tests ''after'' the [[Source code|code]] is written: it makes the developer focus on the requirements ''before'' writing the code, a subtle but important difference.\n;2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails\n:This validates that the [[test harness]] is working correctly, shows that the new test does not pass without requiring new code because the required behavior already exists, and it rules out the possibility that the new test is flawed and will always pass. The new test should fail for the expected reason. This step increases the developer's confidence in the new test.\n;3. Write the code\n:The next step is to write some code that causes the test to pass. The new code written at this stage is not perfect and may, for example, pass the test in an inelegant way. That is acceptable because it will be improved and honed in Step 5.{{pb}}At this point, the only purpose of the written code is to pass the test. The programmer must not write code that is beyond the functionality that the test checks.\n;4. Run tests\n:If all test cases now pass, the programmer can be confident that the new code meets the test requirements, and does not break or degrade any existing features. If they do not, the new code must be adjusted until they do.\n;5. Refactor code\n:The growing code base must be [[Code refactoring|cleaned up]] regularly during test-driven development. New code can be moved from where it was convenient for passing a test to where it more logically belongs. [[Duplicate code|Duplication]] must be removed. [[Object (computer science)|Object]], [[Class (computer programming)|class]], [[Modular programming|module]], [[Variable (computer science)|variable]] and [[Method (computer programming)|method]] names should clearly represent their current purpose and use, as extra functionality is added. As features are added, method bodies can get longer and other objects larger. They benefit from being split and their parts carefully named to improve [[Computer programming#Readability of source code|readability]] and [[Software maintenance|maintainability]], which will be increasingly valuable later in the [[software lifecycle]]. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance hierarchies]] may be rearranged to be more logical and helpful, and perhaps to benefit from recognized [[Software design pattern|design patterns]]. There are specific and general guidelines for refactoring and for creating clean code.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Kent|title=XP Explained, 1st Edition|year=1999|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=0201616416|page=[https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/57 57]|url=https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/57}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ottinger and Langr|first=Tim and Jeff|title=Simple Design|url=http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/simple-design.html|access-date=5 July 2013}}</ref> By continually re-running the test cases throughout each refactoring phase, the developer can be confident that process is not altering any existing functionality.{{pb}}The concept of removing duplication is an important aspect of any software design. In this case, however, it also applies to the removal of any duplication between the test code and the production code\u2014for example [[Magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] or strings repeated in both to make the test pass in Step 3.\n;Repeat\n:Starting with another new test, the cycle is then repeated to push forward the functionality. The size of the steps should always be small, with as few as 1 to 10 edits between each test run. If new code does not rapidly satisfy a new test, or other tests fail unexpectedly, the programmer should [[undo]] or revert in preference to excessive [[debugging]]. [[Continuous integration]] helps by providing revertible checkpoints. When using external libraries it is important not to make increments that are so small as to be effectively merely testing the library itself,<ref name=Newkirk /> unless there is some reason to believe that the library is buggy or is not sufficiently feature-complete to serve all the needs of the software under development.\n\n== Development style ==\nThere are various aspects to using test-driven development, for example the principles of \"keep it simple, stupid\" ([[KISS principle|KISS]]) and \"[[You aren't gonna need it]]\" (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, designs can often be cleaner and clearer than is achieved by other methods.<ref name=Beck /> In ''Test-Driven Development by Example'', Kent Beck also suggests the principle \"[[Fake it till you make it]]\".\n\nTo achieve some advanced design concept such as a [[design pattern]], tests are written that generate that design. The code may remain simpler than the target pattern, but still pass all required tests. This can be unsettling at first but it allows the developer to focus only on what is important.\n\nWriting the tests first: The tests should be written before the functionality that is to be tested. This has been claimed to have many benefits. It helps ensure that the application is written for testability, as the developers must consider how to test the application from the outset rather than adding it later. It also ensures that tests for every feature get written. Additionally, writing the tests first leads to a deeper and earlier understanding of the product requirements, ensures the effectiveness of the test code, and maintains a continual focus on [[software quality]].<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\">{{cite web|title=Effective TDD for Complex Embedded Systems Whitepaper|url=http://www.pathfindersolns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Effective-TDD-Executive-Summary.pdf|publisher=Pathfinder Solutions}}</ref> When writing feature-first code, there is a tendency by developers and organisations to push the developer on to the next feature, even neglecting testing entirely. The first TDD test might not even compile at first, because the classes and methods it requires may not yet exist. Nevertheless, that first test functions as the beginning of an executable specification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/test_driven_development/ |title=Agile Test Driven Development |publisher=Agile Sherpa |date=2010-08-03 |access-date=2012-08-14 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723184333/http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/test_driven_development/ |archive-date=2012-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach test case fails initially: This ensures that the test really works and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the underlying functionality can be implemented. This has led to the \"test-driven development mantra\", which is \"red/green/refactor\", where red means ''fail'' and green means ''pass''. Test-driven development constantly repeats the steps of adding test cases that fail, passing them, and refactoring. Receiving the expected test results at each stage reinforces the developer's mental model of the code, boosts confidence and increases productivity.\n\n===Keep the unit small===\nFor TDD, a unit is most commonly defined as a class, or a group of related functions often called a module. Keeping units relatively small is claimed to provide critical benefits, including:\n* Reduced debugging effort \u2013 When test failures are detected, having smaller units aids in tracking down errors. \n* Self-documenting tests \u2013 Small test cases are easier to read and to understand.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\nAdvanced practices of test-driven development can lead to [[acceptance test\u2013driven development]] (ATDD) and [[Specification by example]] where the criteria specified by the customer are automated into acceptance tests, which then drive the traditional unit test-driven development (UTDD) process.<ref name=\"Koskela\">Koskela, L. \"Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers\", Manning Publications, 2007</ref> This process ensures the customer has an automated mechanism to decide whether the software meets their requirements. With ATDD, the development team now has a specific target to satisfy \u2013 the acceptance tests \u2013 which keeps them continuously focused on what the customer really wants from each user story.\n\n== Best practices ==\n\n=== Test structure ===\nEffective layout of a test case ensures all required actions are completed, improves the readability of the test case, and smooths the flow of execution. Consistent structure helps in building a self-documenting test case. A commonly applied structure for test cases has (1) setup, (2) execution, (3) validation, and (4) cleanup.\n* Setup: Put the Unit Under Test (UUT) or the overall test system in the state needed to run the test.\n* Execution: Trigger/drive the UUT to perform the target behavior and capture all output, such as return values and output parameters. This step is usually very simple.\n* Validation: Ensure the results of the test are correct. These results may include explicit outputs captured during execution or state changes in the UUT.\n* Cleanup: Restore the UUT or the overall test system to the pre-test state. This restoration permits another test to execute immediately after this one.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n=== Individual best practices ===\n\nSome best practices that an individual could follow would be to separate common set-up and tear-down logic into test support services utilized by the appropriate test cases, to keep each [[test oracle]] focused on only the results necessary to validate its test, and to design time-related tests to allow tolerance for execution in non-real time operating systems. The common practice of allowing a 5-10 percent margin for late execution reduces the potential number of false negatives in test execution. It is also suggested to treat test code with the same respect as production code. Test code must work correctly for both positive and negative cases, last a long time, and be readable and maintainable. Teams can get together with and review tests and test practices to share effective techniques and catch bad habits.<ref name=\"pathfindersolns.com\" />\n\n=== Practices to avoid, or \"anti-patterns\" ===\n* Having test cases depend on system state manipulated from previously executed test cases (i.e., you should always start a unit test from a known and pre-configured state).\n* Dependencies between test cases.  A test suite where test cases are dependent upon each other is brittle and complex. Execution order should not be presumed. Basic refactoring of the initial test cases or structure of the UUT causes a spiral of increasingly pervasive impacts in associated tests.\n* Interdependent tests.  Interdependent tests can cause cascading false negatives. A failure in an early test case breaks a later test case even if no actual fault exists in the UUT, increasing defect analysis and debug efforts.\n* Testing precise execution behavior timing or performance.\n* Building \"all-knowing oracles\".  An oracle that inspects more than necessary is more expensive and brittle over time. This very common error is dangerous because it causes a subtle but pervasive time sink across the complex project.<ref name=\"pathfindersolns.com\">{{YouTube| id=0BWSms3J40Y| title=Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Complex Systems Introduction}} by Pathfinder Solutions</ref>\n* Testing implementation details.\n* Slow running tests.\n\n== Benefits ==\nA 2005 study found that using TDD meant writing more tests and, in turn, programmers who wrote more tests tended to be more productive.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://nparc.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/npsi/ctrl?action=shwart&index=an&req=5763742&lang=en\n | title = On the Effectiveness of Test-first Approach to Programming\n | access-date = 2008-01-14\n | last = Erdogmus\n | first = Hakan\n | author2 = Morisio, Torchiano\n | publisher = Proceedings of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 31(1).

Aufl.}}</ref> By focusing on the test cases first, one must imagine how the functionality is used by clients (in the first case, the test cases). So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to [[design by contract]] as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.\n\nTest-driven development offers the ability to take small steps when required. It allows a programmer to focus on the task at hand as the first goal is to make the test pass. Exceptional cases and error handling are not considered initially, and tests to create these extraneous circumstances are implemented separately. Test-driven development ensures in this way that all written code is covered by at least one test. This gives the programming team, and subsequent users, a greater level of confidence in the code.\n\nWhile it is true that more code is required with TDD than without TDD because of the unit test code, the total code implementation time could be shorter based on a model by M\u00fcller and Padberg.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/65d9/24ef1162b2f3c24bd15d627302887991b298.pdf\n | title = About the Return on Investment of Test-Driven Development\n | access-date = 2012-06-14\n | author =\n | last = M\u00fcller\n | first = Matthias M.\n |author2=Padberg, Frank\n  | format = PDF\n | publisher = Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany\n | page = 6\n}}</ref> Large numbers of tests help to limit the number of defects in the code. The early and frequent nature of the testing helps to catch defects early in the development cycle, preventing them from becoming endemic and expensive problems. Eliminating defects early in the process usually avoids lengthy and tedious debugging later in the project.\n\nTDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code. This effect often comes about because the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later. This leads to smaller, more focused classes, looser [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]], and cleaner interfaces. The use of the [[mock object]] design pattern also contributes to the overall modularization of the code because this pattern requires that the code be written so that modules can be switched easily between mock versions for unit testing and \"real\" versions for deployment.\n\nBecause no more code is written than necessary to pass a failing test case, automated tests tend to cover every code path. For example, for a TDD developer to add an <code>else</code> branch to an existing <code>if</code> statement, the developer would first have to write a failing test case that motivates the branch. As a result, the automated tests resulting from TDD tend to be very thorough: they detect any unexpected changes in the code's behaviour. This detects problems that can arise where a change later in the development cycle unexpectedly alters other functionality.\n\nMadeyski<ref name=\"Madeyski\">Madeyski, L. \"Test-Driven Development - An Empirical Evaluation of Agile Practice\", Springer, 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-642-04287-4}}, pp. 1-245.

The mean effect size represents a medium (but close to large) effect on the basis of meta-analysis of the performed experiments which is a substantial finding. It suggests a better modularization (i.e., a more modular design), easier reuse and testing of the developed software products due to the TDD programming practice.<ref name=\"Madeyski\" /> Madeyski also measured the effect of the TDD practice on unit tests using branch coverage (BC) and mutation score indicator (MSI),<ref>[http://madeyski.e-informatyka.pl/download/Madeyski10c.pdf The impact of Test-First programming on branch coverage and mutation score indicator of unit tests: An experiment. ] by L.

TDD encourages developers to put the minimum amount of code into such modules and to maximize the logic that is in testable library code, using fakes and [[Mock object|mocks]] to represent the outside world.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last=Hunter\n | first=Andrew\n | url=https://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/are-unit-tests-overused/\n | title=Are Unit Tests Overused?\n | publisher=Simple-talk.com\n | date=2012-10-19 |access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref>\n\nManagement support is essential.

Therefore, the tests may share blind spots with the code: if, for example, a developer does not realize that certain input parameters must be checked, most likely neither the test nor the code will verify those parameters. Another example: if the developer misinterprets the requirements for the module he is developing, the code and the unit tests he writes will both be wrong in the same way. Therefore, the tests will pass, giving a false sense of correctness.\n\nA high number of passing unit tests may bring a false sense of security, resulting in fewer additional [[software testing]] activities, such as [[integration testing]] and [[compliance testing]].\n\nTests become part of the maintenance overhead of a project. Badly written tests, for example ones that include hard-coded error strings, are themselves prone to failure, and they are expensive to maintain. This is especially the case with [[fragile tests]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url=http://xunitpatterns.com/Fragile%20Test.html\n | title=Fragile Tests\n}}</ref> There is a risk that tests that regularly generate false failures will be ignored, so that when a real failure occurs, it may not be detected. It is possible to write tests for low and easy maintenance, for example by the reuse of error strings, and this should be a goal during the [[code refactoring]] phase described above.\n\nWriting and maintaining an excessive number of tests costs time. Also, more-flexible modules (with limited tests) might accept new requirements without the need for changing the tests. For those reasons, testing for only extreme conditions, or a small sample of data, can be easier to adjust than a set of highly detailed tests.\n\nThe level of coverage and testing detail achieved during repeated TDD cycles cannot easily be re-created at a later date. Therefore, these original, or early, tests become increasingly precious as time goes by. The tactic is to fix it early. Also, if a poor architecture, a poor design, or a poor testing strategy leads to a late change that makes dozens of existing tests fail, then it is important that they are individually fixed. Merely deleting, disabling or rashly altering them can lead to undetectable holes in the test coverage.\n\n== Test-driven work ==\nTest-driven development has been adopted outside of software development, in both product and service teams, as test-driven work.<ref>Leybourn, E. (2013) ''Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management''. London: IT Governance Publishing: 176-179.</ref> Similar to TDD, non-software teams develop [[quality control]] (QC) checks (usually manual tests rather than automated tests) for each aspect of the work prior to commencing. These QC checks are then used to inform the design and validate the associated outcomes. The six steps of the TDD sequence are applied with minor semantic changes:\n# \"Add a check\" replaces \"Add a test\"\n# \"Run all checks\" replaces \"Run all tests\"\n# \"Do the work\" replaces \"Write some code\"\n# \"Run all checks\" replaces \"Run tests\"\n# \"Clean up the work\" replaces \"Refactor code\"\n# \"Repeat\"\n\n== TDD and ATDD ==\nTest-driven development is related to, but different from [[acceptance test\u2013driven development]] (ATDD).<ref>{{cite book |title=Lean-Agile Acceptance Test-Driven Development: Better Software Through Collaboration  |year=2011 |publisher=Addison Wesley Professional |location=Boston |isbn=978-0321714084}}</ref> TDD is primarily a developer's tool to help create well-written unit of code (function, class, or module) that correctly performs a set of operations. ATDD is a communication tool between the customer, developer, and tester to ensure that the requirements are well-defined. TDD requires test automation. ATDD does not, although automation helps with regression testing. Tests used in TDD can often be derived from ATDD tests, since the code units implement some portion of a requirement. ATDD tests should be readable by the customer. TDD tests do not need to be.\n\n== TDD and BDD ==\nBDD ([[behavior-driven development]]) combines practices from TDD and from ATDD.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=BDD \n|url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/bdd.html\n|access-date=2015-04-28\n}}</ref>\nIt includes the practice of writing tests first, but focuses on tests which describe behavior, rather than tests which test a unit of implementation.  Tools such as [[JBehave]], [[Cucumber (software)|Cucumber]], [[Mspec]] and [[Specflow]] provide syntaxes which allow product owners, developers and test engineers to define together the behaviors which can then be translated into automated tests.\n\n==Code visibility==\n[[Test suite]] code clearly has to be able to access the code it is testing. On the other hand, normal design criteria such as [[information hiding]], encapsulation and the [[separation of concerns]] should not be compromised. Therefore, unit test code for TDD is usually written within the same project or [[Module (programming)|module]] as the code being tested.\n\nIn [[object oriented design]] this still does not provide access to private data and methods. Therefore, extra work may be necessary for unit tests. In [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and other languages, a developer can use [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] to access private fields and methods.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=Subverting Java Access Protection for Unit Testing \n|url=http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/12/reflection.html\n|last=Burton\n|first=Ross\n|date=2003-11-12\n|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.\n|access-date=2009-08-12\n}}</ref> Alternatively, an [[inner class]] can be used to hold the unit tests so they have visibility of the enclosing class's members and attributes. In the [[.NET Framework]] and some other programming languages, [[partial class]]es may be used to expose private methods and data for the tests to access.\n\nIt is important that such testing hacks do not remain in the production code. In [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages, [[Directive (programming)|compiler directives]] such as <code>#if DEBUG ... #endif</code> can be placed around such additional classes and indeed all other test-related code to prevent them being compiled into the released code. This means the released code is not exactly the same as what was unit tested. The regular running of fewer but more comprehensive, end-to-end, integration tests on the final release build can ensure (among other things) that no production code exists that subtly relies on aspects of the test harness.\n\nThere is some debate among practitioners of TDD, documented in their blogs and other writings, as to whether it is wise to test private methods and data anyway. Some argue that private members are a mere implementation detail that may change, and should be allowed to do so without breaking numbers of tests. Thus it should be sufficient to test any class through its public interface or through its subclass interface, which some languages call the \"protected\" interface.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ |title=PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code |last1=van Rossum |first1=Guido |last2=Warsaw |first2=Barry |date=5 July 2001 |work= |publisher=Python Software Foundation |access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> Others say that crucial aspects of functionality may be implemented in private methods and testing them directly offers advantage of smaller and more direct unit tests.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/06/07/150361.aspx\n|title=Testing Private Methods/Member Variables - Should you or shouldn't you\n|last=Newkirk\n|first=James\n|date=7 June 2004\n|publisher=Microsoft Corporation\n|access-date=2009-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/testnonpublicmembers.aspx\n|title=How to Test Private and Protected methods in .NET\n|last=Stall\n|first=Tim\n|date=1 Mar 2005\n|publisher=CodeProject\n|access-date=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\n== Software for TDD ==\nThere are many testing frameworks and tools that are useful in TDD.\n\n=== xUnit frameworks ===\nDevelopers may use computer-assisted [[list of unit testing frameworks|testing frameworks]], commonly collectively named [[xUnit]] (which are derived from SUnit, created in 1998), to create and automatically run the test cases. xUnit frameworks provide assertion-style test validation capabilities and result reporting. These capabilities are critical for automation as they move the burden of execution validation from an independent post-processing activity to one that is included in the test execution.  The execution framework provided by these test frameworks allows for the automatic execution of all system test cases or various subsets along with other features.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effective TDD for Complex, Embedded Systems Whitepaper|url=http://www.pathfindersolns.com/download-whitepaper/?download=EffectiveTDDforComplexEmbeddedSystems.pdf&title=Effective_TDD_for_Complex_Embedded_Systems|publisher=Pathfinder Solutions|access-date=2012-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820134917/http://www.pathfindersolns.com/download-whitepaper?download=EffectiveTDDforComplexEmbeddedSystems.pdf&title=Effective_TDD_for_Complex_Embedded_Systems|archive-date=2013-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== TAP results ===\nTesting frameworks may accept unit test output in the language-agnostic [[Test Anything Protocol]] created in 1987.\n\n==Fakes, mocks and integration tests==\nUnit tests are so named because they each test ''one unit'' of code. A complex module may have a thousand unit tests and a simple module may have only ten. The unit tests used for TDD should never cross process boundaries in a program, let alone network connections. Doing so introduces delays that make tests run slowly and discourage developers from running the whole suite. Introducing dependencies on external modules or data also turns ''unit tests'' into ''integration tests''. If one module misbehaves in a chain of interrelated modules, it is not so immediately clear where to look for the cause of the failure.\n\nWhen code under development relies on a database, a web service, or any other external process or service, enforcing a unit-testable separation is also an opportunity and a driving force to design more modular, more testable and more reusable code.<ref>{{cite book |title=Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code |last=Fowler |first=Martin |year=1999 |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=0-201-48567-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780201485677 }}</ref> Two steps are necessary:\n\n# Whenever external access is needed in the final design, an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] should be defined that describes the access available. See the [[dependency inversion principle]] for a discussion of the benefits of doing this regardless of TDD.\n# The interface should be implemented in two ways, one of which really accesses the external process, and the other of which is a [[mock object|fake or mock]]. Fake objects need do little more than add a message such as \"Person object saved\" to a [[Tracing (software)|trace log]], against which a test [[Assertion (computing)|assertion]] can be run to verify correct behaviour. Mock objects differ in that they themselves contain [[Assertion (computing)|test assertions]] that can make the test fail, for example, if the person's name and other data are not as expected.\n\nFake and mock object methods that return data, ostensibly from a data store or user, can help the test process by always returning the same, realistic data that tests can rely upon. They can also be set into predefined fault modes so that error-handling routines can be developed and reliably tested. In a fault mode, a method may return an invalid, incomplete or [[Null character|null]] response, or may throw an [[Exception handling|exception]].  Fake services other than data stores may also be useful in TDD: A fake encryption service may not, in fact, encrypt the data passed; a fake random number service may always return 1. Fake or mock implementations are examples of [[dependency injection]].\n\nA Test Double is a test-specific capability that substitutes for a system capability, typically a class or function, that the UUT depends on. There are two times at which test doubles can be introduced into a system: link and execution. Link time substitution is when the test double is compiled into the load module, which is executed to validate testing. This approach is typically used when running in an environment other than the target environment that requires doubles for the hardware level code for compilation.  The alternative to linker substitution is run-time substitution in which the real functionality is replaced during the execution of a test case. This substitution is typically done through the reassignment of known function pointers or object replacement.\n\nTest doubles are of a number of different types and varying complexities:\n* [[Dummy code|Dummy]] \u2013 A dummy is the simplest form of a test double. It facilitates linker time substitution by providing a default return value where required. \n* [[Method stub|Stub]] \u2013 A stub adds simplistic logic to a dummy, providing different outputs.  \n* Spy \u2013 A spy captures and makes available parameter and state information, publishing accessors to test code for private information allowing for more advanced state validation. \n* [[Mock object|Mock]] \u2013 A mock is specified by an individual test case to validate test-specific behavior, checking parameter values and call sequencing. \n* Simulator \u2013 A simulator is a comprehensive component providing a higher-fidelity approximation of the target capability (the thing being doubled). A simulator typically requires significant additional development effort.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\nA corollary of such dependency injection is that the actual database or other external-access code is never tested by the TDD process itself. To avoid errors that may arise from this, other tests are needed that instantiate the test-driven code with the \"real\" implementations of the interfaces discussed above. These are [[Integration testing|integration tests]] and are quite separate from the TDD unit tests. There are fewer of them, and they must be run less often than the unit tests. They can nonetheless be implemented using the same testing framework.\n\nIntegration tests that alter any [[persistent storage|persistent store]] or database should always be designed carefully with consideration of the initial and final state of the files or database, even if any test fails. This is often achieved using some combination of the following techniques:\n* The <code>TearDown</code> method, which is integral to many test frameworks.\n* <code>try...catch...finally</code> [[exception handling]] structures where available.\n* [[Database transactions]] where a transaction [[atomicity (database systems)|atomically]] includes perhaps a write, a read and a matching delete operation.\n* Taking a \"snapshot\" of the database before running any tests and rolling back to the snapshot after each test run. This may be automated using a framework such as [[Apache Ant|Ant]] or [[NAnt]] or a [[continuous integration]] system such as [[CruiseControl]].\n* Initialising the database to a clean state ''before'' tests, rather than cleaning up ''after'' them. This may be relevant where cleaning up may make it difficult to diagnose test failures by deleting the final state of the database before detailed diagnosis can be performed.\n\n== TDD for complex systems ==\nExercising TDD on large, challenging systems requires a modular architecture, well-defined components with published interfaces, and disciplined system layering with maximization of platform independence. These proven practices yield increased testability and facilitate the application of build and test automation.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n=== Designing for testability ===\nComplex systems require an architecture that meets a range of requirements.  A key subset of these requirements includes support for the complete and effective testing of the system. Effective modular design yields components that share traits essential for effective TDD.\n\n* [[Cohesion (computer science)|High Cohesion]] ensures each unit provides a set of related capabilities and makes the tests of those capabilities easier to maintain.\n* [[Coupling (computer programming)|Low Coupling]] allows each unit to be effectively tested in isolation.\n* Published Interfaces restrict Component access and serve as contact points for tests, facilitating test creation and ensuring the highest fidelity between test and production unit configuration.\n\nA key technique for building effective modular architecture is Scenario Modeling where a set of sequence charts is constructed, each one focusing on a single system-level execution scenario. The Scenario Model provides an excellent vehicle for creating the strategy of interactions between components in response to a specific stimulus. Each of these Scenario Models serves as a rich set of requirements for the services or functions that a component must provide, and it also dictates the order that these components and services interact together. Scenario modeling can greatly facilitate the construction of TDD tests for a complex system.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n=== Managing tests for large teams ===\nIn a larger system the impact of poor component quality is magnified by the complexity of interactions. This magnification makes the benefits of TDD accrue even faster in the context of larger projects. However, the complexity of the total population of tests can become a problem in itself, eroding potential gains. It sounds simple, but a key initial step is to recognize that test code is also important software and should be produced and maintained with the same rigor as the production code.\n\nCreating and managing the architecture of test software within a complex system is just as important as the core product architecture.

Add a test\n:In test-driven development, each new feature begins with writing a test. Write a test that defines a function or improvements of a function, which should be very succinct. To write a test, the developer must clearly understand the feature's specification and requirements. The developer can accomplish this through [[use case]]s and [[user story|user stories]] to cover the requirements and exception conditions, and can write the test in whatever testing framework is appropriate to the software environment. It could be a modified version of an existing test. This is a differentiating feature of test-driven development versus writing unit tests ''after'' the [[Source code|code]] is written: it makes the developer focus on the requirements ''before'' writing the code, a subtle but important difference.\n;2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails\n:This validates that the [[test harness]] is working correctly, shows that the new test does not pass without requiring new code because the required behavior already exists, and it rules out the possibility that the new test is flawed and will always pass. The new test should fail for the expected reason. This step increases the developer's confidence in the new test.\n;3. Write the code\n:The next step is to write some code that causes the test to pass. The new code written at this stage is not perfect and may, for example, pass the test in an inelegant way. That is acceptable because it will be improved and honed in Step 5.{{pb}}At this point, the only purpose of the written code is to pass the test. The programmer must not write code that is beyond the functionality that the test checks.\n;4. Run tests\n:If all test cases now pass, the programmer can be confident that the new code meets the test requirements, and does not break or degrade any existing features. If they do not, the new code must be adjusted until they do.\n;5. Refactor code\n:The growing code base must be [[Code refactoring|cleaned up]] regularly during test-driven development. New code can be moved from where it was convenient for passing a test to where it more logically belongs. [[Duplicate code|Duplication]] must be removed. [[Object (computer science)|Object]], [[Class (computer programming)|class]], [[Modular programming|module]], [[Variable (computer science)|variable]] and [[Method (computer programming)|method]] names should clearly represent their current purpose and use, as extra functionality is added. As features are added, method bodies can get longer and other objects larger. They benefit from being split and their parts carefully named to improve [[Computer programming#Readability of source code|readability]] and [[Software maintenance|maintainability]], which will be increasingly valuable later in the [[software lifecycle]]. [[Inheritance (object-oriented programming)|Inheritance hierarchies]] may be rearranged to be more logical and helpful, and perhaps to benefit from recognized [[Software design pattern|design patterns]]. There are specific and general guidelines for refactoring and for creating clean code.<ref>{{cite book|last=Beck|first=Kent|title=XP Explained, 1st Edition|year=1999|publisher=Addison-Wesley Professional|isbn=0201616416|page=[https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/57 57]|url=https://archive.org/details/extremeprogrammi00beck/page/57}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Ottinger and Langr|first=Tim and Jeff|title=Simple Design|url=http://agileinaflash.blogspot.com/2009/02/simple-design.html|access-date=5 July 2013}}</ref> By continually re-running the test cases throughout each refactoring phase, the developer can be confident that process is not altering any existing functionality.{{pb}}The concept of removing duplication is an important aspect of any software design. In this case, however, it also applies to the removal of any duplication between the test code and the production code\u2014for example [[Magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] or strings repeated in both to make the test pass in Step 3.\n;Repeat\n:Starting with another new test, the cycle is then repeated to push forward the functionality. The size of the steps should always be small, with as few as 1 to 10 edits between each test run. If new code does not rapidly satisfy a new test, or other tests fail unexpectedly, the programmer should [[undo]] or revert in preference to excessive [[debugging]]. [[Continuous integration]] helps by providing revertible checkpoints. When using external libraries it is important not to make increments that are so small as to be effectively merely testing the library itself,<ref name=Newkirk /> unless there is some reason to believe that the library is buggy or is not sufficiently feature-complete to serve all the needs of the software under development.\n\n== Development style ==\nThere are various aspects to using test-driven development, for example the principles of \"keep it simple, stupid\" ([[KISS principle|KISS]]) and \"[[You aren't gonna need it]]\" (YAGNI). By focusing on writing only the code necessary to pass tests, designs can often be cleaner and clearer than is achieved by other methods.<ref name=Beck /> In ''Test-Driven Development by Example'', Kent Beck also suggests the principle \"[[Fake it till you make it]]\".\n\nTo achieve some advanced design concept such as a [[design pattern]], tests are written that generate that design. The code may remain simpler than the target pattern, but still pass all required tests. This can be unsettling at first but it allows the developer to focus only on what is important.\n\nWriting the tests first: The tests should be written before the functionality that is to be tested. This has been claimed to have many benefits. It helps ensure that the application is written for testability, as the developers must consider how to test the application from the outset rather than adding it later. It also ensures that tests for every feature get written. Additionally, writing the tests first leads to a deeper and earlier understanding of the product requirements, ensures the effectiveness of the test code, and maintains a continual focus on [[software quality]].<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\">{{cite web|title=Effective TDD for Complex Embedded Systems Whitepaper|url=http://www.pathfindersolns.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Effective-TDD-Executive-Summary.pdf|publisher=Pathfinder Solutions}}</ref> When writing feature-first code, there is a tendency by developers and organisations to push the developer on to the next feature, even neglecting testing entirely. The first TDD test might not even compile at first, because the classes and methods it requires may not yet exist. Nevertheless, that first test functions as the beginning of an executable specification.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/test_driven_development/ |title=Agile Test Driven Development |publisher=Agile Sherpa |date=2010-08-03 |access-date=2012-08-14 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120723184333/http://www.agilesherpa.org/agile_coach/engineering_practices/test_driven_development/ |archive-date=2012-07-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nEach test case fails initially: This ensures that the test really works and can catch an error. Once this is shown, the underlying functionality can be implemented. This has led to the \"test-driven development mantra\", which is \"red/green/refactor\", where red means ''fail'' and green means ''pass''. Test-driven development constantly repeats the steps of adding test cases that fail, passing them, and refactoring. Receiving the expected test results at each stage reinforces the developer's mental model of the code, boosts confidence and increases productivity.\n\n===Keep the unit small===\nFor TDD, a unit is most commonly defined as a class, or a group of related functions often called a module. Keeping units relatively small is claimed to provide critical benefits, including:\n* Reduced debugging effort \u2013 When test failures are detected, having smaller units aids in tracking down errors. \n* Self-documenting tests \u2013 Small test cases are easier to read and to understand.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\nAdvanced practices of test-driven development can lead to [[acceptance test\u2013driven development]] (ATDD) and [[Specification by example]] where the criteria specified by the customer are automated into acceptance tests, which then drive the traditional unit test-driven development (UTDD) process.<ref name=\"Koskela\">Koskela, L. \"Test Driven: TDD and Acceptance TDD for Java Developers\", Manning Publications, 2007</ref> This process ensures the customer has an automated mechanism to decide whether the software meets their requirements. With ATDD, the development team now has a specific target to satisfy \u2013 the acceptance tests \u2013 which keeps them continuously focused on what the customer really wants from each user story.\n\n== Best practices ==\n\n=== Test structure ===\nEffective layout of a test case ensures all required actions are completed, improves the readability of the test case, and smooths the flow of execution. Consistent structure helps in building a self-documenting test case. A commonly applied structure for test cases has (1) setup, (2) execution, (3) validation, and (4) cleanup.\n* Setup: Put the Unit Under Test (UUT) or the overall test system in the state needed to run the test.\n* Execution: Trigger/drive the UUT to perform the target behavior and capture all output, such as return values and output parameters. This step is usually very simple.\n* Validation: Ensure the results of the test are correct. These results may include explicit outputs captured during execution or state changes in the UUT.\n* Cleanup: Restore the UUT or the overall test system to the pre-test state. This restoration permits another test to execute immediately after this one.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n=== Individual best practices ===\n\nSome best practices that an individual could follow would be to separate common set-up and tear-down logic into test support services utilized by the appropriate test cases, to keep each [[test oracle]] focused on only the results necessary to validate its test, and to design time-related tests to allow tolerance for execution in non-real time operating systems. The common practice of allowing a 5-10 percent margin for late execution reduces the potential number of false negatives in test execution. It is also suggested to treat test code with the same respect as production code. Test code must work correctly for both positive and negative cases, last a long time, and be readable and maintainable. Teams can get together with and review tests and test practices to share effective techniques and catch bad habits.<ref name=\"pathfindersolns.com\" />\n\n=== Practices to avoid, or \"anti-patterns\" ===\n* Having test cases depend on system state manipulated from previously executed test cases (i.e., you should always start a unit test from a known and pre-configured state).\n* Dependencies between test cases.  A test suite where test cases are dependent upon each other is brittle and complex. Execution order should not be presumed. Basic refactoring of the initial test cases or structure of the UUT causes a spiral of increasingly pervasive impacts in associated tests.\n* Interdependent tests.  Interdependent tests can cause cascading false negatives. A failure in an early test case breaks a later test case even if no actual fault exists in the UUT, increasing defect analysis and debug efforts.\n* Testing precise execution behavior timing or performance.\n* Building \"all-knowing oracles\".  An oracle that inspects more than necessary is more expensive and brittle over time. This very common error is dangerous because it causes a subtle but pervasive time sink across the complex project.<ref name=\"pathfindersolns.com\">{{YouTube| id=0BWSms3J40Y| title=Test-Driven Development (TDD) for Complex Systems Introduction}} by Pathfinder Solutions</ref>\n* Testing implementation details.\n* Slow running tests.\n\n== Benefits ==\nA 2005 study found that using TDD meant writing more tests and, in turn, programmers who wrote more tests tended to be more productive.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = http://nparc.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/npsi/ctrl?action=shwart&index=an&req=5763742&lang=en\n | title = On the Effectiveness of Test-first Approach to Programming\n | access-date = 2008-01-14\n | last = Erdogmus\n | first = Hakan\n | author2 = Morisio, Torchiano\n | publisher = Proceedings of the IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering, 31(1).

Aufl.}}</ref> By focusing on the test cases first, one must imagine how the functionality is used by clients (in the first case, the test cases). So, the programmer is concerned with the interface before the implementation. This benefit is complementary to [[design by contract]] as it approaches code through test cases rather than through mathematical assertions or preconceptions.\n\nTest-driven development offers the ability to take small steps when required. It allows a programmer to focus on the task at hand as the first goal is to make the test pass. Exceptional cases and error handling are not considered initially, and tests to create these extraneous circumstances are implemented separately. Test-driven development ensures in this way that all written code is covered by at least one test. This gives the programming team, and subsequent users, a greater level of confidence in the code.\n\nWhile it is true that more code is required with TDD than without TDD because of the unit test code, the total code implementation time could be shorter based on a model by M\u00fcller and Padberg.<ref>{{cite web\n | url = https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/65d9/24ef1162b2f3c24bd15d627302887991b298.pdf\n | title = About the Return on Investment of Test-Driven Development\n | access-date = 2012-06-14\n | author =\n | last = M\u00fcller\n | first = Matthias M.\n |author2=Padberg, Frank\n  | format = PDF\n | publisher = Universit\u00e4t Karlsruhe, Germany\n | page = 6\n}}</ref> Large numbers of tests help to limit the number of defects in the code. The early and frequent nature of the testing helps to catch defects early in the development cycle, preventing them from becoming endemic and expensive problems. Eliminating defects early in the process usually avoids lengthy and tedious debugging later in the project.\n\nTDD can lead to more modularized, flexible, and extensible code. This effect often comes about because the methodology requires that the developers think of the software in terms of small units that can be written and tested independently and integrated together later. This leads to smaller, more focused classes, looser [[Coupling (computer programming)|coupling]], and cleaner interfaces. The use of the [[mock object]] design pattern also contributes to the overall modularization of the code because this pattern requires that the code be written so that modules can be switched easily between mock versions for unit testing and \"real\" versions for deployment.\n\nBecause no more code is written than necessary to pass a failing test case, automated tests tend to cover every code path. For example, for a TDD developer to add an <code>else</code> branch to an existing <code>if</code> statement, the developer would first have to write a failing test case that motivates the branch. As a result, the automated tests resulting from TDD tend to be very thorough: they detect any unexpected changes in the code's behaviour. This detects problems that can arise where a change later in the development cycle unexpectedly alters other functionality.\n\nMadeyski<ref name=\"Madeyski\">Madeyski, L. \"Test-Driven Development - An Empirical Evaluation of Agile Practice\", Springer, 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-642-04287-4}}, pp. 1-245. DOI: 978-3-642-04288-1</ref> provided empirical evidence (via a series of laboratory experiments with over 200 developers) regarding the superiority of the TDD practice over the traditional Test-Last approach or testing for correctness approach, with respect to the lower coupling between objects (CBO). The mean effect size represents a medium (but close to large) effect on the basis of meta-analysis of the performed experiments which is a substantial finding. It suggests a better modularization (i.e., a more modular design), easier reuse and testing of the developed software products due to the TDD programming practice.<ref name=\"Madeyski\" /> Madeyski also measured the effect of the TDD practice on unit tests using branch coverage (BC) and mutation score indicator (MSI),<ref>[http://madeyski.e-informatyka.pl/download/Madeyski10c.pdf The impact of Test-First programming on branch coverage and mutation score indicator of unit tests: An experiment. ] by L.

TDD encourages developers to put the minimum amount of code into such modules and to maximize the logic that is in testable library code, using fakes and [[Mock object|mocks]] to represent the outside world.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | last=Hunter\n | first=Andrew\n | url=https://www.simple-talk.com/dotnet/.net-framework/are-unit-tests-overused/\n | title=Are Unit Tests Overused?\n | publisher=Simple-talk.com\n | date=2012-10-19 |access-date=2014-03-25}}</ref>\n\nManagement support is essential. Without the entire organization believing that test-driven development is going to improve the product, management may feel that time spent writing tests is wasted.<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url=http://people.apache.org/~stevel/slides/testing.pdf\n | title=Testing\n | last=Loughran\n | first=Steve\n | date=November 6, 2006\n | publisher=HP Laboratories\n | access-date=2009-08-12\n | format=PDF\n}}</ref>\n\nUnit tests created in a test-driven development environment are typically created by the developer who is writing the code being tested. Therefore, the tests may share blind spots with the code: if, for example, a developer does not realize that certain input parameters must be checked, most likely neither the test nor the code will verify those parameters. Another example: if the developer misinterprets the requirements for the module he is developing, the code and the unit tests he writes will both be wrong in the same way. Therefore, the tests will pass, giving a false sense of correctness.\n\nA high number of passing unit tests may bring a false sense of security, resulting in fewer additional [[software testing]] activities, such as [[integration testing]] and [[compliance testing]].\n\nTests become part of the maintenance overhead of a project. Badly written tests, for example ones that include hard-coded error strings, are themselves prone to failure, and they are expensive to maintain. This is especially the case with [[fragile tests]].<ref>\n{{cite web\n | url=http://xunitpatterns.com/Fragile%20Test.html\n | title=Fragile Tests\n}}</ref> There is a risk that tests that regularly generate false failures will be ignored, so that when a real failure occurs, it may not be detected. It is possible to write tests for low and easy maintenance, for example by the reuse of error strings, and this should be a goal during the [[code refactoring]] phase described above.\n\nWriting and maintaining an excessive number of tests costs time. Also, more-flexible modules (with limited tests) might accept new requirements without the need for changing the tests. For those reasons, testing for only extreme conditions, or a small sample of data, can be easier to adjust than a set of highly detailed tests.\n\nThe level of coverage and testing detail achieved during repeated TDD cycles cannot easily be re-created at a later date. Therefore, these original, or early, tests become increasingly precious as time goes by. The tactic is to fix it early. Also, if a poor architecture, a poor design, or a poor testing strategy leads to a late change that makes dozens of existing tests fail, then it is important that they are individually fixed. Merely deleting, disabling or rashly altering them can lead to undetectable holes in the test coverage.\n\n== Test-driven work ==\nTest-driven development has been adopted outside of software development, in both product and service teams, as test-driven work.<ref>Leybourn, E. (2013) ''Directing the Agile Organisation: A Lean Approach to Business Management''. London: IT Governance Publishing: 176-179.</ref> Similar to TDD, non-software teams develop [[quality control]] (QC) checks (usually manual tests rather than automated tests) for each aspect of the work prior to commencing. These QC checks are then used to inform the design and validate the associated outcomes. The six steps of the TDD sequence are applied with minor semantic changes:\n# \"Add a check\" replaces \"Add a test\"\n# \"Run all checks\" replaces \"Run all tests\"\n# \"Do the work\" replaces \"Write some code\"\n# \"Run all checks\" replaces \"Run tests\"\n# \"Clean up the work\" replaces \"Refactor code\"\n# \"Repeat\"\n\n== TDD and ATDD ==\nTest-driven development is related to, but different from [[acceptance test\u2013driven development]] (ATDD).<ref>{{cite book |title=Lean-Agile Acceptance Test-Driven Development: Better Software Through Collaboration  |year=2011 |publisher=Addison Wesley Professional |location=Boston |isbn=978-0321714084}}</ref> TDD is primarily a developer's tool to help create well-written unit of code (function, class, or module) that correctly performs a set of operations. ATDD is a communication tool between the customer, developer, and tester to ensure that the requirements are well-defined. TDD requires test automation. ATDD does not, although automation helps with regression testing. Tests used in TDD can often be derived from ATDD tests, since the code units implement some portion of a requirement. ATDD tests should be readable by the customer. TDD tests do not need to be.\n\n== TDD and BDD ==\nBDD ([[behavior-driven development]]) combines practices from TDD and from ATDD.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=BDD \n|url=http://guide.agilealliance.org/guide/bdd.html\n|access-date=2015-04-28\n}}</ref>\nIt includes the practice of writing tests first, but focuses on tests which describe behavior, rather than tests which test a unit of implementation.  Tools such as [[JBehave]], [[Cucumber (software)|Cucumber]], [[Mspec]] and [[Specflow]] provide syntaxes which allow product owners, developers and test engineers to define together the behaviors which can then be translated into automated tests.\n\n==Code visibility==\n[[Test suite]] code clearly has to be able to access the code it is testing. On the other hand, normal design criteria such as [[information hiding]], encapsulation and the [[separation of concerns]] should not be compromised. Therefore, unit test code for TDD is usually written within the same project or [[Module (programming)|module]] as the code being tested.\n\nIn [[object oriented design]] this still does not provide access to private data and methods. Therefore, extra work may be necessary for unit tests. In [[Java (programming language)|Java]] and other languages, a developer can use [[Reflection (computer science)|reflection]] to access private fields and methods.<ref>{{cite web \n|title=Subverting Java Access Protection for Unit Testing \n|url=http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/11/12/reflection.html\n|last=Burton\n|first=Ross\n|date=2003-11-12\n|publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc.\n|access-date=2009-08-12\n}}</ref> Alternatively, an [[inner class]] can be used to hold the unit tests so they have visibility of the enclosing class's members and attributes. In the [[.NET Framework]] and some other programming languages, [[partial class]]es may be used to expose private methods and data for the tests to access.\n\nIt is important that such testing hacks do not remain in the production code. In [[C (programming language)|C]] and other languages, [[Directive (programming)|compiler directives]] such as <code>#if DEBUG ... #endif</code> can be placed around such additional classes and indeed all other test-related code to prevent them being compiled into the released code. This means the released code is not exactly the same as what was unit tested. The regular running of fewer but more comprehensive, end-to-end, integration tests on the final release build can ensure (among other things) that no production code exists that subtly relies on aspects of the test harness.\n\nThere is some debate among practitioners of TDD, documented in their blogs and other writings, as to whether it is wise to test private methods and data anyway. Some argue that private members are a mere implementation detail that may change, and should be allowed to do so without breaking numbers of tests. Thus it should be sufficient to test any class through its public interface or through its subclass interface, which some languages call the \"protected\" interface.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ |title=PEP 8 -- Style Guide for Python Code |last1=van Rossum |first1=Guido |last2=Warsaw |first2=Barry |date=5 July 2001 |work= |publisher=Python Software Foundation |access-date=6 May 2012}}</ref> Others say that crucial aspects of functionality may be implemented in private methods and testing them directly offers advantage of smaller and more direct unit tests.<ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://blogs.msdn.com/jamesnewkirk/archive/2004/06/07/150361.aspx\n|title=Testing Private Methods/Member Variables - Should you or shouldn't you\n|last=Newkirk\n|first=James\n|date=7 June 2004\n|publisher=Microsoft Corporation\n|access-date=2009-08-12}}</ref><ref>{{cite web \n|url=http://www.codeproject.com/KB/cs/testnonpublicmembers.aspx\n|title=How to Test Private and Protected methods in .NET\n|last=Stall\n|first=Tim\n|date=1 Mar 2005\n|publisher=CodeProject\n|access-date=2009-08-12}}</ref>\n\n== Software for TDD ==\nThere are many testing frameworks and tools that are useful in TDD.\n\n=== xUnit frameworks ===\nDevelopers may use computer-assisted [[list of unit testing frameworks|testing frameworks]], commonly collectively named [[xUnit]] (which are derived from SUnit, created in 1998), to create and automatically run the test cases. xUnit frameworks provide assertion-style test validation capabilities and result reporting. These capabilities are critical for automation as they move the burden of execution validation from an independent post-processing activity to one that is included in the test execution.  The execution framework provided by these test frameworks allows for the automatic execution of all system test cases or various subsets along with other features.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effective TDD for Complex, Embedded Systems Whitepaper|url=http://www.pathfindersolns.com/download-whitepaper/?download=EffectiveTDDforComplexEmbeddedSystems.pdf&title=Effective_TDD_for_Complex_Embedded_Systems|publisher=Pathfinder Solutions|access-date=2012-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820134917/http://www.pathfindersolns.com/download-whitepaper?download=EffectiveTDDforComplexEmbeddedSystems.pdf&title=Effective_TDD_for_Complex_Embedded_Systems|archive-date=2013-08-20|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n=== TAP results ===\nTesting frameworks may accept unit test output in the language-agnostic [[Test Anything Protocol]] created in 1987.\n\n==Fakes, mocks and integration tests==\nUnit tests are so named because they each test ''one unit'' of code. A complex module may have a thousand unit tests and a simple module may have only ten. The unit tests used for TDD should never cross process boundaries in a program, let alone network connections. Doing so introduces delays that make tests run slowly and discourage developers from running the whole suite. Introducing dependencies on external modules or data also turns ''unit tests'' into ''integration tests''. If one module misbehaves in a chain of interrelated modules, it is not so immediately clear where to look for the cause of the failure.\n\nWhen code under development relies on a database, a web service, or any other external process or service, enforcing a unit-testable separation is also an opportunity and a driving force to design more modular, more testable and more reusable code.<ref>{{cite book |title=Refactoring - Improving the design of existing code |last=Fowler |first=Martin |year=1999 |publisher=Addison Wesley Longman, Inc. |location=Boston |isbn=0-201-48567-2 |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780201485677 }}</ref> Two steps are necessary:\n\n# Whenever external access is needed in the final design, an [[Interface (computer science)|interface]] should be defined that describes the access available. See the [[dependency inversion principle]] for a discussion of the benefits of doing this regardless of TDD.\n# The interface should be implemented in two ways, one of which really accesses the external process, and the other of which is a [[mock object|fake or mock]]. Fake objects need do little more than add a message such as \"Person object saved\" to a [[Tracing (software)|trace log]], against which a test [[Assertion (computing)|assertion]] can be run to verify correct behaviour. Mock objects differ in that they themselves contain [[Assertion (computing)|test assertions]] that can make the test fail, for example, if the person's name and other data are not as expected.\n\nFake and mock object methods that return data, ostensibly from a data store or user, can help the test process by always returning the same, realistic data that tests can rely upon. They can also be set into predefined fault modes so that error-handling routines can be developed and reliably tested. In a fault mode, a method may return an invalid, incomplete or [[Null character|null]] response, or may throw an [[Exception handling|exception]].  Fake services other than data stores may also be useful in TDD: A fake encryption service may not, in fact, encrypt the data passed; a fake random number service may always return 1. Fake or mock implementations are examples of [[dependency injection]].\n\nA Test Double is a test-specific capability that substitutes for a system capability, typically a class or function, that the UUT depends on. There are two times at which test doubles can be introduced into a system: link and execution. Link time substitution is when the test double is compiled into the load module, which is executed to validate testing. This approach is typically used when running in an environment other than the target environment that requires doubles for the hardware level code for compilation.  The alternative to linker substitution is run-time substitution in which the real functionality is replaced during the execution of a test case. This substitution is typically done through the reassignment of known function pointers or object replacement.\n\nTest doubles are of a number of different types and varying complexities:\n* [[Dummy code|Dummy]] \u2013 A dummy is the simplest form of a test double. It facilitates linker time substitution by providing a default return value where required. \n* [[Method stub|Stub]] \u2013 A stub adds simplistic logic to a dummy, providing different outputs.  \n* Spy \u2013 A spy captures and makes available parameter and state information, publishing accessors to test code for private information allowing for more advanced state validation. \n* [[Mock object|Mock]] \u2013 A mock is specified by an individual test case to validate test-specific behavior, checking parameter values and call sequencing. \n* Simulator \u2013 A simulator is a comprehensive component providing a higher-fidelity approximation of the target capability (the thing being doubled). A simulator typically requires significant additional development effort.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\nA corollary of such dependency injection is that the actual database or other external-access code is never tested by the TDD process itself. To avoid errors that may arise from this, other tests are needed that instantiate the test-driven code with the \"real\" implementations of the interfaces discussed above. These are [[Integration testing|integration tests]] and are quite separate from the TDD unit tests. There are fewer of them, and they must be run less often than the unit tests. They can nonetheless be implemented using the same testing framework.\n\nIntegration tests that alter any [[persistent storage|persistent store]] or database should always be designed carefully with consideration of the initial and final state of the files or database, even if any test fails. This is often achieved using some combination of the following techniques:\n* The <code>TearDown</code> method, which is integral to many test frameworks.\n* <code>try...catch...finally</code> [[exception handling]] structures where available.\n* [[Database transactions]] where a transaction [[atomicity (database systems)|atomically]] includes perhaps a write, a read and a matching delete operation.\n* Taking a \"snapshot\" of the database before running any tests and rolling back to the snapshot after each test run. This may be automated using a framework such as [[Apache Ant|Ant]] or [[NAnt]] or a [[continuous integration]] system such as [[CruiseControl]].\n* Initialising the database to a clean state ''before'' tests, rather than cleaning up ''after'' them. This may be relevant where cleaning up may make it difficult to diagnose test failures by deleting the final state of the database before detailed diagnosis can be performed.\n\n== TDD for complex systems ==\nExercising TDD on large, challenging systems requires a modular architecture, well-defined components with published interfaces, and disciplined system layering with maximization of platform independence. These proven practices yield increased testability and facilitate the application of build and test automation.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n=== Designing for testability ===\nComplex systems require an architecture that meets a range of requirements.  A key subset of these requirements includes support for the complete and effective testing of the system. Effective modular design yields components that share traits essential for effective TDD.\n\n* [[Cohesion (computer science)|High Cohesion]] ensures each unit provides a set of related capabilities and makes the tests of those capabilities easier to maintain.\n* [[Coupling (computer programming)|Low Coupling]] allows each unit to be effectively tested in isolation.\n* Published Interfaces restrict Component access and serve as contact points for tests, facilitating test creation and ensuring the highest fidelity between test and production unit configuration.\n\nA key technique for building effective modular architecture is Scenario Modeling where a set of sequence charts is constructed, each one focusing on a single system-level execution scenario. The Scenario Model provides an excellent vehicle for creating the strategy of interactions between components in response to a specific stimulus. Each of these Scenario Models serves as a rich set of requirements for the services or functions that a component must provide, and it also dictates the order that these components and services interact together. Scenario modeling can greatly facilitate the construction of TDD tests for a complex system.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n=== Managing tests for large teams ===\nIn a larger system the impact of poor component quality is magnified by the complexity of interactions. This magnification makes the benefits of TDD accrue even faster in the context of larger projects. However, the complexity of the total population of tests can become a problem in itself, eroding potential gains. It sounds simple, but a key initial step is to recognize that test code is also important software and should be produced and maintained with the same rigor as the production code.\n\nCreating and managing the architecture of test software within a complex system is just as important as the core product architecture. Test drivers interact with the UUT, test doubles and the unit test framework.<ref name=\"Pathfinder Solutions\" />\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* [[Acceptance testing]]\n* [[Behavior-driven development]]\n* [[Design by contract]]\n* [[Inductive programming]]<!-- automatically producing a program from test cases -->\n* [[Integration testing]]\n* [[List of software development philosophies]] \n* [[List of unit testing frameworks]]\n* [[Mock object]]\n* [[Programming by example]]<!-- example-driven program synthesis -->\n* [[Sanity check]]\n* [[Self-testing code]]\n* [[Software testing]]\n* [[Test case]]\n* [[Transformation Priority Premise]]\n* [[Unit testing]]\n* [[Continuous test-driven development]]\n}}\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- please try and keep this list under control.

The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, however, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic.\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', Portvgallo or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Escoural Cave|History of Portugal}}\n[[File:Rock_Art_Foz_Coa_01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the C\u00f4a Valley]].]]\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies.

Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited Western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Celtic from the West. Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature |  url =https://www.academia.edu/7336002 | author= Koch, John&al.}}</ref> In addition, a number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the [[Tartessian language]], once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at least proto-Celtic in structure. Modern archeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the [[Celts]] in Portugal and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web | title= Our Celtic roots lie in Spain and Portugal | url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/celtic-roots-lie-spain-portugal-2174486| accessdate=11 April 2017 | publisher = Walles Online | author= Devine, Darren}}</ref> During that period and until the Roman invasions, the Castro culture (a variation of the [[Urnfield culture]] also known as ''Urnenfelderkultur'') was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia.<ref>Estos se establecieron en el norte de Portugal y el \u00e1rea de la [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] actual, introduciendo en esta regi\u00f3n la cultura de las urnas, una variante de las Urnenfelder que evolucionar\u00eda despu\u00e9s en la cultura de los castros o castre\u00f1a</ref>\nThis culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, ended up in what has been called the Cultura Castreja or [[Castro Culture]]. This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'd\u00f9n', 'd\u00f9in' or 'don' in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles.\n\nBased on the Roman chronicles about the [[Callaeci]] peoples, along with the [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/leborgablare01macauoft|title=Lebor gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The book of the taking of Ireland|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|publisher=Dublin : Published for the Irish texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]].

A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimar\u00e3es]] \u2013 the \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\" (Cidade Ber\u00e7o in Portuguese).<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portug\u00e1lia'' \u2013 the [[County of Portugal]].<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nLater the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1093, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nSebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

We bury the dead and take care of the living.\"\n\nDespite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nIn 1762, [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War, 1761\u20131763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779.\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the T\u00e1vora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.\n\nHowever, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u201362.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic era ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | footer =\n | image1 = Embarque da Fam\u00edlia Real para o Brasil - Nicolas-Louis-Albert Delerive, attrib.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world.

Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats.

The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male). In 2018 and according to more up-to-date figures, the population decreased to 10,276,617.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |title=Portugal |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\nMinorities of ''Crist\u00e3os Novos'' (New Christians) nevertheless, stayed in Portugal after converting to Catholicism. A very small number of former Jews may have continued to observe rabbinic Judaism in secret over many generations, namely the [[History of the Jews in Belmonte|Jews of Belmonte]], a town in the interior; where people now observe the [[Jewish]] faith openly. Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]]. Another interesting demographic feature relates to the Scandinavian expansion towards the West and strong activity in Northern Portugal where some coastline communities kept [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry in [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto District|Porto]] and [[Braga District|Braga]] regions.\n\nThe most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948\u2013956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}</ref> Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics (Iron Age Period)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=Eupedia.com|access-date=}}</ref> which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] genetical markers.

These maritime contacts and the prevalence of R1b haplogroup as the main genetical marker of these countries suggest a common ancestry and cultural proximity.

This emerging height gap took place in the 1840s and has increased since. One of the driving factors was the modest real wage development, given the late industrialization and economic growth in Portugal compared to the European core.

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS. Five regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy.

Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, the Boom Festival, that is also the only festival in Portugal to win international awards: European Festival Award 2010 \u2013 Green'n'Clean Festival of the Year and the Greener Festival Award Outstanding 2008 and 2010.

The [[pre-Celtic]] people, \n[[Celts]] and [[Roman Republic|Romans]] were followed by the invasions of the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] [[Germanic peoples]]. After the [[Muslim]] conquest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]], most of its territory was part of [[Al-Andalus]]. Portugal as a country was established during the early Christian ''[[Reconquista]]''. Founded in 868, the [[County of Portugal]] gained prominence after the [[Battle of S\u00e3o Mamede]] (1128). The [[Kingdom of Portugal]] was later proclaimed following the [[Battle of Ourique]] (1139), and independence from [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]] was recognised by the [[Treaty of Zamora]] (1143).<ref>Brian Jenkins, Spyros A.

The name of the city is from the Latin word for [[port]] or harbor, ''portus'', but the second element of ''Portus Cale'' is less clear. The mainstream explanation for the name is that it is an [[ethnonym]] derived from the [[Castro culture|Castro people]], also known as the [[Callaeci]], Gallaeci or Gallaecia, who occupied the north-west of the Iberian Peninsula. The names ''cactusi'' and ''Cale'' are the origin of today's ''[[Vila Nova de Gaia|Gaia]]'' and ''[[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]]''.<ref> https://www.academia.edu/10819665/Origem_e_significado_dos_nomes_de_Portugal_e_da_Galiza </ref>\n\nAnother theory has it that Cala was the name of a Celtic goddess (drawing a comparison with the [[Gaelic languages|Gaelic]] ''[[Cailleach]]'' a supernatural hag). \nA further theory is that ''Cale'' or ''Calle'' is a derivation of the Celtic word for port, like the [[Irish language|Irish]] ''called'' or [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''call''. These explanations, however, would require the pre-Roman language of the area to have been a branch of Q-Celtic, which is not generally accepted. The region's pre-Roman language was Gallaecian Celtic.\n\nSome French scholars believe the name may have come from 'Portus Gallus',<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MD8zAQAAMAAJ&pg=PA441&lpg=PA441&dq=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal#v=onepage&q=portus+Gallus+etymologie+du+portugal&f=false|title=Manuel g\u00e9ographique et statistique de l'Espagne et du Portugal ...|date=11 April 2018|publisher=Buisson|via=Google Books}}</ref> the port of the Gauls or Celts.\n\nAround 200 BC, the Romans took the [[Iberian Peninsula]] from the [[Ancient Carthage|Carthaginians]] during the [[Second Punic War]], and in the process conquered Cale renaming it ''Portus Cale'' (''Port of Cale'') incorporating it to the province of [[Gaelicia|Gaellicia]] with capital in [[Bracara Augusta]] (modern day [[Braga]], Portugal). During the [[Middle Ages]], the region around ''Portus Cale'' became known by the [[Suebi]] and [[Visigoths]] as '''''Portucale'''''. The name ''Portucale'' evolved into '''''Portugale''''' during the 7th and 8th centuries, and by the 9th century, that term was used extensively to refer to the region between the rivers [[Douro]] and [[Minho River|Minho]]. By the 11th and 12th centuries, ''Portugale'', ''Portugallia'', Portvgallo or ''Portvgalliae'' was already referred to as '''Portugal'''.\n\n== History ==\n{{more citations needed|section|date=October 2018}}<!--many paragraphs without citations-->\n\n=== Prehistory ===\n{{Main|Escoural Cave|History of Portugal}}\n[[File:Rock_Art_Foz_Coa_01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Prehistoric Rock Art Sites in the C\u00f4a Valley]].]]\nThe early history of Portugal is shared with the rest of the [[Iberian Peninsula]] located in South Western Europe. [[The name of Portugal]] derives from the joined Romano-Celtic name [[Portus Cale]]. The region was [[Pre-Roman peoples of the Iberian Peninsula|settled]] by Pre-[[Celts]] and Celts, giving origin to peoples like the [[Gallaeci]], [[Lusitanians]], [[Celtici]] and [[Cynetes]], visited by [[Phoenicians]], [[Ancient Greek]]s and [[Carthaginians]], incorporated in the [[Roman Republic]] dominions as [[Lusitania]] and part of [[Gallaecia]], after 45 BC until 298 AD.\n\nThe region of present-day Portugal was inhabited by [[Neanderthal]]s and then by ''[[Homo sapiens]]'', who roamed the border-less region of the northern Iberian peninsula.<ref name=\"Birmp1\">David Birmingham (2003), p. 11</ref> These were subsistence societies and although they did not establish prosperous settlements, did form organized societies.

Another theory suggests that Celts inhabited Western Iberia / Portugal well before any large Celtic migrations from [[Central Europe]].<ref>{{cite web | title= Celtic from the West. Alternative Perspectives from Archaeology, Genetics, Language and Literature |  url =https://www.academia.edu/7336002 | author= Koch, John&al.}}</ref> In addition, a number of linguists expert in ancient Celtic have presented compelling evidence that the [[Tartessian language]], once spoken in parts of SW Spain and SW Portugal, is at least proto-Celtic in structure. Modern archeology and research shows a Portuguese root to the [[Celts]] in Portugal and elsewhere.<ref>{{cite web | title= Our Celtic roots lie in Spain and Portugal | url= http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/celtic-roots-lie-spain-portugal-2174486| accessdate=11 April 2017 | publisher = Walles Online | author= Devine, Darren}}</ref> During that period and until the Roman invasions, the Castro culture (a variation of the [[Urnfield culture]] also known as ''Urnenfelderkultur'') was prolific in Portugal and modern Galicia.<ref>Estos se establecieron en el norte de Portugal y el \u00e1rea de la [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] actual, introduciendo en esta regi\u00f3n la cultura de las urnas, una variante de las Urnenfelder que evolucionar\u00eda despu\u00e9s en la cultura de los castros o castre\u00f1a</ref>\nThis culture, together with the surviving elements of the Atlantic megalithic culture and the contributions that come from the more Western Mediterranean cultures, ended up in what has been called the Cultura Castreja or [[Castro Culture]]. This designation refers to the characteristic Celtic populations called 'd\u00f9n', 'd\u00f9in' or 'don' in [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] and that the Romans called castrae in their chronicles.\n\nBased on the Roman chronicles about the [[Callaeci]] peoples, along with the [[Lebor Gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/leborgablare01macauoft|title=Lebor gab\u00e1la \u00c9renn: The book of the taking of Ireland|first=Robert Alexander Stewart|last=Macalister|publisher=Dublin : Published for the Irish texts Society by the Educational Company of Ireland|via=Internet Archive}}</ref> narrations and the interpretation of the abundant archaeological remains throughout the northern half of Portugal and Galicia, it is possible to infer that there was a matriarchal society, with a military and religious aristocracy probably of the feudal type. The figures of maximum authority were the chieftain (chefe tribal), of military type and with authority in his Castro or clan, and the druid, mainly referring to medical and religious functions that could be common to several castros. The Celtic cosmogony remained homogeneous due to the ability of the [[druids]] to meet in councils with the druids of other areas, which ensured the transmission of knowledge and the most significant events.\nThe first documentary references to Castro society are provided by chroniclers of Roman military campaigns such as [[Strabo]], [[Herodotus]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] among others, about the social organization, and describing the inhabitants of these territories, the [[Gallaecia|Gallaeci of Northern Portugal]] as:\n\"A group of barbarians who spend the day fighting and the night eating, drinking and dancing under the moon.\"\n\nThere were other similar tribes, and chief among them were the [[Lusitanians]]; the core area of these people lay in inland central Portugal, while numerous other related tribes existed such as the [[Celtici|Celtici of Alentejo]], and the [[Cynetes|Cynetes or Conii of the Algarve]].

A few small, semi-permanent, commercial coastal settlements (such as [[Tavira Municipality|Tavira]]) were also founded in the [[Algarve]] region by [[Phoenicians]]\u2013[[Carthaginians]].\n\n=== Roman Lusitania and Gallaecia ===\n\n{{Main|Lusitania|Gallaecia|Hispania}}\n\n[[File:Evora-RomanTemple edit.jpg|thumb|left|[[Roman Temple of \u00c9vora]], in the [[Alentejo]], is one of the best preserved [[Roman civilization|Roman]]-built structures in the country.]]\n\nRomans first invaded the Iberian Peninsula in 219 BC. The Carthaginians, Rome's adversary in the [[Punic Wars]], were expelled from their coastal colonies. During the last days of [[Julius Caesar]], almost the entire peninsula was annexed to the [[Roman Republic]].\n\nThe Roman conquest of what is now part of Portugal took almost two hundred years and took many lives of young soldiers and\nthe lives of those who were sentenced to a certain death in the slave mines when not sold as slaves to other parts of the empire. It suffered a severe setback in 155 BC, when a [[Lusitanian War|rebellion]] began in the north. The [[Lusitanians]] and other native tribes, under the leadership of [[Viriathus]], wrested control of all of western Iberia.\n\n[[File:Torre de Centum Cellas.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.92|[[Centum Cellas]], in the [[Beira (Portugal)|Beira region]], is a Roman ''[[villa rustica]]'' from the 1st century CE.]]\n\nRome sent numerous legions and its best generals to Lusitania to quell the rebellion, but to no avail \u2013 the Lusitanians kept conquering territory. The Roman leaders decided to change their strategy. They bribed Viriathus's allies to kill him. In 139 BC, Viriathus was assassinated and [[Tautalus]] became leader of the Lusitanians.\n\nRome installed a colonial regime. The complete Romanization of Lusitania only took place in the [[Visigothic]] era.\n\nIn 27 BC, Lusitania gained the status of [[Roman province]]. Later, a northern province of Lusitania was formed, known as [[Gallaecia]], with capital in Bracara Augusta, today's [[Braga]].\nThere are still many ruins of castros ([[hill forts]]) throughout modern Portugal and remains of the [[Castro culture]].\nSome urban remains are quite large, like [[Con\u00edmbriga]] and [[Mir\u00f3briga|Mirobriga]]. The former, beyond being one of the largest [[Roman Empire|Roman]] settlements in Portugal, is also classified as a [[Monuments of Portugal|National Monument]]. Con\u00edmbriga lies {{convert|16|km|abbr=off}} from [[Coimbra]], which in turn was the ancient ''[[Aeminium]]''. The site also has a museum that displays objects found by archaeologists during their excavations.\n\nSeveral works of engineering, such as baths, temples, bridges, roads, circuses, theatres and laymen's homes are preserved throughout the country. Coins, some coined in Lusitanian land, as well as numerous pieces of ceramics, were also found.

The [[Kingdom of the Suebi]] was the Germanic post-Roman kingdom, established in the former Roman provinces of [[Gallaecia]]-[[Lusitania]]. 5th-century vestiges of [[Alans|Alan]] settlements were found in [[Alenquer Municipality, Portugal|Alenquer]] (from old Germanic ''Alan kerk'', ''temple of the Alans''), [[Coimbra]] and Lisbon.<ref>Milhazes, Jos\u00e9.

In 448 Rechila died, leaving the state in expansion to [[Rechiar]].\nAfter the defeat against the Visigoths, the Suebian kingdom was divided, with Frantan and Aguiulfo ruling simultaneously. Both reigned from 456 to 457, the year in which Maldras (457\u2013459) reunified the kingdom to finish being assassinated after a failed Roman-Visigothic conspiracy.\nAlthough the conspiracy did not achieve its true purposes, the Suebian Kingdom was again divided between two kings:\n[[Frumar]] (Frumario 459\u2013463) and [[Remismund]] (Remismundo, son of [[Maldras]]) (459\u2013469) who would re-reunify his father's kingdom in 463 and that he would be forced to adopt [[Arianism]] in 465 due to the Visigoth influence.\nBy the year 500, the [[Visigothic Kingdom]] had been installed in Iberia, it was based in [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and advancing westwards. They became a threat to the Suebian rule.\nAfter the death of Remismund in 469 a dark period set in, where virtually all written texts and accounts disappear. This period lasted until 550. The only thing known about this period is that [[Theodemund]] (Teodemundo) most probably ruled the Suebians.\nThe dark period ended with the reign of Karriarico (550\u2013559) who reinstalled [[Catholic Church|Catholic Christianity]] in 550. He was succeed by [[Theodemir (Suebian king)|Theodemar]] (559\u2013570) during whose reign the 1st Council of Braga (561) was held.\n\n[[File:Ariamirogaliza.jpg|thumb|left|Illustrated depiction of the [[First Council of Braga]] of 561 CE]]\n\nThe councils represented an advance in the organization of the territory (paroeciam suevorum (Suebian parish) and the [[Christianization]] of the pagan population (''[[De correctione rusticorum]]'') under the auspices of [[Saint Martin of Braga]] (S\u00e3o Martinho de Braga).\n\nAfter the death of Teodomiro, [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] (570\u2013583) was his successor. During his reign, the 2nd Council of Braga (572) was held.\nThe Visigothic civil war began in 577. Miro intervened. Later in 583 he also organized an unsuccessful expedition to reconquer Seville. During the return from this failed operation Miro died.\n\nIn the Suebian Kingdom many internal struggles continued to take place. [[Eborico]] (Eurico, 583\u2013584) was dethroned by [[Andeca]] (Audeca 584\u2013585), who failed to prevent the Visigothic invasion led by Leovigildo. The Visigothic invasion, completed in 585, turned the once rich and fertile kingdom of the Suebi into the sixth province of the Gothic kingdom.\n[[Leovigild]] was crowned King of Gallaecia, Hispania and [[Gallia Narbonensis]].\n[[File:Cvp-00791-109v.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Kingdom of the Suebi|Suebi King]] [[Miro (Suebian king)|Miro]] and St. [[Martin of Braga]]; c. 1145]]\n\nFor the next 300 years and by the year 700, the entire Iberian Peninsula was ruled by the Visigoths.

Both 'governors' [[Wamba (king)|Wamba]] and [[Wittiza]] (Vitiza) acted as doge (they would later become kings in Toledo).  These two became known as the 'vitizians', who headquartered in the northwest and called on the Arab invaders from the South to be their allies in the struggle for power in 711.\nKing [[Roderic]] (Rodrigo) was killed while opposing this invasion, thus becoming the last Visigothic king of Iberia.\nFrom the various Germanic groups who settled in Western Iberia, the [[Suebi]] left the strongest lasting cultural legacy in what is today Portugal, Galicia and western fringes of Asturias.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fim do Imp\u00e9rio Romano e Chegada dos Suevos|url=http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|website=notapositiva.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223112452/http://www.notapositiva.com/pt/trbestbs/historia/10_fim_imper_romano.htm|archive-date=23 December 2014|url-status=dead}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Suevos|url=http://www.infoescola.com/povos-germanicos/suevos/|website=infoescola.com|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vest\u00edgios da presen\u00e7a sueva no noroeste da pen\u00ednsula ib\u00e9rica: na etnologia, na arqueologia e na l\u00edngua|url=http://www.scielo.mec.pt/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0807-89672013000200016|website=scielo.mec.pt|accessdate=12 March 2016|language=pt}}</ref>\nAccording to Dan Stanislawski, the Portuguese way of living in regions North of the Tagus is mostly inherited from the Suebi, in which small farms prevail, distinct from the large properties of Southern Portugal.\nBracara Augusta, the modern city of [[Braga]] and former capital of [[Gallaecia]], became the capital of the Suebi.

This rule lasted from some decades in the North to five centuries in the South.\n\nAfter defeating the [[Visigoths]] in only a few months, the Umayyad Caliphate started expanding rapidly in the peninsula. Beginning in 726, the land that is now Portugal became part of the vast Umayyad Caliphate's empire of [[Damascus]], which stretched from the [[Indus]] river in the Indian sub-continent up to the South of France, until its collapse in 750. That year the west of the empire gained its independence under [[Abd-ar-Rahman I]] with the establishment of the [[Emirate of C\u00f3rdoba]]. After almost two centuries, the Emirate became the [[Caliphate of C\u00f3rdoba]] in 929, until its dissolution a century later in 1031 into no less than 23 small kingdoms, called [[Taifa]] kingdoms.\n\n[[File:Portugal DSC04496 - MERTOLA (34025572830).jpg|thumb|right|Statue of [[Abu-l-Qasim Ahmad ibn al-Husayn ibn Qasi]] outside the [[Castle of M\u00e9rtola]], in the [[Alentejo]]]]\n\nThe governors of the taifas each proclaimed themselves [[Emir]] of their provinces and established diplomatic relations with the Christian kingdoms of the north.

One of the first cities Vimara Peres founded at this time is Vimaranes, known today as [[Guimar\u00e3es]] \u2013 the \"birthplace of the Portuguese nation\" or the \"cradle city\" (Cidade Ber\u00e7o in Portuguese).<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nAfter annexing the County of Portugal into one of the several counties that made up the [[Kingdom of Asturias]], King [[Alfonso III of Asturias]] knighted V\u00edmara Peres, in 868, as the First Count of Portus Cale (Portugal). The region became known as ''Portucale'', ''Portugale'', and simultaneously ''Portug\u00e1lia'' \u2013 the [[County of Portugal]].<ref name=\"QuidNovi\"/>\n\nLater the Kingdom of Asturias was divided into a number of Christian Kingdoms in Northern Iberia due to dynastic divisions of inheritance among the king's offspring. With the forced abdication of [[Alfonso III of Asturias|Alfonso III \"the Great\" of Asturias]] by his sons in 910, the Kingdom of Asturias split into three separate kingdoms. The three kingdoms were eventually reunited in 924 under the crown of [[Kingdom of Le\u00f3n|Le\u00f3n]].\n\nIn 1093, [[Alfonso VI of Le\u00f3n]] bestowed the county to [[Henry, Count of Portugal|Henry of Burgundy]] and married him to his daughter, [[Teresa of Le\u00f3n, Countess of Portugal|Teresa of Le\u00f3n]], for his role in reconquering the land from Moors.

This is traditionally taken as the occasion when the County of Portugal, as a fief of the Kingdom of Le\u00f3n, was transformed into the independent [[Kingdom of Portugal]].\n\nAfonso then established the first of the [[Portuguese Cortes]] at [[Lamego]], where he was crowned by the Archbishop of Braga, though the validity of the Cortes of Lamego has been disputed and called a myth created during the [[Portuguese Restoration War]].

Afonso Henriques and his successors, aided by military [[Christian monasticism|monastic orders]], pushed southward to drive out the Moors. At this time, Portugal covered about half of its present area. In 1249, the Reconquista ended with the capture of the [[Algarve]] and complete expulsion of the last Moorish settlements on the southern coast, giving Portugal its present-day borders, with minor exceptions.\n\nIn one of these situations of conflict with the [[kingdom of Castile]], [[Dinis I of Portugal]] signed with the king [[Fernando IV of Castile]] (who was represented, when a minor, by his mother the queen [[Maria de Molina]]) the [[Treaty of Alca\u00f1ices (1297)]], which stipulated that Portugal abolished agreed treaties against the kingdom of Castile for supporting the infant [[Juan de Castilla]].

The [[Queen consort]] of Portugal, [[Mary Anne of Austria|Archduchess Maria Anne Josefa of Austria]], was fond of Melo; and after his first wife died, she arranged the widowed de Melo's second marriage to the daughter of the Austrian Field Marshal [[Leopold Josef, Count von Daun]]. King [[John V of Portugal]], however, was not pleased and recalled Melo to Portugal in 1749. John V died the following year and his son, Joseph I of Portugal, was crowned. In contrast to his father, Joseph I was fond of de Melo, and with the [[Queen Mother]]'s approval, he appointed Melo as [[political minister|Minister]] of Foreign Affairs.\n\nAs the King's confidence in de Melo increased, the King entrusted him with more control of the state. By 1755, Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo was made Prime Minister. Impressed by British economic success that he had witnessed from his time as an Ambassador, he successfully implemented similar [[Economic system|economic]] policies in Portugal. He abolished slavery in Portugal and in the Portuguese colonies in India, reorganized the army and the navy, restructured the [[University of Coimbra]], and ended discrimination against different [[Christianity|Christian]] sects in Portugal.\n\nSebasti\u00e3o de Melo's greatest reforms were economic and financial, with the creation of several companies and guilds to regulate every commercial activity. He demarcated the region for production of [[port wine|Port]] to ensure the wine's quality, and this was the first attempt to control wine quality and production in Europe. He ruled with a strong hand by imposing strict law upon all classes of Portuguese society from the high nobility to the poorest working class, along with a widespread review of the country's tax system. These reforms gained him enemies in the upper classes, especially among the high nobility, who despised him as a social upstart.\n\n{{multiple image|perrow = 2|total_width=250\n| image1 = Ruinas da Pra\u00e7a da Patriarcal ap\u00f3s o Terramoto de 1755 - Jacques Philippe Le Bas, 1757.png  |width1= 1012 |height1= 716\n| image3 = Ruinas da Igreja de S.

We bury the dead and take care of the living.\"\n\nDespite the calamity and huge [[death toll]], Lisbon suffered no epidemics and within less than one year was already being rebuilt. The new city centre of Lisbon was designed to resist subsequent earthquakes. Architectural models were built for tests, and the effects of an earthquake were simulated by marching troops around the models. The buildings and big squares of the Pombaline City Centre still remain as one of Lisbon's tourist attractions. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo also made an important contribution to the study of [[seismology]] by designing an inquiry that was sent to every parish in the country.\n\nFollowing the earthquake, [[Joseph I of Portugal|Joseph I]] gave his Prime Minister even more power, and Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo became a powerful, progressive dictator. As his power grew, his enemies increased in number, and bitter disputes with the high nobility became frequent. In 1758 Joseph I was wounded in an attempted assassination. The [[T\u00e1vora affair|T\u00e1vora family]] and the [[Dukes of Aveiro|Duke of Aveiro]] were implicated and executed after a quick trial. The [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]] were expelled from the country and their assets confiscated by the crown. Sebasti\u00e3o de Melo prosecuted every person involved, even women and children. This was the final stroke that broke the power of the aristocracy. Joseph I made his loyal minister Count of [[Oeiras Municipality, Portugal|Oeiras]] in 1759.\n\nIn 1762, [[Spanish\u2013Portuguese War, 1761\u20131763|Spain invaded Portuguese territory]] as part of the [[Seven Years' War]], but by 1763 the ''status quo'' between Spain and Portugal before the war had been restored.\n\nFollowing the T\u00e1vora affair, the new Count of Oeiras knew no opposition. Made \"Marquis of Pombal\" in 1770, he effectively ruled Portugal until Joseph I's death in 1779.\n\nThe new ruler, Queen [[Maria I of Portugal]], disliked the Marquis because of the power he amassed, and never forgave him for the ruthlessness with which he dispatched the T\u00e1vora family, and upon her accession to the throne, she withdrew all his political offices. The Marquis of Pombal died on his estate at [[Pombal, Portugal|Pombal]] in 1782.\n\nHowever, historians also argue that Pombal's \"enlightenment,\" while far-reaching, was primarily a mechanism for enhancing autocracy at the expense of individual liberty and especially an apparatus for crushing opposition, suppressing criticism, and furthering colonial economic exploitation as well as intensifying book censorship and consolidating personal control and profit.<ref>Kenneth Maxwell, ''Pombal, Paradox of the Enlightenment'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 83, 91\u2013108, 160\u201362.</ref>\n\n=== Napoleonic era ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1777\u20131834)|United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | footer =\n | image1 = Embarque da Fam\u00edlia Real para o Brasil - Nicolas-Louis-Albert Delerive, attrib.

This decline was hastened by the [[independence of Brazil]], the country's largest colonial possession.\n\nIn the autumn of 1807, [[Napoleon]] moved French troops through Spain to invade Portugal. From 1807 to 1811, British-Portuguese forces would successfully fight against the French invasion of Portugal in the [[Peninsular War]], during which the royal family and the Portuguese [[nobility]], including Maria I, relocated to the [[Colonial Brazil|Portuguese territory of Brazil]], at that time a colony of the [[Portuguese Empire]], in South America. This episode is known as the [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil]].\n\nIn 1807, as Napoleon's army closed in on Lisbon, [[Jo\u00e3o VI of Portugal]], the [[Prince Regent]], transferred his court to Brazil and established [[Rio de Janeiro]] as the capital of the Portuguese Empire. In 1815, Brazil was declared a Kingdom and the Kingdom of Portugal was united with it, forming a pluricontinental state, the [[United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil and the Algarves]].\n\n[[File:Portuguese Constitution of 1826.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|The frontispiece of the 1826 Portuguese Constitution featuring King-Emperor [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro IV]] and his daughter Queen [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]]]]\nAs a result of the change in its status and the arrival of the Portuguese royal family, Brazilian administrative, civic, [[Economic history of Brazil#The economy at independence, 1822|economical]], military, [[Education in Brazil#History|educational]], and [[Brazilian science and technology#History|scientific]] apparatus were expanded and highly modernized. Portuguese and their allied British troops fought against the [[French Invasion of Portugal]] and by 1815 the situation in Europe had cooled down sufficiently that Jo\u00e3o VI would have been able to return safely to Lisbon. However, the King of Portugal remained in Brazil until the [[Liberal Revolution of 1820]], which started in [[Porto]], demanded his return to Lisbon in 1821.\n\nThus he returned to Portugal but left his son [[Pedro I of Brazil|Pedro]] in charge of Brazil. When the Portuguese Government attempted the following year to return the Kingdom of Brazil to subordinate status, his son Pedro, with the overwhelming support of the Brazilian elites, declared [[War of Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]] from Portugal. [[Cisplatina]] (today's sovereign state of Uruguay), in the south, was one of the last additions to the territory of Brazil under Portuguese rule.\n\nBrazilian independence was recognized in 1825, whereby Emperor Pedro I granted to his father the titular honour of ''Emperor of Brazil''. John VI's death in 1826 caused serious questions in his succession. Though Pedro was his heir, and reigned briefly as Pedro IV, his status as a Brazilian monarch was seen as an impediment to holding the Portuguese throne by both nations. Pedro abdicated in favour of his daughter, [[Maria II of Portugal|Maria II]] (Mary II). However, Pedro's brother, [[Miguel I of Portugal|Infante Miguel]], claimed the throne in protest. After a proposal for Miguel and Maria to marry failed, Miguel seized power as King Miguel I, in 1828. In order to defend his daughter's rights to the throne, Pedro launched the [[Portuguese Civil War|Liberal Wars]] to reinstall his daughter and establish a constitutional monarchy in Portugal. The war ended in 1834, with Miguel's defeat, the promulgation of a constitution, and the reinstatement of Queen Maria II.\n\n=== Constitutional monarchy ===\n{{Main|History of Portugal (1834\u20131910)}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = O Regic\u00eddio por Haenen (2).jpg\n | image2 = Aclama\u00e7\u00e3o de Dom Manuel II.jpg\n | image3 = Proclama\u00e7\u00e3o Rep\u00fablica Portuguesa.jpg\n | footer = Top to bottom: The [[Lisbon Regicide]] (1908), [[Manuel II of Portugal|Manuel II]]'s acclamation as King (1908) and the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Proclamation of the Republic]] (1910)\n }}\nQueen Maria II (Mary II) and King [[Ferdinand II of Portugal|Ferdinand II]]'s son, King [[Pedro V]] (Peter V) modernized the country during his short reign (1853\u20131861). Under his reign, roads, telegraphs, and railways were constructed and improvements in public health advanced. His popularity increased when, during the [[cholera]] outbreak of 1853\u20131856, he visited hospitals handing out gifts and comforting the sick. Pedro's reign was short, as he died of cholera in 1861, after a series of deaths in the royal family, including his two brothers [[Infante Fernando of Portugal|Infante Fernando]] and [[Infante Jo\u00e3o, Duke of Beja]], and his wife, [[Stephanie of Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen]]. Pedro not having children, his brother, [[Lu\u00eds I of Portugal]] (Louis I) ascended the throne and continued his modernization.\n\nAt the height of European colonialism in the 19th century, Portugal had already lost its territory in South America and all but a few bases in Asia. [[Luanda]], [[Benguela]], [[Bissau]], [[Maputo|Louren\u00e7o Marques]], [[Porto Amboim]] and the [[Island of Mozambique]] were among the oldest Portuguese-founded port cities in its African territories. During this phase, Portuguese colonialism focused on expanding its outposts in Africa into nation-sized territories to compete with other European powers there.\n\nWith the [[Berlin Conference (1884)|Conference of Berlin]] of 1884, Portuguese territories in Africa had their borders formally established on request of Portugal in order to protect the centuries-long Portuguese interests in the continent from rivalries enticed by the [[Scramble for Africa]]. Portuguese towns and cities in Africa like [[Nova Lisboa]], [[Lubango|S\u00e1 da Bandeira]], [[Kuito|Silva Porto]], [[Malanje]], [[Tete]], [[Vila Junqueiro]], [[Vila Pery]] and [[Vila Cabral]] were founded or redeveloped inland during this period and beyond. New coastal towns like [[Beira, Mozambique|Beira]], [[Namibe|Mo\u00e7\u00e2medes]], [[Lobito]], [[Jo\u00e3o Belo]], [[Nacala]] and [[Porto Am\u00e9lia]] were also founded. Even before the turn of the 20th century, railway tracks as the [[Benguela railway]] in Angola, and the [[Beira railway]] in Mozambique, started to be built to link coastal areas and selected inland regions.\n\nOther episodes during this period of the Portuguese presence in Africa include the [[1890 British Ultimatum]]. This forced the Portuguese military to retreat from the land between the Portuguese colonies of [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]] (most of present-day [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Zambia]]), which had been claimed by Portugal and included in its \"[[Pink Map]]\", which clashed with British aspirations to create a [[Cape to Cairo Railway]].\n\nThe Portuguese territories in Africa were [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde]], [[Portuguese S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe|S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9 and Pr\u00edncipe]], [[Portuguese Guinea]], [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]], and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]]. The tiny fortress of [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]] on the coast of [[Dahomey]], was also under Portuguese rule. In addition, Portugal still ruled the Asian territories of [[Portuguese India]], [[Portuguese Timor]] and [[Portuguese Macau]].\n\nOn February 1, 1908, King Dom [[Carlos I of Portugal]] and his [[heir apparent]] and his eldest son, [[Luis Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal|Prince Royal Dom Lu\u00eds Filipe]], [[Duke of Braganza]], [[Lisbon Regicide|were assassinated in Lisbon]] in the [[Terreiro do Pa\u00e7o]] by two Portuguese republican activist revolutionaries, [[Alfredo Lu\u00eds da Costa]] and [[Manuel Bu\u00ed\u00e7a]]. Under his rule, Portugal had been declared [[bankrupt]]&nbsp;twice \u2013 first on June 14, 1892, and then again on May 10, 1902&nbsp;\u2013 causing social turmoil, economic disturbances, angry protests, revolts and criticism of the monarchy. His second and youngest son, [[Manuel II of Portugal]], became the new king, but was eventually overthrown by the [[5 October 1910 revolution|5 October 1910 Portuguese republican revolution]], which abolished the monarchy and installed a [[republic]]an government in Portugal, causing him and his royal family to flee into [[exile]] in [[London]], [[England]].\n\n=== First Republic and Estado Novo ===\n[[File:Bernardino Machado, Te\u00f3filo Braga, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida e Afonso Costa, ap\u00f3s uma sess\u00e3o solene do Parlamento em homenagem aos mortos da revolu\u00e7\u00e3o republicana, 1911.png|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Left to right: President [[Bernardino Machado]], President [[Te\u00f3filo Braga]], President [[Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 de Almeida]], and Prime Minister [[Afonso Costa]]; 1911]]\n{{Main|Portuguese First Republic|Estado Novo (Portugal)}}\nThe new republic had many problems. Portugal had 45 different governments in just 15 years. During [[World War I|World War 1]] (1914\u20131918), Portugal helped the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] fight the [[Central Powers]]. But the war hurt its weak economy. Political instability and economic weaknesses were fertile ground for chaos and unrest during the [[Portuguese First Republic]]. These conditions would lead to the failed [[Monarchy of the North]], [[28 May 1926 coup d'\u00e9tat]], and the creation of the National Dictatorship (''[[Ditadura Nacional]]'').\nThis in turn led to the establishment of the right-wing dictatorship of the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] under [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] in 1933.\n\nPortugal remained neutral in [[World War II]].\nFrom the 1940s to the 1960s, Portugal was a founding member of [[NATO]], [[OECD]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] (EFTA). Gradually, new economic development projects and relocation of mainland Portuguese citizens into the overseas provinces in Africa were initiated, with [[Angola (Portugal)|Angola]] and [[Mozambique (Portugal)|Mozambique]], as the largest and richest overseas territories, being the main targets of those initiatives. These actions were used to affirm Portugal's status as a [[List of transcontinental countries|transcontinental]] nation and not as a colonial empire.\n\nAfter India attained independence in 1947, pro-Indian residents of [[Dadra and Nagar Haveli]], with the support of the Indian government and the help of pro-independence organisations, separated the territories of Dadra and Nagar Haveli from Portuguese rule in 1954.<ref name =lele>P S Lele, Dadra and Nagar Haveli: past and present, Published by Usha P. Lele, 1987,</ref> In 1961, [[S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1]]'s annexation by the [[Republic of Dahomey]] was the start of a process that led to the final dissolution of the centuries-old Portuguese Empire.\n[[File:Antonio Salazar-1.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] ruled Portugal from 1932 to 1968, within the [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime.]]\nAccording to the census of 1921 S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o Baptista de Ajud\u00e1 had 5 inhabitants and, at the moment of the ultimatum by the Dahomey Government, it had only 2 inhabitants representing Portuguese Sovereignty.\n\nAnother forcible retreat from overseas territories occurred in December 1961 when Portugal refused to relinquish the territories of [[Goa]], [[Daman and Diu]]. As a result, the Portuguese army and navy were involved in armed conflict in its colony of [[Portuguese India]] against the [[Indian Armed Forces]].\n\nThe [[Operation Vijay (1961)|operations resulted in the defeat]] and surrender of the limited Portuguese defensive garrison, which was forced to surrender to a much larger military force. The outcome was the loss of the remaining Portuguese territories in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. The Portuguese regime refused to recognize Indian sovereignty over the annexed territories, which continued to be represented in Portugal's National Assembly until the military coup of 1974.\n\nAlso in the early 1960s, independence movements in the Portuguese overseas provinces of [[Portuguese Angola|Angola]], [[Portuguese Mozambique|Mozambique]] and [[Portuguese Guinea|Guinea]] in Africa, resulted in the [[Portuguese Colonial War]] (1961\u20131974).\n\nThroughout the colonial war period Portugal had to deal with increasing dissent, arms embargoes and other punitive sanctions imposed by most of the international community. However, the authoritarian and conservative [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Estado Novo]] regime, first installed and governed by [[Ant\u00f3nio de Oliveira Salazar]] and from 1968 onwards led by [[Marcelo Caetano]], tried to preserve a vast centuries-long intercontinental empire with a total area of 2,168,071&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup>.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |title=Portugal N\u00e3o \u00c9 Um Pa\u00eds Pequeno |publisher=Purl.pt |accessdate=21 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20141025060609/http://purl.pt/11440/1/P1.html |archivedate=25 October 2014 }}</ref>\n\n=== Carnation Revolution and European integration ===\n{{Main|Carnation Revolution|Portuguese transition to democracy}}\n[[File:Portuguese colonial war blank map.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|[[Portuguese Africa]] before independence in 1975]]\nThe Portuguese government and army resisted the [[decolonization]] of its overseas territories until April 1974, when a bloodless left-wing military [[coup]] in Lisbon, known as the [[Carnation Revolution]], led the way for the independence of the overseas territories in Africa and Asia, as well as for the restoration of democracy after two years of a transitional period known as PREC (''[[Processo Revolucion\u00e1rio Em Curso]]''). This period was characterized by social turmoil and power disputes between left- and right-wing political forces. The retreat from the overseas territories and the acceptance of its independence terms by Portuguese head representatives for overseas negotiations, which would create independent states in 1975, prompted a mass exodus of Portuguese citizens from Portugal's African territories (mostly from Portuguese [[Overseas Province of Angola|Angola]] and [[Overseas Province of Mozambique|Mozambique]]).<ref>[http://www.economist.com/world/mideast-africa/displayStory.cfm?story_id=12079340 Flight from Angola], ''[[The Economist]]'', 16 August 1975</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,913229-1,00.html Dismantling the Portuguese Empire], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'', 7 July 1975</ref>\n\nOver one million [[White African#Portuguese in Africa|Portuguese refugees]] fled the former Portuguese provinces as white settlers were usually not considered part of the new identities of the former Portuguese colonies in Africa and Asia. [[M\u00e1rio Soares]] and [[Ant\u00f3nio de Almeida Santos]] were charged with organising the independence of Portugal's overseas territories. By 1975, all the Portuguese African territories were independent and Portugal held [[1975 Portuguese Constituent Assembly election|its first democratic elections]] in 50 years.\n\nPortugal continued to be governed by a [[Junta de Salva\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional]] until the [[1976 Portuguese legislative election|Portuguese legislative election of 1976]]. It was won by the [[Socialist Party (Portugal)|Portuguese Socialist Party]] (PS) and M\u00e1rio Soares, its leader, became Prime Minister of the 1st Constitutional Government on 23 July. M\u00e1rio Soares would be Prime Minister from 1976 to 1978 and again from 1983 to 1985. In this capacity Soares tried to resume the economic growth and development record that had been achieved before the Carnation Revolution, during the last decade of the previous regime. He initiated the process of accession to the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) by starting accession negotiations as early as 1977.\n[[File:Portugese minister Soares (voorzitter Socialistische Partij) op Schiphol aangeko, Bestanddeelnr 927-7110.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|[[M\u00e1rio Soares]] became Portugal's first democratically elected Prime-Minister in 1976.]]\nPortugal bounced between [[socialism]] and adherence to the [[neoliberal]] model. [[Land reform]] and [[nationalization]]s were enforced; the [[Portuguese Constitution]] (approved in 1976) was rewritten in order to accommodate socialist and communist principles. Until the constitutional revisions of 1982 and 1989, the constitution was a document with numerous references to socialism, the rights of workers, and the desirability of a [[socialist economy]]. Portugal's economic situation after its transition to democracy, obliged the government to pursue [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF)-monitored stabilization programs in 1977\u201378 and 1983\u201385.\n\nIn 1986, Portugal joined the [[European Economic Community]] (EEC) that later became the European Union (EU). In the following years Portugal's economy progressed considerably as a result of EEC/EU [[structural and cohesion funds]] and Portuguese companies' easier access to foreign markets.\n\nPortugal's last overseas and Asian colonial territory, [[Macau]], was peacefully handed over to the [[China|People's Republic of China (PRC)]] on December 20, 1999, under the 1987 joint declaration that set the terms for Macau's handover from Portugal to the PRC. In 2002, the independence of [[East Timor]] (Asia) was formally recognized by Portugal, after an incomplete decolonization process that was started in 1975 because of the Carnation Revolution, but interrupted by an [[Indonesia]]n armed invasion and [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor|occupation]].\n[[File:Tratado de Lisboa 13 12 2007 (081).jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|The [[Treaty of Lisbon]] was signed in 2007, when Portugal held the presidency for the [[European Council]].]]\nOn 26 March 1995, Portugal started to implement [[Schengen Area]] rules, eliminating border controls with other Schengen members while simultaneously strengthening border controls with non-member states. In 1996 the country was a co-founder of the [[Community of Portuguese Language Countries]] (CPLP) headquartered in Lisbon. In 1996, [[Jorge Sampaio]] became president. He won [[2001 Portuguese presidential election|re-election]] in January 2001. [[Expo '98]] took place in Portugal and in 1999 it was one of the founding countries of the [[euro]] and the [[eurozone]]. On July 5, 2004, [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Barroso]], then [[Prime Minister of Portugal]], was nominated [[President of the European Commission]], the most powerful office in the European Union. On 1 December 2009, the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] entered into force, after it had been signed by the European Union member states on 13 December 2007 in the [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]], in Lisbon, enhancing the efficiency and democratic legitimacy of the Union and improving the coherence of its action. The [[Republic of Ireland]] was the only EU state to hold a democratic referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. It was initially rejected by voters in 2008.\n\nEconomic disruption and an unsustainable growth in [[government debt]] during the [[financial crisis of 2007\u20132008]] led the country to negotiate in 2011 with the IMF and the European Union, through the [[European Financial Stability Mechanism]] (EFSM) and the [[European Financial Stability Facility]] (EFSF), a loan to help the country stabilise its finances.\n\n== Geography ==\n<!-- If you want to expand this section, please add new info into the main articles: \"Geography of Portugal\" and \"Protected areas of Portugal\", your work there will be very appreciated. -->\n{{Main|Geography of Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 200\n | footer =\n | image1 = Portugal topographic map-pt.png\n | caption1 = Topography and administration.\n }}\nThe territory of Portugal includes an area in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] (referred to as ''the continent'' by most Portuguese) and two archipelagos in the Atlantic Ocean: the archipelagos of Madeira and the Azores.

Some of these rare and specific species are highly endangered because of habitat loss, pollution and drought. Up-welling along the west coast of Portugal makes the sea extremely rich in nutrients and diverse species of marine fish; the Portuguese marine waters are one of the richest in the world.

Elected by universal suffrage according to a system of [[Closed list|closed]] [[party-list proportional representation]], deputies serve four-year terms of office, unless the President dissolves the Assembly and calls for new elections.\n\nCurrently the Government ([[Socialist Party (Portugal)|PS]]) and the parties supporting it through a [[Confidence and supply|confidence-and-supply agreement]] ([[Left Bloc|BE]], [[Portuguese Communist Party|PCP]], [[Ecologist Party \"The Greens\"|PEV]]) control parliament with the most seats.

The main laws include the Constitution (1976, as amended), the [[Portuguese Civil Code]] (1966, as amended) and the [[Penal Code of Portugal]] (1982, as amended). Other relevant laws are the ''Commercial Code'' (1888, as amended) and the ''Civil Procedure Code'' (1961, as amended).\n\nThe supreme national courts are the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Portugal)|Supreme Court of Justice]] and the [[Constitutional Court of Portugal|Constitutional Court]]. The [[Public Ministry (Portugal)|Public Ministry]], headed by the Attorney General of the Republic, constitutes the independent body of public prosecutors.\n\nPortuguese laws were applied in the former [[Portuguese colonies|colonies and territories]] and continue to be major influences for those countries.\n\nPortugal was the first country in the world to abolish [[life imprisonment]] (in 1884) and was one of the first countries to [[Capital punishment in Portugal|abolish the death penalty]]. Maximum jail sentences are limited to 25 years.\n\nPortugal is also known for having decriminalized the usage of all common drugs in 2001, the first country in the world to do so. Portugal decriminalized possession of effectively all drugs that are still illegal in other developed nations including [[cannabis]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], and [[LSD]]. While possession is legal, trafficking and possession of more than \"10 days worth of personal use\" are still punishable by jail time and fines. People caught with small amounts of any drug are given the choice to go to a rehab facility, and may refuse treatment without consequences. Despite criticism from other European nations, who stated Portugal's drug consumption would tremendously increase, overall drug use has declined along with the number of [[HIV]] infection cases, which had dropped 50 percent by 2009. Drug use among 16- to 18-year-olds also declined, however the use of marijuana rose only slightly among that age group.<ref>Brian Vastag [http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=portugal-drug-decriminalization 5 Years After: Portugal's Drug Decriminalization Policy Shows Positive Results].

New programmes combine wind and water: wind-driven turbines pump water uphill at night, the most blustery period; then the water flows downhill by day, generating electricity, when consumer demand is highest. Portugal's distribution system is also now a two-way street. Instead of just delivering electricity, it draws electricity from even the smallest generators, like rooftop solar panels. The government aggressively encouraged such contributions by setting a premium price for those who buy rooftop-generated solar electricity.\n\n== Demographics ==\n{{Main|Demographics of Portugal|}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align = left\n | width =\n | image1 = Viana_do_Castelo,_Portugal_(4922364383).jpg\n | image2 = Fado1 - Fadistas a los Jeronimos.JPG\n | footer = Young people in traditional attire from [[Minho (province)|Minho]] (top) and [[Fado|fadistas]] playing at [[Jer\u00f3nimos Monastery]] (bottom)\n }}\nThe Statistics Portugal ({{lang-pt|INE \u2013 [[Instituto Nacional de Estat\u00edstica]]}}) estimates that, according to the 2011 census, the population was 10,562,178 (of which 52% was female, 48% was male). In 2018 and according to more up-to-date figures, the population decreased to 10,276,617.<ref name=\"auto2\"/> This population has been relatively homogeneous for most of its history: a single religion (Roman Catholicism) and a single language have contributed to this ethnic and national unity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Portugal.html |title=Portugal |publisher=Jewishvirtuallibrary.org |accessdate=6 May 2012}}</ref>\nMinorities of ''Crist\u00e3os Novos'' (New Christians) nevertheless, stayed in Portugal after converting to Catholicism. A very small number of former Jews may have continued to observe rabbinic Judaism in secret over many generations, namely the [[History of the Jews in Belmonte|Jews of Belmonte]], a town in the interior; where people now observe the [[Jewish]] faith openly. Some famous Portuguese New Christians were the mathematician [[Pedro Nunes]] and the physician and naturalist [[Garcia de Orta]]. Another interesting demographic feature relates to the Scandinavian expansion towards the West and strong activity in Northern Portugal where some coastline communities kept [[Scandinavia]]n ancestry in [[Aveiro District|Aveiro]], [[Porto District|Porto]] and [[Braga District|Braga]] regions.\n\nThe most important demographic influence in the modern Portuguese seems to be the oldest one; current interpretation of [[Y-chromosome]] and [[mtDNA]] data suggests that the Portuguese have their origin in [[Paleolithic]] peoples that began arriving to the European continent around 45,000 years ago. All subsequent migrations did leave an impact, genetically and culturally, but the main population source of the Portuguese is still Paleolithic. Genetic studies show Portuguese populations not to be significantly different from other European populations.<ref>{{Cite journal | pmc=1852743 | year=2007 | last1=Bauchet | first1=M | last2=McEvoy | first2=B | last3=Pearson | first3=LN | last4=Quillen | first4=EE | last5=Sarkisian | first5=T | last6=Hovhannesyan | first6=K | last7=Deka | first7=R | last8=Bradley | first8=DG | last9=Shriver | first9=MD | title=Measuring European Population Stratification with Microarray Genotype Data | volume=80 | issue=5 | pages=948\u2013956 | journal=American Journal of Human Genetics | doi=10.1086/513477 | pmid=17436249 }}</ref> Portuguese people have a preponderancy of genetics (Iron Age Period)<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.eupedia.com/europe/autosomal_maps_dodecad.shtml|title=Eupedia Autosomal Maps|last=|first=|date=|website=Eupedia.com|access-date=}}</ref> which belong to R1b haplogroup family along with [[Brittonic languages|Brythonic]], [[Alpine states|Alpine]] and [[Goidelic languages|Goidelic]] genetical markers.

These maritime contacts and the prevalence of R1b haplogroup as the main genetical marker of these countries suggest a common ancestry and cultural proximity.

This emerging height gap took place in the 1840s and has increased since. One of the driving factors was the modest real wage development, given the late industrialization and economic growth in Portugal compared to the European core.

The [[University of Coimbra|oldest Portuguese university]]<ref> https://www.topuniversities.com/universities/university-coimbra </ref> was first established in Lisbon before moving to [[Coimbra]]. Historically, within the scope of the Portuguese Empire, the Portuguese founded the oldest engineering school of the [[Americas]] (the ''[[Real Academia de Artilharia, Fortifica\u00e7\u00e3o e Desenho]]'' of [[Rio de Janeiro]]) in 1792, as well as the oldest medical college in Asia (the ''[[Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica de Goa|Escola M\u00e9dico-Cir\u00fargica]]'' of [[Goa]]) in 1842. Presently, the largest university in Portugal is the [[University of Lisbon]].\n\nThe [[Bologna process]] has been adopted by Portuguese universities and poly-technical institutes in 2006. Higher education in state-run educational establishments is provided on a competitive basis, a system of ''[[numerus clausus]]'' is enforced through a national database on student admissions. However, every higher education institution offers also a number of additional vacant places through other extraordinary admission processes for sportsmen, mature applicants (over 23 years old), [[international students]], foreign students from the [[Lusosphere]], degree owners from other institutions, students from other institutions ([[Transfer admissions in the United States|academic transfer]]), former students (readmission), and course change, which are subject to specific standards and regulations set by each institution or course department.\n\nMost student costs are supported with public money. However, with the increasing tuition fees a student has to pay to attend a Portuguese state-run higher education institution and the attraction of new types of students (many as part-time students or in evening classes) like employees, businessmen, parents, and pensioners, many departments make a substantial profit from every additional student enrolled in courses, with benefits for the college or university's gross tuition revenue and without loss of educational quality (teacher per student, computer per student, classroom size per student, etc.).\n\nPortugal has entered into [[Higher education in Portugal#International partnership agreements|cooperation agreements with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and other US institutions]] to further develop and increase the effectiveness of Portuguese higher education and research.\n\n=== Health ===\n{{Main|Health in Portugal}}\n{{multiple image\n | direction = vertical\n | align    = right\n | image1 = Miragaia-Rua do Prof. Vicente Jose de Carvalho-Hospital Sto.

The SNS provides universal coverage. In addition, about 25% of the population is covered by the health subsystems, 10% by private insurance schemes and another 7% by mutual funds.\n\nThe Ministry of Health is responsible for developing health policy as well as managing the SNS.\nFive regional health administrations are in charge of implementing the national health policy objectives, developing guidelines and protocols and supervising health care delivery. Decentralization efforts have aimed at shifting financial and management responsibility to the regional level. In practice, however, the autonomy of regional health administrations over budget setting and spending has been limited to primary care.\n\nThe SNS is predominantly funded through general taxation. Employer (including the state) and employee contributions represent the main funding sources of the health subsystems. In addition, direct payments by the patient and voluntary health insurance premiums account for a large proportion of funding.\n[[File:FCM-UNL.JPG|thumb|left|The Medical Department of the [[Universidade Nova de Lisboa]]]]\nSimilar to the other Eur-A countries, most Portuguese die from [[noncommunicable diseases]]. Mortality from [[cardiovascular diseases]] (CVD) is higher than in the [[eurozone]], but its two main components, ischaemic heart disease and cerebrovascular disease, display inverse trends compared with the Eur-A, with [[cerebrovascular disease]] being the single biggest killer in Portugal (17%). Portuguese people die 12% less often from cancer than in the Eur-A, but mortality is not declining as rapidly as in the Eur-A. Cancer is more frequent among children as well as among women younger than 44 years. Although lung cancer (slowly increasing among women) and breast cancer (decreasing rapidly) are scarcer, cervical cancer and prostate cancer are more frequent.\nPortugal has the highest mortality rate for diabetes in the Eur-A, with a sharp increase since the 1980s.\n\nPortugal's [[infant mortality rate]] is around 2 deaths per 1000 newborns, with 2.4 deaths per 1000 live births.\n\nPeople are usually well informed about their health status, the positive and negative effects of their behaviour on their health, and their use of health care services. Yet their perceptions of their health, can differ from what administrative and examination-based data show about levels of illness within populations. Thus, survey results based on self-reporting at household level, complement other data on health status and the use of services.\n\nOnly one third of adults rated their health as good or very good in Portugal (Kasmel et al., 2004). This is the lowest of the Eur-A countries reporting and reflects the relatively adverse situation of the country in terms of mortality and selected morbidity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |title=Highlights on health in Portugal 2004 |accessdate=25 February 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091201122536/http://www.euro.who.int/document/chh/por_highlights.pdf |archivedate=1 December 2009 }}.

Two other popular fish recipes are grilled [[sardines]] and [[caldeirada]], a tomato-based [[stew]] that can be made from several types of fish with a mix of onion, garlic, peppers, potatoes, tomatoes, parsley or [[coriander]]. Typical Portuguese meat recipes made out of beef, pork, lamb, goat or chicken include ''[[cozido \u00e0 portuguesa]]'', ''[[feijoada]]'', ''[[frango de churrasco]]'', ''leit\u00e3o'' (roast [[suckling pig]]), ''[[chanfana]]'' and ''[[carne de porco \u00e0 alentejana]]''. A very popular northern dish is [[dobrada]], a tripe with white beans and carrots stew, often served with steamed white rice.  [[Piri-piri]] chicken is a spicy charcoal chicken dish served with rice and vegetables, a favourite throughout Portugal, but most common in the [[Algarve]] region.\n[[File: MargaretCafe PasteisDeNata.JPG|thumb|right|Pasteis de Nata in [[Lisboa]]]]\nTypical fast food dishes include the [[Francesinha]] (Frenchie) from Porto, \"Tripas \u00e0 moda do Porto\" which is also a traditional plate from Porto, and ''bifanas'' (grilled pork) or ''prego'' (grilled beef) [[sandwich]]es, which are well known around the country. The Portuguese art of [[pastry]] has its origins in the many [[medieval]] Catholic monasteries spread widely across the country. These monasteries, using very few ingredients (mostly almonds, [[vanilla]], [[cinnamon]], flour, eggs and some liquor), managed to create a spectacular wide range of different pastries, of which [[past\u00e9is de Bel\u00e9m]] (or ''past\u00e9is de nata'') originally from Lisbon, and ''[[ovos moles]]'' from Aveiro are examples. Portuguese cuisine is very diverse, with different regions having their own traditional dishes. The Portuguese have a culture of good food, and throughout the country there are myriads of good restaurants and typical small ''tasquinhas''.\n\nPortuguese wines have enjoyed international recognition since the times of the Romans, who associated Portugal with their god [[Dionysus|Bacchus]]. Today, the country is known by wine lovers and its wines have won several international prizes. Some of the best Portuguese wines are [[Vinho Verde]], [[Vinho Alvarinho]], [[Vinho do Douro]], [[Vinho do Alentejo]], [[Vinho do D\u00e3o]], [[Vinho da Bairrada]] and the sweet [[Port Wine]], [[Madeira Wine]], and the [[Moscatel]] from [[Set\u00fabal]] and [[Favaios]].

Within Portuguese folk music is the renowned genre of [[Fado]], a melancholic urban music originated in [[Lisbon]] in the 19th century, probably inside bohemian environments, usually associated with the [[Portuguese guitar]] and ''saudade'', or longing. [[Coimbra fado]], a unique type of \"[[troubadour]] serenading\" fado, is also noteworthy.

Out of the summer season, Portugal has a large number of festivals, designed more to an urban audience, like Flowfest or Hip Hop Porto. Furthermore, one of the largest international [[Goa trance]] festivals takes place in central Portugal every two years, the Boom Festival, that is also the only festival in Portugal to win international awards: European Festival Award 2010 \u2013 Green'n'Clean Festival of the Year and the Greener Festival Award Outstanding 2008 and 2010.
