It also serves [[Abstatt]], [[Bad Rappenau]], [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Beilstein (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Beilstein]], [[Brackenheim]], [[Cleebronn]], [[Eberstadt (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Eberstatt]], [[Ellhofen]], [[Eppingen]], [[Flein]], [[Gemmingen]], [[G\u00fcglingen]], [[Ilsfeld]], [[Ittlingen]], [[Kirchardt]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]], [[Lehrensteinsfeld]], [[Leingarten]], [[L\u00f6wenstein]], [[Massenbachhausen]], [[Neckarwestheim]], [[Nordheim (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Nordheim]], [[Obersulm]], [[Pfaffenhofen (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Pfaffenhofen]], [[Schwaigern]], [[Siegelsbach]], [[Talheim, Neckar|Talheim]], [[Untergruppenbach]], [[Weinsberg]], [[W\u00fcstenrot]], and [[Zaberfeld]] as a regional economic centre.\n\n===Neighboring communities===\nHeilbronn shares a border with the following cities and towns, all part of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn County]] and listed here clockwise from the North: [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Neckarsulm]], [[Erlenbach (Landkreis Heilbronn)|Erlenbach]], [[Weinsberg]], [[Lehrensteinsfeld]], [[Untergruppenbach]], [[Flein]], [[Talheim, Neckar|Talheim]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]], [[Nordheim (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Nordheim]], [[Leingarten]], [[Schwaigern]], [[Massenbachhausen]] and [[Bad Rappenau]].\n\n===Boroughs===\nThe city is divided into nine [[borough]]s: \n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 001: Heilbronn itself\n* 002: B\u00f6ckingen\n* 003: Neckargartach\n* 004: Sontheim\n* 005: Klingenberg\n| valign=\"top\" | \n* 006: [[Heilbronn-Frankenbach|Frankenbach]]\n* 007: Kirchhausen\n* 008: Biberach\n* 009: Horkheim\n|}\n\n==History==\n\n===Up to AD 1200===\nThe oldest traces of humans in and around Heilbronn date back to the [[Old Stone Age]] (30,000 BC). The fertile Neckar floodplains in the Heilbronn basin aided early settlement by farmers and ranchers. The city limits of present-day Heilbronn contain many sites of [[Bronze Age]] finds. Later on, but still before AD, the [[Celt]]s already mined here for salt from brine.\n\nUnder [[Roman Emperor]] [[Domitian]] (AD 81\u201396) the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] pushed east away from the [[Rhine]] and the outer boundary of the [[Roman Empire]] was set at the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]]. A [[castle]] in today's borough of B\u00f6ckingen was part of that ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'', and nearby numerous Roman villas and plantations were built. Around AD 150, the Neckar-Odenwald Limes became obsolete when the boundary of the Roman Empire was moved approximately {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east, where it was subsequently fortified with the construction of the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] complete with [[parapet]] and [[trench]]es.\n\nAround 260, the Romans surrendered the limes, and the [[Alamanni]] became rulers of the Neckar basin. Between the 4th and 7th centuries, the area became part of the [[Frankish Empire]], and the first settlement was built in the general vicinity of the present center of town.\n\nIn 741 Heilbronn is first mentioned in an official document of the [[Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg]] as ''villa Helibrunna'' (together with a ''Michaelsbasilica''), and in 841, King [[Louis the German]] set up court here for a period of time. The name ''Heilbrunna'' (''healing well'') hints to a well that is located not far from the basilica. In 1050 a significant settlement of [[Jews]] is noted in official documents, and the Codex of the monastery in [[Hirsau]] documented Heilbronn's right to hold market days and mint coins, mentioning its harbor and vineyards as well. The name of the city became a widespread [[Jewish surname]] in many varieties, see [[Heilprin]] and [[Halperin]].\n\n===1200\u20131500===\n[[File:DeutschHof HN.JPG|thumb|The ''Deutschhof''.]]\nIn 1225 Heilbronn was incorporated into the [[Hohenstaufen]] Empire as ''oppidum Heilecbrunnen''. ''Oppidum'' signified a city fortified by [[parapet]] and [[trench]]es. Later during the 13th century, the [[Teutonic Knights]] obtained ownership of a large area south of Heilbronn which would remain owned by that order until [[German Mediatisation]] in 1805. Starting in 1268, the order built the ''Deutschhof'' there as one of its residences. The church building of the order that was located on the premises was modified and expanded several times: First in 1350 it was expanded ([[gothic architecture|Gothic]]), then it was remodeled in 1719 ([[Baroque]]), and in 1977, it was consecrated as a cathedral.\n\nAfter the demise of the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty, King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf I]] returned city status to Heilbronn in 1281 and installed a regal advocate to rule the city. In addition to the advocate he put a council in place that was headed up by a mayor. Around 1300, the first city hall was erected in the market place and the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (built on the foundation of the Michaelsbasilica) was expanded. The Neckar privilege gave the city the right to modify the flow of the river in 1333, which meant it now had the right to construct dams, harbors and mills. Because of the infrastructure thus created, during the 14th century Heilbronn grew attractive to merchants and craftspeople, who now demanded the right to determine their own fate.\n\nIn 1371 [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], issued a new charter to the city. Now Heilbronn needed to answer only to the Emperor and as such was an [[Imperial Free City]]. Craftspeople and merchants were now represented in its council and the villages of B\u00f6ckingen, [[Flein]], [[Frankenbach]] and Neckargartach became part of Heilbronn's territory.\n\nAs an Imperial Free City Heilbronn was threatened by the ambitious House of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]. A relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor and a treaty with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in effect from 1417 to 1622 strengthened Heilbronn's position and kept the House of W\u00fcrttemberg at bay. The political stability enjoyed by the city during the 15th century enabled it to expand, and many of its historic structures, such as the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (1455\u201360), trace their origins to that era.\n\n===1500\u20131700===\n[[File:Heilbronn Bollwerksturm 20050828.jpg|left|thumb|160px|''Bollwerksturm'']]\n\n[[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] spent three years in \"knightly custody\" in Heilbronn starting in 1519 and even spent a night in the tower of the bastion. That same year people first took note of the pub owner [[J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach]] who with accomplices would later kill the executor of B\u00f6ckingen. After he had spent some time in the [[Hohenlohe Plains]] and collected similarly minded characters around him, he returned to Heilbronn in April 1525 just as the [[German Peasants' War]] was getting into full swing. On April 16 the peasants killed many of the nobles in Weinsberg and on April 18 the Heilbronn cloister of the [[Carmelites|Order of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel]] was attacked and ransacked. The city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day. For about a month Heilbronn remained under the control of rebellious peasants. And even though [[Johann Lachmann]], later a church reformer, had attempted to mediate, the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on May 12, 1525 in [[B\u00f6blingen]]. Their leader Rohrbach was executed on May 21, 1525 in Neckargartach and his home town of B\u00f6ckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment.\n\nIn 1528, the replacement of the mayor by [[Hans Riesser]], a Protestant, brought on the previously delayed [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and through the efforts of Reformer Lachmann schools and healthcare were also reorganized. In 1529 the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (church tower of the Kilianskirche) was completed. It was the first important religious building of the [[Renaissance]] in Germany. The year 1530 brought about the acceptance of the [[Augsburg Confession]] by city council and residents and the ''Heilbronn Catechism'' of 1536 is the second oldest catechism in the Protestant Church. In 1538 Heilbronn joined the [[Schmalkaldic League]] but by 1546 squabbles between troops of the Schmalkaldic League and those of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] escalated into battles that were won by the Emperor. As a result, Charles V spent Christmas 1546 in Heilbronn to attend the ensuing criminal proceedings. It is also Charles V who in 1522 changed the charter of the city and this charter survived almost unscathed until 1803.\n\n[[File:Heilbronn 1643 von Matthaeus Merian.jpg|thumb|Heilbronn in 1643. Engraving by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]]]]\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the city and surrounding villages suffered badly. After the [[battle of Wimpfen]] in 1622, Neckargartach was burnt to the ground. In 1631 Heilbronn was occupied by imperial troops but the same year the Swedes succeeded in conquering the city. From 1644 through 1647, Heilbronn was again part of the Holy Roman Empire, but then French troops moved in and later those of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The city was not free of occupying forces until four years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. But already in the 1670s the city again became the stage for armed manoeuvres, until it was occupied by French troops in 1688. But while that occupation of the city only lasted several months, the French were only persuaded to leave the surrounding areas in 1693, after a large defensive army had been put into the field and fortifications had been erected.\n\n===1700\u20131900===\n[[File:K\u00e4thchenHaus HN02.JPG|thumb|''K\u00e4thchenhaus'']]\nDuring the 18th century, archives suggest all members of the city council enjoyed some sort of formal education; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] came to visit; and elaborate buildings were being constructed in the [[Rococo]] style.\n\nOn September 9, 1802, Heilbronn lost its status as an Imperial Free City when the troops of Duke [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Friedrich I]] of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] arrived. The duke had conceded the left bank of the Rhine to France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] but had been compensated with areas on the right bank. This is how Heilbronn and other former Imperial Free Cities became part of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1803. Heilbronn became the seat of an ''Oberamt'' (district), and the four Imperial Free villages became separate communities within the district. In 1806 the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg became the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n[[File:Heilbronn Stadtplan 1858-2.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Heilbronn, 1858]]\nIn 1815, Heilbronn again became a staging area for major armies ahead of the campaign against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and 10,000 troops paraded in front of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz of Austria]] and more than one hundred German princes and generals in the ''Theresienwiese''. [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]] met in Heilbronn with the [[Baltic German|Baltic]] Baroness [[Barbara Juliana, Baroness von Kr\u00fcdener|Juliane]] von [[Barony of Kr\u00fcdener|Kr\u00fcdener]], who talked him into founding the \"[[Holy Alliance]]\".\n\n[[Industrialization]] arrived in 1820. When the first train lines were placed in service in W\u00fcrttemberg, Heilbronn was at the end of the line of the northern branch that connected Heilbronn with [[Stuttgart]] and further fueled industrialization.\n\nFor a while Heilbronn suffered from the upheavals of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Baden Revolution]] that its civil guard participated in. During that time the 8th infantry regiment switched sides and joined the revolutionaries until it was subsequently disarmed and force-transferred out of the area.\n\nIn 1849 was founded the [[Hoerner Bank]], one of the oldest still functioning banks in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hoernerbank.de/hoerner-bank-ag\n|title=Hoerner Bank AG\n|accessdate=10 March 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nHeilbronn became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]].\n\nIn the 1860s the city's train tracks were extended to [[Heidelberg]] via [[Bad Wimpfen]], to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] via [[Osterburken]], and to [[Crailsheim]] (and later on to [[Nuremberg]]) via [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]]. In 1880, the [[Kraichgau]] line was completed and created an important connection towards [[Karlsruhe]], and by the end of the 19th century, Heilbronn had become an important hub, second in Wuerttemburg to Stuttgart in industrial output.\n\nThe year 1892 brought a connection to the power plant in Lauffen; thus Heilbronn became the first city in the world to enjoy long distance electric power.\n\n===1900\u20131945===\n[[File:Stadtgemeinde Heilbronn 1923.JPG|thumb|Bond of the Municipality Heilbronn, issued 10. April 1923]]\n[[File:Heilbronn ca. April 1945.jpg|thumb|Ruins in Heilbronn in 1945.]]\nWith the dissolution of monarchy in the [[German Reich]] as a result of World War I, Heilbronn became part of the [[Free People's State of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1918.\n\nAfter almost a century of economic boom and growth of the local industry Heilbronn's citizenry included many labourers. The city came to be known as a \"red hot spot\"''';''' numerous worker and sports clubs were begun. Already prior to World War I the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] cornered the majority of the vote and stayed that course during the [[Weimar Republic]]. At his visit to the city on May 15, 1926, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was clearly not welcome by everyone, and several people were injured when a man was mistaken for Hitler and attacked. Hitler himself was able to give his speech in the city's community center ''Harmonie'', but the SPD had the majority in Heilbronn over the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] as late as the elections on March 5, 1933.\n\n[[Richard Drauz]], who had been born into a respected Heilbronn family, became Heilbronn's NSDAP [[Kreisleiter]] (District Leader) in 1932 . He was also elected to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] from 1933 on and pushed hard for the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' of the Heilbronn clubs and press in [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nOn July 28, 1935, the port was opened in a canal off the Neckar, and 1936 saw the [[Autobahn]] between Heilbronn and Stuttgart completed. Economy and infrastructure were booming in W\u00fcrttemberg, and Heilbronn was at the logistic centre of it all. As the result of a district reform on October 1, 1938, Heilbronn became the seat of the newly created [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn County]] and regained independent city status. At the same time the previously independent communities of B\u00f6ckingen, Sontheim, and Neckargartach were annexed, and with 72,000 residents Heilbronn then was the second largest city in W\u00fcrttemberg. The port turned into an important transfer station on the Neckar and one of the ten largest interior ports in the country.\n\nOn November 10, 1938, the Heilbronn [[synagogue]] was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]]. Soon thereafter the [[Jew]]ish community was all but eliminated.\n\nStarting in 1942 during World War II, the salt mines in and around Heilbronn were used to store art and artifacts from Germany, France, and Italy. Similarly, important producers of the war industry were moved into the [[Shaft mining|mine shafts]]. The expansion of the shafts was undertaken by labour brigades of the [[concentration camp]] branches in Kochendorf and Neckargartach. From Heilbronn all the way to [[Neckarelz]] numerous subterraneous complexes, some of them gigantic, were constructed''';''' on November 20, 1942, the Heilbronn Bureau of Labour had 8,000 forced labourers registered in its district.\n\nIn 1940 [[Bombings of Heilbronn in World War II|allied air raids]] began, and the city and its surrounding area were hit about 20 times with minor damage. On September 10, 1944, a raid by the allies targeted the city specifically, in particular the B\u00f6ckingen train transfer station. As a result of 1,168 bombs dropped that day, 281 residents died. The city was carpet-bombed from the southern quarter all the way to the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] in the center of town. The church was burnt out.\n\nAfter a [[Battle of Heilbronn (1945)|ten-day battle]], with the allies advancing over the strategically important [[Neckar]] crossings, the war ended for the destroyed city, and it was occupied by the U.S. Army on April 12, 1945. Local NSDAP leader [[Richard Drauz|Drauz]] became a fugitive because of executions of American prisoners of war he had ordered in March 1945. He was eventually arrested, tried, and hanged by the Allies in [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]] on December 4, 1946.\n\n===Since World War II===\n[[File:StadtTheater HN01.JPG|thumb|''Stadttheater'' Heilbronn.]]\nAfter the war, Emil Beutinger, mayor until 1933, returned to office and began the formidable task of reconstruction that was subsequently continued by his successors [[Paul Metz]] and Paul Meyle. Milestones were the rededication of historic city hall in 1953 and the reopening of the community centre, ''Harmonie''. Heilbronn was part of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] until 1952, after which it became part of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n\nAfter 1951, US troops were permanently stationed in Heilbronn. They used barracks built prior to World War II and added some structures of their own.\n\nThe opening of the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] from Heilbronn to [[Mannheim]] in 1968 was an important economic event. When the [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] to [[Nuremberg]] was completed in 1974 and 1979, respectively, Heilbronn became an important logistical centre in southern Germany. As a result, many large companies opened offices in Heilbronn.\n\nWhen Klingenberg became part of Heilbronn on January 1, 1970, the city's population exceeded 100,000 for the first time; thus Heilbronn attained \"major city\" (''Gro\u00dfstadt'') status. During the last district reform in the 1970s, Kirchhausen, Biberach, Frankenbach and Horkheim were incorporated into Heilbronn, and the city was reconfirmed as independent city and seat of Heilbronn County. It was also declared seat of the newly formed Franken region, now Heilbronn-Franken.\n\nAlso during the 1970s, the centre of the city was transformed into a [[pedestrian zone]] and the rededication of the city theatre in 1982 closed one of the largest holes left in the inner city from World War II.\n\nPursuant to the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] of 1979, [[Pershing II]] intermediate-range [[nuclear missiles]] were stationed just uphill of Heilbronn in the Waldheide. This made Heilbronn the only major city in Germany with atomic missiles inside its city limits \u2014 a fact that became front-page news during the missile accident on January 11, 1985. After the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] was signed in 1987, the missiles were removed .\n\nIn the 1980s, Heilbronn hosted ''Heimatttage'' and ''Landesgartenschau'' staged by the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1998, Heilbronn was connected to the S-Bahn net with Karlsruhe. This further transformed the city centre, and an extension of the S-Bahn towards [[\u00d6hringen]] opened on December 10, 2005, marking the completion of the east-west axis of the Baden-Wuerttemburg regional transportation system. The north-south axis was in the planning stages as of February 2006.\n\nHeilbronn won the European competition \"Entente Florale 2000\" on September 9, 2000, in Broughshane, Northern Ireland, and in 2005\u201306 the city became the first [[UNICEF]] children's city in Germany.\n\nLate in 2005, Heilbronn was chosen to host the [[Bundesgartenschau]] in 2019. An entire new borough along the S-Bahn line B\u00f6ckingen\u2013Theresienwiese\u2013Neckargartach is planned.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Heilbronn Kilianskirche 20050828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[St. Kilian's Church, Heilbronn]], as seen from the Kiliansplatz]]\nEver since the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Chlodwig]] settled in the Neckar region around 500 the area has been predominantly [[Christians|Christian]] and when Heilbronn was first mentioned in an official document in 741 Christian Michaelsbasilica, present day's [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]], was mentioned along with the city. The [[Teutonic Knights]] constructed its church from the 13th century and both churches were continually expanded. They were joined later by other churches and cloisters in the city.\n\nAround 1050 an important Jewish community was mentioned that had settled in what became known as the ''Judengasse'' (''Lohtorstra\u00dfe''). In 1298, 143 Jews were killed during the [[Rintfleisch-Pogrom]] and in 1350 Jews suffered attacks again during a European [[epidemic]] of the [[Bubonic plague]]. The city's constitution required the council to include Jews, but already in the middle of the 15th century Jews were the target of vigilantes again until they were evicted from the city in 1490 with the blessings of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]].\n\nIt is worth noting that the common Jewish name Halpern, and many variants such as Alpert, derive from the name of this city Heilbronn, and the early Jewish community there.\n\nWhile Heilbronn was part of the [[Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg]], the independent villages of B\u00f6ckingen, Neckargartach and Frankenbach were attached to the [[Diocese of Worms]]. From 1514 on the Heilbronn native Johann Lachmann was caretaker of the parish in St. Kilian, in 1521 he became its preacher, in 1524 he converted to [[Lutheranism]] and proceeded to teach and lead the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Heilbronn against the wishes of both dioceses. After the [[Protestant reformation]] of Heilbronn was complete the city remained Lutheran for centuries and the council and citizens accepted the [[Augsburg Confession]] without dissent. Catholics were no longer welcome, Jews were prohibited from settling in Heilbronn, and the city took part in the [[Protestation at Speyer]] on April 19, 1529 (the Protestation was the origin of the terms Protestant and Protestantism).\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]] brought Heilbronn freedom of religion. From 1803 Jews were again permitted to settle in the city, Catholics also began to move back in and by the 1860s Jews were granted equal rights as Heilbronn citizens.\n\nAfter the city became part of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1803 it also became seat of a deaconry and the [[Prelate]] or regional bishop of the Protestant State Church in W\u00fcrttemberg. To this day Protestants are in the majority in Heilbronn. The Catholic parishes belong to the Deacony Heilbronn and are part of the [[Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]].\n\nAround 1920 first groups of \"Serious Bible Students\" (now: [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]) formed. Their small community suffered from oppression during the [[Third Reich]] and many of its members died in [[concentration camps]]. Similarly, the Jewish community had to watch as its colossal [[synagogue]] went up in flames and its 350 members were subsequently all but extinguished. Jehovah's Witnesses built a first meeting room in Heilbronn in 1953 and many more have been added since then.\n\n[[File:Heilbronn Rathausuhr 20050828.jpg|thumb|200px|Astronomical clock at City Hall.]]\n\nSince the 1970s, after guest workers and immigrants from [[Islam]]ic or [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian-Orthodox]] countries settled here, these faiths are practiced by a growing part of the population and numerous mosques have been created since the 1990s in the city and county of Heilbronn.\n\n===District reform===\nOver the years, the following, formerly independent towns or communities, have been annexed to Heilbronn:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|----- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

The Borough President also presides over the Borough Council. In Heilbronn the boroughs of Biberach, Frankenbach, Horkheim, Kirchhausen and Klingenberg have borough councils.\n\n===City council===\nAfter the municipal elections of May 25, 2014 the city council of Heilbronn was made up of 40 seats.

Before the 2006 elections, it was an electoral district all by itself.\n\n===Coat of arms===\nHeilbronn's [[coat of arms]] features a black eagle with red tongue and claws on golden background. The eagle is protected by a red, silver and blue shield. The city flag is red, white and blue.\n\nThe oldest seal of the city dates back to 1265. The eagle is the symbol for the imperial freedom enjoyed by Heilbronn until it was [[German Mediatisation|annexed]] by the [[Grand Duchy]] (and later Kingdom) of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. While it is established that it appeared for the first time with shield in 1556 to distinguish it from other versions of eagles, the origin of the colors of the shield has yet to be determined. The colors also appeared in reverse order in 1556, 1581 and 1681 and there have been other variations of colour as well, such as white rather than golden background.\n\nInteresting is the fact that Heilbronn sports three colours in its flag. Newly dedicated municipal flags in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] only use two colours. According to State municipal laws, Heilbronn's flag was grandfathered as it had been in use prior to 1935.\n\n==Main sights==\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Heilbronn Handkran 20050828.jpg|thumb|align=left|Historic manual crane]]\n* Historic manual crane\n* ''Bollwerksturm''\n* ''Deutschhof''\n* Steam power plant\n* Community centre \"Harmonie\"\n* Court and ''Fleischhaus''\n* ''G\u00f6tzenturm''\n* ''Hafenmarktturm'' (pot market tower)\n* ''Haus Zehender'' at the market place\n* ''K\u00e4thchenhaus'' at the market place\n* City Hall with historic astronomic clock\n* ''Schie\u00dfhaus''\n* ''[[Trappenseeschl\u00f6sschen]]''\n* ''Weinvilla''\n\n===Churches===\n* ''[[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]]'' (Protestant): The tower from the early [[Renaissance]] is the [[logo]] of the city.

In May the Trollinger marathon takes place. July brings the ''Gaffenberg Festival'' and the ''Unterl\u00e4nder Volksfest'' takes the city from July into August. It is the largest festival of its kind in Heilbronn and takes place on the ''Theresienwiese''. Each year it begins on the last Friday in July and ends on the second Monday in August. In September, patrons enjoy themselves at the ''Heilbronner Weindorf'', in October at the ''Hafenmarkt'' and in November and December at the ''Weihnachtsmarkt'' by the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]]. Every other year the ''Neckarfest'' and ''Traubenbl\u00fctenfest'' are added to this already full schedule.\n\n==Sport==\n[[FC Heilbronn]] is a football club based in Heilbronn, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg formed only recently \u2013 in 2003 \u2013 out of a merger between two former clubs with the elder dating back to 1896 and playing a five-year stint in the [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963-74)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]] (II) / [[2nd Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974-81)|2nd Bundesliga S\u00fcd]] from 1969 to 1975.\n\nHeilbronn hosts an annual tennis tournament [[Intersport Heilbronn Open|Heilbronn Open]] (see [http://www.heilbronn-open.de/ Heilbronn Open website]) which is part of the [[ATP Challenger Tour|ATP Challenger tour]].\n\nHeilbronn is also the hometown of ice hockey team Heilbronner Falken (Heilbronn Falcons). The team currently plays in the second German ice hockey league. The Eisb\u00e4ren Heilbronn (Heilbronn polar bears) is the second ice hockey team, which is playing in the regional league South-West in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n{{Missing information|section|industry in Heilbronn|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Heilbronn Weinbau 20050904.jpg|thumb|250px|Vineyards east of Heilbronn]]\n\n[[Viticulture]] has a long tradition in Heilbronn and is an important part of its economy to this day. Its 514 [[hectare|ha]], two thirds of it growing red grapes, is the third largest vineyard in [[W\u00fcrttemberg (wine region)|W\u00fcrttemberg's vine-growing region]] after [[Brackenheim]] and [[Lauffen am Neckar]]. In 1888 the [[vintner]]s of the Heilbronn area combined and formed the ''Weing\u00e4rtnergesellschaft Heilbronn '', a cooperative. In 1933 that cooperative then combined with the competing cooperative ''Winzergenossenschaft Heilbronn'' that had formed in 1919 and that cooperative again merged with the Vintner cooperatives of [[Erlenbach, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Erlenbach]] and [[Weinsberg]] to form the ''Genossenschaftskellerei Heilbronn-Erlenbach-Weinsberg'' with seat just outside the city limits in Erlenbach. In addition to the cooperative, numerous independent vintners are also located here.\n\nSouth of the steam power plant is located the [[conveyor tower]] of the ''S\u00fcdwestdeutsche Salzwerke AG'' (SWS). The SWS runs a [[salt]] mine in the Heilbronn area. That mine was connected through a tunnel with the now shut-down (since 1994) salt mine ''Kochendorf'' in [[Bad Friedrichshall]]. Extraction had extended the Heilbronn mine far to the west so that in 2004 a new shaft, ''Konradsberg'', was added \u2014 probably the last mining shaft that was constructed in all of Germany.\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[File:Heilbronn Bahnhofsvorplatz Stadtbahn01 2002-09-08.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|Heilbronn]]/[[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]] train pulling into the station outside of [[Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nThe city of Heilbronn is readily accessible by road courtesy of the [[Weinsberg Intersection]] just to the northeast of the city, the intersection of the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] from [[W\u00fcrzburg]] to [[Gottmadingen]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] from [[Saarbr\u00fccken]] to [[Waidhaus]]. In addition to the Autobahns the city is connected via the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 27|B 27]] from [[Blankenburg am Harz|Blankenburg]] to [[Schaffhausen]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 39|B 39]] from [[Frankenstein (Palatine)]] to [[Mainhardt]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 293|B 293]] from [[Karlsruhe]] to Heilbronn that both run through the city itself.\n\nHeilbronn is also a forerunner of [[right turn on red]] in Germany and 65 \"Green arrow\" signs have been installed at appropriate intersections since 1996.\n\nAlthough [[Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) does not benefit from the [[DB Fernverkehr|Deutsche Bahn long-distance service]], the city is well connected by train. The [[Franconia Railway]] (''Frankenbahn'') connects [[Stuttgart]] and W\u00fcrzburg, the [[Neckar Valley Railway]] and [[Elsenz Valley Railway]] run from Heilbronn to Heidelberg and [[Mannheim]], and the [[Hohenlohe Railway]] accommodates travel to [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] via [[\u00d6hringen]].\n\nThe [[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|Heilbronn]] and [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]]s provide a connection all the way to [[Karlsruhe]] on the [[Kraichgau Railway]]'s tracks. Currently the S 4 takes travellers from Karlsruhe through the central train station past the centre of town all the way to the \u00d6hringen borough of Cappel (since December 11, 2005). Because of massive delays in the construction of the S-Bahn tracks through Heilbronn's city limits and with the modernization[[File:Heilbronn Kanalhafen 20050905.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Heilbronn canal port]] and electrification of the existing tracks from Heilbronn to \u00d6hringen meant that the new section's official opening needed to be postponed several times. In the future, additional S-Bahn lines are planned to [[Neckarsulm]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Zaberfeld]]. As well a these new lines, additional stops will also be built in the inner city of Heilbronn. In 2014 the S-Bahn line to Neckarsulm was established.\n\nWhilst the original ''[[tram|Stra\u00dfenbahn]]'' of Heilbronn, nicknamed the ''Spatzenschaukel'' (German for \"sparrows' swing\"), was discontinued on April 1, 1955, the city used electrically powered [[trolley bus]]es until 1960. Today, [[public transportation]] is provided by the S-Bahn that runs through Heilbronn similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]] and this is complemented by buses run by the ''Stadtwerke Heilbronn (Verkehrsbetriebe)'' and several other enterprises. All now belong to the ''Heilbronner Verkehrsverbund''.\n\n[[File:Heilbronn EnBW 20050905.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Thermal power plant]]\n[[File:Heilbronn PowerPlant view from Wartberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of the Thermal Power Plant from Wartberg]]\n\nThe canal port on the Neckar is one of the ten largest German interior [[port]]s.\n\n===Power plant===\nIn the industrial part of Heilbronn EnBW AG runs a large powerplant that is powered by coal. Its two chimneys (250 m tall) and cooling tower (140 m tall) are visible from afar, see [[Heilbronn Power Station]]\n\n===Transport===\nThe public [[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|light rail]] and bus system is run by [http://www.h3nv.de/ HNV (Heilbronner Hohenloher Haller Nahverkehr)].\n\n===Media===\nHeilbronn is home to one of the studios of [[S\u00fcdwestrundfunk]] (SWR). From here regional programmes like ''Frankenradio'' are broadcast on SWR4 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The ''[[Heilbronner Stimme]]'' is a daily newspaper published in the city and the advertisers ''Neckar Express'', ''echo am Mittwoch'' and ''echo am Sonntag'' are available weekly free of charge. Heilbronners also peruse the monthly city magazines ''Freizeit Journal'' and ''Moritz''.\n\n===Public service===\n\nSeveral courts are located in Heilbronn, two belonging to the Stuttgart court district, a specialty court hearing labour issues, and a family court whose district includes the city of Heilbronn and the counties of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn]], [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg]], [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall (district)|Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], [[Hohenlohekreis (district)|Hohenlohe]] and [[Main-Tauber-Kreis|Main-Tauber]].\n\nThe City is also the seat of the Prelature of Heilbronn and of the church district of Heilbronn (of the Protestant State Church as well as of the Heilbronn Deacony of the [[Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]).\n\n===Education===\nHeilbronn is the seat of the main campus of the ''[[Hochschule Heilbronn]]'', founded in 1961 as a public engineering school. Since 1971 the school was known as the ''Fachhochschule Heilbronn'' (Heilbronn University) and has operated a secondary campus in [[K\u00fcnzelsau]] since 1988. Starting with the fall semester on September 1, 2005 the [[Fachhochschule]] was awarded the status of a [[Hochschule]]. In 2009 a third campus in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall was established.\n\n[[File:Trappenseeschl\u00f6sschen.JPG|250px|left|thumb|Trappenseeschl\u00f6sschen]]\nThe private ''Heilbronn Business School'' opened at the ''Neckarturm'' in January 2005.\n\nAs far as general education is concerned, Heilbronn operates five college-track highschools or [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] (''Elly-Heuss-Knapp-Gymnasium'', ''Justinus-Kerner-Gymnasium'', ''M\u00f6nchsee-Gymnasium'', ''Robert-Mayer-Gymnasium'' and ''Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium''), four non-college-track highschools or ''Realschulen'' (''Dammrealschule'', ''Helene-Lange-Realschule'', ''Heinrich-von-Kleist-Realschule'' in B\u00f6ckingen and ''M\u00f6rike-Realschule''). There are also six special-education schools run by the city (''Wilhelm-Hofmann-F\u00f6rderschule'', ''Pestalozzi-F\u00f6rderschule'', and ''Paul-Meyle-Schule'' for the mentally and physically impaired, two special-education schools run by Heilbronn County (''Gebr\u00fcder-Grimm-Schule'' for the speech impaired and ''Hermann-Herzog-Schule'' for the seeing impaired), and the ''Lindenparkschule'', which is run by the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg for the hearing and speech impaired. The latter also includes a boarding school and consultation centre.\n\nCity grammar schools are the ''Damm-Grundschule'', ''Deutschorden-Grundschule Kirchhausen'', ''Grundschule Horkheim'', ''Grundschule Klingenberg'', ''Gr\u00fcnewaldschule Grundschule B\u00f6ckingen'', ''Rein\u00f6hlschule Grundschule B\u00f6ckingen'', ''Silcherschule Grundschule'' and ''Uhlandschule Grundschule Sontheim''.

The county runs the ''Andreas-Schneider-Schule'' and ''Christiane-Herzog-Schule'', and in the fall of 2005 the ''Peter-Bruckmann-Schule'' was added to the already operating professional training schools.\n\nFinally, the following private schools round out the education options offered in Heilbronn:\n* The ''Abendrealschule Heilbronn e.V.'' allows students with middle school diplomas to achieve the first in a series of steps to gain college entrance prerequisites on a part-time basis after work.

Furthermore, Heilbronn is known for its wine industry and is nicknamed ''K\u00e4thchenstadt'', after [[Heinrich von Kleist]]'s ''[[Das K\u00e4thchen von Heilbronn]].''\n\n==Geography==\nHeilbronn is located in the northern corner of the [[Neckar]] [[Sedimentary basin|basin]] at the bottom of the Wartberg (308 m). It occupies both banks of the Neckar, and the highest spot inside city limits is the [[Schweinsberg (mountain)|Schweinsberg]] with a height of 372 meters. Heilbronn is adjacent to [[Swabian-Franconian Forest]] Nature Park and is surrounded by vineyards.\n[[File:Neckar watershed closer.gif|right|thumb|210px|Heilbronn (upper right) on the [[Neckar|Neckar River]], in southwest Germany.]]\n\nHeilbronn and its surroundings are located in the northern part of the larger [[Stuttgart]] metropolitan area. The city is the economic center of the Heilbronn-Franken region and is one of fourteen such cities in the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg master plan of 2002. It also serves [[Abstatt]], [[Bad Rappenau]], [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Beilstein (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Beilstein]], [[Brackenheim]], [[Cleebronn]], [[Eberstadt (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Eberstatt]], [[Ellhofen]], [[Eppingen]], [[Flein]], [[Gemmingen]], [[G\u00fcglingen]], [[Ilsfeld]], [[Ittlingen]], [[Kirchardt]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]], [[Lehrensteinsfeld]], [[Leingarten]], [[L\u00f6wenstein]], [[Massenbachhausen]], [[Neckarwestheim]], [[Nordheim (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Nordheim]], [[Obersulm]], [[Pfaffenhofen (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Pfaffenhofen]], [[Schwaigern]], [[Siegelsbach]], [[Talheim, Neckar|Talheim]], [[Untergruppenbach]], [[Weinsberg]], [[W\u00fcstenrot]], and [[Zaberfeld]] as a regional economic centre.\n\n===Neighboring communities===\nHeilbronn shares a border with the following cities and towns, all part of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn County]] and listed here clockwise from the North: [[Bad Wimpfen]], [[Neckarsulm]], [[Erlenbach (Landkreis Heilbronn)|Erlenbach]], [[Weinsberg]], [[Lehrensteinsfeld]], [[Untergruppenbach]], [[Flein]], [[Talheim, Neckar|Talheim]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]], [[Nordheim (W\u00fcrttemberg)|Nordheim]], [[Leingarten]], [[Schwaigern]], [[Massenbachhausen]] and [[Bad Rappenau]].\n\n===Boroughs===\nThe city is divided into nine [[borough]]s: \n{|\n| valign=\"top\" |\n* 001: Heilbronn itself\n* 002: B\u00f6ckingen\n* 003: Neckargartach\n* 004: Sontheim\n* 005: Klingenberg\n| valign=\"top\" | \n* 006: [[Heilbronn-Frankenbach|Frankenbach]]\n* 007: Kirchhausen\n* 008: Biberach\n* 009: Horkheim\n|}\n\n==History==\n\n===Up to AD 1200===\nThe oldest traces of humans in and around Heilbronn date back to the [[Old Stone Age]] (30,000 BC). The fertile Neckar floodplains in the Heilbronn basin aided early settlement by farmers and ranchers. The city limits of present-day Heilbronn contain many sites of [[Bronze Age]] finds. Later on, but still before AD, the [[Celt]]s already mined here for salt from brine.\n\nUnder [[Roman Emperor]] [[Domitian]] (AD 81\u201396) the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] pushed east away from the [[Rhine]] and the outer boundary of the [[Roman Empire]] was set at the [[Neckar-Odenwald Limes]]. A [[castle]] in today's borough of B\u00f6ckingen was part of that ''[[Limes (Roman Empire)|limes]]'', and nearby numerous Roman villas and plantations were built. Around AD 150, the Neckar-Odenwald Limes became obsolete when the boundary of the Roman Empire was moved approximately {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}} to the east, where it was subsequently fortified with the construction of the [[Upper Germanic Limes]] complete with [[parapet]] and [[trench]]es.\n\nAround 260, the Romans surrendered the limes, and the [[Alamanni]] became rulers of the Neckar basin. Between the 4th and 7th centuries, the area became part of the [[Frankish Empire]], and the first settlement was built in the general vicinity of the present center of town.\n\nIn 741 Heilbronn is first mentioned in an official document of the [[Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg]] as ''villa Helibrunna'' (together with a ''Michaelsbasilica''), and in 841, King [[Louis the German]] set up court here for a period of time. The name ''Heilbrunna'' (''healing well'') hints to a well that is located not far from the basilica. In 1050 a significant settlement of [[Jews]] is noted in official documents, and the Codex of the monastery in [[Hirsau]] documented Heilbronn's right to hold market days and mint coins, mentioning its harbor and vineyards as well. The name of the city became a widespread [[Jewish surname]] in many varieties, see [[Heilprin]] and [[Halperin]].\n\n===1200\u20131500===\n[[File:DeutschHof HN.JPG|thumb|The ''Deutschhof''.]]\nIn 1225 Heilbronn was incorporated into the [[Hohenstaufen]] Empire as ''oppidum Heilecbrunnen''. ''Oppidum'' signified a city fortified by [[parapet]] and [[trench]]es. Later during the 13th century, the [[Teutonic Knights]] obtained ownership of a large area south of Heilbronn which would remain owned by that order until [[German Mediatisation]] in 1805. Starting in 1268, the order built the ''Deutschhof'' there as one of its residences. The church building of the order that was located on the premises was modified and expanded several times: First in 1350 it was expanded ([[gothic architecture|Gothic]]), then it was remodeled in 1719 ([[Baroque]]), and in 1977, it was consecrated as a cathedral.\n\nAfter the demise of the [[Hohenstaufen|Staufen]] dynasty, King [[Rudolph I of Germany|Rudolf I]] returned city status to Heilbronn in 1281 and installed a regal advocate to rule the city. In addition to the advocate he put a council in place that was headed up by a mayor. Around 1300, the first city hall was erected in the market place and the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (built on the foundation of the Michaelsbasilica) was expanded. The Neckar privilege gave the city the right to modify the flow of the river in 1333, which meant it now had the right to construct dams, harbors and mills. Because of the infrastructure thus created, during the 14th century Heilbronn grew attractive to merchants and craftspeople, who now demanded the right to determine their own fate.\n\nIn 1371 [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor]], issued a new charter to the city. Now Heilbronn needed to answer only to the Emperor and as such was an [[Imperial Free City]]. Craftspeople and merchants were now represented in its council and the villages of B\u00f6ckingen, [[Flein]], [[Frankenbach]] and Neckargartach became part of Heilbronn's territory.\n\nAs an Imperial Free City Heilbronn was threatened by the ambitious House of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]]. A relationship with the Holy Roman Emperor and a treaty with the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]] in effect from 1417 to 1622 strengthened Heilbronn's position and kept the House of W\u00fcrttemberg at bay. The political stability enjoyed by the city during the 15th century enabled it to expand, and many of its historic structures, such as the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (1455\u201360), trace their origins to that era.\n\n===1500\u20131700===\n[[File:Heilbronn Bollwerksturm 20050828.jpg|left|thumb|160px|''Bollwerksturm'']]\n\n[[G\u00f6tz von Berlichingen]] spent three years in \"knightly custody\" in Heilbronn starting in 1519 and even spent a night in the tower of the bastion. That same year people first took note of the pub owner [[J\u00e4cklein Rohrbach]] who with accomplices would later kill the executor of B\u00f6ckingen. After he had spent some time in the [[Hohenlohe Plains]] and collected similarly minded characters around him, he returned to Heilbronn in April 1525 just as the [[German Peasants' War]] was getting into full swing. On April 16 the peasants killed many of the nobles in Weinsberg and on April 18 the Heilbronn cloister of the [[Carmelites|Order of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel]] was attacked and ransacked. The city opened its gates in response to demands of the peasants and consequently more churches and municipal institutions were robbed the next day. For about a month Heilbronn remained under the control of rebellious peasants. And even though [[Johann Lachmann]], later a church reformer, had attempted to mediate, the peasants did not leave the city until one of their armies was defeated on May 12, 1525 in [[B\u00f6blingen]]. Their leader Rohrbach was executed on May 21, 1525 in Neckargartach and his home town of B\u00f6ckingen was partially burnt to the ground in punishment.\n\nIn 1528, the replacement of the mayor by [[Hans Riesser]], a Protestant, brought on the previously delayed [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] and through the efforts of Reformer Lachmann schools and healthcare were also reorganized. In 1529 the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] (church tower of the Kilianskirche) was completed. It was the first important religious building of the [[Renaissance]] in Germany. The year 1530 brought about the acceptance of the [[Augsburg Confession]] by city council and residents and the ''Heilbronn Catechism'' of 1536 is the second oldest catechism in the Protestant Church. In 1538 Heilbronn joined the [[Schmalkaldic League]] but by 1546 squabbles between troops of the Schmalkaldic League and those of the Emperor [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] escalated into battles that were won by the Emperor. As a result, Charles V spent Christmas 1546 in Heilbronn to attend the ensuing criminal proceedings. It is also Charles V who in 1522 changed the charter of the city and this charter survived almost unscathed until 1803.\n\n[[File:Heilbronn 1643 von Matthaeus Merian.jpg|thumb|Heilbronn in 1643. Engraving by [[Matth\u00e4us Merian]]]]\nDuring the [[Thirty Years' War]] the city and surrounding villages suffered badly. After the [[battle of Wimpfen]] in 1622, Neckargartach was burnt to the ground. In 1631 Heilbronn was occupied by imperial troops but the same year the Swedes succeeded in conquering the city. From 1644 through 1647, Heilbronn was again part of the Holy Roman Empire, but then French troops moved in and later those of the [[Electorate of the Palatinate]]. The city was not free of occupying forces until four years after the [[Peace of Westphalia]] of 1648. But already in the 1670s the city again became the stage for armed manoeuvres, until it was occupied by French troops in 1688. But while that occupation of the city only lasted several months, the French were only persuaded to leave the surrounding areas in 1693, after a large defensive army had been put into the field and fortifications had been erected.\n\n===1700\u20131900===\n[[File:K\u00e4thchenHaus HN02.JPG|thumb|''K\u00e4thchenhaus'']]\nDuring the 18th century, archives suggest all members of the city council enjoyed some sort of formal education; [[Friedrich Schiller|Schiller]] and [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe|Goethe]] came to visit; and elaborate buildings were being constructed in the [[Rococo]] style.\n\nOn September 9, 1802, Heilbronn lost its status as an Imperial Free City when the troops of Duke [[Frederick I of W\u00fcrttemberg|Friedrich I]] of [[Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg|W\u00fcrttemberg]] arrived. The duke had conceded the left bank of the Rhine to France during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] but had been compensated with areas on the right bank. This is how Heilbronn and other former Imperial Free Cities became part of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1803. Heilbronn became the seat of an ''Oberamt'' (district), and the four Imperial Free villages became separate communities within the district. In 1806 the Duchy of W\u00fcrttemberg became the [[Kingdom of W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n[[File:Heilbronn Stadtplan 1858-2.jpg|thumb|left|Plan of Heilbronn, 1858]]\nIn 1815, Heilbronn again became a staging area for major armies ahead of the campaign against [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], and 10,000 troops paraded in front of Emperor [[Francis II, Holy Roman Emperor|Franz of Austria]] and more than one hundred German princes and generals in the ''Theresienwiese''. [[Tsar]] [[Alexander I of Russia]] met in Heilbronn with the [[Baltic German|Baltic]] Baroness [[Barbara Juliana, Baroness von Kr\u00fcdener|Juliane]] von [[Barony of Kr\u00fcdener|Kr\u00fcdener]], who talked him into founding the \"[[Holy Alliance]]\".\n\n[[Industrialization]] arrived in 1820. When the first train lines were placed in service in W\u00fcrttemberg, Heilbronn was at the end of the line of the northern branch that connected Heilbronn with [[Stuttgart]] and further fueled industrialization.\n\nFor a while Heilbronn suffered from the upheavals of the [[Revolutions of 1848 in the German states|Baden Revolution]] that its civil guard participated in. During that time the 8th infantry regiment switched sides and joined the revolutionaries until it was subsequently disarmed and force-transferred out of the area.\n\nIn 1849 was founded the [[Hoerner Bank]], one of the oldest still functioning banks in [[Germany]].<ref>{{cite web\n|url=https://www.hoernerbank.de/hoerner-bank-ag\n|title=Hoerner Bank AG\n|accessdate=10 March 2017\n}}</ref>\n\nHeilbronn became part of the [[German Empire]] in 1871 during the [[unification of Germany]].\n\nIn the 1860s the city's train tracks were extended to [[Heidelberg]] via [[Bad Wimpfen]], to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] via [[Osterburken]], and to [[Crailsheim]] (and later on to [[Nuremberg]]) via [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]]. In 1880, the [[Kraichgau]] line was completed and created an important connection towards [[Karlsruhe]], and by the end of the 19th century, Heilbronn had become an important hub, second in Wuerttemburg to Stuttgart in industrial output.\n\nThe year 1892 brought a connection to the power plant in Lauffen; thus Heilbronn became the first city in the world to enjoy long distance electric power.\n\n===1900\u20131945===\n[[File:Stadtgemeinde Heilbronn 1923.JPG|thumb|Bond of the Municipality Heilbronn, issued 10. April 1923]]\n[[File:Heilbronn ca. April 1945.jpg|thumb|Ruins in Heilbronn in 1945.]]\nWith the dissolution of monarchy in the [[German Reich]] as a result of World War I, Heilbronn became part of the [[Free People's State of W\u00fcrttemberg]] in 1918.\n\nAfter almost a century of economic boom and growth of the local industry Heilbronn's citizenry included many labourers. The city came to be known as a \"red hot spot\"''';''' numerous worker and sports clubs were begun. Already prior to World War I the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] cornered the majority of the vote and stayed that course during the [[Weimar Republic]]. At his visit to the city on May 15, 1926, [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] was clearly not welcome by everyone, and several people were injured when a man was mistaken for Hitler and attacked. Hitler himself was able to give his speech in the city's community center ''Harmonie'', but the SPD had the majority in Heilbronn over the [[Nazi Party|NSDAP]] as late as the elections on March 5, 1933.\n\n[[Richard Drauz]], who had been born into a respected Heilbronn family, became Heilbronn's NSDAP [[Kreisleiter]] (District Leader) in 1932 . He was also elected to the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] from 1933 on and pushed hard for the ''[[Gleichschaltung]]'' of the Heilbronn clubs and press in [[Nazi Germany]].\n\nOn July 28, 1935, the port was opened in a canal off the Neckar, and 1936 saw the [[Autobahn]] between Heilbronn and Stuttgart completed. Economy and infrastructure were booming in W\u00fcrttemberg, and Heilbronn was at the logistic centre of it all. As the result of a district reform on October 1, 1938, Heilbronn became the seat of the newly created [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn County]] and regained independent city status. At the same time the previously independent communities of B\u00f6ckingen, Sontheim, and Neckargartach were annexed, and with 72,000 residents Heilbronn then was the second largest city in W\u00fcrttemberg. The port turned into an important transfer station on the Neckar and one of the ten largest interior ports in the country.\n\nOn November 10, 1938, the Heilbronn [[synagogue]] was destroyed during the [[Kristallnacht]]. Soon thereafter the [[Jew]]ish community was all but eliminated.\n\nStarting in 1942 during World War II, the salt mines in and around Heilbronn were used to store art and artifacts from Germany, France, and Italy. Similarly, important producers of the war industry were moved into the [[Shaft mining|mine shafts]]. The expansion of the shafts was undertaken by labour brigades of the [[concentration camp]] branches in Kochendorf and Neckargartach. From Heilbronn all the way to [[Neckarelz]] numerous subterraneous complexes, some of them gigantic, were constructed''';''' on November 20, 1942, the Heilbronn Bureau of Labour had 8,000 forced labourers registered in its district.\n\nIn 1940 [[Bombings of Heilbronn in World War II|allied air raids]] began, and the city and its surrounding area were hit about 20 times with minor damage. On September 10, 1944, a raid by the allies targeted the city specifically, in particular the B\u00f6ckingen train transfer station. As a result of 1,168 bombs dropped that day, 281 residents died. The city was carpet-bombed from the southern quarter all the way to the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]] in the center of town. The church was burnt out.\n\nAfter a [[Battle of Heilbronn (1945)|ten-day battle]], with the allies advancing over the strategically important [[Neckar]] crossings, the war ended for the destroyed city, and it was occupied by the U.S. Army on April 12, 1945. Local NSDAP leader [[Richard Drauz|Drauz]] became a fugitive because of executions of American prisoners of war he had ordered in March 1945. He was eventually arrested, tried, and hanged by the Allies in [[Landsberg Prison|Landsberg]] on December 4, 1946.\n\n===Since World War II===\n[[File:StadtTheater HN01.JPG|thumb|''Stadttheater'' Heilbronn.]]\nAfter the war, Emil Beutinger, mayor until 1933, returned to office and began the formidable task of reconstruction that was subsequently continued by his successors [[Paul Metz]] and Paul Meyle. Milestones were the rededication of historic city hall in 1953 and the reopening of the community centre, ''Harmonie''. Heilbronn was part of [[W\u00fcrttemberg-Baden]] until 1952, after which it became part of [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].\n\nAfter 1951, US troops were permanently stationed in Heilbronn. They used barracks built prior to World War II and added some structures of their own.\n\nThe opening of the Autobahn [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] from Heilbronn to [[Mannheim]] in 1968 was an important economic event. When the [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] to [[W\u00fcrzburg]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] to [[Nuremberg]] was completed in 1974 and 1979, respectively, Heilbronn became an important logistical centre in southern Germany. As a result, many large companies opened offices in Heilbronn.\n\nWhen Klingenberg became part of Heilbronn on January 1, 1970, the city's population exceeded 100,000 for the first time; thus Heilbronn attained \"major city\" (''Gro\u00dfstadt'') status. During the last district reform in the 1970s, Kirchhausen, Biberach, Frankenbach and Horkheim were incorporated into Heilbronn, and the city was reconfirmed as independent city and seat of Heilbronn County. It was also declared seat of the newly formed Franken region, now Heilbronn-Franken.\n\nAlso during the 1970s, the centre of the city was transformed into a [[pedestrian zone]] and the rededication of the city theatre in 1982 closed one of the largest holes left in the inner city from World War II.\n\nPursuant to the [[NATO Double-Track Decision]] of 1979, [[Pershing II]] intermediate-range [[nuclear missiles]] were stationed just uphill of Heilbronn in the Waldheide. This made Heilbronn the only major city in Germany with atomic missiles inside its city limits \u2014 a fact that became front-page news during the missile accident on January 11, 1985. After the [[Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty|INF Treaty]] was signed in 1987, the missiles were removed .\n\nIn the 1980s, Heilbronn hosted ''Heimatttage'' and ''Landesgartenschau'' staged by the State of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. In 1998, Heilbronn was connected to the S-Bahn net with Karlsruhe. This further transformed the city centre, and an extension of the S-Bahn towards [[\u00d6hringen]] opened on December 10, 2005, marking the completion of the east-west axis of the Baden-Wuerttemburg regional transportation system. The north-south axis was in the planning stages as of February 2006.\n\nHeilbronn won the European competition \"Entente Florale 2000\" on September 9, 2000, in Broughshane, Northern Ireland, and in 2005\u201306 the city became the first [[UNICEF]] children's city in Germany.\n\nLate in 2005, Heilbronn was chosen to host the [[Bundesgartenschau]] in 2019. An entire new borough along the S-Bahn line B\u00f6ckingen\u2013Theresienwiese\u2013Neckargartach is planned.\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:Heilbronn Kilianskirche 20050828.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[St. Kilian's Church, Heilbronn]], as seen from the Kiliansplatz]]\nEver since the [[Franks]] under [[Clovis I|Chlodwig]] settled in the Neckar region around 500 the area has been predominantly [[Christians|Christian]] and when Heilbronn was first mentioned in an official document in 741 Christian Michaelsbasilica, present day's [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]], was mentioned along with the city. The [[Teutonic Knights]] constructed its church from the 13th century and both churches were continually expanded. They were joined later by other churches and cloisters in the city.\n\nAround 1050 an important Jewish community was mentioned that had settled in what became known as the ''Judengasse'' (''Lohtorstra\u00dfe''). In 1298, 143 Jews were killed during the [[Rintfleisch-Pogrom]] and in 1350 Jews suffered attacks again during a European [[epidemic]] of the [[Bubonic plague]]. The city's constitution required the council to include Jews, but already in the middle of the 15th century Jews were the target of vigilantes again until they were evicted from the city in 1490 with the blessings of Emperor [[Frederick III, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick III]].\n\nIt is worth noting that the common Jewish name Halpern, and many variants such as Alpert, derive from the name of this city Heilbronn, and the early Jewish community there.\n\nWhile Heilbronn was part of the [[Diocese of W\u00fcrzburg]], the independent villages of B\u00f6ckingen, Neckargartach and Frankenbach were attached to the [[Diocese of Worms]]. From 1514 on the Heilbronn native Johann Lachmann was caretaker of the parish in St. Kilian, in 1521 he became its preacher, in 1524 he converted to [[Lutheranism]] and proceeded to teach and lead the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in Heilbronn against the wishes of both dioceses. After the [[Protestant reformation]] of Heilbronn was complete the city remained Lutheran for centuries and the council and citizens accepted the [[Augsburg Confession]] without dissent. Catholics were no longer welcome, Jews were prohibited from settling in Heilbronn, and the city took part in the [[Protestation at Speyer]] on April 19, 1529 (the Protestation was the origin of the terms Protestant and Protestantism).\n\nThe [[Age of Enlightenment]] brought Heilbronn freedom of religion. From 1803 Jews were again permitted to settle in the city, Catholics also began to move back in and by the 1860s Jews were granted equal rights as Heilbronn citizens.\n\nAfter the city became part of W\u00fcrttemberg in 1803 it also became seat of a deaconry and the [[Prelate]] or regional bishop of the Protestant State Church in W\u00fcrttemberg. To this day Protestants are in the majority in Heilbronn. The Catholic parishes belong to the Deacony Heilbronn and are part of the [[Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]].\n\nAround 1920 first groups of \"Serious Bible Students\" (now: [[Jehovah's Witnesses]]) formed. Their small community suffered from oppression during the [[Third Reich]] and many of its members died in [[concentration camps]]. Similarly, the Jewish community had to watch as its colossal [[synagogue]] went up in flames and its 350 members were subsequently all but extinguished. Jehovah's Witnesses built a first meeting room in Heilbronn in 1953 and many more have been added since then.\n\n[[File:Heilbronn Rathausuhr 20050828.jpg|thumb|200px|Astronomical clock at City Hall.]]\n\nSince the 1970s, after guest workers and immigrants from [[Islam]]ic or [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian-Orthodox]] countries settled here, these faiths are practiced by a growing part of the population and numerous mosques have been created since the 1990s in the city and county of Heilbronn.\n\n===District reform===\nOver the years, the following, formerly independent towns or communities, have been annexed to Heilbronn:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|----- bgcolor=\"#efefef\"\n!

Residents of such boroughs elect their borough council at each municipal election and the borough council must be consulted on all matters of significance to the respective borough. The Borough President also presides over the Borough Council. In Heilbronn the boroughs of Biberach, Frankenbach, Horkheim, Kirchhausen and Klingenberg have borough councils.\n\n===City council===\nAfter the municipal elections of May 25, 2014 the city council of Heilbronn was made up of 40 seats.

Before the 2006 elections, it was an electoral district all by itself.\n\n===Coat of arms===\nHeilbronn's [[coat of arms]] features a black eagle with red tongue and claws on golden background. The eagle is protected by a red, silver and blue shield. The city flag is red, white and blue.\n\nThe oldest seal of the city dates back to 1265. The eagle is the symbol for the imperial freedom enjoyed by Heilbronn until it was [[German Mediatisation|annexed]] by the [[Grand Duchy]] (and later Kingdom) of [[W\u00fcrttemberg]]. While it is established that it appeared for the first time with shield in 1556 to distinguish it from other versions of eagles, the origin of the colors of the shield has yet to be determined. The colors also appeared in reverse order in 1556, 1581 and 1681 and there have been other variations of colour as well, such as white rather than golden background.\n\nInteresting is the fact that Heilbronn sports three colours in its flag. Newly dedicated municipal flags in [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]] only use two colours. According to State municipal laws, Heilbronn's flag was grandfathered as it had been in use prior to 1935.\n\n==Main sights==\n\n===Buildings===\n[[File:Heilbronn Handkran 20050828.jpg|thumb|align=left|Historic manual crane]]\n* Historic manual crane\n* ''Bollwerksturm''\n* ''Deutschhof''\n* Steam power plant\n* Community centre \"Harmonie\"\n* Court and ''Fleischhaus''\n* ''G\u00f6tzenturm''\n* ''Hafenmarktturm'' (pot market tower)\n* ''Haus Zehender'' at the market place\n* ''K\u00e4thchenhaus'' at the market place\n* City Hall with historic astronomic clock\n* ''Schie\u00dfhaus''\n* ''[[Trappenseeschl\u00f6sschen]]''\n* ''Weinvilla''\n\n===Churches===\n* ''[[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]]'' (Protestant): The tower from the early [[Renaissance]] is the [[logo]] of the city.

In May the Trollinger marathon takes place. July brings the ''Gaffenberg Festival'' and the ''Unterl\u00e4nder Volksfest'' takes the city from July into August. It is the largest festival of its kind in Heilbronn and takes place on the ''Theresienwiese''. Each year it begins on the last Friday in July and ends on the second Monday in August. In September, patrons enjoy themselves at the ''Heilbronner Weindorf'', in October at the ''Hafenmarkt'' and in November and December at the ''Weihnachtsmarkt'' by the [[Kilianskirche (Heilbronn)|Kilianskirche]]. Every other year the ''Neckarfest'' and ''Traubenbl\u00fctenfest'' are added to this already full schedule.\n\n==Sport==\n[[FC Heilbronn]] is a football club based in Heilbronn, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg formed only recently \u2013 in 2003 \u2013 out of a merger between two former clubs with the elder dating back to 1896 and playing a five-year stint in the [[Regionalliga S\u00fcd (1963-74)|Regionalliga S\u00fcd]] (II) / [[2nd Bundesliga S\u00fcd (1974-81)|2nd Bundesliga S\u00fcd]] from 1969 to 1975.\n\nHeilbronn hosts an annual tennis tournament [[Intersport Heilbronn Open|Heilbronn Open]] (see [http://www.heilbronn-open.de/ Heilbronn Open website]) which is part of the [[ATP Challenger Tour|ATP Challenger tour]].\n\nHeilbronn is also the hometown of ice hockey team Heilbronner Falken (Heilbronn Falcons). The team currently plays in the second German ice hockey league. The Eisb\u00e4ren Heilbronn (Heilbronn polar bears) is the second ice hockey team, which is playing in the regional league South-West in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n==Economy and infrastructure==\n{{Missing information|section|industry in Heilbronn|date=June 2016}}\n[[File:Heilbronn Weinbau 20050904.jpg|thumb|250px|Vineyards east of Heilbronn]]\n\n[[Viticulture]] has a long tradition in Heilbronn and is an important part of its economy to this day. Its 514 [[hectare|ha]], two thirds of it growing red grapes, is the third largest vineyard in [[W\u00fcrttemberg (wine region)|W\u00fcrttemberg's vine-growing region]] after [[Brackenheim]] and [[Lauffen am Neckar]]. In 1888 the [[vintner]]s of the Heilbronn area combined and formed the ''Weing\u00e4rtnergesellschaft Heilbronn '', a cooperative. In 1933 that cooperative then combined with the competing cooperative ''Winzergenossenschaft Heilbronn'' that had formed in 1919 and that cooperative again merged with the Vintner cooperatives of [[Erlenbach, Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg|Erlenbach]] and [[Weinsberg]] to form the ''Genossenschaftskellerei Heilbronn-Erlenbach-Weinsberg'' with seat just outside the city limits in Erlenbach. In addition to the cooperative, numerous independent vintners are also located here.\n\nSouth of the steam power plant is located the [[conveyor tower]] of the ''S\u00fcdwestdeutsche Salzwerke AG'' (SWS). The SWS runs a [[salt]] mine in the Heilbronn area. That mine was connected through a tunnel with the now shut-down (since 1994) salt mine ''Kochendorf'' in [[Bad Friedrichshall]]. Extraction had extended the Heilbronn mine far to the west so that in 2004 a new shaft, ''Konradsberg'', was added \u2014 probably the last mining shaft that was constructed in all of Germany.\n\n===Infrastructure===\n[[File:Heilbronn Bahnhofsvorplatz Stadtbahn01 2002-09-08.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|Heilbronn]]/[[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]] train pulling into the station outside of [[Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof]]]]\n\nThe city of Heilbronn is readily accessible by road courtesy of the [[Weinsberg Intersection]] just to the northeast of the city, the intersection of the [[Autobahn]] [[Bundesautobahn 81|A 81]] from [[W\u00fcrzburg]] to [[Gottmadingen]] and the [[Bundesautobahn 6|A 6]] from [[Saarbr\u00fccken]] to [[Waidhaus]]. In addition to the Autobahns the city is connected via the [[Bundesstra\u00dfe]]n [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 27|B 27]] from [[Blankenburg am Harz|Blankenburg]] to [[Schaffhausen]], [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 39|B 39]] from [[Frankenstein (Palatine)]] to [[Mainhardt]] and [[Bundesstra\u00dfe 293|B 293]] from [[Karlsruhe]] to Heilbronn that both run through the city itself.\n\nHeilbronn is also a forerunner of [[right turn on red]] in Germany and 65 \"Green arrow\" signs have been installed at appropriate intersections since 1996.\n\nAlthough [[Heilbronn Hauptbahnhof]] (central station) does not benefit from the [[DB Fernverkehr|Deutsche Bahn long-distance service]], the city is well connected by train. The [[Franconia Railway]] (''Frankenbahn'') connects [[Stuttgart]] and W\u00fcrzburg, the [[Neckar Valley Railway]] and [[Elsenz Valley Railway]] run from Heilbronn to Heidelberg and [[Mannheim]], and the [[Hohenlohe Railway]] accommodates travel to [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]] via [[\u00d6hringen]].\n\nThe [[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|Heilbronn]] and [[Karlsruhe Stadtbahn]]s provide a connection all the way to [[Karlsruhe]] on the [[Kraichgau Railway]]'s tracks. Currently the S 4 takes travellers from Karlsruhe through the central train station past the centre of town all the way to the \u00d6hringen borough of Cappel (since December 11, 2005). Because of massive delays in the construction of the S-Bahn tracks through Heilbronn's city limits and with the modernization[[File:Heilbronn Kanalhafen 20050905.jpg|thumb|left|250px|The Heilbronn canal port]] and electrification of the existing tracks from Heilbronn to \u00d6hringen meant that the new section's official opening needed to be postponed several times. In the future, additional S-Bahn lines are planned to [[Neckarsulm]], [[Lauffen am Neckar]] and [[Zaberfeld]]. As well a these new lines, additional stops will also be built in the inner city of Heilbronn. In 2014 the S-Bahn line to Neckarsulm was established.\n\nWhilst the original ''[[tram|Stra\u00dfenbahn]]'' of Heilbronn, nicknamed the ''Spatzenschaukel'' (German for \"sparrows' swing\"), was discontinued on April 1, 1955, the city used electrically powered [[trolley bus]]es until 1960. Today, [[public transportation]] is provided by the S-Bahn that runs through Heilbronn similar to the [[Karlsruhe model]] and this is complemented by buses run by the ''Stadtwerke Heilbronn (Verkehrsbetriebe)'' and several other enterprises. All now belong to the ''Heilbronner Verkehrsverbund''.\n\n[[File:Heilbronn EnBW 20050905.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Thermal power plant]]\n[[File:Heilbronn PowerPlant view from Wartberg.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of the Thermal Power Plant from Wartberg]]\n\nThe canal port on the Neckar is one of the ten largest German interior [[port]]s.\n\n===Power plant===\nIn the industrial part of Heilbronn EnBW AG runs a large powerplant that is powered by coal. Its two chimneys (250 m tall) and cooling tower (140 m tall) are visible from afar, see [[Heilbronn Power Station]]\n\n===Transport===\nThe public [[Heilbronn Stadtbahn|light rail]] and bus system is run by [http://www.h3nv.de/ HNV (Heilbronner Hohenloher Haller Nahverkehr)].\n\n===Media===\nHeilbronn is home to one of the studios of [[S\u00fcdwestrundfunk]] (SWR). From here regional programmes like ''Frankenradio'' are broadcast on SWR4 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg. The ''[[Heilbronner Stimme]]'' is a daily newspaper published in the city and the advertisers ''Neckar Express'', ''echo am Mittwoch'' and ''echo am Sonntag'' are available weekly free of charge. Heilbronners also peruse the monthly city magazines ''Freizeit Journal'' and ''Moritz''.\n\n===Public service===\n\nSeveral courts are located in Heilbronn, two belonging to the Stuttgart court district, a specialty court hearing labour issues, and a family court whose district includes the city of Heilbronn and the counties of [[Heilbronn (district)|Heilbronn]], [[Ludwigsburg (district)|Ludwigsburg]], [[Schw\u00e4bisch Hall (district)|Schw\u00e4bisch Hall]], [[Hohenlohekreis (district)|Hohenlohe]] and [[Main-Tauber-Kreis|Main-Tauber]].\n\nThe City is also the seat of the Prelature of Heilbronn and of the church district of Heilbronn (of the Protestant State Church as well as of the Heilbronn Deacony of the [[Diocese of Rottenburg-Stuttgart]]).\n\n===Education===\nHeilbronn is the seat of the main campus of the ''[[Hochschule Heilbronn]]'', founded in 1961 as a public engineering school. Since 1971 the school was known as the ''Fachhochschule Heilbronn'' (Heilbronn University) and has operated a secondary campus in [[K\u00fcnzelsau]] since 1988. Starting with the fall semester on September 1, 2005 the [[Fachhochschule]] was awarded the status of a [[Hochschule]]. In 2009 a third campus in Schw\u00e4bisch Hall was established.\n\n[[File:Trappenseeschl\u00f6sschen.JPG|250px|left|thumb|Trappenseeschl\u00f6sschen]]\nThe private ''Heilbronn Business School'' opened at the ''Neckarturm'' in January 2005.\n\nAs far as general education is concerned, Heilbronn operates five college-track highschools or [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasiums]] (''Elly-Heuss-Knapp-Gymnasium'', ''Justinus-Kerner-Gymnasium'', ''M\u00f6nchsee-Gymnasium'', ''Robert-Mayer-Gymnasium'' and ''Theodor-Heuss-Gymnasium''), four non-college-track highschools or ''Realschulen'' (''Dammrealschule'', ''Helene-Lange-Realschule'', ''Heinrich-von-Kleist-Realschule'' in B\u00f6ckingen and ''M\u00f6rike-Realschule''). There are also six special-education schools run by the city (''Wilhelm-Hofmann-F\u00f6rderschule'', ''Pestalozzi-F\u00f6rderschule'', and ''Paul-Meyle-Schule'' for the mentally and physically impaired, two special-education schools run by Heilbronn County (''Gebr\u00fcder-Grimm-Schule'' for the speech impaired and ''Hermann-Herzog-Schule'' for the seeing impaired), and the ''Lindenparkschule'', which is run by the state of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg for the hearing and speech impaired. The latter also includes a boarding school and consultation centre.\n\nCity grammar schools are the ''Damm-Grundschule'', ''Deutschorden-Grundschule Kirchhausen'', ''Grundschule Horkheim'', ''Grundschule Klingenberg'', ''Gr\u00fcnewaldschule Grundschule B\u00f6ckingen'', ''Rein\u00f6hlschule Grundschule B\u00f6ckingen'', ''Silcherschule Grundschule'' and ''Uhlandschule Grundschule Sontheim''.

The county runs the ''Andreas-Schneider-Schule'' and ''Christiane-Herzog-Schule'', and in the fall of 2005 the ''Peter-Bruckmann-Schule'' was added to the already operating professional training schools.\n\nFinally, the following private schools round out the education options offered in Heilbronn:\n* The ''Abendrealschule Heilbronn e.V.'' allows students with middle school diplomas to achieve the first in a series of steps to gain college entrance prerequisites on a part-time basis after work.
