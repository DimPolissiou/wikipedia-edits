There are two distinct geographical areas of Korkuteli, of equal size: the lowland area nearer the coast has a hot Mediterranean climate, while the larger area of lakes higher up is cooler and less humid. The high country is covered with pine forest, while the lowland is used for agriculture; crops include grains, pulses and vegetable oil-seeds. There are trout in Korkuteli reservoir and other small lakes.\n\nUntil recently economic activity in this district was basically herding sheep and goats on the hillsides, but since the 1960s investment in irrigation and machinery has generated a thriving fruit-growing industry, including many roadside stalls selling fruit to travellers en route to the Mediterranean coast. This is turn has led to better buildings and infrastructure in the town of Korkuteli and the villages in the district. There is no industry or large-scale trading. Korkuteli is a small town of 15,000 people providing high schools and other basic infrastructure to the district.\n\nThe countryside is attractive and Antalya's middle-classes are building holiday homes in Korkuteli, a place to escape the summer heat on the coast. The local delicacy is 'burnt ice-cream', made of goats-milk.\n[[File:Korkuteli; Alaaddin Keykubat Medresesi.jpg|thumb|left|Koran school in Korkuteli, built at the beginning of the 13th century under Sultan Kayqubad I.]]\n==History==\n\nBuildings of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] periods in Korkuteli include the ''Ke\u015fi\u015f Evi'' (\"priest's house\") and the building that later became the ''Hamidoglu Medrese'', which has [[Latin]] inscriptions.\n\nThe area was taken from the Byzantines by the [[Seljuk Turks]] of [[G\u0131yaseddin Keyh\u00fcsrev I]] in 1207, and was used as a summer residence by the local Seljuk rulers.

Giselle shows this to Miss Kate, who then shows it to the woman in charge of Internationals.

She tried out for Elite with Emily, but didn't make it. She auditioned for a role on a TV show and got it, but turned it down after realizing it was being filmed the same week as Regionals. After the auditions for Nationals, Stephanie is cut from A-Troupe along with Tiffany and she decides to join B troupe.. Stephanie had always wanted to be a triple threat (actress/singer/dancer).

Later when Chloe leaves The Next Step to join a ballet touring company, Stephanie takes her place on the internationals team. In Season 4, Stephanie leaves The Next Step in order to go to Los Angeles to pursue her career as a triple threat after leading the auditions for A-Troupe.

It was revealed that he used to be in a street dance group, Seeds, who gave him the nickname 'Compass', in \"Dancing in the Street\". He makes it to the Nationals team in Season 2. At the end of season 2 he kisses Emily but later becomes 'just friends' with her.

One prank is changing the Internationals letters from hotel information to an old-fashioned square dance. At first A-troupe is stressed and upset, but by the end of the day, they all lighten up and are happy about it. Ella's main goal for the prank was to stop A-troupe from being too uptight.

He dates Emily briefly in Season 1.5, but breaks up with her in the season finale to be with Michelle. In Season 2, he has a good relationship with Michelle until her ex-boyfriend, Hunter, joins the studio. He challenges Eldon to a dance battle, with the winner getting Michelle as their prize. Eldon loses to Hunter, so he backs off Michelle and later breaks up with her in Season 2.5. In Season 3, he and fellow dancer Thalia start to fall for each other. James tells Eldon that when he can do 30 pirouettes, he will be ready to date Thalia. In the spinning contest at Internationals, James abandon the 30-pirouette rule, and tells Eldon that if he wins the round, he can date Thalia. Eldon wins the round by spinning the longest and wins Thalia. They kiss when The Next Step win the mystery song round, due to Eldon's win. In Season 4, Eldon has light blonde hair and blue eyes, and pale skin. Eldon leaves the Next Step at the beginning of Series 4 and competes with West and James at the Bangers and Mashups International Hip-Hop Extravaganza.
