Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the [[domestic cat]], the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014red and gray.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s. While they are fairly common in Brazil, Peru and Venezuela, jaguarundis may have gone [[extinct]] in the US. The [[IUCN]] lists the jaguarundi as [[Least Concern]], but populations are in decline in many parts of its range due to loss and [[Habitat fragmentation|fragmentation]] of their habitat and persecution for killing poultry.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe common name \"jaguarundi\" ({{IPAc-en|\u02cc|\u0292|\u00e6|\u0261|w|\u0259|\u02c8|r|\u028c|n|d|i}}) comes from the [[Guarani language|Old Guarani]] word ''yaguarundi'', similar to the [[Old Tupi]] word ''yawaum'di''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Ferreira |first=A.B.H. |year=1986 |title=Novo Dicion\u00e1rio da L\u00edngua Portuguesa|language=Portuguese |trans-title=New Dictionary of the Portuguese Language |edition=2nd|place=Rio de Janeiro |publisher=Nova Fronteira |page=980}}</ref><ref>{{Cite Merriam-Webster|jaguarundi|accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> In some [[Spanish language|Spanish]]-speaking countries, the jaguarundi is also called ''gato colorado'', ''gato moro'', ''le\u00f3n brenero'', ''leoncillo'' and ''tigrillo''.<ref name=iucn/> It is also called ''eyra'', ''gato-mourisco'', ''gato-preto'', ''gato-vermelho'' and ''maracaj\u00e1-preto'' in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=de Miranda |first1=E.E. |last2=Gambarini |first2=A. |title=Natureza, Conserva\u00e7\u00e3o e Cultura: Ensaio sobre a Rela\u00e7\u00e3o do Homem com a Natureza no Brasil |trans-title=Nature, Conservation and Culture: Essay on the Relationship between Man and Nature in Brazil |date=2003 |publisher=Metalivros |location=S\u00e3o Paulo |isbn=9788585371470 |page=113 |language=Portuguese}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |editor1-last=Nowell |editor1-first=K. |editor2-last=Jackson |editor2-first=P. |editor3-last=IUCN/SSC Cat Specialist Group |title=Wild Cats: Status Survey and Conservation Action Plan |date=1996 |publisher=IUCN |location=Gland |isbn=978-2-8317-0045-8 |page=146}}</ref>\n\n==Taxonomy==\n''Felis yagouarundi'' was the [[scientific name]] used by [[\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire]] in 1803 who described two [[zoological specimen|specimen]]s from Central America, including one from [[French Guiana]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire, \u00c9. |authorlink=\u00c9tienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire |year=1803 |title=Catalogue des Mammif\u00e8res du Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |trans-title=Catalogue of Mammals of the National Museum of Natural History| language=French |location=Paris |publisher=Museum National d'Histoire Naturelle |page=124 |chapter=Le chat yagouarundi.

The jaguarundi has a broad vocal repertoire; 13 different calls have been recorded including chattering, purring, screaming, a 'wah-wah' call, whistling, yapping and a peculiar bird-like chirp.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover. The kittens are covered well with fur and the underside is marked with spots, which disappear as they age; the coat color gradually changes as the kittens grow older.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ceballos/> The mother starts bringing solid food for the kittens when they are around three weeks old, who simply play with it till the mother ingests it; kittens are capable of taking solid food like birds and guinea pigs at around six weeks. Jaguarundis become sexually mature at one to three years of age. Lifespan up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=Nowak/>\n\n==Distribution and habitat==\nThe jaguarundi inhabits a wide variety of habitats\u2014from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

[[felidae|cat]] native to the Americas. Its range extends from central Argentina in the south to the US-Mexico border in the north, through Central and South America east of the [[Andes]]. The jaguarundi is a medium-sized cat of slender build and uniform coloration that differs significantly from other [[Neotropics|neotropical]] cats in its external appearance. In fact, it is characterized by several [[mustelid]] features\u2014an elongated body with relatively short legs, a small, narrow head, small, round ears, a short [[snout]] and a long tail. Around twice as large as the domestic cat, the jaguarundi stands {{convert|14|in|cm|abbr=on|order=flip}} at the shoulder and weighs {{convert|3.5|\u2013|7|kg|lb|abbr=on}}. There are two color [[Morph (zoology)|morph]]s\u2014red and gray.\n\nSecretive and alert, the jaguarundi is typically solitary or forms pairs in the wild, though captive individuals are gregarious. Unlike other [[Sympatry|sympatric]] cats such as [[ocelot]]s, the jaguarundi is more active during the day and hunts mainly during daytime and evening hours. Individuals live in large [[home range]]s, and are sparsely distributed within a region. Though an efficient climber and swimmer, the jaguarundi typically prefers hunting on ground. The jaguarundi feeds on various kinds of prey, especially ground-feeding birds, reptiles, rodents and small mammals. Mating occurs throughout the year, with peaks at different times of the year across the range. After a [[gestation period]] of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens. Lifespan of up to 15 years has been recorded in captivity.\n\nJaguarundis occur in a broad array of closed as well as open habitats ranging from from tropical rainforests and [[deciduous forest]]s to deserts and [[thorn scrub]]s.

Estrus lasts three to five days, marked by the female regularly rolling onto her back and [[spraying urine]]. [[Sexually mature]] males will pursue the female, not reacting to any aggressive behavior from her side. As in many other felids, the male bites the fur on the female's neck on mounting; the female lets out a loud scream on penetration.<ref name=WCoW/><ref name=ms/>\n\nAfter a [[gestation]] period of 70 to 75 days, the female gives birth to a litter of one to four kittens in a den constructed in a dense thicket, hollow tree, or similar cover.

They ranged in size from 30 to 300 men, depending on the size of the province and the need for their services by the provincial chiefs and the CIA. District Intelligence and Operation Coordinating Centers (DIOCC) would be staffed by representatives from the CIA\u2019s Census Grievance, PRU, Rural Development and Police Special Branch, along with the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police|National Police]] and Military Security Service. They would be run by the district chief\u2019s S-2 and advised by an American officer. Many of the early PRU units were organized along strictly military lines since they were often employed in military operations against main force VC units. In 1967, when [[Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support|Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) took over operation of the PRU program, the CIA decided to give the PRU a countrywide presence and a standard table of organization for a PRU team. It was decided that each PRU team would consist of 18 men broken down into three six-man squads. The senior squad leader in each team became the team leader. The idea was to assign an 18-man PRU team to each district so the team could react quickly to any targets identified by the DIOCC in that district. In theory, each province would be given enough PRU teams for one to be assigned to each DIOCC. This new organization went into effect in late 1967 and was maintained until the PRUs were integrated into the National Police in 1973. This new national-level PRU organization resulted in most districts receiving an 18-man PRU team, which meant that small provinces with only a few districts or no districts had fewer than 50 PRU members assigned while larger, more populous provinces with many districts had as many as 300 PRU members assigned. In total, 4,000 to 6,000 Vietnamese PRU personnel were assigned countrywide to the program during the years 1967 to 1973.<ref name=Finlayson>{{cite book|last=Finlayson|first=Andrew|title=Marine Advisors with the Vietnamese Provincial Reconnaissance Units, 1966-1970|publisher=United States Marine Corps History Division|year=2009|url= https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/VN%20Advisors%20Boards_Marine%20Advisors.pdf|isbn= 978-1470097868}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|8}}\n\nA typical post-1967 provincial PRU organization was the one found in [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province]] in [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]. In this organization, each of the four districts in T\u00e2y Ninh Province was assigned an 18-man PRU team and an additional 18-man team was assigned to the capital of the province as a \u201ccity team\u201d that could mount operations in the densely populated [[T\u00e2y Ninh]] or be used to reinforce one or more of the district teams. A very small headquarters cell consisting of the South Vietnamese PRU commander; his deputy, who was also the leader of the T\u00e2y Ninh PRU team; and an operations/intelligence officer provided the staff planning and interagency coordination for the province. According to the Marines assigned to the PRU, this form of organizational structure worked well despite the paucity of personnel assigned to staff duties.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|9}}\n\n===Recruitment===\nThe recruitment of PRU personnel varied from province to province. Many PRU members were former VC or former [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) soldiers. Some were former [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldiers or former members of a [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group program|Citizen Irregular Defense Group]] (CIDG), while a few were simply local youths who did not want to join the regular ARVN and preferred to serve their country in their own home province. In a few provinces, some paroled criminals were allowed to join the PRU, but the number of such people was few and greatly reduced after 1968. Some had strong religious and community affiliations that made them natural enemies of the VC, such as Catholics, [[Cao Dai]], [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o]] and [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] tribesmen. Most PRU members were strongly motivated by their hatred of the VC. Since there were many people in every province who had a grudge against the VC, there were many South Vietnamese who were eager to join the PRU and this made them a very formidable force and one that made it very difficult for the VC to infiltrate or proselytize. According to Colonel Terence M. Allen, the senior military advisor to the PRU Program in Saigon from 1968 to 1970, the most effective PRU teams were those who were recruited among the Cao Dai and Catholic religious communities and the Montagnard tribes since these groups had a visceral hatred of the VC and a vested interest in protecting their communities from the ravages inflicted on them by the VC.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|9-10}}\n\n===Uniforms and equipment===\nPRU teams were equipped with an assortment of uniforms, weapons, and equipment. Most PRU members dressed in the black pajamas worn by Vietnam\u2019s peasants or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms when they went to the field, but some units actually used VC/[[People\u2019s Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) grey or light green uniforms when such uniforms gave them a tactical advantage. In garrison, most PRU members wore either civilian clothes or the standard PRU tiger-striped camouflage uniform. This wide variety of uniforms made it difficult for both the enemy and friendly units to identify them. Therefore, it was essential that the U.S. PRU advisors coordinate closely with friendly units if the PRU were to operate in areas where U.S. and ARVN units were located. The Marine PRU advisors normally wore black pajamas or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms in the field and civilian clothes while in garrison. Some advisors even wore civilian clothes on PRU operations but this was rare.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|10-1}}\n\nWeapons consisted primarily of [[M16 rifle]]s, [[M1911 pistol|45-caliber pistols]], [[M79 grenade launcher]]s and [[M60 machine gun]]s. However, many PRU units maintained extensive armories of captured weapons, and they often used these in operations against the VC. The PRUs found it convenient to equip some of their men with [[AK-47]] rifles and [[RPG-2|RPG]] grenade launchers, so any VC encountered during an operation in enemy territory would initially think they were fellow VC. This gave the PRUs a distinct tactical advantage in any engagement. Other weapons that were employed by PRU members and their advisors were [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning 9mm]] automatic pistols, [[Colt Cobra]] revolvers, [[Browning Automatic Rifle]]s (BAR), [[M2 Carbine]]s, [[Carl Gustaf m/45|Swedish K submachine gun]]s and [[Bren machine gun]]s. This wide assortment of weapons posed a logistical challenge to some PRU teams, but in most cases there were never any serious shortages of ammunition. Captured enemy ammunition was readily available, and the CIA supply system was able to obtaining almost any ammunition required for operational use. Ammunition for the PRU was often stored within the CIA \u201cembassy house\u201d compounds or in the various PRU armories throughout the provinces so it could be rapidly issued.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|11-2}}\n\nFor communications, the PRUs were equipped with the [[AN/PRC-77 Portable Transceiver|PRC-25]] radio and its ancillary equipment. A few PRU units maintained some high frequency radios for long-range communications, but such radios were not standard issue, and most PRUs needed to establish temporary radio relay sites on mountaintops to support their long-range missions. This was especially true in the mountainous areas of [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]]I Corps. The PRUs were given their own frequencies for tactical communications. They were wary of the enemy intercepting their radio communications, so they seldom used their radios for the transmission of operational details while they were in garrison, choosing instead to use their radios sparingly and primarily during field operations. The PRUs had neither encrypted communications equipment nor code pads, so communications security was often nonexistent, ad hoc, or rudimentary. One of many valuable assets an American PRU advisor brought with him whenever he accompanied a PRU team to the field was the ability to encode communications; however, the use of encoding materials was not frequently employed during most PRU operations, even those that were accompanied by U.S. PRU advisors. Some PRUs did not use radios on their operations, preferring to maintain complete silence until the mission was completed.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nPRU forces were equipped with ground transport in the form of commercial light trucks and motorcycles, which were purchased by the CIA. These trucks and motorcycles were typical of the trucks and motorcycles used by Vietnamese civilians, so their use did not arouse suspicion or draw unwanted attention to them when they were employed by the PRU. It also made repair of these transport assets easy since parts, automotive supplies and repairs could be readily obtained locally. When major repairs were needed, PRU vehicles were taken to the CIA\u2019s automotive repair facility in Saigon. The trucks and motorcycles were never provided in the numbers needed by the PRU. Often, only two to three trucks were given to each province, thus they had to be shared by each district team or kept at province level for use as needed. Most PRU teams suffered because of the lack of organic transport. As a result, the PRUs also used public transportation, such as cyclos and buses, or privately owned motorcycles or bicycles to insert themselves into operational areas. Dressed in civilian clothes and posing as civilian travelers, they were able to blend in with the locals using these modes of transportation until they were near their operational area and ready to engage their targets.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nAlthough most PRU operations did not require U.S. military or ARVN transportation assets, the PRUs did avail themselves of such transport when it was provided to them, usually through the good offices of the Vietnamese province chief, a district U.S. military advisor, or the U.S.PRU advisor. For operations over long distances and in mountainous terrain, the PRUs would rely primarily on U.S. helicopters for insertion and extraction. Most U.S. PRU advisors felt the PRUs would have been even more effective had they possessed additional organic transportation assets, such as three-quarter-ton trucks and motorcycles, and a dedicated helicopter package in each military region. The U.S. PRU advisors stated that they often lost valuable time trying to obtain nonorganic transportation for deep or difficult PRU operations, and these delays often had an adverse impact on the success rate of such operations. Since most PRU targets were fleeting in nature, a timely response, often within 24 hours, was needed to achieve success. The lack of organic or rapidly available transportation assets often meant that the target was gone by the time the transportation had been arranged.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12-3}}\n\n===Command and control===\nThe PRUs were under the operational control of the CIA. However, under an agreement between the GVN and the CIA, the Vietnamese province chiefs were given some control over how and when the PRUs could be used. In some instances, this dual-command relationship caused friction between the local CIA leadership in the province and the province chiefs. The relationship was certainly a violation of the unity of command principle. Theoretically, all PRU operations in a province required both the approval of the provincial officer in charge (POIC), who was the senior CIA officer in the province, and the province chief. In many provinces, the PRUs followed this arrangement, but in some provinces, the CIA disregarded it. Some PRU advisors simply obtained the permission of the POIC and assumed the POIC would get the province chief\u2019s approval. As the program matured, the necessity to fully coordinate PRU arrest orders and operations with the province chiefs became institutionalized.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|13}}\n\nThe PRU command and control authority on the Vietnamese side came down from the president through the minister of interior to the province chiefs and finally down to the district chiefs, but this was more administrative than operational since day-to-day operations of the PRUs were planned and executed under the direct supervision of the CIA. In a practical sense, the CIA POICs controlled the PRUs and used the American PRU advisors to ensure the PRU teams were properly employed on counter-VCI operations. A great deal of authority and independence of action was given to the PRU advisors, often amounting to outright autonomy. Since many POICs were busy with their primary duties, not the least of which was the collection of political and strategic intelligence on the enemy\u2019s Central Office South Vietnam (COSVN) and the North Vietnamese government, they simply did not have the time to micromanage the PRU advisor. Also, many POICs lacked military experience or their military experience was dated. This meant that they did not feel they had the technical expertise to plan and control the types of operations the PRUs were conducting and preferred to leave the operational details to the initiative of the American PRU advisors. Because the PRU advisors had a great deal of control over how and when their PRU teams were employed, the job required a level of maturity and sophistication not commonly found among the normal special operations soldier, sailor, or Marine. The American PRU advisors were unanimous in their recommendation that the best men for assignment to this form of duty should be in the age range of 25 to 30 years old and should have obtained at least the equivalent rank of sergeant (E-5) for enlisted and first lieutenant (O-2) for officers. Ideally, they felt the enlisted advisors should be the equivalent of gunnery sergeants (E-7) and the officers should be captains (0-3). The American PRU advisors were unanimous in their belief that immaturity and emotionalism were two of the most destructive and corrosive characteristics a PRU advisor could possess and, along with a lack of cultural sensitivity, the root causes of most serious problems. The number of U.S. military PRU advisors was small; perhaps no more than 400 were assigned to the program from 1967 to 1971.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|13-4}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Military units and formations of South Vietnam]]\n[[Category:Military units and formations disestablished in 1973]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox military unit\n| unit_name = Provincial Reconnaissance Unit\n| native_name = \n| image =\n| image_size = \n| alt = \n| caption = \n| dates = 1967 \u2013 1975\n| country = {{flagicon|South Vietnam}} [[South Vietnam]]\n| allegiance = \n| branch =\n| type = Paramilitary police\n| role = \n| size =\n| command_structure = \n| garrison = \n| garrison_label = \n| nickname =\n| patron = \n| motto = \n| colors = <!-- or | colours = -->\n| colors_label = <!-- or | colours_label = -->\n| equipment = \n| equipment_label = \n| battles = [[Vietnam War]]\n| decorations = \n| battle_honours = \n| battle_honours_label = \n| disbanded = 1973\n| commander1 = \n| commander1_label = \n| commander2 = \n| commander2_label = \n| notable_commanders = <!-- Insignia -->\n| identification_symbol = \n| identification_symbol_label = \n}}\n\nThe '''Provincial Reconnaissance Unit'''s (PRUs) were [[South Vietnam]]ese special police, led by U.S. military and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) personnel, who fought against the political leadership of the [[Vietcong]] (VC) insurgency under the [[Phoenix Program]] during the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n==History==\n===Structure===\nBefore 1967 the PRUs existed at the provincial level and less than half of the provinces in South Vietnam had such units. They ranged in size from 30 to 300 men, depending on the size of the province and the need for their services by the provincial chiefs and the CIA. District Intelligence and Operation Coordinating Centers (DIOCC) would be staffed by representatives from the CIA\u2019s Census Grievance, PRU, Rural Development and Police Special Branch, along with the [[Republic of Vietnam National Police|National Police]] and Military Security Service. They would be run by the district chief\u2019s S-2 and advised by an American officer. Many of the early PRU units were organized along strictly military lines since they were often employed in military operations against main force VC units. In 1967, when [[Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support|Civil Operations and Rural Development Support]] (CORDS) took over operation of the PRU program, the CIA decided to give the PRU a countrywide presence and a standard table of organization for a PRU team. It was decided that each PRU team would consist of 18 men broken down into three six-man squads. The senior squad leader in each team became the team leader. The idea was to assign an 18-man PRU team to each district so the team could react quickly to any targets identified by the DIOCC in that district. In theory, each province would be given enough PRU teams for one to be assigned to each DIOCC. This new organization went into effect in late 1967 and was maintained until the PRUs were integrated into the National Police in 1973. This new national-level PRU organization resulted in most districts receiving an 18-man PRU team, which meant that small provinces with only a few districts or no districts had fewer than 50 PRU members assigned while larger, more populous provinces with many districts had as many as 300 PRU members assigned. In total, 4,000 to 6,000 Vietnamese PRU personnel were assigned countrywide to the program during the years 1967 to 1973.<ref name=Finlayson>{{cite book|last=Finlayson|first=Andrew|title=Marine Advisors with the Vietnamese Provincial Reconnaissance Units, 1966-1970|publisher=United States Marine Corps History Division|year=2009|url= https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/VN%20Advisors%20Boards_Marine%20Advisors.pdf|isbn= 978-1470097868}}{{PD-notice}}</ref>{{rp|8}}\n\nA typical post-1967 provincial PRU organization was the one found in [[T\u00e2y Ninh Province]] in [[III Corps (South Vietnam)|III Corps]]. In this organization, each of the four districts in T\u00e2y Ninh Province was assigned an 18-man PRU team and an additional 18-man team was assigned to the capital of the province as a \u201ccity team\u201d that could mount operations in the densely populated [[T\u00e2y Ninh]] or be used to reinforce one or more of the district teams. A very small headquarters cell consisting of the South Vietnamese PRU commander; his deputy, who was also the leader of the T\u00e2y Ninh PRU team; and an operations/intelligence officer provided the staff planning and interagency coordination for the province. According to the Marines assigned to the PRU, this form of organizational structure worked well despite the paucity of personnel assigned to staff duties.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|9}}\n\n===Recruitment===\nThe recruitment of PRU personnel varied from province to province. Many PRU members were former VC or former [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam]] (ARVN) soldiers. Some were former [[Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces|Special Forces]] soldiers or former members of a [[Civilian Irregular Defense Group program|Citizen Irregular Defense Group]] (CIDG), while a few were simply local youths who did not want to join the regular ARVN and preferred to serve their country in their own home province. In a few provinces, some paroled criminals were allowed to join the PRU, but the number of such people was few and greatly reduced after 1968. Some had strong religious and community affiliations that made them natural enemies of the VC, such as Catholics, [[Cao Dai]], [[H\u00f2a H\u1ea3o]] and [[Montagnard (Vietnam)|Montagnard]] tribesmen. Most PRU members were strongly motivated by their hatred of the VC. Since there were many people in every province who had a grudge against the VC, there were many South Vietnamese who were eager to join the PRU and this made them a very formidable force and one that made it very difficult for the VC to infiltrate or proselytize. According to Colonel Terence M. Allen, the senior military advisor to the PRU Program in Saigon from 1968 to 1970, the most effective PRU teams were those who were recruited among the Cao Dai and Catholic religious communities and the Montagnard tribes since these groups had a visceral hatred of the VC and a vested interest in protecting their communities from the ravages inflicted on them by the VC.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|9-10}}\n\n===Uniforms and equipment===\nPRU teams were equipped with an assortment of uniforms, weapons, and equipment. Most PRU members dressed in the black pajamas worn by Vietnam\u2019s peasants or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms when they went to the field, but some units actually used VC/[[People\u2019s Army of Vietnam]] (PAVN) grey or light green uniforms when such uniforms gave them a tactical advantage. In garrison, most PRU members wore either civilian clothes or the standard PRU tiger-striped camouflage uniform. This wide variety of uniforms made it difficult for both the enemy and friendly units to identify them. Therefore, it was essential that the U.S. PRU advisors coordinate closely with friendly units if the PRU were to operate in areas where U.S. and ARVN units were located. The Marine PRU advisors normally wore black pajamas or tiger-striped camouflage uniforms in the field and civilian clothes while in garrison. Some advisors even wore civilian clothes on PRU operations but this was rare.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|10-1}}\n\nWeapons consisted primarily of [[M16 rifle]]s, [[M1911 pistol|45-caliber pistols]], [[M79 grenade launcher]]s and [[M60 machine gun]]s. However, many PRU units maintained extensive armories of captured weapons, and they often used these in operations against the VC. The PRUs found it convenient to equip some of their men with [[AK-47]] rifles and [[RPG-2|RPG]] grenade launchers, so any VC encountered during an operation in enemy territory would initially think they were fellow VC. This gave the PRUs a distinct tactical advantage in any engagement. Other weapons that were employed by PRU members and their advisors were [[Browning Hi-Power|Browning 9mm]] automatic pistols, [[Colt Cobra]] revolvers, [[Browning Automatic Rifle]]s (BAR), [[M2 Carbine]]s, [[Carl Gustaf m/45|Swedish K submachine gun]]s and [[Bren machine gun]]s. This wide assortment of weapons posed a logistical challenge to some PRU teams, but in most cases there were never any serious shortages of ammunition. Captured enemy ammunition was readily available, and the CIA supply system was able to obtaining almost any ammunition required for operational use. Ammunition for the PRU was often stored within the CIA \u201cembassy house\u201d compounds or in the various PRU armories throughout the provinces so it could be rapidly issued.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|11-2}}\n\nFor communications, the PRUs were equipped with the [[AN/PRC-77 Portable Transceiver|PRC-25]] radio and its ancillary equipment. A few PRU units maintained some high frequency radios for long-range communications, but such radios were not standard issue, and most PRUs needed to establish temporary radio relay sites on mountaintops to support their long-range missions. This was especially true in the mountainous areas of [[I Corps (South Vietnam)|I Corps]]I Corps. The PRUs were given their own frequencies for tactical communications. They were wary of the enemy intercepting their radio communications, so they seldom used their radios for the transmission of operational details while they were in garrison, choosing instead to use their radios sparingly and primarily during field operations. The PRUs had neither encrypted communications equipment nor code pads, so communications security was often nonexistent, ad hoc, or rudimentary. One of many valuable assets an American PRU advisor brought with him whenever he accompanied a PRU team to the field was the ability to encode communications; however, the use of encoding materials was not frequently employed during most PRU operations, even those that were accompanied by U.S. PRU advisors. Some PRUs did not use radios on their operations, preferring to maintain complete silence until the mission was completed.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nPRU forces were equipped with ground transport in the form of commercial light trucks and motorcycles, which were purchased by the CIA. These trucks and motorcycles were typical of the trucks and motorcycles used by Vietnamese civilians, so their use did not arouse suspicion or draw unwanted attention to them when they were employed by the PRU. It also made repair of these transport assets easy since parts, automotive supplies and repairs could be readily obtained locally. When major repairs were needed, PRU vehicles were taken to the CIA\u2019s automotive repair facility in Saigon. The trucks and motorcycles were never provided in the numbers needed by the PRU. Often, only two to three trucks were given to each province, thus they had to be shared by each district team or kept at province level for use as needed. Most PRU teams suffered because of the lack of organic transport. As a result, the PRUs also used public transportation, such as cyclos and buses, or privately owned motorcycles or bicycles to insert themselves into operational areas. Dressed in civilian clothes and posing as civilian travelers, they were able to blend in with the locals using these modes of transportation until they were near their operational area and ready to engage their targets.<ref name=Finlayson/>{{rp|12}}\n\nAlthough most PRU operations did not require U.S. military or ARVN transportation assets, the PRUs did avail themselves of such transport when it was provided to them, usually through the good offices of the Vietnamese province chief, a district U.S. military advisor, or the U.S.PRU advisor.

Sikhs found employment in laying the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway, in lumber mills and mines. Though they earned less than white workers, they made enough money to send some of it to India and make it possible for their relatives to immigrate to Canada. The first Sikh pioneers came to the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] area in 1905 and originally worked on farms and in the [[lumber]] industry.<ref name=\"Baker\"/>\nBy 1906, there were about 1,500 Sikh workers living in Canada, among about 5,000 East Indians in total.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Although most of the immigrants from South Asia at the time were Sikhs, local ignorance of Eastern religions led to them frequently being assumed to be [[Hindus]]. About 90% of these Sikhs lived in British Columbia. While Canadian politicians, missionaries, unions and the press were opposed to Asian workers<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/komagata-maru|title=Komagata Maru|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref> [[British Columbia]] industrialists were short of labour and thus Sikhs were able to get an early foothold at the turn of the 20th century in British Columbia.\n\nAs with the large numbers of Japanese and Chinese workers already present in Canada, many white workers resented those immigrants and directed their ill-will toward the Sikhs, who were easily recognized by their beards and turbans.  Punjabis were accused of having a caste system, an idea that goes against the foundations of Sikhism. They were portrayed as being riddled with [[trachoma]] and as being unclean in general. To strengthen these racist characterizations, a song called ''White Canada Forever'' was created. All this eventually led to a boat of Sikhs arriving in Vancouver being sent to Victoria.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  In 1907, the year that [[Buckam Singh]] came to British Columbia from Punjab at the age of fourteen, Punjabis were forced to avoid the [[Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907]] by staying indoors.\n\nMost of the Sikhs in Canada in 1907 were retired British army veterans and their families.<ref>[http://sikhs.org/100th/part1a.html Century of Struggle and Success The Sikh Canadian Experience] 13 November 2006</ref>\n[[File:Guru Nanak Gurdwara Delta-Surrey (2010).jpg|thumb|right|Guru Nanak Gurdwara Delta-Surrey, British Columbia]]  These Punjabis had proved themselves as loyal soldiers in the British colonies in Asia and Africa.  However, the Canadian Government did not prevent the use of the illegal scare tactics being used to monitor immigration and prevent Sikhs from seeking employment, and this soon resulted in the cessation of all Indian immigration to Canada. The Canadian Prime Minister, Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] claimed that Indians were unsuited to life in the Canadian climate. However, in a letter to the viceroy, [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|The Earl of Minto]], Sir Wilfred voiced a different opinion, stating that the Chinese were the least adaptable to Canadian ways, whereas Sikhs, which he mistakenly referred to as Hindus, were the most adaptable. Nevertheless, 1,072 Sikhs left for California in 1907. In the same year, the Khalsa Diwan society was set up in Vancouver with branches in Abbotsford, [[New Westminster]], [[Fraser Mills]], [[Duncan Coombs]] and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nIn 1908, Indians were asked by the Canadian Government to leave Canada voluntarily and settle in [[British Honduras]]; it was stated that the \"Mexican\" climate would better suit Indians. A Sikh delegate was sent to what is now [[Belize]] and stayed in the British colony for some time before returning. Upon his return, he advised not only Sikhs, but also the members of other Indian religious groups, to decline the offer, maintaining that conditions in Latin America were unsuitable for Punjabis, although they might be more amenable to South Indians. In 1908, 1,710 Sikhs left British Columbia for California. The first plans to build a temple were made in 1908. After a property was acquired, the settlers carried lumber from a local [[lumber mill|mill]] on their backs up a hill to construct a [[gurdwara]].<ref name=\"Baker\"/>\n\n[[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (not yet the Canadian Prime Minister) visited [[London]] and [[Calcutta]] to express the Canadian view of Indian immigration. As a result, the Indian Government stopped advertising facilities and employment opportunities in North America. This invoked the provisions of Emigration act of 1883 which stopped Sikhs from leaving Canada. The Canadian Government passed two laws, one providing that an immigrant had to have 200 dollars, a steep increase from the previous requirement of 20 dollars, the other authorizing the Minister of the Interior to prohibit entry into Canada to people not arriving from their birth-country by continuous journey and through tickets purchased before leaving the country of their birth or citizenship. These laws were specifically directed at Punjabis and resulted in their population, which had exceeded 5,000 people in 1911, dropping to little more than 2,500.\n\nThe [[History of Canadian nationality law|Immigration Act, 1910]] came under scrutiny when a party of 39 Indians, mostly Sikhs, arriving on a Japanese ship, the Kamagata Maru, succeeded in obtaining ''habeas corpus'' against the immigration department's order of deportation. The Canadian Government then passed a law intended to keep labourers and artisans, whether skilled or unskilled, out of Canada by preventing them from landing at any dock in British Columbia. As Canadian immigration became stricter, more Indians, most of them Sikhs, travelled south to the United States of America. The [[Gur Sikh Temple]] opened on February 26, 1911; Sikhs and non-Sikhs from across British Columbia attended the ceremony and a local newspaper reported on the event. It was the first Gurdwara not only in North America, but also anywhere in the world outside of South Asia, and has since become a Canadian historical landmark and symbol, the only Gurdwara to have similar status outside India. The Khalsa Diwan Society subsequently built Gurdwaras in Vancouver and Victoria.<ref name=\"Gur Sikh Temple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiansikhheritage.ca/en/node/16|title=Gur Sikh Temple &#124; CanadianSikhHeritage.ca|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref> The first and only Sikh settlement in Canada, [[Paldi, British Columbia]] was established as a mill town in 1916.<ref>{{cite web |title=Paldi, BC, The Oldest Sikh Settlement In Canada Falls On Bad Days |url=https://www.darpanmagazine.com/news/national/paldi-bc-the-oldest-sikh-settlement-in-canada-falls-on-bad-days/ |website=darpanmagazine.com |accessdate=16 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref>\n\nThough the objectives of the Khalsa Diwan Society were religious, educational and philanthropic, problems connected to immigration and racism loomed in its proceedings. Alongside the Sikh Diwan, other organizations were set up to counteract the policies of the immigration authorities. The United India League operated in Vancouver, and the Hindustani Association of the Pacific Coast opened in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Gurdwaras became storm centres of political activity. The [[Ghadar Party]] was founded in America in 1913 by Sikhs who had fled to California from British Columbia as a consequence of Canadian immigration rules. Despite originally being directed at the racism encountered by Sikhs in the [[Sacramento Valley]] and in [[Sacramento]] itself, it eventually moved to British Columbia. Thousands of Ghadar journals were published with some even being sent to India.\n\n====The Komagata Maru incident====\n{{main|Komagata Maru incident}}In 1908, a series of ordinances were passed by the federal government, by which Indian immigrants entering Canada had to have 200 Canadian dollars (vs. 25 for Europeans). They also had to arrive directly from the area of birth/nationality- even though there was no direct route between India and Canada.  Because of this legislation, in 1914, a Japanese ship called Komagata Maru chartered by a Sikh businessman which sailed from Hong Kong to Vancouver (with multiple stops) was not allowed to dock at the final port. The ship, which had 376 passengers (340 Sikhs), had to spend over 2 months offshore and only 20 former Canadian residents were allowed to disembark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/jagmeet-singh-hard-questions-facing-canada-multiculturalism-poster-boy|title=The hard questions facing the poster boy of Canadian multiculturalism|last=Block|first=Daniel|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref> [[File:Komagata Maru and Rainbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Komagata Maru]]'' (furthest ship on the left)]]\nIn 1914, Buckam Singh moved to Toronto. Also in 1914, [[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh Sandhu]], from [[Sarhali]], Amritsar, was a well-to-do businessman in Singapore who was aware of the problems that Punjabis were having in getting to Canada due to exclusion laws. He initially wanted to circumvent these laws by hiring a boat to sail from Calcutta to Vancouver. His aim was to help his compatriots whose journeys to Canada had been blocked. In order to achieve his goal, Gurdit Singh purchased the ''Komagata Maru'', a Japanese vessel. Gurdit Singh carried 340 Sikhs, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus in his boat to Canada.\n\nWhen the ship arrived in Canada, it was not allowed to dock. The [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] [[Premier of British Columbia]], [[Richard McBride]], issued a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Meanwhile, a \"Shore Committee\" had been formed with the participation of Hussain Rahim and Sohan Lal Pathak. Protest meetings were held in Canada and the USA. At one, held in Dominion Hall, Vancouver, it was resolved that if the passengers were not allowed off, Indo-Canadians should follow them back to India to start a rebellion (or Ghadar). The shore Committee raised $22,000 [[Canadian dollar|dollars]] as an instalment on chartering the ship. They also launched a test case legal battle in the name of Munshi Singh, one of the passengers. Further, the [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] (founded 1907 to manage Vancouver's gurudwara) offered to pay the 200 dollar admittance fee for every passenger, which was denied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/jagmeet-singh-hard-questions-facing-canada-multiculturalism-poster-boy|title=The hard questions facing the poster boy of Canadian multiculturalism|last=Block|first=Daniel|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref>  On July 7, the full bench of the Supreme Court gave a unanimous judgment that under new Orders-In-Council it had no authority to interfere with the decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization. The Japanese captain was relieved of duty by the angry passengers, but the Canadian government ordered the harbour tug Sea Lion to push the ship out on its homeward journey. On July 19, the angry passengers mounted an attack. Next day the Vancouver newspaper The Sun reported: \"Howling masses of Hindus showered policemen with lumps of coal and bricks... it was like standing underneath a coal chute\".\n\nThe Komagata Maru arrived in Calcutta, India on September 26. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was forced to stop by a British gunboat and with the passengers subsequently being placed under guard. The ship was then diverted approximately {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip|0}} to Budge Budge, where the British intended to put them on a train bound for Punjab. The passengers wanted to stay in Calcutta, and marched on the city, but were forced to return to Budge Budge and re-board the ship. The passengers protested, some refusing to re-board, and the police opened fire, killing 20 and wounding nine others. This incident became known as the [[Budge Budge Riot]]. Gurdit Singh managed to escape and lived in hiding until 1922. He was urged by [[Mohandas Gandhi]] to give himself up as a true patriot. He was imprisoned for five years.\n\n<br />\n\n====First World War====\n[[File:BukamAttestation.jpg|thumb|right|Private Buckam Singh attestation papers, World War I]]\n[[File:Private Bukan Singh gravestone Remembrance Day 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Private Buckam Singh gravestone, annual Sikh Remembrance Day service, Mount Hope Cemetery, Kitchener, Ontario 2012]]\nBuckam Singh enlisted with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] in the spring of 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/collections/virtualmem/Detail/2756353 |title = Private Bukan Singh|year=2012| work=Veterans Affairs Canada Virtual Memorial|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref> Buckam Singh was one of the earliest known Sikhs living in Ontario at the time as well as one of only 9 Sikhs known to have served with Canadian troops in the [[First World War]]. Private Buckam Singh served with the 20th Canadian Infantry Battalion in the battlefields of [[Flanders]] during 1916. Here, Buckam Singh was wounded twice in battle and later received treatment at a hospital run by one of Canada's most famous soldier poets the Doctor Lt. Colonel [[John McCrae]].\n\nWhile recovering from his wounds in England, Private Buckam Singh contracted [[tuberculosis]] and spent his final days in a Kitchener, Ontario military hospital, dying at age 25 in 1919. His grave in Kitchener is the only known First World War Sikh Canadian soldier's grave in Canada. Despite being forgotten for ninety years and never getting to see his family again, Buckam Singh is now being celebrated as not only a Sikh hero, but a Canadian hero.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhmuseum.com/buckam/ |title = Buckam Singh|year=2008| work=The Sikh Museum|accessdate=27 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Growing government support ===\nDue to immigration restrictions, South Asians were not able to bring their relatives from India to Canada. Therefore, they resorted to illegal means to bring them to Canada. This was through the Washington-British Columbia border. When the Canadian Government became aware of the happenings along the borderline, they tightened immigration regulations and South Asian men who stayed even three days longer outside of Canada were denied entrance for violating the three-year limit. In 1937, a controversy surfaced with there being almost three hundred illegal South Asian immigrants in BC. The case was investigated by the RCMP who had eventually solved the case. The Canadian government, however, decided to take this as an opportunity to negotiate with India and refused to deport illegal Sikh immigrants. In fact, the Canadian government pushed the Sikhs into gaining residency in Canada. During the 1940s, South Asians in Canada began to establish their livelihoods despite deep social and economic disturbances. Unemployment was common and the average British Columbian's wage had dropped over 20 percent. White employers were willing to accept Asian workers, this produced insecurities amongst the mainstream community of British Columbia. The result of this was a British Columbia minimum wage law, a law that was ultimately flawed. 25 percent of the employees would be paid 25 percent less and these were invariably Asians. South Asians continued to live under one roof and in extensive families; this support helped them during the Depression period.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indo-Canadians: The Depression & Immigration Issue|last=Mohindra|first=Rimple|date=June 4, 2011|work=Abbotsford News|location=British Columbia, Abbotsford & Greater Vancouver Area}}</ref>\n\nIn 1943, a twelve-man delegation including members of the [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] presented the case of South Asian voting rights to Premier Hart. They said that without the ability to vote, in Canada they were nothing more than second-class citizens. The Premier then made it so that South Asians in British Columbia that had fought in World War II would be granted voting rights, this law was passed in 1945. By 1947, all South Asians had the right to vote due to the Sikh Khalsa Diwan Society. In 1944, the [[Census in Canada|Canadian Census]] showed there to be 1756 Canadian Sikhs with 98% of them living in British Columbia, the initial major port of immigration for Canadian Sikhs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canadiansikhheritage.ca/en/node/9|title=South Asian voting rights granted in Canada due to Sikh demands|accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt was in the 1950s that major immigration to Ontario would start to occur. The celebration of the birth of Guru Nanak was first celebrated in 1954 after a group of Sikhs from England arrived because of the liberalization of the laws due to the acts of the Khalsa Diwan Society. The construction of many gurdwaras had an immense effect on the Sikh population in Ontario.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt36.html|title=Sikh arrival in Ontario|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> Following the founding of the [[East Indian Welfare Association]] by Sikhs, the first ever Sikh was elected to a city council in Mission, B.C. It was reported the following year that there were 2148 Sikhs in Canada.<ref name=\"vahms.org\">http://vahms.org/education/sikh-canadian-history/</ref>\n\n=== New era ===\n[[File:Ontario Khalsa Darbar.jpg|thumb|right|Khalsa Darbar Gurdwara, Ontario]]\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, tens of thousands of skilled Sikhs, some highly educated, settled across Canada, especially in the urban corridor from Toronto to Windsor. As their numbers grew, Sikhs established temporary ''gurdwaras'' in every major city eastward to Montr\u00e9al, with the first gurdwara in Eastern Canada being made in 1965. These were followed in many instances by permanent gurdwaras and Sikh centres. Most cities now have several gurdwaras, each reflecting slightly different religious views, social or political opinions. Through them, Sikhs now have access to a full set of public observances. Central among these are Sunday prayer services, and in many communities the prayers are followed by ''langar'' (a free meal) provided by members of the sangat (governing council of holy men) and the congregation. The Khalsa Diwan Society grew to a much larger amount during the immigration boom of this period. Near the end of the decade in 1979, the Canadian Sikhs, now more racially diverse, celebrated the 500th birthday of [[Guru Amar Das]] to mark the start of the annual Nagar Kirtan's, which would occur in Canada every year following. To celebrate the centennial birthday of the guru, the Khalsa Diwan Society purchased an adjoined building which included a school, museum, daycare and Gurdwara and named it after Guru Amar Das. In the early 1980s, the Khalsa Diwan Society grew slightly more and built a sports complex. Canada would also have its first officially registered Sikh organization, the Federation of Sikh Societies of Canada in the early 1980s. In the months prior to [[Operation Blue Star]], Sikh seats were granted to the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[University of Toronto]]. The launching of [[Operation Bluestar]] enraged many Sikhs in Canada, who had left their homeland long ago in search of better prospects.<ref name=\"vahms.org\"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sikhism|title=Sikhism |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Sikh Insurgency ===\n\n====Militancy====\nExtremism in Canada increased after the [[Operation Bluestar]] to evict militant leader Bhindranwale occupying the Akal Takht inside the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], the holiest shrine of Sikhs, to evade arrest.

Two Sikhs entered the Indian Consulate in Vancouver and smashed all pictures of [[Indira Gandhi]] with swords.

They would spend the day chanting \"Down With Gandhi\" and \"Gandhi is a Murderer\" until the consulate had to agree to relay their demands to the Indian Government.

In 2011, the Gur Sikh Temple in Abbotsford celebrated its one-hundredth birthday. To celebrate, the Government of Canada is funding the building of a museum dedicated to Canadian Sikhism.

Balwant Singh Rajoana was considered a hero among many Sikh youths in Canada, who stated that upon death he would become a martyr. The announcement angered many Sikhs across the world. Many of these angered Sikhs were both Punjabi and converted from Canada, spurring civil unrest among Canadian Sikhs. The World Sikh Organization of Canada had called on the [[United Nations]] to try to make India abolish the death penalty and save Rajoana from death.\n\nUpon the announcement, many Canadian Sikhs, regardless of race, took up [[Nishan Sahib]] and began to protest against the Indian government, and against the execution of Rajoana, in the city of [[Vancouver]]. Other protests happened worldwide in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand and even India itself. Following the release of Kishori Lal, a murderer who had decapitated three innocent Sikhs with a chopper knife, the announcement led Canadian Sikhs to believe that the Indian government was targeting Sikh people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhsiyasat.net/2012/03/29/worldwide-sikh-diaspora-approach-un-human-rights-commission-regarding-proposed-hanging-of-sikh-political-prisioner-in-india/|title=Worldwide Sikh Diaspora approach UN Human Rights Commission regarding proposed hanging of Sikh political prisoner in India - Sikh Siyasat News (in English)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref> In Canada, a large protest in [[Edmonton]] took place on March 25, six days prior to the pending execution.

In British Columbia, various places celebrate the Nagar Kirtan, though it is mainly celebrated in the cities of [[Vancouver]] and Surrey. In Vancouver, the Nagar Kirtan, is used to celebrate the [[Visakhi]] and the birth of [[Khalsa]]. Various Canadian Sikhs, of various ethnic origins, are present in the parade, which usually happens on [[Easter Weekend]]. In Abbotsford, the celebration happens on [[Labour Day Weekend]] and is commemorated in the celebration of the Parkash Divas of the Guru Granth Sahib Ji. The parade in Abbotsford takes place near the Kalgidar Durbar.\n\n=== Vaisakhi ===\n\nVaisakhi celebrations happen in both British Columbia and Ontario, with many including a Nagar Kirtan parade. In Ontario, the Vaisakhi celebrations are reported to get bigger and bigger in terms of festivities and attending populace every year. Many Sikh academies and institutes also participate in the Ontario parades, such as the Akal Academy Brampton. While the Nagar Kirtan in the Ontario Vaisakhi celebration starts at the Malton Gurudwara and ends at the Sikh Spiritual Centre, festivities go on until the Rexdale Gurudwara is reached, it is organized annually by the [[Ontario Gurdwara Committee]]. Nagar Kirtan parades also take place in Alberta.

There is a large population of Sikh people in the city of Surrey; this has led to the availability of a course in the Punjabi language in the fifth grade using the British Columbia Punjabi Language Curriculum. In specific schools in the city of Abbotsford, the Punjabi language too is available as a course that can be taken following the fifth grade in elementary school levels.<ref>[http://abbynet.sd34.bc.ca/modernlanguages/punjabi stationary<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> For Abbotsford, however, when the curriculum was suggested to a more mainstream stray of schools, controversy was brought up, despite Punjabi being Abbotsford's second largest language.

Most of these cases have taken place in the Canadian province of [[Quebec]] where the Sikh religion is incredibly minor to the dominant Abrahamic faiths, compared to other Canadian provinces.\n\n==== Quebec Legislature ====\nIn February 2011, the [[National Assembly of Quebec|Quebec National Assembly]] banned religious daggers, of which the kirpan was included. Upon the announcement, Canadian Sikh Liberal MP [[Navdeep Bains]] revealed his surprise and anger as he had worn the kirpan to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and the [[United States Congress]] without any trouble. The ban sparked a small debate amongst the Canadian Legislatures and news programs as well as backlash from the [[World Sikh Organization]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://religiousliberty.tv/article18-canada.html|title=Article18: Canada - Sikhs Upset After Quebec National Assembly Bans Religious Daggers; Controversy Reignites Multiculturalism Debate - ReligiousLiberty.TV - Celebrating Liberty of Conscience|work=ReligiousLiberty.TV - Celebrating Liberty of Conscience}}</ref> Following this was a vote that the kirpan be banned from all parliamentary buildings including the [[House of Commons of Canada]].

In the Calgary stadium, a [[Gurdas Mann]] concert in 2009 had to be shut down after Sikh ticket holders had refused to remove their kirpans. Jasbeer was reportedly furious due to the case having occurred after it was proven that the kirpan was allowed to legally be worn in public areas due to the Multani v.

Concert promoter Nirmal Dhaliwal revealed his intent on suing the centre due to the lack of revenue brought by the case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1685963&auth=SUN%20MEDIA&archive=true |title=Sikhs' knives out over kirpan controversy|work=Owen Sound Sun-Times|date=August 5, 2009|author=Tarina White}}</ref>\n\n=== Turban cases ===\nThe [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] came under fire when they refused to let turbaned Canadian Sikh officers join their service. In doing so they had indefinitely banned all RCMP officers from wearing a turban, requiring them to wear the standard and traditional RCMP headdress. The ban was a result of the activism of a petition leader named [[Herman Bittner]],<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1990/03/16/canada-says-sikh-mounties-can-wear-turbans/c5fa5ffe-c7e6-42c8-a1dd-eb68426b9938/</ref> who maintained that he was preserving history rather than discriminating.

Sikhs found employment in laying the tracks of the Canadian Pacific Railway, in lumber mills and mines. Though they earned less than white workers, they made enough money to send some of it to India and make it possible for their relatives to immigrate to Canada. The first Sikh pioneers came to the [[Abbotsford, British Columbia|Abbotsford]] area in 1905 and originally worked on farms and in the [[lumber]] industry.<ref name=\"Baker\"/>\nBy 1906, there were about 1,500 Sikh workers living in Canada, among about 5,000 East Indians in total.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  Although most of the immigrants from South Asia at the time were Sikhs, local ignorance of Eastern religions led to them frequently being assumed to be [[Hindus]]. About 90% of these Sikhs lived in British Columbia. While Canadian politicians, missionaries, unions and the press were opposed to Asian workers<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/komagata-maru|title=Komagata Maru|encyclopedia=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]]|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref> [[British Columbia]] industrialists were short of labour and thus Sikhs were able to get an early foothold at the turn of the 20th century in British Columbia.\n\nAs with the large numbers of Japanese and Chinese workers already present in Canada, many white workers resented those immigrants and directed their ill-will toward the Sikhs, who were easily recognized by their beards and turbans.  Punjabis were accused of having a caste system, an idea that goes against the foundations of Sikhism. They were portrayed as being riddled with [[trachoma]] and as being unclean in general. To strengthen these racist characterizations, a song called ''White Canada Forever'' was created. All this eventually led to a boat of Sikhs arriving in Vancouver being sent to Victoria.{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}  In 1907, the year that [[Buckam Singh]] came to British Columbia from Punjab at the age of fourteen, Punjabis were forced to avoid the [[Anti-Oriental Riots of 1907]] by staying indoors.\n\nMost of the Sikhs in Canada in 1907 were retired British army veterans and their families.<ref>[http://sikhs.org/100th/part1a.html Century of Struggle and Success The Sikh Canadian Experience] 13 November 2006</ref>\n[[File:Guru Nanak Gurdwara Delta-Surrey (2010).jpg|thumb|right|Guru Nanak Gurdwara Delta-Surrey, British Columbia]]  These Punjabis had proved themselves as loyal soldiers in the British colonies in Asia and Africa.  However, the Canadian Government did not prevent the use of the illegal scare tactics being used to monitor immigration and prevent Sikhs from seeking employment, and this soon resulted in the cessation of all Indian immigration to Canada. The Canadian Prime Minister, Sir [[Wilfrid Laurier]] claimed that Indians were unsuited to life in the Canadian climate. However, in a letter to the viceroy, [[Gilbert Elliot-Murray-Kynynmound, 4th Earl of Minto|The Earl of Minto]], Sir Wilfred voiced a different opinion, stating that the Chinese were the least adaptable to Canadian ways, whereas Sikhs, which he mistakenly referred to as Hindus, were the most adaptable. Nevertheless, 1,072 Sikhs left for California in 1907. In the same year, the Khalsa Diwan society was set up in Vancouver with branches in Abbotsford, [[New Westminster]], [[Fraser Mills]], [[Duncan Coombs]] and [[Ocean Falls]].\n\nIn 1908, Indians were asked by the Canadian Government to leave Canada voluntarily and settle in [[British Honduras]]; it was stated that the \"Mexican\" climate would better suit Indians. A Sikh delegate was sent to what is now [[Belize]] and stayed in the British colony for some time before returning. Upon his return, he advised not only Sikhs, but also the members of other Indian religious groups, to decline the offer, maintaining that conditions in Latin America were unsuitable for Punjabis, although they might be more amenable to South Indians. In 1908, 1,710 Sikhs left British Columbia for California. The first plans to build a temple were made in 1908. After a property was acquired, the settlers carried lumber from a local [[lumber mill|mill]] on their backs up a hill to construct a [[gurdwara]].<ref name=\"Baker\"/>\n\n[[William Lyon Mackenzie King]] (not yet the Canadian Prime Minister) visited [[London]] and [[Calcutta]] to express the Canadian view of Indian immigration. As a result, the Indian Government stopped advertising facilities and employment opportunities in North America. This invoked the provisions of Emigration act of 1883 which stopped Sikhs from leaving Canada. The Canadian Government passed two laws, one providing that an immigrant had to have 200 dollars, a steep increase from the previous requirement of 20 dollars, the other authorizing the Minister of the Interior to prohibit entry into Canada to people not arriving from their birth-country by continuous journey and through tickets purchased before leaving the country of their birth or citizenship. These laws were specifically directed at Punjabis and resulted in their population, which had exceeded 5,000 people in 1911, dropping to little more than 2,500.\n\nThe [[History of Canadian nationality law|Immigration Act, 1910]] came under scrutiny when a party of 39 Indians, mostly Sikhs, arriving on a Japanese ship, the Kamagata Maru, succeeded in obtaining ''habeas corpus'' against the immigration department's order of deportation. The Canadian Government then passed a law intended to keep labourers and artisans, whether skilled or unskilled, out of Canada by preventing them from landing at any dock in British Columbia. As Canadian immigration became stricter, more Indians, most of them Sikhs, travelled south to the United States of America. The [[Gur Sikh Temple]] opened on February 26, 1911; Sikhs and non-Sikhs from across British Columbia attended the ceremony and a local newspaper reported on the event. It was the first Gurdwara not only in North America, but also anywhere in the world outside of South Asia, and has since become a Canadian historical landmark and symbol, the only Gurdwara to have similar status outside India. The Khalsa Diwan Society subsequently built Gurdwaras in Vancouver and Victoria.<ref name=\"Gur Sikh Temple\">{{cite web|url=http://www.canadiansikhheritage.ca/en/node/16|title=Gur Sikh Temple &#124; CanadianSikhHeritage.ca|accessdate=7 April 2011}}</ref>\n\nThough the objectives of the Khalsa Diwan Society were religious, educational and philanthropic, problems connected to immigration and racism loomed in its proceedings. Alongside the Sikh Diwan, other organizations were set up to counteract the policies of the immigration authorities. The United India League operated in Vancouver, and the Hindustani Association of the Pacific Coast opened in [[Portland, Oregon]]. Gurdwaras became storm centres of political activity. The [[Ghadar Party]] was founded in America in 1913 by Sikhs who had fled to California from British Columbia as a consequence of Canadian immigration rules. Despite originally being directed at the racism encountered by Sikhs in the [[Sacramento Valley]] and in [[Sacramento]] itself, it eventually moved to British Columbia. Thousands of Ghadar journals were published with some even being sent to India.\n\n====The Komagata Maru incident====\n{{main|Komagata Maru incident}}In 1908, a series of ordinances were passed by the federal government, by which Indian immigrants entering Canada had to have 200 Canadian dollars (vs. 25 for Europeans). They also had to arrive directly from the area of birth/nationality- even though there was no direct route between India and Canada.  Because of this legislation, in 1914, a Japanese ship called Komagata Maru chartered by a Sikh businessman which sailed from Hong Kong to Vancouver (with multiple stops) was not allowed to dock at the final port. The ship, which had 376 passengers (340 Sikhs), had to spend over 2 months offshore and only 20 former Canadian residents were allowed to disembark.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/jagmeet-singh-hard-questions-facing-canada-multiculturalism-poster-boy|title=The hard questions facing the poster boy of Canadian multiculturalism|last=Block|first=Daniel|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref> [[File:Komagata Maru and Rainbow.jpg|thumb|250px|right|''[[Komagata Maru]]'' (furthest ship on the left)]]\nIn 1914, Buckam Singh moved to Toronto. Also in 1914, [[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh Sandhu]], from [[Sarhali]], Amritsar, was a well-to-do businessman in Singapore who was aware of the problems that Punjabis were having in getting to Canada due to exclusion laws. He initially wanted to circumvent these laws by hiring a boat to sail from Calcutta to Vancouver. His aim was to help his compatriots whose journeys to Canada had been blocked. In order to achieve his goal, Gurdit Singh purchased the ''Komagata Maru'', a Japanese vessel. Gurdit Singh carried 340 Sikhs, 24 Muslims, and 12 Hindus in his boat to Canada.\n\nWhen the ship arrived in Canada, it was not allowed to dock. The [[British Columbia Conservative Party|Conservative]] [[Premier of British Columbia]], [[Richard McBride]], issued a categorical statement that the passengers would not be allowed to disembark. Meanwhile, a \"Shore Committee\" had been formed with the participation of Hussain Rahim and Sohan Lal Pathak. Protest meetings were held in Canada and the USA. At one, held in Dominion Hall, Vancouver, it was resolved that if the passengers were not allowed off, Indo-Canadians should follow them back to India to start a rebellion (or Ghadar). The shore Committee raised $22,000 [[Canadian dollar|dollars]] as an instalment on chartering the ship. They also launched a test case legal battle in the name of Munshi Singh, one of the passengers. Further, the [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] (founded 1907 to manage Vancouver's gurudwara) offered to pay the 200 dollar admittance fee for every passenger, which was denied.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://caravanmagazine.in/reportage/jagmeet-singh-hard-questions-facing-canada-multiculturalism-poster-boy|title=The hard questions facing the poster boy of Canadian multiculturalism|last=Block|first=Daniel|website=The Caravan|language=en|access-date=2019-08-19}}</ref>  On July 7, the full bench of the Supreme Court gave a unanimous judgment that under new Orders-In-Council it had no authority to interfere with the decisions of the Department of Immigration and Colonization. The Japanese captain was relieved of duty by the angry passengers, but the Canadian government ordered the harbour tug Sea Lion to push the ship out on its homeward journey. On July 19, the angry passengers mounted an attack. Next day the Vancouver newspaper The Sun reported: \"Howling masses of Hindus showered policemen with lumps of coal and bricks... it was like standing underneath a coal chute\".\n\nThe Komagata Maru arrived in Calcutta, India on September 26. Upon entry into the harbour, the ship was forced to stop by a British gunboat and with the passengers subsequently being placed under guard. The ship was then diverted approximately {{convert|17|mi|km|abbr=off|order=flip|0}} to Budge Budge, where the British intended to put them on a train bound for Punjab. The passengers wanted to stay in Calcutta, and marched on the city, but were forced to return to Budge Budge and re-board the ship. The passengers protested, some refusing to re-board, and the police opened fire, killing 20 and wounding nine others. This incident became known as the [[Budge Budge Riot]]. Gurdit Singh managed to escape and lived in hiding until 1922. He was urged by [[Mohandas Gandhi]] to give himself up as a true patriot. He was imprisoned for five years.\n\n<br />\n\n====First World War====\n[[File:BukamAttestation.jpg|thumb|right|Private Buckam Singh attestation papers, World War I]]\n[[File:Private Bukan Singh gravestone Remembrance Day 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Private Buckam Singh gravestone, annual Sikh Remembrance Day service, Mount Hope Cemetery, Kitchener, Ontario 2012]]\nBuckam Singh enlisted with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] in the spring of 1915.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.veterans.gc.ca/eng/collections/virtualmem/Detail/2756353 |title = Private Bukan Singh|year=2012| work=Veterans Affairs Canada Virtual Memorial|accessdate=17 November 2012}}</ref> Buckam Singh was one of the earliest known Sikhs living in Ontario at the time as well as one of only 9 Sikhs known to have served with Canadian troops in the [[First World War]].

Here, Buckam Singh was wounded twice in battle and later received treatment at a hospital run by one of Canada's most famous soldier poets the Doctor Lt. Colonel [[John McCrae]].\n\nWhile recovering from his wounds in England, Private Buckam Singh contracted [[tuberculosis]] and spent his final days in a Kitchener, Ontario military hospital, dying at age 25 in 1919. His grave in Kitchener is the only known First World War Sikh Canadian soldier's grave in Canada. Despite being forgotten for ninety years and never getting to see his family again, Buckam Singh is now being celebrated as not only a Sikh hero, but a Canadian hero.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sikhmuseum.com/buckam/ |title = Buckam Singh|year=2008| work=The Sikh Museum|accessdate=27 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n=== Growing government support ===\nDue to immigration restrictions, South Asians were not able to bring their relatives from India to Canada. Therefore, they resorted to illegal means to bring them to Canada. This was through the Washington-British Columbia border. When the Canadian Government became aware of the happenings along the borderline, they tightened immigration regulations and South Asian men who stayed even three days longer outside of Canada were denied entrance for violating the three-year limit. In 1937, a controversy surfaced with there being almost three hundred illegal South Asian immigrants in BC. The case was investigated by the RCMP who had eventually solved the case. The Canadian government, however, decided to take this as an opportunity to negotiate with India and refused to deport illegal Sikh immigrants. In fact, the Canadian government pushed the Sikhs into gaining residency in Canada. During the 1940s, South Asians in Canada began to establish their livelihoods despite deep social and economic disturbances. Unemployment was common and the average British Columbian's wage had dropped over 20 percent. White employers were willing to accept Asian workers, this produced insecurities amongst the mainstream community of British Columbia. The result of this was a British Columbia minimum wage law, a law that was ultimately flawed. 25 percent of the employees would be paid 25 percent less and these were invariably Asians. South Asians continued to live under one roof and in extensive families; this support helped them during the Depression period.<ref>{{cite news|title=Indo-Canadians: The Depression & Immigration Issue|last=Mohindra|first=Rimple|date=June 4, 2011|work=Abbotsford News|location=British Columbia, Abbotsford & Greater Vancouver Area}}</ref>\n\nIn 1943, a twelve-man delegation including members of the [[Khalsa Diwan Society Vancouver|Khalsa Diwan Society]] presented the case of South Asian voting rights to Premier Hart. They said that without the ability to vote, in Canada they were nothing more than second-class citizens. The Premier then made it so that South Asians in British Columbia that had fought in World War II would be granted voting rights, this law was passed in 1945. By 1947, all South Asians had the right to vote due to the Sikh Khalsa Diwan Society. In 1944, the [[Census in Canada|Canadian Census]] showed there to be 1756 Canadian Sikhs with 98% of them living in British Columbia, the initial major port of immigration for Canadian Sikhs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.canadiansikhheritage.ca/en/node/9|title=South Asian voting rights granted in Canada due to Sikh demands|accessdate=5 June 2011}}</ref>\n\nIt was in the 1950s that major immigration to Ontario would start to occur. The celebration of the birth of Guru Nanak was first celebrated in 1954 after a group of Sikhs from England arrived because of the liberalization of the laws due to the acts of the Khalsa Diwan Society. The construction of many gurdwaras had an immense effect on the Sikh population in Ontario.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.tgmag.ca/magic/mt36.html|title=Sikh arrival in Ontario|accessdate=5 February 2012}}</ref> Following the founding of the [[East Indian Welfare Association]] by Sikhs, the first ever Sikh was elected to a city council in Mission, B.C. It was reported the following year that there were 2148 Sikhs in Canada.<ref name=\"vahms.org\">http://vahms.org/education/sikh-canadian-history/</ref>\n\n=== New era ===\n[[File:Ontario Khalsa Darbar.jpg|thumb|right|Khalsa Darbar Gurdwara, Ontario]]\nIn the 1960s and 1970s, tens of thousands of skilled Sikhs, some highly educated, settled across Canada, especially in the urban corridor from Toronto to Windsor. As their numbers grew, Sikhs established temporary ''gurdwaras'' in every major city eastward to Montr\u00e9al, with the first gurdwara in Eastern Canada being made in 1965. These were followed in many instances by permanent gurdwaras and Sikh centres. Most cities now have several gurdwaras, each reflecting slightly different religious views, social or political opinions. Through them, Sikhs now have access to a full set of public observances. Central among these are Sunday prayer services, and in many communities the prayers are followed by ''langar'' (a free meal) provided by members of the sangat (governing council of holy men) and the congregation. The Khalsa Diwan Society grew to a much larger amount during the immigration boom of this period. Near the end of the decade in 1979, the Canadian Sikhs, now more racially diverse, celebrated the 500th birthday of [[Guru Amar Das]] to mark the start of the annual Nagar Kirtan's, which would occur in Canada every year following. To celebrate the centennial birthday of the guru, the Khalsa Diwan Society purchased an adjoined building which included a school, museum, daycare and Gurdwara and named it after Guru Amar Das. In the early 1980s, the Khalsa Diwan Society grew slightly more and built a sports complex. Canada would also have its first officially registered Sikh organization, the Federation of Sikh Societies of Canada in the early 1980s. In the months prior to [[Operation Blue Star]], Sikh seats were granted to the [[University of British Columbia]] and the [[University of Toronto]]. The launching of [[Operation Bluestar]] enraged many Sikhs in Canada, who had left their homeland long ago in search of better prospects.<ref name=\"vahms.org\"/><ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/sikhism|title=Sikhism |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=September 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\n=== Sikh Insurgency ===\n\n====Militancy====\nExtremism in Canada increased after the [[Operation Bluestar]] to evict militant leader Bhindranwale occupying the Akal Takht inside the [[Harmandir Sahib|Golden Temple]], the holiest shrine of Sikhs, to evade arrest.

It is the only gurdwara declared a national historic landmark outside of South Asia.<ref name=\"Gur Sikh Temple\"/> In 2007 the temple was completely renovated and reopened. In 2011, the Gur Sikh Temple in Abbotsford celebrated its one-hundredth birthday. To celebrate, the Government of Canada is funding the building of a museum dedicated to Canadian Sikhism. During the anniversary celebration, Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] gave a speech to the Punjabi Community as to how the Gur Sikh Temple is a shrine to all immigrants into Canada, not just Sikh ones. 2011 was declared the Centennial year for Canadian Sikhs.<ref name=\"Gur Sikh Temple\"/>\n\n==== Rajoana protests (2005\u20132012) ====\nIn 2005, it was announced that Balwant Singh Rajoana would be hanged under the death penalty for the murder of former Punjab Chief Minister Beant Singh on March 31 in Patiala. Balwant Singh Rajoana was considered a hero among many Sikh youths in Canada, who stated that upon death he would become a martyr. The announcement angered many Sikhs across the world. Many of these angered Sikhs were both Punjabi and converted from Canada, spurring civil unrest among Canadian Sikhs. The World Sikh Organization of Canada had called on the [[United Nations]] to try to make India abolish the death penalty and save Rajoana from death.\n\nUpon the announcement, many Canadian Sikhs, regardless of race, took up [[Nishan Sahib]] and began to protest against the Indian government, and against the execution of Rajoana, in the city of [[Vancouver]]. Other protests happened worldwide in the United Kingdom, United States, Australia, New Zealand and even India itself. Following the release of Kishori Lal, a murderer who had decapitated three innocent Sikhs with a chopper knife, the announcement led Canadian Sikhs to believe that the Indian government was targeting Sikh people.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sikhsiyasat.net/2012/03/29/worldwide-sikh-diaspora-approach-un-human-rights-commission-regarding-proposed-hanging-of-sikh-political-prisioner-in-india/|title=Worldwide Sikh Diaspora approach UN Human Rights Commission regarding proposed hanging of Sikh political prisoner in India - Sikh Siyasat News (in English)<!-- Bot generated title -->|publisher=|accessdate=6 January 2019}}</ref> In Canada, a large protest in [[Edmonton]] took place on March 25, six days prior to the pending execution.

In Vancouver, the Nagar Kirtan, is used to celebrate the [[Visakhi]] and the birth of [[Khalsa]]. Various Canadian Sikhs, of various ethnic origins, are present in the parade, which usually happens on [[Easter Weekend]].

While the Nagar Kirtan in the Ontario Vaisakhi celebration starts at the Malton Gurudwara and ends at the Sikh Spiritual Centre, festivities go on until the Rexdale Gurudwara is reached, it is organized annually by the [[Ontario Gurdwara Committee]].

Upon the announcement, Canadian Sikh Liberal MP [[Navdeep Bains]] revealed his surprise and anger as he had worn the kirpan to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] and the [[United States Congress]] without any trouble.

Jasbeer was reportedly furious due to the case having occurred after it was proven that the kirpan was allowed to legally be worn in public areas due to the Multani v.

Concert promoter Nirmal Dhaliwal revealed his intent on suing the centre due to the lack of revenue brought by the case.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.owensoundsuntimes.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1685963&auth=SUN%20MEDIA&archive=true |title=Sikhs' knives out over kirpan controversy|work=Owen Sound Sun-Times|date=August 5, 2009|author=Tarina White}}</ref>\n\n=== Turban cases ===\nThe [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] came under fire when they refused to let turbaned Canadian Sikh officers join their service. In doing so they had indefinitely banned all RCMP officers from wearing a turban, requiring them to wear the standard and traditional RCMP headdress.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} After Cooke's death, Louisa remained in residence at Donhead Lodge until 1813.{{r|DH:30}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton|John Knox Laughton's]] entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn.

Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|left|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on Barkers Hill.{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} After Cooke's death, Louisa remained in residence at Donhead Lodge until 1813.{{r|DH:30}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} She died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n==Notes==\n{{refbegin}}\n'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A.
