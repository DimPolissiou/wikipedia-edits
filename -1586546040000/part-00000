Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.</ref>\n\n===Internal combustion engine===\n{{Main|Nitrous oxide engine}}\n\nIn vehicle [[racing]], nitrous oxide (often referred to as just \"[[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous]]\") allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen during combustion. The increase in oxygen allows for an increase in the injection of fuel, allowing the engine to produce more [[engine power]]. The gas is not flammable at a low pressure/temperature, but it delivers more [[oxygen]] than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures, about 570 degrees F (~300C). Therefore, it often is mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate. Nitrous oxide is a strong oxidising agent, roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, and much stronger than oxygen gas.\n\nNitrous oxide is stored as a compressed liquid; the [[heat of vaporization|evaporation]] and expansion of liquid nitrous oxide in the [[intake manifold]] causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into (or prior to) the intake manifold, whereas other systems directly inject, right before the cylinder (direct port injection) to increase power.\n\nThe technique was used during [[World War II]] by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft with the [[GM-1]] system to boost the power output of [[aircraft engine]]s. Originally meant to provide the Luftwaffe standard aircraft with superior high-altitude performance, technological considerations limited its use to extremely high altitudes. Accordingly, it was only used by specialised planes such as high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]], [[schnellbomber|high-speed bombers]] and high-altitude [[interceptor aircraft]]. It sometimes could be found on Luftwaffe aircraft also fitted with another engine-boost system, [[MW 50]], a form of [[Water injection (engine)|water injection]] for aviation engines that used [[methanol]] for its boost capabilities.\n\nOne of the major problems of using nitrous oxide in a reciprocating engine is that it can produce enough power to damage or destroy the engine. Very large power increases are possible, and if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced, the engine may be severely damaged, or destroyed, during this kind of operation. It is very important with nitrous oxide augmentation of [[petrol engine]]s to maintain proper [[operating temperature]]s and fuel levels to prevent \"pre-ignition\",<ref>Cline, Allen W. (January 2000) [http://www.contactmagazine.com/Issue54/EngineBasics.html \"Engine Basics: Detonation and Pre-Ignition\"]. ''CONTACT!'' Magazine</ref> or \"detonation\" (sometimes referred to as \"knock\"). Most problems that are associated with nitrous oxide do not come from mechanical failure due to the power increases. Since nitrous oxide allows a much denser charge into the cylinder, it dramatically increases cylinder pressures. The increased pressure and temperature can cause problems such as melting the piston or valves. It also may crack or warp the piston or head and cause pre-ignition due to uneven heating.\n\nAutomotive-grade liquid nitrous oxide differs slightly from medical-grade nitrous oxide. A small amount of [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) is added to prevent substance abuse.<ref name=\"Automotive gas\">{{cite web|url=https://www.holley.com/support/faq/?category=NOS |work=Holley |title=Holley performance products, FAQ for Nitrous Oxide Systems |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Multiple washes through a base (such as [[sodium hydroxide]]) can remove this, decreasing the corrosive properties observed when {{chem|SO|2}} is further oxidised during combustion into [[sulfuric acid]], making emissions cleaner.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Aerosol propellant===\n[[File:N2O whippets.jpg|thumb|right|Food-grade {{chem|N|2|O}} [[whipped-cream charger|whippets]]]]\nThe gas is approved for use as a [[food additive]] ([[E number|E&nbsp;number]]: E942), specifically as an [[Aerosol spray#Aerosol propellants|aerosol spray propellant]]. Its most common uses in this context are in aerosol [[whipped cream]] canisters and [[cooking spray]]s.\n\nThe gas is extremely soluble in fatty compounds. In aerosol whipped cream, it is dissolved in the fatty cream until it leaves the can, when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam. Used in this way, it produces whipped cream which is four times the volume of the liquid, whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume. If air were used as a propellant, oxygen would accelerate [[rancidification]] of the butterfat, but nitrous oxide inhibits such degradation. Carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water, which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer-like \"sparkling\" sensation.\n\nThe whipped cream produced with nitrous oxide is unstable, however, and will return to a more liquid state within half an hour to one hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.explora-science.net/nitrousoxide-use-as-a-propellant-and-in-cooking/|title=Explora Science {{!}} Nitrous use as a propellant and in cooking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Thus, the method is not suitable for decorating food that will not be served immediately.\n\nDuring December 2016, some manufacturers reported a shortage of aerosol whipped creams in the United States due to an explosion at the [[Air Liquide]] nitrous oxide facility in [[Florida]] in late August. With a major facility offline, the disruption caused a shortage resulting in the company diverting the supply of nitrous oxide to medical clients rather than to food manufacturing. The shortage came during the [[Christmas and holiday season]] when canned whipped cream use is normally at its highest.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/21/the-real-reason-you-cant-buy-whipped-cream-this-christmas/ |title=The real reason grocery stores are running out of whipped cream this Christmas |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2016-12-22 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[cooking spray]], which is made from various types of oils combined with [[lecithin]] (an [[emulsifier]]), may use nitrous oxide as a [[propellant]].

This book was important for two reasons. First, James Watt had invented a novel machine to produce \"Factitious Airs\" (i.e. nitrous oxide) and a novel \"breathing apparatus\" to inhale the gas. Second, the book also presented the new medical theories by Thomas Beddoes, that [[tuberculosis]] and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of \"Factitious Airs\".<ref name=\"Drug discovery\" />\n\n[[File:Anaesthesia exhibition, 1946 Wellcome M0009908.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Humphry Davy]]'s ''Researches chemical and philosophical: chiefly concerning nitrous oxide'' (1800), pages 556 and 557 (right), outlining potential anaesthetic properties of nitrous oxide in relieving pain during surgery]]\nThe machine to produce \"Factitious Airs\" had three parts: a furnace to burn the needed material, a vessel with water where the produced gas passed through in a spiral pipe (for impurities to be \"washed off\"), and finally the gas cylinder with a gasometer where the gas produced, \"air\", could be tapped into portable air bags (made of airtight oily silk). The breathing apparatus consisted of one of the portable air bags connected with a tube to a mouthpiece. With this new equipment being engineered and produced by 1794, the way was paved for [[clinical trial]]s,{{Clarify|date=April 2011}} which began in 1798 when [[Thomas Beddoes]] established the ''\"[[Pneumatic Institution]] for Relieving Diseases by Medical Airs\"'' in [[Hotwells]] ([[Bristol]]).

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft.</ref>\n\n===Internal combustion engine===\n{{Main|Nitrous oxide engine}}\n\nIn vehicle [[racing]], nitrous oxide (often referred to as just \"[[Nitrous oxide engine|nitrous]]\") allows the engine to burn more fuel by providing more oxygen during combustion. The increase in oxygen allows for an increase in the injection of fuel, allowing the engine to produce more [[engine power]]. The gas is not flammable at a low pressure/temperature, but it delivers more [[oxygen]] than atmospheric air by breaking down at elevated temperatures, about 570 degrees F (~300C). Therefore, it often is mixed with another fuel that is easier to deflagrate. Nitrous oxide is a strong oxidising agent, roughly equivalent to hydrogen peroxide, and much stronger than oxygen gas.\n\nNitrous oxide is stored as a compressed liquid; the [[heat of vaporization|evaporation]] and expansion of liquid nitrous oxide in the [[intake manifold]] causes a large drop in intake charge temperature, resulting in a denser charge, further allowing more air/fuel mixture to enter the cylinder. Sometimes nitrous oxide is injected into (or prior to) the intake manifold, whereas other systems directly inject, right before the cylinder (direct port injection) to increase power.\n\nThe technique was used during [[World War II]] by [[Luftwaffe]] aircraft with the [[GM-1]] system to boost the power output of [[aircraft engine]]s. Originally meant to provide the Luftwaffe standard aircraft with superior high-altitude performance, technological considerations limited its use to extremely high altitudes. Accordingly, it was only used by specialised planes such as high-altitude [[reconnaissance aircraft]], [[schnellbomber|high-speed bombers]] and high-altitude [[interceptor aircraft]]. It sometimes could be found on Luftwaffe aircraft also fitted with another engine-boost system, [[MW 50]], a form of [[Water injection (engine)|water injection]] for aviation engines that used [[methanol]] for its boost capabilities.\n\nOne of the major problems of using nitrous oxide in a reciprocating engine is that it can produce enough power to damage or destroy the engine. Very large power increases are possible, and if the mechanical structure of the engine is not properly reinforced, the engine may be severely damaged, or destroyed, during this kind of operation. It is very important with nitrous oxide augmentation of [[petrol engine]]s to maintain proper [[operating temperature]]s and fuel levels to prevent \"pre-ignition\",<ref>Cline, Allen W. (January 2000) [http://www.contactmagazine.com/Issue54/EngineBasics.html \"Engine Basics: Detonation and Pre-Ignition\"]. ''CONTACT!'' Magazine</ref> or \"detonation\" (sometimes referred to as \"knock\"). Most problems that are associated with nitrous oxide do not come from mechanical failure due to the power increases. Since nitrous oxide allows a much denser charge into the cylinder, it dramatically increases cylinder pressures. The increased pressure and temperature can cause problems such as melting the piston or valves. It also may crack or warp the piston or head and cause pre-ignition due to uneven heating.\n\nAutomotive-grade liquid nitrous oxide differs slightly from medical-grade nitrous oxide. A small amount of [[sulfur dioxide]] ({{chem|SO|2}}) is added to prevent substance abuse.<ref name=\"Automotive gas\">{{cite web|url=https://www.holley.com/support/faq/?category=NOS |work=Holley |title=Holley performance products, FAQ for Nitrous Oxide Systems |accessdate=18 December 2013}}</ref> Multiple washes through a base (such as [[sodium hydroxide]]) can remove this, decreasing the corrosive properties observed when {{chem|SO|2}} is further oxidised during combustion into [[sulfuric acid]], making emissions cleaner.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}\n\n===Aerosol propellant===\n[[File:N2O whippets.jpg|thumb|right|Food-grade {{chem|N|2|O}} [[whipped-cream charger|whippets]]]]\nThe gas is approved for use as a [[food additive]] ([[E number|E&nbsp;number]]: E942), specifically as an [[Aerosol spray#Aerosol propellants|aerosol spray propellant]]. Its most common uses in this context are in aerosol [[whipped cream]] canisters and [[cooking spray]]s.\n\nThe gas is extremely soluble in fatty compounds. In aerosol whipped cream, it is dissolved in the fatty cream until it leaves the can, when it becomes gaseous and thus creates foam. Used in this way, it produces whipped cream which is four times the volume of the liquid, whereas whipping air into cream only produces twice the volume. If air were used as a propellant, oxygen would accelerate [[rancidification]] of the butterfat, but nitrous oxide inhibits such degradation. Carbon dioxide cannot be used for whipped cream because it is acidic in water, which would curdle the cream and give it a seltzer-like \"sparkling\" sensation.\n\nThe whipped cream produced with nitrous oxide is unstable, however, and will return to a more liquid state within half an hour to one hour.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.explora-science.net/nitrousoxide-use-as-a-propellant-and-in-cooking/|title=Explora Science {{!}} Nitrous use as a propellant and in cooking|language=en-US|access-date=2019-02-19}}</ref> Thus, the method is not suitable for decorating food that will not be served immediately.\n\nDuring December 2016, some manufacturers reported a shortage of aerosol whipped creams in the United States due to an explosion at the [[Air Liquide]] nitrous oxide facility in [[Florida]] in late August. With a major facility offline, the disruption caused a shortage resulting in the company diverting the supply of nitrous oxide to medical clients rather than to food manufacturing. The shortage came during the [[Christmas and holiday season]] when canned whipped cream use is normally at its highest.<ref>{{cite news |last=Dewey |first=Caitlin |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/12/21/the-real-reason-you-cant-buy-whipped-cream-this-christmas/ |title=The real reason grocery stores are running out of whipped cream this Christmas |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=2016-12-21 |accessdate=2016-12-22 }}</ref>\n\nSimilarly, [[cooking spray]], which is made from various types of oils combined with [[lecithin]] (an [[emulsifier]]), may use nitrous oxide as a [[propellant]].

This book was important for two reasons. First, James Watt had invented a novel machine to produce \"Factitious Airs\" (i.e. nitrous oxide) and a novel \"breathing apparatus\" to inhale the gas. Second, the book also presented the new medical theories by Thomas Beddoes, that [[tuberculosis]] and other lung diseases could be treated by inhalation of \"Factitious Airs\".<ref name=\"Drug discovery\" />\n\n[[File:Anaesthesia exhibition, 1946 Wellcome M0009908.jpg|thumb|right|Sir [[Humphry Davy]]'s ''Researches chemical and philosophical: chiefly concerning nitrous oxide'' (1800), pages 556 and 557 (right), outlining potential anaesthetic properties of nitrous oxide in relieving pain during surgery]]\nThe machine to produce \"Factitious Airs\" had three parts: a furnace to burn the needed material, a vessel with water where the produced gas passed through in a spiral pipe (for impurities to be \"washed off\"), and finally the gas cylinder with a gasometer where the gas produced, \"air\", could be tapped into portable air bags (made of airtight oily silk). The breathing apparatus consisted of one of the portable air bags connected with a tube to a mouthpiece.

It is also emitted through the manufacture of [[Nitric acid]], which is used in the synthesis of nitrogen fertilizers.

Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest [[sergeant major]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during [[World War I]], he was sent to a work camp in the [[Ural Mountains]]. He participated in some events of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. \n\nUpon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (1939\u20131980). During [[World War II]], after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] (1941\u20131945).<ref>{{cite book |title=The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7472-2|page=175}}</ref> \n\nAfter the war, he was selected as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] (1944\u20131963), and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) (1953\u20131980) of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]], serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both [[Cold War]] blocs, he received some [[Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito|98 foreign decorations]], including the [[Legion of Honour]] and the [[Order of the Bath]].\n\nTito was the chief architect of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], a [[Socialist state|socialist federation]] that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of [[Cominform]], he became the first Cominform member to [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split|defy Soviet hegemony]] in 1948. He was the only leader in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's [[Titoism|own socialist program]], which contained elements of [[market socialism]]. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Yugoslav-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Illyrian model]]. Firms were [[Social ownership|socially owned]] by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]]; they competed in open and [[free market]]s. \n\nTito built a very powerful [[cult of personality]] around himself, which was maintained by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] after his [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]].\n\nTito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] defined [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of [[brotherhood and unity]] in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] if done through legal channels. Lastly, [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], the [[SR Serbia|two constituent provinces of Serbia]], received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the [[Serbian parliament]]. \n\nTen years after [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]], [[Revolutions of 1989| Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe]], and [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslavia descended into civil war]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Pre-World War I===\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Tito hi\u0161a1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Tito's birthplace in the village of [[Kumrovec]], Croatia.]]}}\nJosip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in [[Kumrovec]], a village in the northern Croatian region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]. At the time it was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Although Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful 1944 [[Nazis|Nazi]] attempt on his life. The Germans found forged documents that stated 25 May was Tito's birthday and attacked him on that day.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=43}}}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Despite there being \"not the slightest doubt\" about the date and location of Tito's birth, many people in all parts of the former Yugoslavia give credence to various rumours about his origins.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=42}}}}\n\nHe was the seventh or eighth child of Franjo Broz (1860\u20131936) and Marija n\u00e9e Javer\u0161ek (1864\u20131918). His parents had already had a number of children die in early infancy.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=44}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=44}} Broz was christened and raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=45}} His father, Franjo, was a [[Croats|Croat]] whose family had lived in the village for three centuries, while his mother Marija, was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] from the village of [[Podsreda]]. The villages were {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} apart, and his parents had married on 21 January 1881. Franjo Broz had inherited a {{convert|10|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} estate and a good house, but he was unable to make a success of farming. Josip spent a significant proportion of his pre-school years living with his maternal grandparents at Podsreda, where he became a favourite of his grandfather Martin Javer\u0161ek. By the time he returned to Kumrovec to begin school, he spoke [[Slovene language|Slovene]] better than [[Croatian language|Croatian]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} and had learned to play the piano.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} Despite his \"mixed parentage\", Broz identified as a Croat like his father and neighbours.{{sfn|Minahan|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Lee|1993|p=9}}{{sfn|Laqueur|1976|p=218}}\n\nIn July 1900,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} at the age of eight, Broz entered primary school at Kumrovec. He completed four years of school,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} failing the 2nd grade and graduating in 1905.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}} As a result of his limited schooling, throughout his life Tito was poor at spelling. After leaving school, he initially worked for a maternal uncle, and then on his parents' family farm.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} In 1907, his father wanted him to emigrate to the United States, but could not raise the money for the voyage.{{sfn|West|1995|p=32}} \n\nInstead, aged 15 years, Broz left Kumrovec and travelled about {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip}} south to [[Sisak]], where his cousin Jurica Broz was doing army service. Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz was soon tired of that work. He approached a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[locksmith]], Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and [[room and board]]. As his father could not afford to pay for his work clothing, Broz paid for it himself. Soon after, his younger brother Stjepan also became apprenticed to Karas.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nDuring his apprenticeship, Broz was encouraged to mark [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in 1909, and he read and sold ''Slobodna Re\u010d'' (''Free Word''), a [[Socialism|socialist]] newspaper. After completing his apprenticeship in September 1910, Broz used his contacts to gain employment in [[Zagreb]]. At the age of 18, he joined the Metal Workers' Union and participated in his first labour [[Demonstration (protest)|protest]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} He also joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1952|p=25}}\n\nHe returned home in December 1910.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} In early 1911 he began a series of moves in search of work, first seeking work in [[Ljubljana]], then [[Trieste]], Kumrovec and Zagreb, where he worked repairing bicycles. He joined his first strike action on May Day 1911.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} After a brief period of work in Ljubljana,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} between May 1911 and May 1912, he worked in a factory in [[Kamnik]] in the [[Kamnik\u2013Savinja Alps]]. After it closed, he was offered redeployment to [[\u010cenkov]] in [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1867\u20131918)|Bohemia]]. \nOn arriving at his new workplace, he discovered that the employer was trying to bring in cheaper labour to replace the local Czech workers, and he and others joined successful strike action to force the employer to back down.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ridley notes that since his death there have been stories written about this period in his life, some of which state that he married a Czech girl in 1912, and she bore him a son. According to Ridley, these stories are \"almost impossible to verify\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=55}}}}\n\nDriven by curiosity, Broz  moved to [[Plze\u0148]], where he was briefly employed at the [[\u0160koda Works]]. He next travelled to [[Munich]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. He also worked at the [[Mercedes-Benz|Benz]] car factory in [[Mannheim]], and visited the [[Ruhr]] industrial region. By October 1912 he had reached [[Vienna]]. He stayed with his older brother Martin and his family, and worked at the Griedl Works before getting a job at [[Wiener Neustadt]]. There he worked for [[Austro-Daimler]], and was often asked to drive and test the cars.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=55\u201356}} During this time he spent considerable time [[fencing]] and dancing,{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=55}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=6\u20137}} and during his training and early work life, he also learned German and passable [[Czech language|Czech]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ridley notes that some popular biographers falsely claim that he married for a second time in Vienna and had a son.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=57}}}}\n\n===World War I===\nIn May 1913,{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}} Broz was [[conscript]]ed into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=58}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|When he was conscripted into the army, his date of birth was recorded as 5 March 1892.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=43}}}} for his compulsory two years of service. He successfully requested to serve with the 25th Croatian Home Guard ({{lang-hr|Domobran|links=no}}) Regiment garrisoned in Zagreb. After learning to ski during the winter of 1913 and 1914, Broz was sent to a school for [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCO) in [[Budapest]],{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} after which he was promoted to [[sergeant major]]. At 22 years of age, he was the youngest of that rank in his regiment.{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Vinterhalter states that he was promoted to sergeant after completing non-commissioned officer (NCO) training.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=64}}}} At least one source states that he was the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=59}} After winning the regimental fencing competition,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Broz came in second in the army fencing championships in Budapest in May 1914.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=59}}\n\nSoon after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the 25th Croatian Home Guard Regiment marched toward the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] border. Broz was arrested for [[sedition]] and imprisoned in the [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in present-day [[Novi Sad]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=62}} Broz later gave conflicting accounts of this arrest, telling one biographer that he had threatened to desert to the Russians, but also claiming that the whole matter arose from a clerical error.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} A third version was that he had been overheard saying that he hoped the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be defeated.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} After his acquittal and release,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=62\u201363}} his regiment served briefly on the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Front]] before being deployed to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in early 1915 to fight against [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Tito in his own account of his military service did not mention that he participated in the failed Austrian invasion of Serbia, instead giving the misleading impression that he fought only in Galicia, as it would have offended Serbian opinion to know that he fought in 1914 for the Habsburgs against them.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} On one occasion, the [[Reconnaissance|scout]] [[platoon]] he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive. In 1980 it was discovered that he had been recommended for an award for gallantry and initiative in reconnaissance and capturing prisoners.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41\u201342}} Tito's biographer, Richard West, wrote that Tito actually downplayed his military record as the Austrian Army records showed that he was a brave soldier, which contradicted his later claim to have been opposed to the Habsburg monarchy and his self-portrait of himself as an unwilling conscript fighting in a war he was opposed to.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41}} Broz was regarded by his fellow soldiers as ''kaisertreu'' (\"true to the Emperor\").{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nOn 25 March 1915,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West gives the date as 21 March,{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} and Ridley says 4 April}} he was wounded in the back by a [[Circassia]]n cavalryman's lance,{{sfn|Gilbert|2004|p=138}} and captured during a Russian attack near [[Bukovina]].{{sfn|Frankel|1992|p=331}} Broz in his account of his capture described it melodramatically as: \"...but suddenly the right flank yielded and through the gap poured cavalry of the Circassians, from Asiatic Russia. Before we knew it they were thundering through our positions, leaping from their horses and throwing themselves into our trenches with lances lowered. One of them rammed his two-yard, iron-tipped, double-pronged lance into my back just below the left arm. I fainted. Then, as I learned, the Circassians began to butcher the wounded, even slashing them with their knives. Fortunately, Russian infantry reached the positions and put an end to the orgy\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} Now a [[prisoner of war]] (POW), Broz was transported east to a hospital established in an old monastery in the town of [[Sviyazhsk]] on the [[Volga]] river near [[Kazan]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During his 13 months in hospital he had bouts of pneumonia and typhus, and learned Russian with the help of two schoolgirls who brought him Russian classics by such authors as [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] to read.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=64}}\n{{stack|float=right|[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b.JPG|thumb|The Uspensko-Bogorodichny monastery, where Broz recuperated from his wounds|alt=a colour photograph of a brown multi-storey building]]}}\nAfter recuperating, in mid-1916 he was transferred to the Ardatov POW camp in the [[Samara Governorate]], where he used his skills to maintain the nearby village grain mill. At the end of the year, he was again transferred, this time to the [[Kungur]] POW camp near [[Perm]] where the POWs were used as labour to maintain the newly completed [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Broz was appointed to be in charge of all the POWs in the camp.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=65}} During this time he became aware that the [[Red Cross parcel]]s sent to the POWs were being stolen by camp staff. When he complained, he was beaten and put in prison.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During the [[February Revolution]], a crowd broke into the prison and returned Broz to the POW camp. A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son.{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=66\u201367}} The journalist [[Richard West (journalist)|Richard West]] has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the [[Serbian Army]], this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nLess than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the [[July Days]] demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}} In the aftermath, he tried to flee to [[Finland]] in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.{{sfn|West|1995|p=44}} He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm. When he finally admitted to being an escaped POW, he was to be returned by train to Kungur, but escaped at [[Yekaterinburg]], then caught another train that reached [[Omsk]] in [[Siberia]] on 8 November after a {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} journey.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=67\u201368}} At one point, police searched the train looking for an escaped POW, but were deceived by Broz's fluent Russian.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}}\n\nIn Omsk the train was stopped by local Bolsheviks who told Broz that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had seized control of Petrograd. They recruited him into an [[Red Guards (Russia)|International Red Guard]] that guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917 and 1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik [[Czechoslovak Legion]] wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] village {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} from Omsk.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=71}} Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the [[Red Army]] recaptured Omsk from [[White movement|White forces]] loyal to the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] of [[Alexander Kolchak]]. He moved back to Omsk and married Belousova in January 1920.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West states that the marriage occurred in mid-1919.{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}}}} At the time of their marriage, Broz was 27 years old and Belousova was 15.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=76}} Broz later wrote that during his time in Russia he heard much talk of Lenin, a little of Trotsky and \"...as for Stalin, during the time I stayed in Russia, I never once heard his name\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}} In the autumn of 1920 he and his pregnant wife returned to his homeland, first by train to [[Narva]], by ship to [[Szczecin|Stettin]], then by train to Vienna, where they arrived on 20 September. In early October Broz returned home to Kumrovec in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to find that his mother had died and his father had moved to [[Jastrebarsko]] near Zagreb.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}} Sources differ over whether Broz joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] while in Russia, but he stated that the first time he joined the party was in Zagreb after he returned to his homeland.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=77}}\n\n==Interwar communist activity==\n===Communist agitator===\n[[File:Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 wiki photo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the Minister of the Interior, Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, led to the outlawing of the Communist Party.|alt=black and white photograph of a male in formal attire]]\nUpon his return home, Broz was unable to gain employment as a metalworker in Kumrovec, so he and his wife moved briefly to Zagreb, where he worked as a waiter, and took part in a waiter's strike. He also joined the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY).{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=77\u201378}} The CPY's influence on the political life of Yugoslavia was growing rapidly. In the 1920 elections it won 59 seats and became the third strongest party.{{sfn|Vucinich|1969|p=7}} After the assassination of [[Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107]], the Yugoslav Minister of the Interior, by a young communist named [[Alija Alijagi\u0107]] on 2 August 1921, the CPY was declared illegal under the Yugoslav State Security Act of 1921.{{sfn|Trbovich|2008|p=134}}\n\nDue to his overt communist links, Broz was fired from his employment.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=9}} He and his wife then moved to the village of [[Veliko Trojstvo]] where he worked as a mill mechanic.{{sfn|West|1995|p=51}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=84}} After the arrest of the CPY leadership in January 1922, [[Stevo Sabi\u0107]] took over control of its operations. Sabi\u0107 contacted Broz who agreed to work illegally for the party, distributing leaflets and agitating among factory workers. In the contest of ideas between those that wanted to pursue moderate policies and those that advocated violent revolution, Broz sided with the latter. In 1924, Broz was elected to the CPY district committee, but after he gave a speech at a comrade's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] funeral he was arrested when the priest complained. Paraded through the streets in chains, he was held for eight days and was eventually charged with creating a public disturbance. With the help of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] prosecutor who hated Catholics, Broz and his co-accused were acquitted.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=80\u201382}} His brush with the law had marked him as a communist agitator, and his home was searched on an almost weekly basis. Since their arrival in Yugoslavia, Pelagija had lost three babies soon after their births, and one daughter, Zlatina, at the age of two. Broz felt the loss of Zlatina deeply. In 1924, Pelagija gave birth to a boy, \u017darko, who survived. In mid-1925, Broz's employer died and the new mill owner gave him an ultimatum, give up his communist activities or lose his job. So, at the age of 33, Broz became a professional revolutionary.{{sfn|West|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=83\u201385}}\n\n===Professional revolutionary===\nThe CPY concentrated its revolutionary efforts on factory workers in the more industrialised areas of Croatia and Slovenia, encouraging strikes and similar action.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=87}} In 1925, the now unemployed Broz moved to [[Kraljevica]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, where he started working at a shipyard to further the aims of the CPY.{{sfn|Auty|1970|p=53}} During his time in Karljevica, Tito acquired a love of the warm, sunny Adriatic coastline that was to last for the rest of his life, and throughout his later time as leader, he spent as much time possible living on his yacht while cruising the Adriatic.{{sfn|West|1995|p=55}} \n\nWhile at Kraljevica he worked on Yugoslav [[torpedo boat]]s and a pleasure yacht for the [[People's Radical Party]] politician, [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]]. Broz built up the trade union organisation in the shipyards and was elected as a [[union representative]]. A year later he led a shipyard strike, and soon after was fired. In October 1926 he obtained work in a railway works in [[Smederevska Palanka]] near [[Belgrade]]. In March 1927, he wrote an article complaining about the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in the factory, and after speaking up for a worker he was promptly sacked. Identified by the CPY as worthy of promotion, he was appointed secretary of the Zagreb branch of the Metal Workers' Union, and soon after of the whole Croatian branch of the union. In July 1927 Broz was arrested, along with six other workers, and imprisoned at nearby [[Ogulin]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=88\u201389}} After being held without trial for some time, Broz went on a hunger strike until a date was set. The trial was held in secret and he was found guilty of being a member of the CPY. Sentenced to four months' imprisonment, he was released from prison pending an appeal. On the orders of the CPY, Broz did not report to the court for the hearing of the appeal, instead going into hiding in Zagreb. Wearing dark spectacles and carrying forged papers, Broz posed as a middle-class technician in the engineering industry, working undercover to contact other CPY members and co-ordinate their infiltration of trade unions.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito in prison 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Tito's [[mug shot]] after arrest for communist activities in 1928|alt=a series of three black and white head and shoulders photographs]]\n\nIn February 1928, Broz was one of 32 delegates to the conference of the Croatian branch of the CPY. During the conference, Broz condemned factions within the party. These included those that advocated a [[Greater Serbia]] agenda within Yugoslavia, like the long-term CPY leader, the Serb [[Sima Markovi\u0107]]. Broz proposed that the executive committee of the [[Communist International]] purge the branch of factionalism, and was supported by a delegate sent from Moscow. After it was proposed that the entire central committee of the Croatian branch be dismissed, a new central committee was elected with Broz as its secretary.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=95\u201396}} Markovi\u0107 was subsequently expelled from the CPY at the Fourth Congress of the [[Comintern]], and the CPY adopted a policy of working for the break-up of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=96}} Broz arranged to disrupt a meeting of the [[Yugoslav Social-Democratic Party|Social-Democratic Party]] on May Day that year, and in a melee outside the venue, Broz was arrested by the police. They failed to identify him, charging him under his false name for a breach of the peace. He was imprisoned for 14 days and then released, returning to his previous activities.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=96\u201397}} The police eventually tracked him down with the help of a police informer. He was ill-treated and held for three months before being tried in court in November 1928 for his illegal communist activities,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=98\u201399}} which included allegations that the bombs that had been found at his address had been planted by the police.{{sfn|West|1995|p=57}} He was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=101}}\n\n===Prison===\n[[File:Tito i Mo\u0161a Pijade u zatvoru.jpg|thumb|Tito (left) and his ideological mentor [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] while in the Lepoglava jail|alt=a black and white photograph of two men]]\n\nAfter his sentencing, his wife and son returned to Kumrovec, where they were looked after by sympathetic locals, but then one day they suddenly left without explanation and returned to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=102\u2013103}} She fell in love with another man and \u017darko grew up in institutions.{{sfn|West|1995|p=59}} After arriving at [[Lepoglava prison]], Broz was employed in maintaining the electrical system, and chose as his assistant a middle-class Belgrade Jew, [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]], who had been given a 20-year sentence for his communist activities. Their work allowed Broz and Pijade to move around the prison, contacting and organising other communist prisoners.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=103\u2013104}} During their time together in Lepoglava, Pijade became Broz's ideological mentor.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|pp=36\u201339}} After two and a half years at Lepoglava, Broz was accused of attempting to escape and was transferred to [[Maribor]] prison where he was held in solitary confinement for several months.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=106}} After completing the full term of his sentence, he was released, only to be arrested outside the prison gates and taken to Ogulin to serve the four-month sentence he had avoided in 1927. He was finally released from prison on 16 March 1934, but even then he was subject to orders that required him to live in Kumrovec and report to the police daily.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=107\u2013108 & 112}} During his imprisonment, the political situation in Europe had changed significantly, with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany and the emergence of right-wing parties in France and neighbouring Austria. He returned to a warm welcome in Kumrovec, but did not stay for long. In early May, he received word from the CPY to return to his revolutionary activities, and left his home town for Zagreb, where he rejoined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=109\u2013113}}\n\nThe Croatian branch of the CPY was in disarray, a situation exacerbated by the escape of the executive committee of the CPY to Vienna in Austria, from which they were directing activities. Over the next six months, Broz travelled several times between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Vienna, using false passports. In July 1934, he was blackmailed by a smuggler, but pressed on across the border, and was detained by the local ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a paramilitary Home Guard. He used the Austrian accent he had developed during his war service to convince them that he was a wayward Austrian mountaineer, and they allowed him to proceed to Vienna.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=147}} Once there, he contacted the General Secretary of the CPY, [[Milan Gorki\u0107]], who sent him to Ljubljana to arrange a secret conference of the CPY in Slovenia. The conference was held at the summer palace of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|Roman Catholic bishop of Ljubljana]], whose brother was a communist sympathiser. It was at this conference that Broz first met [[Edvard Kardelj]], a young Slovene communist who had recently been released from prison. Broz and Kardelj subsequently became good friends, with Tito later regarding him as his most reliable deputy. As he was wanted by the police for failing to report to them in Kumrovec, Broz adopted various pseudonyms, including \"Rudi\" and \"Tito\". He used the latter as a pen name when he wrote articles for party journals in 1934, and it stuck. He gave no reason for choosing the name \"Tito\" except that it was a common nickname for men from the district where he grew up. Within the Comintern network, his nickname was \"Walter\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=114\u2013115}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=151}}\n\n===Flight from Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Edvard Kardelj zatvorenik.jpg|thumb|left|Edvard Kardelj met Tito in 1934 and they became close friends|alt=two black and white mugshots]]\n\nDuring this time Tito wrote articles on the duties of imprisoned communists and on trade unions. He was in Ljubljana when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] was assassinated by the Croatian nationalist ''[[Usta\u0161e]]'' organisation in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. In the crackdown on dissidents that followed his death, it was decided that Tito should leave Yugoslavia. He travelled to Vienna on a forged Czech passport where he joined Gorki\u0107 and the rest of the [[Politburo]] of the CPY. It was decided that the Austrian government was too hostile to communism, so the Politburo travelled to [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], and Tito accompanied them.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=116\u2013117}} On Christmas Day 1934, a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the CPY was held in Ljubljana, and Tito was elected as a member of the Politburo for the first time. The Politburo decided to send him to Moscow to report on the situation in Yugoslavia, and in early February 1935 he arrived there as full-time official of the Comintern.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=117\u2013118}} He lodged at the main Comintern residence, the [[Hotel Lux]] on [[Tverskaya Street]], and was quickly in contact with [[Vladimir \u0106opi\u0107]], one of the leading Yugoslavs with the Comintern. He was soon introduced to the main personalities in the organisation. Tito was appointed to the secretariat of the Balkan section, responsible for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=120}} Kardelj was also in Moscow, as was the Bulgarian communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}} Tito lectured on trade unions to foreign communists, and attended a course on military tactics run by the Red Army, and occasionally attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He attended as one of 510 delegates to the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in July and August 1935, where he briefly saw [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time. After the congress, he toured the Soviet Union, then returned to Moscow to continue his work. He contacted Polka and \u017darko, but soon fell in love with an Austrian woman who worked at the Hotel Lux, Johanna Koenig, known within communist ranks as Lucia Bauer. When she became aware of this liaison, Polka divorced Tito in April 1936. Tito married Bauer on 13 October of that year.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAfter the World Congress, Tito worked to promote the new Comintern line on Yugoslavia, which was that it would no longer work to break up the country, and would instead defend the integrity of Yugoslavia against Nazism and Fascism. From a distance, Tito also worked to organise strikes at the shipyards at Kraljevica and the coal mines at [[Trbovlje]] near Ljubljana. He tried to convince the Comintern that it would be better if the party leadership was located inside Yugoslavia. A compromise was arrived at, where Tito and others would work inside the country and Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo would continue to work from abroad. Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo relocated to Paris, while Tito began to travel between Moscow, Paris and Zagreb in 1936 and 1937, using false passports.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=122\u2013123}} In 1936, his father died.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}\n\n[[File:\u0160panski borci.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav volunteers fighting in the Spanish Civil War|alt=black and white photograph of men firing weapons]]\n\nTito returned to Moscow in August 1936, soon after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=124}} At the time, the [[Great Purge]] was underway, and foreign communists like Tito and his Yugoslav compatriots were particularly vulnerable. Despite a laudatory report written by Tito about the veteran Yugoslav communist [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]], Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and shot by the Soviet secret police, the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=126\u2013127}} However, before the Purge really began to erode the ranks of the Yugoslav communists in Moscow, Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia with a new mission, to recruit [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|volunteers]] for the [[International Brigades]] being raised to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Travelling via Vienna, he reached the coastal port city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in December 1936.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} According to the Croatian historian [[Ivo Banac]], the reason Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Comintern was in order to purge the CPY.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} An initial attempt to send 500 volunteers to Spain by ship failed utterly, with nearly all the communist volunteers being arrested and imprisoned.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} Tito then travelled to Paris, where he arranged the travel of volunteers to France under the cover of attending the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris Exhibition]]. Once in France, the volunteers simply crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain. In all, he sent 1,192 men to fight in the war, but only 330 came from Yugoslavia, the rest being expatriates in France, Belgium, the U.S. and Canada. Less than half were communists, and the rest were social-democrats and anti-fascists of various hues. Of the total, 671 were killed in the fighting and another 300 were wounded. Tito himself never went to Spain, despite later claims that he had. Between May and August 1937, Tito travelled several times between Paris and Zagreb organising the movement of volunteers and creating a separate [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communist Party of Croatia]]. The new party was inaugurated at a conference at [[Samobor]] on the outskirts of Zagreb on 1\u20132 August 1937.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=131\u2013133}}\n\n===General Secretary of the CPY===\nIn June 1937, Gorki\u0107 was summoned to Moscow, where he was arrested, and after months of NKVD interrogation, he was shot.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=134}} According to Banac, Gorki\u0107 was killed on Stalin's orders.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} West concludes that despite being in competition with men like Gorki\u0107 for the leadership of the CPY, it was not in Tito's character to have innocent people sent to their deaths.{{sfn|West|1995|p=63}} Tito then received a message from the Politburo of the CPY to join them in Paris. In August 1937 he became acting [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the CPY]]. He later explained that he survived the Purge by staying out of Spain where the NKVD was active, and also by avoiding visiting the Soviet Union as much as possible. When first appointed as general secretary, he avoided travelling to Moscow by insisting that he needed to deal with some indiscipline in the CPY in Paris. He also promoted the idea that the upper echelons of the CPY should be sharing the dangers of underground resistance within the country.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=134\u2013135}} He developed a new, younger leadership team that was loyal to him, including the Slovene Kardelj, the [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], and the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]].{{sfn|West|1995|pp=63\u201364}} In December 1937, Tito arranged for a demonstration to greet the French foreign minister when he visited Belgrade, expressing solidarity with the French against Nazi Germany. The protest march numbered 30,000 and turned into a protest against the neutrality policy of the Stojadinovi\u0107 government. It was eventually broken up by the police. In March 1938 Tito returned to Yugoslavia from Paris. Hearing a rumour that his opponents within the CPY had tipped off the police, he travelled to Belgrade rather than Zagreb and used a different passport. While in Belgrade he stayed with a young intellectual, [[Vladimir Dedijer]], who was a friend of \u0110ilas. Arriving in Yugoslavia a few days ahead of the ''[[Anschluss]]'' between Nazi Germany and Austria, he made an appeal condemning it, in which the CPY was joined by the Social Democrats and trade unions. In June, Tito wrote to the Comintern suggesting that he should visit Moscow. He waited in Paris for two months for his Soviet visa before travelling to Moscow via Copenhagen. He arrived in Moscow on 24 August.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito's fake Canadian ID, 1939.jpg|thumb|Fake Canadian ID, \"Spiridon Mekas\", used for returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, 1939]]\n\nOn arrival in Moscow, he found that all Yugoslav communists were under suspicion. Nearly all the most prominent leaders of the CPY were arrested by the NKVD and executed, including over twenty members of the Central Committee. Both his ex-wife Polka and his wife Koenig/Bauer were arrested as \"imperialist spies\", although they were both eventually released, Polka after 27 months in prison. Tito therefore needed to make arrangements for the care of \u017darko, who was fourteen. He placed him a boarding school outside [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], then at a school at [[Penza]], but he ran away twice and was eventually taken in by a friend's mother. In 1941, \u017darko joined the Red Army to fight the invading Germans.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=137}} Some of Tito's critics argue that his survival indicates he must have denounced his comrades as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. He was asked for information on a number of his fellow Yugoslav communists, but according to his own statements and published documents, he never denounced anyone, usually saying he did not know them. In one case he was asked about the Croatian communist leader Horvatin, but wrote ambiguously, saying that he did not know whether he was a Trotskyist. Nevertheless, Horvatin was not heard of again. While in Moscow, he was given the task of assisting \u0106opi\u0107 to translate the ''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' into [[Serbo-Croatian]], but they had only got to the second chapter when \u0106opi\u0107 too was arrested and executed. He worked on with a fellow surviving Yugoslav communist, but a Yugoslav communist of German ethnicity reported an inaccurate translation of a passage and claimed it showed Tito was a Trotskyist. Other influential communists vouched for him, and he was exonerated. He was denounced by a second Yugoslav communist, but the action backfired and his accuser was arrested. Several factors were at play in his survival; working class origins, lack of interest in intellectual arguments about socialism, attractive personality and capacity for making influential friends.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nWhile Tito was avoiding arrest in Moscow, Germany was placing pressure on Czechoslovakia to cede the [[Sudetenland]]. In response to this threat, Tito organised for a call for Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Czechoslovakia, and thousands of volunteers came to the Czechoslovak embassy in Belgrade to offer their services. Despite the eventual [[Munich Agreement]] and Czechoslovak acceptance of the annexation and the fact that the volunteers were turned away, Tito claimed credit for the Yugoslav response, which worked in his favour. By this stage, Tito was well aware of the realities in the Soviet Union, later stating that he \"witnessed a great many injustices\", but was too heavily invested in communism and too loyal to the Soviet Union to step back at this point.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=140\u2013141}} Tito's appointment as General Secretary of the CPY was formally ratified by the Comintern on 5 January 1939.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=135}}\n\nHe was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] and [[Boris Kidri\u010d]].\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Resistance in Yugoslavia===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] assistance, launched an [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

The country was soon renamed the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY) (later finally renamed into Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, SFRY).

Under Stepinac's leadership, the bishops' conference released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September 1945. The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial.

At the conclusion of the \"Informbiro period\", reforms rendered Yugoslavia considerably more religiously liberal than the [[Eastern Bloc]] states.\n\nIn the first post war years Tito was widely considered a communist leader very loyal to Moscow, indeed, he was often viewed as second only to Stalin in the Eastern Bloc. In fact, Stalin and Tito had an uneasy alliance from the start, with Stalin considering Tito too independent.\n\nDuring the immediate post-war period Tito's Yugoslavia had a strong commitment to orthodox Marxist ideas. Harsh repressive measures against dissidents were common, including \"arrests, show trials, forced collectivisation, suppression of churches and religion\".{{sfn|Forsythe|2009|p=47}} As the leader of Yugoslavia, Tito displayed a fondness for luxury, taking over the royal palaces that had belonged to the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 together with the former palaces used by the House of Habsburg that were located in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=196-197}} Tito's governing style was very monarchical, as his tours across Yugoslavia in the former royal train closely resembled the royal tours of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings and Habsburg emperors, and in Serbia he adopted the traditional royal custom of being a godfather to every 9th son.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito modified the custom by becoming a godfather to every 9th daughter as well after criticism was made that the practice was sexist.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Just like a Serbian king, Tito would appear wherever a 9th child was born to the family to congratulate the parents and give them a gift of cash.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito always spoke very harshly of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings in both public and private (through in private, he sometimes had a kind word for the Habsburgs), but in many ways he appeared to his people as a sort of king.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}}\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===Tito\u2013Stalin split===\n{{Main|Tito\u2013Stalin split}}\n[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito 1953.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito greeting former U.S. first lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her July 1953 visit to Yugoslavia]]\n[[File:Resolucija VII. kongresa o prihodnjih nalogah ZKJ.jpg|thumb|Kardelj, Rankovi\u0107 and Tito in 1958]]\n[[File:Tito in Kumrovec, 1961.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito visiting his birthplace [[Kumrovec]] in 1961]]\n\nUnlike other states in east-central Europe liberated by allied forces, Yugoslavia liberated itself from Axis domination with limited direct support from the [[Red Army]]. Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons to recognise Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, giving way to an uneasy alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.at/books?id=J34leeCdXFQC&pg=PT120&lpg=PT120&dq=soviet+spy+ring+yugoslav+party+1945&source=bl&ots=dIXuH8A3Lq&sig=WWgnE0DnV6KfklOSYccGita4xHw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoq7bWgb3fAhVHzKQKHQmsCu8Q6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=soviet%20spy%20ring%20yugoslav%20party%201945&f=false|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|last=West|first=Richard|date=2012-11-15|publisher=Faber|isbn=9780571281107|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=12 The Quarrel with Stalin}}</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents occurred between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of [[Istria]] as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]]. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents.<ref>https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/89147/RICE0184.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modelled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that \"We study and take as an example the Soviet system, but develop it a different form\".<ref>https://schoolworkhelper.net/tito-stalin-dispute-1948-timeline-analysis-significance/</ref>\n\nThe Soviet answer on 4 May admonished Tito and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse them of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had saved them from destruction. Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the [[Cominform]], fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800593,00.html|title=No Words Left?|work=Time Magazine|date=22 August 1949|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> An invasion of Yugoslavia was planned to be carried out in 1949 via the combined forces of neighbouring Soviet satellite states of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, followed by the subsequent removal of Tito's government. On 28 June, the other member countries of the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The Hungarian and Romanian armies were expanded in size and, together with Soviet ones, massed on the Yugoslav border. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; \"I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,\" Stalin remarked.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar |first=M. |year=2009 |title=The Power of Freedom.

Stalin took the matter personally and arranged several assassination attempts on Tito, none of which succeeded. In a correspondence between the two leaders, Tito openly wrote:\n\n{{quote|Stop sending people to kill me. We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle.

This repression was not limited to known and alleged Stalinists, but also included members of the Communist Party or anyone exhibiting sympathy towards the Soviet Union. Prominent partisans, such as [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]] and [[Dragoljub Mi\u0107unovi\u0107]], were victims of this period of strong repression, which lasted until 1956 and was marked by significant violations of human rights.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SAyizpsg-Z8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Accommodating+National+Identity:+New+Approaches+in+International+and+Domestic+Law#v=onepage&q=Accommodating%20National%20Identity%3A%20New%20Approaches%20in%20International%20and%20Domestic%20Law&f=false |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law - Page 17|last=Tierney|first=Stephen |year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1400-6|page=17}}<br />\"''Human rights were routinely suppressed...''\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz6pvc3YSr0C&pg=PA37&dq=tito+regime+human+rights#v=onepage&q=tito%20regime%20human%20rights&f=false|title=No More: The Battle Against Human Rights Violations - Page 37, D.

The facilities at Goli Otok were abandoned in 1956, and jurisdiction of the now-defunct political prison was handed over to the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Ho Chi Minh, Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj, Beograd, avgust 1957.jpg|thumb|left|Tito with North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Belgrade, 1957]]\n\nTito's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain U.S. aid via the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the same U.S. aid institution that administered the [[Marshall Plan]]. Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed, and Tito began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East\u2013West antagonism to his advantage. Instead of choosing sides, he was instrumental in kick-starting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which would function as a \"third way\" for countries interested in staying outside of the East\u2013West divide.<ref name=\"nonaligned-chief\" />\n\nThe event was significant not only for Yugoslavia and Tito, but also for the global development of socialism, since it was the first major split between Communist states, casting doubt on Comintern's claims for socialism to be a unified force that would eventually control the whole world, as Tito became the first (and the only successful) socialist leader to defy Stalin's leadership in the [[COMINFORM]]. This rift with the [[Soviet Union]] brought Tito much international recognition, but also triggered a period of instability often referred to as the [[Informbiro]] period. Tito's form of communism was labelled \"[[Titoism]]\" by Moscow, which encouraged purges against suspected \"Titoites'\" throughout the [[Eastern bloc]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[File:Tito i Hrushchov.jpg|thumb|Tito and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in [[Skopje]] after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]]]\n\nOn 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and Tito regarding \"[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\" (''samoupravljanje''), a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced [[profit sharing]] and [[workplace democracy]] in previously state-run enterprises, which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded [[Ivan Ribar]] as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death, Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalisation of relations between the two nations. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologised for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signalled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862216,00.html |title=Discrimination in a Tomb|work=Time |date=18 June 1956|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> However, the relationship would reach another low in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Christman\">{{cite book |last1=Broz Tito |first1=Josip |last2=Christman |first2= Henry M. |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1970 |title=The Essential Tito |page=69}}<br />''\"The truth is that it is, at best, disloyal and unobjective behaviour towards our party and the country.

Stalin put pressure on Czechoslovakia to conduct purges in order to discourage the spread of the idea of a \"national path to socialism,\" which Tito espoused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2005-03-08/Front_Page/082.html|title=Film, discussion to focus on 1952 Slansky trials|accessdate=2013-06-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615165940/http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2005-03-08/Front_Page/082.html|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Non-Alignment===\n{{See also|Non-Aligned Movement}}\n{{See also|Yugoslavia and the Non-Aligned Movement}}\n[[File:Yugoslav passport Josip Broz Tito 1973.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Tito's diplomatic passport, 1973]]\n\n[[File:TitoCarter19783.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|U.S.-Yugoslav summit, 1978]]\nUnder Tito's leadership, Yugoslavia became a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In 1961, Tito co-founded the movement with Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], India's [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Indonesia's [[Sukarno]] and Ghana's [[Kwame Nkrumah]], in an action called The Initiative of Five (Tito, Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, Nkrumah), thus establishing strong ties with [[third world]] countries. This move did much to improve Yugoslavia's diplomatic position. Tito saw the Non-Aligned Movement as a way of presenting himself as a world leader of an important bloc of nations that would improve his bargaining power with both the eastern and western blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} On 1 September 1961, Josip Broz Tito became the first [[Non-Aligned Movement#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nTito's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments, such as exchanging visits (1954 and 1956) with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, where a street was named in his honour. In 1953, Tito visited Ethiopia and in 1954, the Emperor visited Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Tito's motives in befriending Ethiopia were somewhat self-interested as he wanted to send recent graduates of Yugoslav universities (whose standards were not up to those of Western universities, thus making them unemployable in the West) to work in Ethiopia, which was one of the few countries that was willing to accept them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} As Ethiopia did not have much of a health care system or a university system, Haile Selassie from 1953 onward encouraged the graduates of Yugoslav universities, especially with medical degrees, to come work in his empire.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Reflecting his tendency to pursue closer ties with Third World nations, from 1950 onward, Tito permitted Mexican films to be shown in Yugoslavia, where they become very popular, especially the 1950 film ''Un d\u00eda de vida'', which become a huge hit when it premiered in Yugoslavia in 1952.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=160}} The success of Mexican films led to the \"[[Yu-Mex]]\" craze of the 1950s-1960s as Mexican music become popular and it was fashionable for many Yugoslav musicians to don sombreros and sing Mexican songs in Serbo-Croatian.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=161-162}}       \n\nTito was notable for pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality during the [[Cold War]] and for establishing close ties with developing countries. Tito's strong belief in self-determination caused  the 1948 rift with Stalin and consequently, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. His public speeches often reiterated that policy of neutrality and co-operation with all countries would be natural as long as these countries did not use their influence to pressure Yugoslavia to take sides. Relations with the United States and Western European nations were generally cordial. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Yugoslav-Hungarian relations were strained as Tito made little secret of his distaste for the Stalinist [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his preference for the \"national communist\" [[Imre Nagy]] instead.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495}} Tito's decision to create a \"Balkan bloc\" by signing a treaty of alliance with NATO members Turkey and Greece in 1954 was regarded as tantamount to joining NATO in Soviet eyes, and his vague talk of a neutralist Communist federation of Eastern European states was seen as a major threat in Moscow.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495-496}} The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was seen by the Soviets as a center of subversion in Hungary as they accused Yugoslav diplomats and journalists, sometimes with justification, of supporting Nagy.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=496-497}} However, when the revolt broke out in Hungary in October 1956, Tito accused Nagy of losing control of the situation, as he wanted a Communist Hungary independent of the Soviet Union, not the overthrow of Hungarian Communism.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} On 31 October 1956, Tito ordered the Yugoslav media to stop praising Nagy and he quietly supported the Soviet intervention on 4 November to end the revolt in Hungary, as he believed that a Hungary ruled by anti-communists would pursue irredentist claims against Yugoslavia, just had been the case during the interwar period.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} To escape from the Soviets, Nagy fled to the Yugoslav embassy, where Tito granted him asylum.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=501}} On 5 November 1956, Soviet tanks shelled the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, killing the Yugoslav cultural attache and several other diplomats.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Tito's refusal to turn over Nagy, despite increasingly shrill Soviet demands that he do so, served his purposes well with relations with the Western states, as he was presented in the Western media as the \"good communist\" who stood up to Moscow by sheltering Nagy and the other Hungarian leaders.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=503-504}} On 22 November, Nagy and his cabinet left the embassy on a bus that was take them into exile in Yugoslavia after the new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] had promised Tito in writing that they would not be harmed.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Much to Tito's fury, when the bus left the Yugoslav embassy, it was promptly boarded by KGB agents who arrested the Hungarian leaders and roughly handled the Yugoslav diplomats who tried to protect them.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} The kidnapping of Nagy, followed by his subsequent execution, almost led to Yugoslavia breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and in 1957 Tito boycotted the ceremonials in Moscow for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, being the only communist leader who did not attend the occasion.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505-506}}     \n\nYugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide,<ref name=\"Socialism of Sorts\"/> whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number{{quantify|date=October 2015}} of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; [[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Indian politicians [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]]; British Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]; U.S. Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Georges Pompidou]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], [[Sukarno]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[Suharto]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Gaddafi]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] and [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He also met numerous celebrities.\n\nYugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French navy boarded the Slovenija cargo ship off [[Oran]], whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that \"Tito and the leading nucleus of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] really saw in the Third World's liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or [[Vietcong]].<ref name=mo>Au temps de la Yougoslavie anticoloniale</ref> \u00bb \n\nThousands of Yugoslav cooperants travelled  [[Guinea]] after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also supported the liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He saw the murder of [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1961 as the \"greatest crime in contemporary history\". The country's military schools hosted activists from [[Swapo]] (Namibia) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] (South Africa). In 1980, the secret services of South Africa and Argentina planned to bring 1,500 anti-communist guerrillas to Yugoslavia.  The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito's death and while the Yugoslav armed forces raised their alert level.<ref name=mo />\n\nIn 1953, Tito traveled to Britain for a state visit and met with [[Winston Churchill]]. He also toured [[Cambridge]] and visited the University Library.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britishpathe.com/workspaces/BritishPathe/NgGe1fPW |title=Pathe News films of state visit |accessdate=15 March 2013 }}</ref>\n\nTito visited India from 22 December 1954 through 8 January 1955.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.titoville.com/partthree.html |title=Josip Broz Tito Chronology |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001109100200/http://www.titoville.com/partthree.html |archivedate=9 November 2000 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> After his return, he removed many restrictions on churches and spiritual institutions in Yugoslavia.\n\nTito also developed warm relations with [[Burma]] under [[U Nu]], travelling to the country in 1955 and again in 1959, though he didn't receive the same treatment in 1959 from the new leader, [[Ne Win]]. Tito had an especially close friendship with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia who preached an eccentric mixture of monarchism, Buddhism, and socialism and like Tito wanted his country to be neutral in the Cold War.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} Tito saw Sihanouk as something of a kindred soul who like him had to struggle to maintain his backward country's neutrality in face of rival power blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} By contrast, Tito had a strong dislike of President Idi Amin of Uganda whom he saw as a thuggish and possibly insane leader.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=284}}\n\nBecause of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] governments.

Rankovi\u0107 was, for almost twenty years, at the head of the [[State Security Administration]], as well as Federal Secretary of Internal Affairs. His position as a party whip and Tito's way of controlling and monitoring the government and, to a certain extent the people, bothered many, especially the younger, newer generation of government officials who were working towards a more liberal Yugoslav society. In the same year Tito declared that Communists must henceforth chart Yugoslavia's course by the force of their arguments (implying an abandonment of Leninist orthodoxy and development of liberal Communism).<ref name=\"Payne\">{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley |title=Spain: A Unique History |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |year=2011 |page=227 |isbn=978-0299249335}}</ref> The [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA) saw its power scaled back and its staff reduced to 5000 after the removal of Rankovi\u0107.

In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislation independently from the Communist Party. [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]] was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralise the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defence, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions.

Not one to be discouraged easily, Jovanka continued working at [[Beli Dvor]], where she managed the staff and eventually got another chance. Their relationship was not a happy one, however. It had gone through many, often public, ups and downs with episodes of infidelities and even allegations of preparation for a ''coup d'\u00e9tat'' by the latter pair. Certain unofficial reports suggest Tito and Jovanka even formally divorced in the late 1970s, shortly before his death. However, during Tito's funeral she was officially present as his wife, and later claimed rights for inheritance. The couple did not have any children.\n\nTito's grandchildren include [[Sa\u0161a Broz]], a theatre director in Croatia; [[Svetlana Broz]], a cardiologist and writer in Bosnia-Herzegovina; and [[Josip Broz Jo\u0161ka|Josip Broz \u2013 Jo\u0161ka]], [[Edvard Broz]] and [[Natali Klasevski]], an artisan of Bosnia-Herzegovina.\n\nAs the [[President of Yugoslavia|President]], Tito had access to extensive (state-owned) property associated with the office, and maintained a lavish lifestyle. In Belgrade he resided in the official residence, the [[Beli dvor]], and maintained a separate private home. The [[Brijuni islands]] were the site of the State Summer Residence from 1949 on. The pavilion was designed by [[Jo\u017ee Ple\u010dnik]], and included a zoo. Close to 100 foreign heads of state were to visit Tito at the island residence, along with film stars such as [[Elizabeth Taylor]], [[Richard Burton]], [[Sophia Loren]], [[Carlo Ponti]], and [[Gina Lollobrigida]].\n\nAnother residence was maintained at [[Lake Bled]], while the grounds at [[Kara\u0111or\u0111evo (Ba\u010dka Palanka)|Kara\u0111or\u0111evo]] were the site of \"diplomatic hunts\". By 1974 the Yugoslav President had at his disposal 32 official residences, larger and small,<ref>[[#refBarnett2006|Barnett 2006]], p. 138.</ref> the yacht ''[[Yugoslav yacht Galeb|Galeb]]'' (\"seagull\"), a Boeing 727 as the presidential aeroplane, and the Blue Train.<ref name=\"Draskovic\">{{cite book |last=Draskovic |first=Milorad |title=East Central Europe |year=1982 |publisher=Hoover Institution Press |isbn=978-0313299186 |page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313299186/page/371 371] |url-access=registration |url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780313299186/page/371 }}</ref> After Tito's death the presidential Boeing 727 was sold to [[Aviogenex]], the ''Galeb'' remained docked in Montenegro, while the Blue Train was stored in a Serbian train shed for over two decades.<ref>{{cite web| title = Titov avion leti za Indone\u017eane | website = Blic | url = http://www.blic.rs/stara_arhiva/svet/59349/Titov-avion-leti-za-Indonezane | accessdate = 15 July 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = The Blue Train | last = Andric | first = Gordana | website = Balkan Insight | url = http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/the-blue-train | accessdate = 15 July 2013 }}</ref> While Tito was the person who held the office of president for by far the longest period, the associated property was not private and much of it continues to be in use by Yugoslav successor states, as public property, or maintained at the disposal of high-ranking officials.\n\nAs regards knowledge of languages, Tito replied that he spoke [[Serbo-Croatian]], German, Russian, and some English.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=[[Socialist Thought and Practice]]|title=|volume=11\u201312}}</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=February 2020}} Broz's official biographer and then fellow Central Committee-member [[Vladimir Dedijer]] stated in 1953 that he spoke \"Serbo-Croatian ...

After an incident where he was slapped and shouted at by a priest when he had difficulty assisting the priest to remove his vestments, Tito would not enter a church again. As an adult, he identified as an atheist.<ref>[[#refSherwood2013|Sherwood 2013]], p. 129.</ref>\n\nEvery federal unit had a town or city with historic significance from the [[World War II]] period renamed to have Tito's name included. The largest of these was [[Titograd]], now [[Podgorica]], the capital city of [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro|Montenegro]]. With the exception of Titograd, the cities were renamed simply by the addition of the adjective \"Tito's\" (\"''Titov''\"). The cities were:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! '''Republic''' !!

Tito's personal doctor, Aleksandar Matunovi\u0107, wrote a book<ref>{{cite book|author=Aleksandar Matunovi\u0107|title= Enigma Broz \u2013 ko ste vi dru\u017ee predsedni\u010de?|year=1997|location=Belgrade}}</ref> about Tito in which he questioned his true origin, noting that Tito's habits and lifestyle could only mean that he was from an aristocratic family.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titov \u017eivot ostaje enigma|author=Vladimir Jokanovi\u0107|date=3 May 2010|publisher=NSPM|url=http://www.nspm.rs/prenosimo/titov-zivot-ostaje-enigma.html?alphabet=l}}</ref> Serbian journalist [[Vladan Dini\u0107]], in ''Tito is not Tito'', included several possible alternate identities of Tito, arguing that three separate people had identified as Tito.<ref>{{cite web|title=BILA SU TRI TITA|author=Vladan Dini\u0107|publisher=Svedok|url=http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=79124|access-date=25 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007173705/http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=79124|archive-date=7 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a lot of media coverage was given to a declassified [[National Security Agency|NSA]] study in ''Cryptologic Spectrum'' that concluded Tito had not spoken the Serbo-Croatian language as a native. The report noted that his speech had features of other Slavic languages (Russian and Polish). The hypothesis that \"a non-Yugoslav, perhaps a Russian or a Pole\" assumed Tito's identity was included with a note that this had happened during or before the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Yugoslav President Tito Really a Yugoslav?|journal=Cryptologic Spectrum|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|id=(b) (3)-P.L. 86-36|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130906/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The report notes [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s impressions of Tito's Russian origins after he had personally spoken with Tito.\n\nHowever, the NSA's report was completely invalidated by Croatian experts. The report failed to recognise that Tito was a native speaker of the very distinctive local [[Kajkavian]] dialect of Zagorje. His acute accent, present only in Croatian dialects, and which Tito was able to pronounce perfectly, is the strongest evidence for his Zagorje origins.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/tajna-sluzba-nije-znala-samo-jednu-sitnicu---da-postoje-kajkavci/1121913/ | title=Tajna slu\u017eba nije znala samo jednu sitnicu \u2013 da postoje kajkavci | last=Jozi\u0107 | first=\u017deljko | work=[[Jutarnji list]] | date=24 August 2013 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2013-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Origin of the name \"Tito\"===\nAs the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia starting on 30 December 1920, Josip Broz took on many assumed names during his activity within the Party, including \"Rudi\", \"Walter\", and \"Tito.\"<ref>Vladimir Dedijer, ''Tito Speaks'', 1953, p. 80.</ref> Broz himself explains:\n\n{{quote|It was a rule in the Party in those times not to use one's real name, in order to reduce the chances of exposure. For instance, if someone working with me was arrested, and flogged into revealing my real name, the police would easily trace me. But the police never knew the real person hiding behind an assumed name, such as I had in the Party. Naturally, even the assumed names often had to be changed. Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijevi\u0107, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'. I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second.\n\nNow I had to take a new name. I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito. I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it. Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment. Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district. The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Titu\u0161 Brezova\u010dki|Tito Brezova\u010dki]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years. The father of [[Ksaver \u0160andor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito.<ref>Dedijer, p. 81</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{{main|Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito}}\nJosip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]). The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the West German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]].\n\nThe decorations were seldom displayed, however. After the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons. The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\">{{cite book|last1=Badurina|first1=Berislav|last2=Sara\u010devi\u0107|first2=Sead|last3=Grobenski|first3=Valent|last4=Eterovi\u0107|first4=Ivo|last5=Tudor|first5=Mladen|title=Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom|publisher=Vjesnik|year=1980|page=102}}</ref> Tito's reputation as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders of [[World War II]], along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], was primarily the cause of the favourable international recognition.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\"/>\n\n===Domestic awards===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Yugoslavian Great Star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden slobode.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Hero of socialist labour Rib.png|width=104}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National liberation Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Battle flag Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden jugoslovenske zastave1(traka).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the partisan star with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order Republic Golden wreath RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of merits for the people with golden star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the brotherhood and unity with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National army with laurer wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of military merits with the great star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order for courageousness Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941 RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal RIB.png|width=106}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Order of the People's Hero]] {{smallsup|a}}\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Star|Order of the Yugoslav Great Star]]\n|[[Order of Freedom (Yugoslavia)|Order of Freedom]]\n|[[Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour]]\n|[[Order of National Liberation]]\n|[[Order of the War Flag]]\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Sash]]\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|[[Order of the Partisan Star with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the Republic with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of People's Merit]]\n|[[Order of Brotherhood and Unity with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the People's Army with Laurel Wreath]]\n|[[Order of Military Merit with Great Star]]\n|-\n!4th Row\n|[[Order of Courage (Yugoslavia)|Order of Courage]]\n|[[Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941]]\n|[[10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 1:</small> <sup>a</sup>'''<small>Awarded 3 times.</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 2:</small>''' <small>All Yugoslav decorations are now defunct.</small>\n|}\n\n===Foreign awards===\nHere follows a short list including some of the more notable foreign awards and decorations of Tito.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Award or decoration\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Place\n! style=\"width:500px;\"| Note\n!

Drafted into military service, he distinguished himself, becoming the youngest [[sergeant major]] in the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]] of that time. After being seriously wounded and captured by the Imperial Russians during [[World War I]], he was sent to a work camp in the [[Ural Mountains]]. He participated in some events of the [[Russian Revolution]] in 1917 and subsequent [[Russian Civil War|Civil War]]. \n\nUpon his return to the Balkans in 1918, Broz entered the newly established [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]], where he joined the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (KPJ). He later was elected as General Secretary (later Chairman of the Presidium) of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] (1939\u20131980). During [[World War II]], after the Nazi invasion of the area, he led the Yugoslav guerrilla movement, the [[Partisans (Yugoslavia)|Partisans]] (1941\u20131945).<ref>{{cite book |title=The J Curve: A New Way to Understand Why Nations Rise and Fall|last=Bremmer|first=Ian|year=2007|publisher=Simon & Schuster|isbn=978-0-7432-7472-2|page=175}}</ref> \n\nAfter the war, he was selected as [[Prime Minister of Yugoslavia|Prime Minister]] (1944\u20131963), and [[President of Yugoslavia|President]] (later [[President for Life]]) (1953\u20131980) of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY). From 1943 to his death in 1980, Tito held the rank of [[Marshal of Yugoslavia]], serving as the supreme commander of the Yugoslav military, the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA). With a highly favourable reputation abroad in both [[Cold War]] blocs, he received some [[Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito|98 foreign decorations]], including the [[Legion of Honour]] and the [[Order of the Bath]].\n\nTito was the chief architect of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|second Yugoslavia]], a [[Socialist state|socialist federation]] that lasted from November 1943 until April 1992. Despite being one of the founders of [[Cominform]], he became the first Cominform member to [[Tito\u2013Stalin Split|defy Soviet hegemony]] in 1948. He was the only leader in [[Joseph Stalin]]'s time to leave Cominform and begin with his country's [[Titoism|own socialist program]], which contained elements of [[market socialism]]. Economists active in the former Yugoslavia, including Czech-born [[Jaroslav Vanek]] and Yugoslav-born [[Branko Horvat]], promoted a model of market socialism that was dubbed the [[Economy of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Illyrian model]]. Firms were [[Social ownership|socially owned]] by their employees and structured on [[workers' self-management]]; they competed in open and [[free market]]s. \n\nTito built a very powerful [[cult of personality]] around himself, which was maintained by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] after his [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|death]].\n\nTito managed to keep ethnic tensions under control by delegating as much power as possible to each republic. The [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] defined [[SFR Yugoslavia]] as a \"federal republic of equal nations and nationalities, freely united on the principle of [[brotherhood and unity]] in achieving specific and common interest.\" Each republic was also given the right to [[self-determination]] and [[secession]] if done through legal channels. Lastly, [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], the [[SR Serbia|two constituent provinces of Serbia]], received substantially increased autonomy, including de facto veto power in the [[Serbian parliament]]. \n\nTen years after [[funeral of Josip Broz Tito|his death]], [[Revolutions of 1989| Communism collapsed in Eastern Europe]], and [[Yugoslav wars|Yugoslavia descended into civil war]].\n\n==Early life==\n===Pre-World War I===\n{{stack|float=left|[[File:Tito hi\u0161a1.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|left|Tito's birthplace in the village of [[Kumrovec]], Croatia.]]}}\nJosip Broz was born on 7 May 1892 in [[Kumrovec]], a village in the northern Croatian region of [[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]. At the time it was part of the [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia]] within the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]].{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Although Tito was born on 7 May, after he became president of Yugoslavia, he celebrated his birthday on 25 May to mark the unsuccessful 1944 [[Nazis|Nazi]] attempt on his life.

His parents had already had a number of children die in early infancy.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=44}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=44}} Broz was christened and raised as a [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=45}} His father, Franjo, was a [[Croats|Croat]] whose family had lived in the village for three centuries, while his mother Marija, was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] from the village of [[Podsreda]]. The villages were {{convert|10|mi|km|order=flip}} apart, and his parents had married on 21 January 1881. Franjo Broz had inherited a {{convert|10|acre|adj=on|order=flip}} estate and a good house, but he was unable to make a success of farming. Josip spent a significant proportion of his pre-school years living with his maternal grandparents at Podsreda, where he became a favourite of his grandfather Martin Javer\u0161ek. By the time he returned to Kumrovec to begin school, he spoke [[Slovene language|Slovene]] better than [[Croatian language|Croatian]],{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} and had learned to play the piano.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} Despite his \"mixed parentage\", Broz identified as a Croat like his father and neighbours.{{sfn|Minahan|1998|p=50}}{{sfn|Lee|1993|p=9}}{{sfn|Laqueur|1976|p=218}}\n\nIn July 1900,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=46}} at the age of eight, Broz entered primary school at Kumrovec. He completed four years of school,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} failing the 2nd grade and graduating in 1905.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}} As a result of his limited schooling, throughout his life Tito was poor at spelling. After leaving school, he initially worked for a maternal uncle, and then on his parents' family farm.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=5}} In 1907, his father wanted him to emigrate to the United States, but could not raise the money for the voyage.{{sfn|West|1995|p=32}} \n\nInstead, aged 15 years, Broz left Kumrovec and travelled about {{convert|60|mi|km|order=flip}} south to [[Sisak]], where his cousin Jurica Broz was doing army service. Jurica helped him get a job in a restaurant, but Broz was soon tired of that work. He approached a [[Czechs|Czech]] [[locksmith]], Nikola Karas, for a three-year apprenticeship, which included training, food, and [[room and board]]. As his father could not afford to pay for his work clothing, Broz paid for it himself. Soon after, his younger brother Stjepan also became apprenticed to Karas.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nDuring his apprenticeship, Broz was encouraged to mark [[International Workers' Day|May Day]] in 1909, and he read and sold ''Slobodna Re\u010d'' (''Free Word''), a [[Socialism|socialist]] newspaper. After completing his apprenticeship in September 1910, Broz used his contacts to gain employment in [[Zagreb]]. At the age of 18, he joined the Metal Workers' Union and participated in his first labour [[Demonstration (protest)|protest]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} He also joined the [[Social Democratic Party of Croatia and Slavonia]].{{sfn|Dedijer|1952|p=25}}\n\nHe returned home in December 1910.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} In early 1911 he began a series of moves in search of work, first seeking work in [[Ljubljana]], then [[Trieste]], Kumrovec and Zagreb, where he worked repairing bicycles. He joined his first strike action on May Day 1911.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=6}} After a brief period of work in Ljubljana,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=54}} between May 1911 and May 1912, he worked in a factory in [[Kamnik]] in the [[Kamnik\u2013Savinja Alps]]. After it closed, he was offered redeployment to [[\u010cenkov]] in [[History of the Lands of the Bohemian Crown (1867\u20131918)|Bohemia]]. \nOn arriving at his new workplace, he discovered that the employer was trying to bring in cheaper labour to replace the local Czech workers, and he and others joined successful strike action to force the employer to back down.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ridley notes that since his death there have been stories written about this period in his life, some of which state that he married a Czech girl in 1912, and she bore him a son. According to Ridley, these stories are \"almost impossible to verify\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=55}}}}\n\nDriven by curiosity, Broz  moved to [[Plze\u0148]], where he was briefly employed at the [[\u0160koda Works]]. He next travelled to [[Munich]] in [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. He also worked at the [[Mercedes-Benz|Benz]] car factory in [[Mannheim]], and visited the [[Ruhr]] industrial region. By October 1912 he had reached [[Vienna]]. He stayed with his older brother Martin and his family, and worked at the Griedl Works before getting a job at [[Wiener Neustadt]].

He successfully requested to serve with the 25th Croatian Home Guard ({{lang-hr|Domobran|links=no}}) Regiment garrisoned in Zagreb. After learning to ski during the winter of 1913 and 1914, Broz was sent to a school for [[non-commissioned officer]]s (NCO) in [[Budapest]],{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} after which he was promoted to [[sergeant major]]. At 22 years of age, he was the youngest of that rank in his regiment.{{sfn|West|1995|p=33}}{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Vinterhalter states that he was promoted to sergeant after completing non-commissioned officer (NCO) training.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=64}}}} At least one source states that he was the youngest sergeant major in the Austro-Hungarian Army.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=59}} After winning the regimental fencing competition,{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Broz came in second in the army fencing championships in Budapest in May 1914.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=59}}\n\nSoon after the outbreak of [[World War I]] in 1914, the 25th Croatian Home Guard Regiment marched toward the [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbian]] border. Broz was arrested for [[sedition]] and imprisoned in the [[Petrovaradin fortress]] in present-day [[Novi Sad]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=62}} Broz later gave conflicting accounts of this arrest, telling one biographer that he had threatened to desert to the Russians, but also claiming that the whole matter arose from a clerical error.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} A third version was that he had been overheard saying that he hoped the Austro-Hungarian Empire would be defeated.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} After his acquittal and release,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=62\u201363}} his regiment served briefly on the [[Serbian Campaign of World War I|Serbian Front]] before being deployed to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] in [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] in early 1915 to fight against [[Russian Empire|Russia]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Tito in his own account of his military service did not mention that he participated in the failed Austrian invasion of Serbia, instead giving the misleading impression that he fought only in Galicia, as it would have offended Serbian opinion to know that he fought in 1914 for the Habsburgs against them.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=40}} On one occasion, the [[Reconnaissance|scout]] [[platoon]] he commanded went behind the enemy lines and captured 80 Russian soldiers, bringing them back to their own lines alive. In 1980 it was discovered that he had been recommended for an award for gallantry and initiative in reconnaissance and capturing prisoners.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41\u201342}} Tito's biographer, Richard West, wrote that Tito actually downplayed his military record as the Austrian Army records showed that he was a brave soldier, which contradicted his later claim to have been opposed to the Habsburg monarchy and his self-portrait of himself as an unwilling conscript fighting in a war he was opposed to.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=41}} Broz was regarded by his fellow soldiers as ''kaisertreu'' (\"true to the Emperor\").{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nOn 25 March 1915,{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West gives the date as 21 March,{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} and Ridley says 4 April}} he was wounded in the back by a [[Circassia]]n cavalryman's lance,{{sfn|Gilbert|2004|p=138}} and captured during a Russian attack near [[Bukovina]].{{sfn|Frankel|1992|p=331}} Broz in his account of his capture described it melodramatically as: \"...but suddenly the right flank yielded and through the gap poured cavalry of the Circassians, from Asiatic Russia. Before we knew it they were thundering through our positions, leaping from their horses and throwing themselves into our trenches with lances lowered. One of them rammed his two-yard, iron-tipped, double-pronged lance into my back just below the left arm. I fainted. Then, as I learned, the Circassians began to butcher the wounded, even slashing them with their knives. Fortunately, Russian infantry reached the positions and put an end to the orgy\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}} Now a [[prisoner of war]] (POW), Broz was transported east to a hospital established in an old monastery in the town of [[Sviyazhsk]] on the [[Volga]] river near [[Kazan]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During his 13 months in hospital he had bouts of pneumonia and typhus, and learned Russian with the help of two schoolgirls who brought him Russian classics by such authors as [[Leo Tolstoy|Tolstoy]] and [[Ivan Turgenev|Turgenev]] to read.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=42}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=64}}\n{{stack|float=right|[[File:\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043f\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0441 \u0437\u0434\u0430\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0437\u0435\u043c\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0439 \u0431\u043e\u043b\u044c\u043d\u0438\u0446\u044b.JPG|thumb|The Uspensko-Bogorodichny monastery, where Broz recuperated from his wounds|alt=a colour photograph of a brown multi-storey building]]}}\nAfter recuperating, in mid-1916 he was transferred to the Ardatov POW camp in the [[Samara Governorate]], where he used his skills to maintain the nearby village grain mill. At the end of the year, he was again transferred, this time to the [[Kungur]] POW camp near [[Perm]] where the POWs were used as labour to maintain the newly completed [[Trans-Siberian Railway]].{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} Broz was appointed to be in charge of all the POWs in the camp.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=65}} During this time he became aware that the [[Red Cross parcel]]s sent to the POWs were being stolen by camp staff. When he complained, he was beaten and put in prison.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=7}} During the [[February Revolution]], a crowd broke into the prison and returned Broz to the POW camp. A [[Bolsheviks|Bolshevik]] he had met while working on the railway told Broz that his son was working in an engineering works in [[Saint Petersburg|Petrograd]], so, in June 1917, Broz walked out of the unguarded POW camp and hid aboard a goods train bound for that city, where he stayed with his friend's son.{{sfn|Swain|2010|pp=7\u20138}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=66\u201367}} The journalist [[Richard West (journalist)|Richard West]] has suggested that because Broz chose to remain in an unguarded POW camp rather than volunteer to serve with the Yugoslav legions of the [[Serbian Army]], this indicates that he remained loyal to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, and undermines his later claim that he and other Croat POWs were excited by the prospect of revolution and looked forward to the overthrow of the empire that ruled them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=43}}\n\nLess than a month after Broz arrived in Petrograd, the [[July Days]] demonstrations broke out, and Broz joined in, coming under fire from government troops.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}} In the aftermath, he tried to flee to [[Finland]] in order to make his way to the United States, but was stopped at the border.{{sfn|West|1995|p=44}} He was arrested along with other suspected Bolsheviks during the subsequent crackdown by the [[Russian Provisional Government]] led by [[Alexander Kerensky]]. He was imprisoned in the [[Peter and Paul Fortress]] for three weeks, during which he claimed to be an innocent citizen of Perm. When he finally admitted to being an escaped POW, he was to be returned by train to Kungur, but escaped at [[Yekaterinburg]], then caught another train that reached [[Omsk]] in [[Siberia]] on 8 November after a {{convert|2000|mi|km|adj=on|order=flip}} journey.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=67\u201368}} At one point, police searched the train looking for an escaped POW, but were deceived by Broz's fluent Russian.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=67}}\n\nIn Omsk the train was stopped by local Bolsheviks who told Broz that [[Vladimir Lenin]] had seized control of Petrograd. They recruited him into an [[Red Guards (Russia)|International Red Guard]] that guarded the Trans-Siberian Railway during the winter of 1917 and 1918. In May 1918, the anti-Bolshevik [[Czechoslovak Legion]] wrested control of parts of Siberia from Bolshevik forces, and the [[Provisional Siberian Government (Omsk)|Provisional Siberian Government]] established itself in Omsk, and Broz and his comrades went into hiding. At this time Broz met a beautiful 14-year-old local girl, Pelagija \"Polka\" Belousova, who hid him then helped him escape to a [[Kyrgyz people|Kyrgyz]] village {{convert|40|mi|km|order=flip}} from Omsk.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=71}} Broz again worked maintaining the local mill until November 1919 when the [[Red Army]] recaptured Omsk from [[White movement|White forces]] loyal to the [[Provisional All-Russian Government]] of [[Alexander Kolchak]]. He moved back to Omsk and married Belousova in January 1920.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|West states that the marriage occurred in mid-1919.{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}}}} At the time of their marriage, Broz was 27 years old and Belousova was 15.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=76}} Broz later wrote that during his time in Russia he heard much talk of Lenin, a little of Trotsky and \"...as for Stalin, during the time I stayed in Russia, I never once heard his name\".{{sfn|West|1995|p=45}} In the autumn of 1920 he and his pregnant wife returned to his homeland, first by train to [[Narva]], by ship to [[Szczecin|Stettin]], then by train to Vienna, where they arrived on 20 September. In early October Broz returned home to Kumrovec in what was then the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]] to find that his mother had died and his father had moved to [[Jastrebarsko]] near Zagreb.{{sfn|Swain|2010|p=8}} Sources differ over whether Broz joined the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union|Communist Party]] while in Russia, but he stated that the first time he joined the party was in Zagreb after he returned to his homeland.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=77}}\n\n==Interwar communist activity==\n===Communist agitator===\n[[File:Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107 wiki photo.jpg|thumb|The assassination of the Minister of the Interior, Milorad Dra\u0161kovi\u0107, led to the outlawing of the Communist Party.|alt=black and white photograph of a male in formal attire]]\nUpon his return home, Broz was unable to gain employment as a metalworker in Kumrovec, so he and his wife moved briefly to Zagreb, where he worked as a waiter, and took part in a waiter's strike. He also joined the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY).{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=77\u201378}} The CPY's influence on the political life of Yugoslavia was growing rapidly.

Sabi\u0107 contacted Broz who agreed to work illegally for the party, distributing leaflets and agitating among factory workers. In the contest of ideas between those that wanted to pursue moderate policies and those that advocated violent revolution, Broz sided with the latter. In 1924, Broz was elected to the CPY district committee, but after he gave a speech at a comrade's [[Catholicism|Catholic]] funeral he was arrested when the priest complained. Paraded through the streets in chains, he was held for eight days and was eventually charged with creating a public disturbance. With the help of a [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]] prosecutor who hated Catholics, Broz and his co-accused were acquitted.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=80\u201382}} His brush with the law had marked him as a communist agitator, and his home was searched on an almost weekly basis. Since their arrival in Yugoslavia, Pelagija had lost three babies soon after their births, and one daughter, Zlatina, at the age of two. Broz felt the loss of Zlatina deeply. In 1924, Pelagija gave birth to a boy, \u017darko, who survived. In mid-1925, Broz's employer died and the new mill owner gave him an ultimatum, give up his communist activities or lose his job. So, at the age of 33, Broz became a professional revolutionary.{{sfn|West|1995|p=54}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=83\u201385}}\n\n===Professional revolutionary===\nThe CPY concentrated its revolutionary efforts on factory workers in the more industrialised areas of Croatia and Slovenia, encouraging strikes and similar action.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=87}} In 1925, the now unemployed Broz moved to [[Kraljevica]] on the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] coast, where he started working at a shipyard to further the aims of the CPY.{{sfn|Auty|1970|p=53}} During his time in Karljevica, Tito acquired a love of the warm, sunny Adriatic coastline that was to last for the rest of his life, and throughout his later time as leader, he spent as much time possible living on his yacht while cruising the Adriatic.{{sfn|West|1995|p=55}} \n\nWhile at Kraljevica he worked on Yugoslav [[torpedo boat]]s and a pleasure yacht for the [[People's Radical Party]] politician, [[Milan Stojadinovi\u0107]]. Broz built up the trade union organisation in the shipyards and was elected as a [[union representative]]. A year later he led a shipyard strike, and soon after was fired. In October 1926 he obtained work in a railway works in [[Smederevska Palanka]] near [[Belgrade]]. In March 1927, he wrote an article complaining about the [[exploitation of labour|exploitation of workers]] in the factory, and after speaking up for a worker he was promptly sacked. Identified by the CPY as worthy of promotion, he was appointed secretary of the Zagreb branch of the Metal Workers' Union, and soon after of the whole Croatian branch of the union. In July 1927 Broz was arrested, along with six other workers, and imprisoned at nearby [[Ogulin]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=56}}{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=88\u201389}} After being held without trial for some time, Broz went on a hunger strike until a date was set. The trial was held in secret and he was found guilty of being a member of the CPY. Sentenced to four months' imprisonment, he was released from prison pending an appeal. On the orders of the CPY, Broz did not report to the court for the hearing of the appeal, instead going into hiding in Zagreb. Wearing dark spectacles and carrying forged papers, Broz posed as a middle-class technician in the engineering industry, working undercover to contact other CPY members and co-ordinate their infiltration of trade unions.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=90\u201391}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito in prison 1928.jpg|thumb|left|Tito's [[mug shot]] after arrest for communist activities in 1928|alt=a series of three black and white head and shoulders photographs]]\n\nIn February 1928, Broz was one of 32 delegates to the conference of the Croatian branch of the CPY. During the conference, Broz condemned factions within the party. These included those that advocated a [[Greater Serbia]] agenda within Yugoslavia, like the long-term CPY leader, the Serb [[Sima Markovi\u0107]]. Broz proposed that the executive committee of the [[Communist International]] purge the branch of factionalism, and was supported by a delegate sent from Moscow. After it was proposed that the entire central committee of the Croatian branch be dismissed, a new central committee was elected with Broz as its secretary.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=95\u201396}} Markovi\u0107 was subsequently expelled from the CPY at the Fourth Congress of the [[Comintern]], and the CPY adopted a policy of working for the break-up of Yugoslavia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=96}} Broz arranged to disrupt a meeting of the [[Yugoslav Social-Democratic Party|Social-Democratic Party]] on May Day that year, and in a melee outside the venue, Broz was arrested by the police. They failed to identify him, charging him under his false name for a breach of the peace. He was imprisoned for 14 days and then released, returning to his previous activities.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=96\u201397}} The police eventually tracked him down with the help of a police informer. He was ill-treated and held for three months before being tried in court in November 1928 for his illegal communist activities,{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=98\u201399}} which included allegations that the bombs that had been found at his address had been planted by the police.{{sfn|West|1995|p=57}} He was convicted and sentenced to five years' imprisonment.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=101}}\n\n===Prison===\n[[File:Tito i Mo\u0161a Pijade u zatvoru.jpg|thumb|Tito (left) and his ideological mentor [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]] while in the Lepoglava jail|alt=a black and white photograph of two men]]\n\nAfter his sentencing, his wife and son returned to Kumrovec, where they were looked after by sympathetic locals, but then one day they suddenly left without explanation and returned to the Soviet Union.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=102\u2013103}} She fell in love with another man and \u017darko grew up in institutions.{{sfn|West|1995|p=59}} After arriving at [[Lepoglava prison]], Broz was employed in maintaining the electrical system, and chose as his assistant a middle-class Belgrade Jew, [[Mo\u0161a Pijade]], who had been given a 20-year sentence for his communist activities. Their work allowed Broz and Pijade to move around the prison, contacting and organising other communist prisoners.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=103\u2013104}} During their time together in Lepoglava, Pijade became Broz's ideological mentor.{{sfn|Barnett|2006|pp=36\u201339}} After two and a half years at Lepoglava, Broz was accused of attempting to escape and was transferred to [[Maribor]] prison where he was held in solitary confinement for several months.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=106}} After completing the full term of his sentence, he was released, only to be arrested outside the prison gates and taken to Ogulin to serve the four-month sentence he had avoided in 1927. He was finally released from prison on 16 March 1934, but even then he was subject to orders that required him to live in Kumrovec and report to the police daily.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=107\u2013108 & 112}} During his imprisonment, the political situation in Europe had changed significantly, with the rise of [[Adolf Hitler]] in Germany and the emergence of right-wing parties in France and neighbouring Austria. He returned to a warm welcome in Kumrovec, but did not stay for long. In early May, he received word from the CPY to return to his revolutionary activities, and left his home town for Zagreb, where he rejoined the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Croatia.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=109\u2013113}}\n\nThe Croatian branch of the CPY was in disarray, a situation exacerbated by the escape of the executive committee of the CPY to Vienna in Austria, from which they were directing activities. Over the next six months, Broz travelled several times between Zagreb, Ljubljana and Vienna, using false passports. In July 1934, he was blackmailed by a smuggler, but pressed on across the border, and was detained by the local ''[[Heimwehr]]'', a paramilitary Home Guard. He used the Austrian accent he had developed during his war service to convince them that he was a wayward Austrian mountaineer, and they allowed him to proceed to Vienna.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=113}}{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=147}} Once there, he contacted the General Secretary of the CPY, [[Milan Gorki\u0107]], who sent him to Ljubljana to arrange a secret conference of the CPY in Slovenia. The conference was held at the summer palace of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Ljubljana|Roman Catholic bishop of Ljubljana]], whose brother was a communist sympathiser. It was at this conference that Broz first met [[Edvard Kardelj]], a young Slovene communist who had recently been released from prison. Broz and Kardelj subsequently became good friends, with Tito later regarding him as his most reliable deputy. As he was wanted by the police for failing to report to them in Kumrovec, Broz adopted various pseudonyms, including \"Rudi\" and \"Tito\". He used the latter as a pen name when he wrote articles for party journals in 1934, and it stuck. He gave no reason for choosing the name \"Tito\" except that it was a common nickname for men from the district where he grew up. Within the Comintern network, his nickname was \"Walter\".{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=114\u2013115}}{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}}{{sfn|Ramet|2006|p=151}}\n\n===Flight from Yugoslavia===\n[[File:Edvard Kardelj zatvorenik.jpg|thumb|left|Edvard Kardelj met Tito in 1934 and they became close friends|alt=two black and white mugshots]]\n\nDuring this time Tito wrote articles on the duties of imprisoned communists and on trade unions. He was in Ljubljana when [[Alexander I of Yugoslavia|King Alexander]] was assassinated by the Croatian nationalist ''[[Usta\u0161e]]'' organisation in Marseilles on 9 October 1934. In the crackdown on dissidents that followed his death, it was decided that Tito should leave Yugoslavia. He travelled to Vienna on a forged Czech passport where he joined Gorki\u0107 and the rest of the [[Politburo]] of the CPY. It was decided that the Austrian government was too hostile to communism, so the Politburo travelled to [[Brno]] in [[Czechoslovakia]], and Tito accompanied them.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=116\u2013117}} On Christmas Day 1934, a secret meeting of the Central Committee of the CPY was held in Ljubljana, and Tito was elected as a member of the Politburo for the first time. The Politburo decided to send him to Moscow to report on the situation in Yugoslavia, and in early February 1935 he arrived there as full-time official of the Comintern.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=117\u2013118}} He lodged at the main Comintern residence, the [[Hotel Lux]] on [[Tverskaya Street]], and was quickly in contact with [[Vladimir \u0106opi\u0107]], one of the leading Yugoslavs with the Comintern. He was soon introduced to the main personalities in the organisation. Tito was appointed to the secretariat of the Balkan section, responsible for Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, Romania and Greece.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=120}} Kardelj was also in Moscow, as was the Bulgarian communist leader [[Georgi Dimitrov]].{{sfn|West|1995|p=62}} Tito lectured on trade unions to foreign communists, and attended a course on military tactics run by the Red Army, and occasionally attended the [[Bolshoi Theatre]]. He attended as one of 510 delegates to the [[Seventh World Congress of the Comintern]] in July and August 1935, where he briefly saw [[Joseph Stalin]] for the first time. After the congress, he toured the Soviet Union, then returned to Moscow to continue his work. He contacted Polka and \u017darko, but soon fell in love with an Austrian woman who worked at the Hotel Lux, Johanna Koenig, known within communist ranks as Lucia Bauer. When she became aware of this liaison, Polka divorced Tito in April 1936. Tito married Bauer on 13 October of that year.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=121\u2013122}}\n\nAfter the World Congress, Tito worked to promote the new Comintern line on Yugoslavia, which was that it would no longer work to break up the country, and would instead defend the integrity of Yugoslavia against Nazism and Fascism. From a distance, Tito also worked to organise strikes at the shipyards at Kraljevica and the coal mines at [[Trbovlje]] near Ljubljana. He tried to convince the Comintern that it would be better if the party leadership was located inside Yugoslavia. A compromise was arrived at, where Tito and others would work inside the country and Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo would continue to work from abroad. Gorki\u0107 and the Politburo relocated to Paris, while Tito began to travel between Moscow, Paris and Zagreb in 1936 and 1937, using false passports.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=122\u2013123}} In 1936, his father died.{{sfn|Vinterhalter|1972|p=49}}\n\n[[File:\u0160panski borci.jpg|thumb|Yugoslav volunteers fighting in the Spanish Civil War|alt=black and white photograph of men firing weapons]]\n\nTito returned to Moscow in August 1936, soon after the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=124}} At the time, the [[Great Purge]] was underway, and foreign communists like Tito and his Yugoslav compatriots were particularly vulnerable. Despite a laudatory report written by Tito about the veteran Yugoslav communist [[Filip Filipovi\u0107 (politician)|Filip Filipovi\u0107]], Filipovi\u0107 was arrested and shot by the Soviet secret police, the [[NKVD]].{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=126\u2013127}} However, before the Purge really began to erode the ranks of the Yugoslav communists in Moscow, Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia with a new mission, to recruit [[Yugoslav volunteers in the Spanish Civil War|volunteers]] for the [[International Brigades]] being raised to fight on the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War. Travelling via Vienna, he reached the coastal port city of [[Split, Croatia|Split]] in December 1936.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} According to the Croatian historian [[Ivo Banac]], the reason Tito was sent back to Yugoslavia by the Comintern was in order to purge the CPY.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} An initial attempt to send 500 volunteers to Spain by ship failed utterly, with nearly all the communist volunteers being arrested and imprisoned.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=129}} Tito then travelled to Paris, where he arranged the travel of volunteers to France under the cover of attending the [[Exposition Internationale des Arts et Techniques dans la Vie Moderne|Paris Exhibition]]. Once in France, the volunteers simply crossed the [[Pyrenees]] to Spain. In all, he sent 1,192 men to fight in the war, but only 330 came from Yugoslavia, the rest being expatriates in France, Belgium, the U.S. and Canada. Less than half were communists, and the rest were social-democrats and anti-fascists of various hues. Of the total, 671 were killed in the fighting and another 300 were wounded. Tito himself never went to Spain, despite later claims that he had. Between May and August 1937, Tito travelled several times between Paris and Zagreb organising the movement of volunteers and creating a separate [[League of Communists of Croatia|Communist Party of Croatia]]. The new party was inaugurated at a conference at [[Samobor]] on the outskirts of Zagreb on 1\u20132 August 1937.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=131\u2013133}}\n\n===General Secretary of the CPY===\nIn June 1937, Gorki\u0107 was summoned to Moscow, where he was arrested, and after months of NKVD interrogation, he was shot.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=134}} According to Banac, Gorki\u0107 was killed on Stalin's orders.{{sfn|Banac|1988|p=64}} West concludes that despite being in competition with men like Gorki\u0107 for the leadership of the CPY, it was not in Tito's character to have innocent people sent to their deaths.{{sfn|West|1995|p=63}} Tito then received a message from the Politburo of the CPY to join them in Paris. In August 1937 he became acting [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of Yugoslavia|General Secretary of the CPY]]. He later explained that he survived the Purge by staying out of Spain where the NKVD was active, and also by avoiding visiting the Soviet Union as much as possible. When first appointed as general secretary, he avoided travelling to Moscow by insisting that he needed to deal with some indiscipline in the CPY in Paris. He also promoted the idea that the upper echelons of the CPY should be sharing the dangers of underground resistance within the country.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=134\u2013135}} He developed a new, younger leadership team that was loyal to him, including the Slovene Kardelj, the [[Serbs|Serb]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]], and the [[Montenegrins|Montenegrin]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]].{{sfn|West|1995|pp=63\u201364}} In December 1937, Tito arranged for a demonstration to greet the French foreign minister when he visited Belgrade, expressing solidarity with the French against Nazi Germany. The protest march numbered 30,000 and turned into a protest against the neutrality policy of the Stojadinovi\u0107 government. It was eventually broken up by the police. In March 1938 Tito returned to Yugoslavia from Paris. Hearing a rumour that his opponents within the CPY had tipped off the police, he travelled to Belgrade rather than Zagreb and used a different passport. While in Belgrade he stayed with a young intellectual, [[Vladimir Dedijer]], who was a friend of \u0110ilas. Arriving in Yugoslavia a few days ahead of the ''[[Anschluss]]'' between Nazi Germany and Austria, he made an appeal condemning it, in which the CPY was joined by the Social Democrats and trade unions. In June, Tito wrote to the Comintern suggesting that he should visit Moscow. He waited in Paris for two months for his Soviet visa before travelling to Moscow via Copenhagen. He arrived in Moscow on 24 August.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=136\u2013137}}\n\n[[File:Josip Broz Tito's fake Canadian ID, 1939.jpg|thumb|Fake Canadian ID, \"Spiridon Mekas\", used for returning to Yugoslavia from Moscow, 1939]]\n\nOn arrival in Moscow, he found that all Yugoslav communists were under suspicion. Nearly all the most prominent leaders of the CPY were arrested by the NKVD and executed, including over twenty members of the Central Committee. Both his ex-wife Polka and his wife Koenig/Bauer were arrested as \"imperialist spies\", although they were both eventually released, Polka after 27 months in prison. Tito therefore needed to make arrangements for the care of \u017darko, who was fourteen. He placed him a boarding school outside [[Kharkiv|Kharkov]], then at a school at [[Penza]], but he ran away twice and was eventually taken in by a friend's mother. In 1941, \u017darko joined the Red Army to fight the invading Germans.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=137}} Some of Tito's critics argue that his survival indicates he must have denounced his comrades as [[Trotskyism|Trotskyists]]. He was asked for information on a number of his fellow Yugoslav communists, but according to his own statements and published documents, he never denounced anyone, usually saying he did not know them. In one case he was asked about the Croatian communist leader Horvatin, but wrote ambiguously, saying that he did not know whether he was a Trotskyist. Nevertheless, Horvatin was not heard of again. While in Moscow, he was given the task of assisting \u0106opi\u0107 to translate the ''History of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (Bolsheviks)'' into [[Serbo-Croatian]], but they had only got to the second chapter when \u0106opi\u0107 too was arrested and executed. He worked on with a fellow surviving Yugoslav communist, but a Yugoslav communist of German ethnicity reported an inaccurate translation of a passage and claimed it showed Tito was a Trotskyist. Other influential communists vouched for him, and he was exonerated. He was denounced by a second Yugoslav communist, but the action backfired and his accuser was arrested. Several factors were at play in his survival; working class origins, lack of interest in intellectual arguments about socialism, attractive personality and capacity for making influential friends.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=138\u2013140}}\n\nWhile Tito was avoiding arrest in Moscow, Germany was placing pressure on Czechoslovakia to cede the [[Sudetenland]]. In response to this threat, Tito organised for a call for Yugoslav volunteers to fight for Czechoslovakia, and thousands of volunteers came to the Czechoslovak embassy in Belgrade to offer their services. Despite the eventual [[Munich Agreement]] and Czechoslovak acceptance of the annexation and the fact that the volunteers were turned away, Tito claimed credit for the Yugoslav response, which worked in his favour. By this stage, Tito was well aware of the realities in the Soviet Union, later stating that he \"witnessed a great many injustices\", but was too heavily invested in communism and too loyal to the Soviet Union to step back at this point.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|pp=140\u2013141}} Tito's appointment as General Secretary of the CPY was formally ratified by the Comintern on 5 January 1939.{{sfn|Ridley|1994|p=135}}\n\nHe was appointed to the Committee and started to appoint allies to him, among them [[Edvard Kardelj]], [[Milovan \u0110ilas]], [[Aleksandar Rankovi\u0107]] and [[Boris Kidri\u010d]].\n\n==World War II==\n{{See also|World War II in Yugoslavia}}\n\n===Resistance in Yugoslavia===\nOn 6 April 1941, [[Nazi Germany|German]] forces, with [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131946)|Hungarian]] and [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] assistance, launched an [[invasion of Yugoslavia]].

After the Partisan victory and the end of hostilities in Europe, all external forces were ordered off Yugoslav territory.\n\nIn the final days of World War II in Yugoslavia, units of the Partisans were responsible for [[Bleiburg repatriations|atrocities after the repatriations of Bleiburg]], and accusations of culpability were later raised at the Yugoslav leadership under Tito. At the time, according to some authors, Josip Broz Tito repeatedly issued calls for surrender to the retreating column, offering amnesty and attempting to avoid a disorderly surrender.<ref>Dizdar, Zdravko; An Addition to the Research of the Problem of Bleiburg and the Way of the Cross</ref> On 14 May he dispatched a telegram to the supreme headquarters Slovene Partisan Army prohibiting the execution of prisoners of war and commanding the transfer of the possible suspects to a military court.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ramet|first1=Sabrina P.|last2=Mati\u0107|first2=Davorka|title=Democratic Transition in Croatia: Value Transformation, Education, and Media|publisher=Texas A&M University Press|year=2007|page=274|isbn=978-1-58544-587-5}}</ref>\n\n===Aftermath===\n[[File:Event in Zagreb in honour of Tito.jpg|thumb|Celebrating Tito in Zagreb in 1945, in presence of Orthodox dignitaries, the Catholic cardinal [[Aloysius Stepinac]], and the Soviet military ''attach\u00e9'']]\n\nOn 7 March 1945, the provisional government of the [[Democratic Federal Yugoslavia]] (''Demokratska Federativna Jugoslavija'', DFY) was assembled in [[Belgrade]] by Josip Broz Tito, while the provisional name allowed for either a republic or monarchy. This government was headed by Tito as provisional Yugoslav Prime Minister and included representatives from the royalist government-in-exile, among others [[Ivan \u0160uba\u0161i\u0107]]. In accordance with the agreement between resistance leaders and the government-in-exile, post-war elections were held to determine the form of government. In November 1945, Tito's pro-republican People's Front, led by the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia|Communist Party of Yugoslavia]], won the elections with an overwhelming majority, the vote having been boycotted by [[monarchist]]s.<ref>{{cite book|title=1998 Information Please Almanac|url=https://archive.org/details/1998informationpbru00brun|url-access=registration|last=Brunner|first=Borgna|year=1997|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|isbn=978-0-395-88276-4|page=[https://archive.org/details/1998informationpbru00brun/page/342 342]}}</ref> During the period, Tito evidently enjoyed massive popular support due to being generally viewed by the populace as the liberator of Yugoslavia.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Greenwood Encyclopedia of International Relations: S-Z|last=Nolan |first=Cathal|year=2002|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0-313-32383-6|page=1668}}</ref> The Yugoslav administration in the immediate post-war period managed to unite a country that had been severely affected by ultra-nationalist upheavals and war devastation, while successfully suppressing the nationalist sentiments of the various nations in favour of tolerance, and the common Yugoslav goal. After the overwhelming electoral victory, Tito was confirmed as the Prime Minister and the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the DFY. The country was soon renamed the [[Federal People's Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FPRY) (later finally renamed into Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, SFRY). On 29 November 1945, King [[Peter II of Yugoslavia|Peter II]] was formally deposed by the Yugoslav Constituent Assembly. The Assembly drafted a new republican constitution soon afterwards.\n\n[[File:Tito-Churchill.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.9|Josip Broz Tito and [[Winston Churchill]] in 1944 in [[Naples]], Italy]]\n\nYugoslavia organised the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (''Jugoslavenska narodna armija'', or JNA) from the [[Partisan movement]] and became the fourth strongest army in Europe at the time.<ref>{{cite book|last=Leffler|first=Melvyn P.|title=The Cambridge History of the Cold War|year=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83719-4|page=201}}</ref> The [[UDBA|State Security Administration]] (''Uprava dr\u017eavne bezbednosti''/''sigurnosti''/''varnosti'', UDBA) was also formed as the new secret police, along with a [[security agency]], the [[OZNA|Department of People's Security]] (''Organ Za\u0161tite Naroda (Armije)'', OZNA). Yugoslav intelligence was charged with imprisoning and bringing to trial large numbers of Nazi collaborators; controversially, this included Catholic clergymen due to the widespread [[Catholic clergy involvement with the Usta\u0161e|involvement of Croatian Catholic clergy with the Usta\u0161a regime]].

The two could not reach an agreement on the state of the Catholic Church. Under Stepinac's leadership, the bishops' conference released a letter condemning alleged Partisan war crimes in September 1945. The following year Stepinac was arrested and put on trial. In October 1946, in its first special session for 75 years, the Vatican excommunicated Tito and the Yugoslav government for sentencing Stepinac to 16 years in prison on charges of assisting [[Usta\u0161e]] terror and of supporting forced conversions of Serbs to Catholicism.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,855498,00.html|title=Excommunicate's Interview|work=Time Magazine |date=21 October 1946|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> Stepinac received preferential treatment in recognition of his status<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,939610,00.html|title=The Silent Voice|work=Time Magazine|date=22 February 1966|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> and the sentence was soon shortened and reduced to house-arrest, with the option of emigration open to the archbishop. At the conclusion of the \"Informbiro period\", reforms rendered Yugoslavia considerably more religiously liberal than the [[Eastern Bloc]] states.\n\nIn the first post war years Tito was widely considered a communist leader very loyal to Moscow, indeed, he was often viewed as second only to Stalin in the Eastern Bloc. In fact, Stalin and Tito had an uneasy alliance from the start, with Stalin considering Tito too independent.\n\nDuring the immediate post-war period Tito's Yugoslavia had a strong commitment to orthodox Marxist ideas. Harsh repressive measures against dissidents were common, including \"arrests, show trials, forced collectivisation, suppression of churches and religion\".{{sfn|Forsythe|2009|p=47}} As the leader of Yugoslavia, Tito displayed a fondness for luxury, taking over the royal palaces that had belonged to the House of Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 together with the former palaces used by the House of Habsburg that were located in Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=196-197}} Tito's governing style was very monarchical, as his tours across Yugoslavia in the former royal train closely resembled the royal tours of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings and Habsburg emperors, and in Serbia he adopted the traditional royal custom of being a godfather to every 9th son.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito modified the custom by becoming a godfather to every 9th daughter as well after criticism was made that the practice was sexist.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Just like a Serbian king, Tito would appear wherever a 9th child was born to the family to congratulate the parents and give them a gift of cash.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}} Tito always spoke very harshly of the Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 kings in both public and private (through in private, he sometimes had a kind word for the Habsburgs), but in many ways he appeared to his people as a sort of king.{{sfn|West|1995|p=197}}\n\n==Presidency==\n\n===Tito\u2013Stalin split===\n{{Main|Tito\u2013Stalin split}}\n[[File:Eleanor Roosevelt and Josip Broz Tito 1953.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito greeting former U.S. first lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] during her July 1953 visit to Yugoslavia]]\n[[File:Resolucija VII. kongresa o prihodnjih nalogah ZKJ.jpg|thumb|Kardelj, Rankovi\u0107 and Tito in 1958]]\n[[File:Tito in Kumrovec, 1961.jpg|thumb|Josip Broz Tito visiting his birthplace [[Kumrovec]] in 1961]]\n\nUnlike other states in east-central Europe liberated by allied forces, Yugoslavia liberated itself from Axis domination with limited direct support from the [[Red Army]]. Tito's leading role in liberating Yugoslavia not only greatly strengthened his position in his party and among the Yugoslav people, but also caused him to be more insistent that Yugoslavia had more room to follow its own interests than other Bloc leaders who had more reasons to recognise Soviet efforts in helping them liberate their own countries from Axis control. Although Tito was formally an ally of Stalin after World War II, the Soviets had set up a spy ring in the Yugoslav party as early as 1945, giving way to an uneasy alliance.<ref>{{Cite book|chapter-url=https://books.google.at/books?id=J34leeCdXFQC&pg=PT120&lpg=PT120&dq=soviet+spy+ring+yugoslav+party+1945&source=bl&ots=dIXuH8A3Lq&sig=WWgnE0DnV6KfklOSYccGita4xHw&hl=de&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwjoq7bWgb3fAhVHzKQKHQmsCu8Q6AEwDHoECAEQAQ#v=onepage&q=soviet%20spy%20ring%20yugoslav%20party%201945&f=false|title=Tito and the Rise and Fall of Yugoslavia|last=West|first=Richard|date=2012-11-15|publisher=Faber|isbn=9780571281107|location=|pages=|language=en|chapter=12 The Quarrel with Stalin}}</ref>\n\nIn the immediate aftermath of World War II, several armed incidents occurred between Yugoslavia and the [[Western Bloc|Western Allies]]. Following the war, Yugoslavia acquired the Italian territory of [[Istria]] as well as the cities of [[Zadar]] and [[Rijeka]]. Yugoslav leadership was looking to incorporate [[Trieste]] into the country as well, which was opposed by the Western Allies. This led to several armed incidents, notably attacks by Yugoslav fighter planes on U.S. transport aircraft, causing bitter criticism from the West. In 1946 alone, Yugoslav air-force shot down two U.S. transport aircraft. The passengers and crew of the first plane were secretly interned by the Yugoslav government. The second plane and its crew were a total loss. The U.S. was outraged and sent an ultimatum to the Yugoslav government, demanding the release of the Americans in custody, U.S. access to the downed planes, and full investigation of the incidents.<ref>https://scholarship.rice.edu/bitstream/handle/1911/89147/RICE0184.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y</ref> Stalin was opposed to these provocations, as he felt the USSR unready to face the West in open war so soon after the losses of World War II and at the time when U.S. had operational nuclear weapons whereas the USSR had yet to conduct its first test. In addition, Tito was openly supportive of the Communist side in the [[Greek Civil War]], while Stalin kept his distance, having agreed with Churchill not to pursue Soviet interests there, although he did support the Greek communist struggle politically, as demonstrated in several assemblies of the UN Security Council. In 1948, motivated by the desire to create a strong independent economy, Tito modelled his economic development plan independently from Moscow, which resulted in a diplomatic escalation followed by a bitter exchange of letters in which Tito wrote that \"We study and take as an example the Soviet system, but develop it a different form\".<ref>https://schoolworkhelper.net/tito-stalin-dispute-1948-timeline-analysis-significance/</ref>\n\nThe Soviet answer on 4 May admonished Tito and the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia]] (CPY) for failing to admit and correct its mistakes, and went on to accuse them of being too proud of their successes against the Germans, maintaining that the Red Army had saved them from destruction. Tito's response on 17 May suggested that the matter be settled at the meeting of the Cominform to be held that June. However, Tito did not attend the second meeting of the [[Cominform]], fearing that Yugoslavia was to be openly attacked. In 1949 the crisis nearly escalated into an armed conflict, as Hungarian and Soviet forces were massing on the northern Yugoslav frontier.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,800593,00.html|title=No Words Left?|work=Time Magazine|date=22 August 1949|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> An invasion of Yugoslavia was planned to be carried out in 1949 via the combined forces of neighbouring Soviet satellite states of Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and Albania, followed by the subsequent removal of Tito's government. On 28 June, the other member countries of the Cominform expelled Yugoslavia, citing \"nationalist elements\" that had \"managed in the course of the past five or six months to reach a dominant position in the leadership\" of the CPY. The Hungarian and Romanian armies were expanded in size and, together with Soviet ones, massed on the Yugoslav border. The assumption in Moscow was that once it was known that he had lost Soviet approval, Tito would collapse; \"I will shake my little finger and there will be no more Tito,\" Stalin remarked.<ref>{{cite book|last=Laar |first=M. |year=2009 |title=The Power of Freedom.

Stalin took the matter personally and arranged several assassination attempts on Tito, none of which succeeded. In a correspondence between the two leaders, Tito openly wrote:\n\n{{quote|Stop sending people to kill me. We've already captured five of them, one of them with a bomb and another with a rifle.

This repression was not limited to known and alleged Stalinists, but also included members of the Communist Party or anyone exhibiting sympathy towards the Soviet Union. Prominent partisans, such as [[Vlado Dap\u010devi\u0107]] and [[Dragoljub Mi\u0107unovi\u0107]], were victims of this period of strong repression, which lasted until 1956 and was marked by significant violations of human rights.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=SAyizpsg-Z8C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Accommodating+National+Identity:+New+Approaches+in+International+and+Domestic+Law#v=onepage&q=Accommodating%20National%20Identity%3A%20New%20Approaches%20in%20International%20and%20Domestic%20Law&f=false |title=Accommodating National Identity: New Approaches in International and Domestic Law - Page 17|last=Tierney|first=Stephen |year=2000|publisher=Martinus Nijhoff Publishers|isbn=978-90-411-1400-6|page=17}}<br />\"''Human rights were routinely suppressed...''\"</ref><ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Iz6pvc3YSr0C&pg=PA37&dq=tito+regime+human+rights#v=onepage&q=tito%20regime%20human%20rights&f=false|title=No More: The Battle Against Human Rights Violations - Page 37, D.

The facilities at Goli Otok were abandoned in 1956, and jurisdiction of the now-defunct political prison was handed over to the government of the [[Socialist Republic of Croatia]].\n\n[[File:Stevan Kragujevic, Ho Chi Minh, Josip Broz Tito and Edvard Kardelj, Beograd, avgust 1957.jpg|thumb|left|Tito with North Vietnamese leader [[Ho Chi Minh]] in Belgrade, 1957]]\n\nTito's estrangement from the USSR enabled Yugoslavia to obtain U.S. aid via the [[Economic Cooperation Administration]] (ECA), the same U.S. aid institution that administered the [[Marshall Plan]]. Still, he did not agree to align with the West, which was a common consequence of accepting American aid at the time. After Stalin's death in 1953, relations with the USSR were relaxed, and Tito began to receive aid as well from the COMECON. In this way, Tito played East\u2013West antagonism to his advantage. Instead of choosing sides, he was instrumental in kick-starting the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which would function as a \"third way\" for countries interested in staying outside of the East\u2013West divide.<ref name=\"nonaligned-chief\" />\n\nThe event was significant not only for Yugoslavia and Tito, but also for the global development of socialism, since it was the first major split between Communist states, casting doubt on Comintern's claims for socialism to be a unified force that would eventually control the whole world, as Tito became the first (and the only successful) socialist leader to defy Stalin's leadership in the [[COMINFORM]]. This rift with the [[Soviet Union]] brought Tito much international recognition, but also triggered a period of instability often referred to as the [[Informbiro]] period. Tito's form of communism was labelled \"[[Titoism]]\" by Moscow, which encouraged purges against suspected \"Titoites'\" throughout the [[Eastern bloc]].{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n[[File:Tito i Hrushchov.jpg|thumb|Tito and [[Nikita Khrushchev]] in [[Skopje]] after the [[1963 Skopje earthquake|1963 earthquake]]]]\n\nOn 26 June 1950, the National Assembly supported a crucial bill written by [[Milovan \u0110ilas]] and Tito regarding \"[[Workers' self-management|self-management]]\" (''samoupravljanje''), a type of cooperative independent socialist experiment that introduced [[profit sharing]] and [[workplace democracy]] in previously state-run enterprises, which then became the direct social ownership of the employees. On 13 January 1953, they established that the law on self-management was the basis of the entire social order in Yugoslavia. Tito also succeeded [[Ivan Ribar]] as the President of Yugoslavia on 14 January 1953. After Stalin's death, Tito rejected the USSR's invitation for a visit to discuss normalisation of relations between the two nations. [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Nikolai Bulganin]] visited Tito in Belgrade in 1955 and apologised for wrongdoings by Stalin's administration. Tito visited the USSR in 1956, which signalled to the world that animosity between Yugoslavia and USSR was easing.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,862216,00.html |title=Discrimination in a Tomb|work=Time |date=18 June 1956|accessdate=27 April 2010}}</ref> However, the relationship would reach another low in the late 1960s.<ref name=\"Christman\">{{cite book |last1=Broz Tito |first1=Josip |last2=Christman |first2= Henry M. |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1970 |title=The Essential Tito |page=69}}<br />''\"The truth is that it is, at best, disloyal and unobjective behaviour towards our party and the country.

It has, for example, been given as one of the reasons for the [[Sl\u00e1nsk\u00fd trial]] in Czechoslovakia, in which 14 high-level Communist officials were purged, with 11 of them being executed. Stalin put pressure on Czechoslovakia to conduct purges in order to discourage the spread of the idea of a \"national path to socialism,\" which Tito espoused.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2005-03-08/Front_Page/082.html|title=Film, discussion to focus on 1952 Slansky trials|accessdate=2013-06-07|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130615165940/http://nt.gmnews.com/news/2005-03-08/Front_Page/082.html|archivedate=15 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===Non-Alignment===\n{{See also|Non-Aligned Movement}}\n{{See also|Yugoslavia and the Non-Aligned Movement}}\n[[File:Yugoslav passport Josip Broz Tito 1973.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|Tito's diplomatic passport, 1973]]\n\n[[File:TitoCarter19783.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.9|U.S.-Yugoslav summit, 1978]]\nUnder Tito's leadership, Yugoslavia became a founding member of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]]. In 1961, Tito co-founded the movement with Egypt's [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], India's [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], Indonesia's [[Sukarno]] and Ghana's [[Kwame Nkrumah]], in an action called The Initiative of Five (Tito, Nehru, Nasser, Sukarno, Nkrumah), thus establishing strong ties with [[third world]] countries. This move did much to improve Yugoslavia's diplomatic position. Tito saw the Non-Aligned Movement as a way of presenting himself as a world leader of an important bloc of nations that would improve his bargaining power with both the eastern and western blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} On 1 September 1961, Josip Broz Tito became the first [[Non-Aligned Movement#Secretaries-General|Secretary-General of the Non-Aligned Movement]].\n\nTito's foreign policy led to relationships with a variety of governments, such as exchanging visits (1954 and 1956) with [[Emperor Haile Selassie]] of Ethiopia, where a street was named in his honour. In 1953, Tito visited Ethiopia and in 1954, the Emperor visited Yugoslavia.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Tito's motives in befriending Ethiopia were somewhat self-interested as he wanted to send recent graduates of Yugoslav universities (whose standards were not up to those of Western universities, thus making them unemployable in the West) to work in Ethiopia, which was one of the few countries that was willing to accept them.{{sfn|West|1995|p=281}} As Ethiopia did not have much of a health care system or a university system, Haile Selassie from 1953 onward encouraged the graduates of Yugoslav universities, especially with medical degrees, to come work in his empire.{{sfn|West|1995|p=282}} Reflecting his tendency to pursue closer ties with Third World nations, from 1950 onward, Tito permitted Mexican films to be shown in Yugoslavia, where they become very popular, especially the 1950 film ''Un d\u00eda de vida'', which become a huge hit when it premiered in Yugoslavia in 1952.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=160}} The success of Mexican films led to the \"[[Yu-Mex]]\" craze of the 1950s-1960s as Mexican music become popular and it was fashionable for many Yugoslav musicians to don sombreros and sing Mexican songs in Serbo-Croatian.{{sfn|McKee Irwin|2010|p=161-162}}       \n\nTito was notable for pursuing a foreign policy of neutrality during the [[Cold War]] and for establishing close ties with developing countries. Tito's strong belief in self-determination caused  the 1948 rift with Stalin and consequently, the [[Eastern Bloc]]. His public speeches often reiterated that policy of neutrality and co-operation with all countries would be natural as long as these countries did not use their influence to pressure Yugoslavia to take sides. Relations with the United States and Western European nations were generally cordial. \n\nIn the early 1950s, Yugoslav-Hungarian relations were strained as Tito made little secret of his distaste for the Stalinist [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] and his preference for the \"national communist\" [[Imre Nagy]] instead.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495}} Tito's decision to create a \"Balkan bloc\" by signing a treaty of alliance with NATO members Turkey and Greece in 1954 was regarded as tantamount to joining NATO in Soviet eyes, and his vague talk of a neutralist Communist federation of Eastern European states was seen as a major threat in Moscow.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=495-496}} The Yugoslav embassy in Budapest was seen by the Soviets as a center of subversion in Hungary as they accused Yugoslav diplomats and journalists, sometimes with justification, of supporting Nagy.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=496-497}} However, when the revolt broke out in Hungary in October 1956, Tito accused Nagy of losing control of the situation, as he wanted a Communist Hungary independent of the Soviet Union, not the overthrow of Hungarian Communism.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} On 31 October 1956, Tito ordered the Yugoslav media to stop praising Nagy and he quietly supported the Soviet intervention on 4 November to end the revolt in Hungary, as he believed that a Hungary ruled by anti-communists would pursue irredentist claims against Yugoslavia, just had been the case during the interwar period.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=497-498}} To escape from the Soviets, Nagy fled to the Yugoslav embassy, where Tito granted him asylum.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=501}} On 5 November 1956, Soviet tanks shelled the Yugoslav embassy in Budapest, killing the Yugoslav cultural attache and several other diplomats.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Tito's refusal to turn over Nagy, despite increasingly shrill Soviet demands that he do so, served his purposes well with relations with the Western states, as he was presented in the Western media as the \"good communist\" who stood up to Moscow by sheltering Nagy and the other Hungarian leaders.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=503-504}} On 22 November, Nagy and his cabinet left the embassy on a bus that was take them into exile in Yugoslavia after the new Hungarian leader, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] had promised Tito in writing that they would not be harmed.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} Much to Tito's fury, when the bus left the Yugoslav embassy, it was promptly boarded by KGB agents who arrested the Hungarian leaders and roughly handled the Yugoslav diplomats who tried to protect them.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505}} The kidnapping of Nagy, followed by his subsequent execution, almost led to Yugoslavia breaking off diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union and in 1957 Tito boycotted the ceremonials in Moscow for the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, being the only communist leader who did not attend the occasion.{{sfn|Granville|1998|p=505-506}}     \n\nYugoslavia had a liberal travel policy permitting foreigners to freely travel through the country and its citizens to travel worldwide,<ref name=\"Socialism of Sorts\"/> whereas it was limited by most Communist countries. A number{{quantify|date=October 2015}} of Yugoslav citizens worked throughout Western Europe. Tito met many world leaders during his rule, such as Soviet rulers [[Joseph Stalin]], [[Nikita Khrushchev]] and [[Leonid Brezhnev]]; [[Egypt]]'s [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], Indian politicians [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] and [[Indira Gandhi]]; British Prime Ministers [[Winston Churchill]], [[James Callaghan]] and [[Margaret Thatcher]]; U.S. Presidents [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[Richard Nixon]], [[Gerald Ford]] and [[Jimmy Carter]]; other political leaders, dignitaries and heads of state that Tito met at least once in his lifetime included [[Che Guevara]], [[Fidel Castro]], [[Yasser Arafat]], [[Willy Brandt]], [[Helmut Schmidt]], [[Georges Pompidou]], [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]], [[Hua Guofeng]], [[Kim Il-sung|Kim Il Sung]], [[Sukarno]], [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]], [[Suharto]], [[Idi Amin]], [[Haile Selassie I|Haile Selassie]], [[Kenneth Kaunda]], [[Gaddafi]], [[Erich Honecker]], [[Nicolae Ceau\u0219escu]], [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]] and [[Urho Kekkonen]]. He also met numerous celebrities.\n\nYugoslavia provided major assistance to anti-colonialist movements in the Third World. The Yugoslav delegation was the first to bring the demands of the [[Algerian National Liberation Front]] to the United Nations. In January 1958, the French navy boarded the Slovenija cargo ship off [[Oran]], whose holds were filled with weapons for the insurgents. Diplomat Danilo Milic explained that \"Tito and the leading nucleus of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] really saw in the Third World's liberation struggles a replica of their own struggle against the fascist occupants. They vibrated to the rhythm of the advances or setbacks of the FLN or [[Vietcong]].<ref name=mo>Au temps de la Yougoslavie anticoloniale</ref> \u00bb \n\nThousands of Yugoslav cooperants travelled  [[Guinea]] after its decolonisation and as the French government tried to destabilise the country. Tito also supported the liberation movements of the Portuguese colonies in Africa. He saw the murder of [[Patrice Lumumba]] in 1961 as the \"greatest crime in contemporary history\". The country's military schools hosted activists from [[Swapo]] (Namibia) and the [[Pan Africanist Congress of Azania]] (South Africa). In 1980, the secret services of South Africa and Argentina planned to bring 1,500 anti-communist guerrillas to Yugoslavia.  The operation was aimed at overthrowing Tito and was planned during the Olympic Games period so that the Soviets would be too busy to react. The operation was finally abandoned due to Tito's death and while the Yugoslav armed forces raised their alert level.<ref name=mo />\n\nIn 1953, Tito traveled to Britain for a state visit and met with [[Winston Churchill]].

Tito had an especially close friendship with Prince Norodom Sihanouk of Cambodia who preached an eccentric mixture of monarchism, Buddhism, and socialism and like Tito wanted his country to be neutral in the Cold War.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} Tito saw Sihanouk as something of a kindred soul who like him had to struggle to maintain his backward country's neutrality in face of rival power blocs.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=283}} By contrast, Tito had a strong dislike of President Idi Amin of Uganda whom he saw as a thuggish and possibly insane leader.{{sfn|West|1995|pp=284}}\n\nBecause of its neutrality, Yugoslavia would often be rare among Communist countries to have diplomatic relations with right-wing, [[Anti-communism|anti-Communist]] governments.

Rankovi\u0107 was, for almost twenty years, at the head of the [[State Security Administration]], as well as Federal Secretary of Internal Affairs. His position as a party whip and Tito's way of controlling and monitoring the government and, to a certain extent the people, bothered many, especially the younger, newer generation of government officials who were working towards a more liberal Yugoslav society. In the same year Tito declared that Communists must henceforth chart Yugoslavia's course by the force of their arguments (implying an abandonment of Leninist orthodoxy and development of liberal Communism).<ref name=\"Payne\">{{cite book |last=Payne |first=Stanley |title=Spain: A Unique History |publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press |year=2011 |page=227 |isbn=978-0299249335}}</ref> The [[State Security Administration]] (UDBA) saw its power scaled back and its staff reduced to 5000 after the removal of Rankovi\u0107.

In his speech before the Federal Assembly he introduced 20 sweeping constitutional amendments that would provide an updated framework on which the country would be based. The amendments provided for a collective presidency, a 22-member body consisting of elected representatives from six republics and two autonomous provinces. The body would have a single chairman of the presidency and chairmanship would rotate among six republics. When the Federal Assembly fails to agree on legislation, the collective presidency would have the power to rule by decree. Amendments also provided for stronger cabinet with considerable power to initiate and pursue legislation independently from the Communist Party. [[D\u017eemal Bijedi\u0107]] was chosen as the Premier. The new amendments aimed to decentralise the country by granting greater autonomy to republics and provinces. The federal government would retain authority only over foreign affairs, defence, internal security, monetary affairs, free trade within Yugoslavia, and development loans to poorer regions.

Tito's personal doctor, Aleksandar Matunovi\u0107, wrote a book<ref>{{cite book|author=Aleksandar Matunovi\u0107|title= Enigma Broz \u2013 ko ste vi dru\u017ee predsedni\u010de?|year=1997|location=Belgrade}}</ref> about Tito in which he questioned his true origin, noting that Tito's habits and lifestyle could only mean that he was from an aristocratic family.<ref>{{cite web|title=Titov \u017eivot ostaje enigma|author=Vladimir Jokanovi\u0107|date=3 May 2010|publisher=NSPM|url=http://www.nspm.rs/prenosimo/titov-zivot-ostaje-enigma.html?alphabet=l}}</ref> Serbian journalist [[Vladan Dini\u0107]], in ''Tito is not Tito'', included several possible alternate identities of Tito, arguing that three separate people had identified as Tito.<ref>{{cite web|title=BILA SU TRI TITA|author=Vladan Dini\u0107|publisher=Svedok|url=http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=79124|access-date=25 February 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007173705/http://www.svedok.rs/index.asp?show=79124|archive-date=7 October 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, a lot of media coverage was given to a declassified [[National Security Agency|NSA]] study in ''Cryptologic Spectrum'' that concluded Tito had not spoken the Serbo-Croatian language as a native. The report noted that his speech had features of other Slavic languages (Russian and Polish). The hypothesis that \"a non-Yugoslav, perhaps a Russian or a Pole\" assumed Tito's identity was included with a note that this had happened during or before the Second World War.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Is Yugoslav President Tito Really a Yugoslav?|journal=Cryptologic Spectrum|url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|id=(b) (3)-P.L. 86-36|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090511130906/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/_files/cryptologic_spectrum/is_yugoslav.pdf|archivedate=11 May 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The report notes [[Dra\u017ea Mihailovi\u0107]]'s impressions of Tito's Russian origins after he had personally spoken with Tito.\n\nHowever, the NSA's report was completely invalidated by Croatian experts. The report failed to recognise that Tito was a native speaker of the very distinctive local [[Kajkavian]] dialect of Zagorje. His acute accent, present only in Croatian dialects, and which Tito was able to pronounce perfectly, is the strongest evidence for his Zagorje origins.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.jutarnji.hr/tajna-sluzba-nije-znala-samo-jednu-sitnicu---da-postoje-kajkavci/1121913/ | title=Tajna slu\u017eba nije znala samo jednu sitnicu \u2013 da postoje kajkavci | last=Jozi\u0107 | first=\u017deljko | work=[[Jutarnji list]] | date=24 August 2013 | language=Croatian | accessdate=2013-08-24}}</ref>\n\n===Origin of the name \"Tito\"===\nAs the Communist Party was outlawed in Yugoslavia starting on 30 December 1920, Josip Broz took on many assumed names during his activity within the Party, including \"Rudi\", \"Walter\", and \"Tito.\"<ref>Vladimir Dedijer, ''Tito Speaks'', 1953, p. 80.</ref> Broz himself explains:\n\n{{quote|It was a rule in the Party in those times not to use one's real name, in order to reduce the chances of exposure. For instance, if someone working with me was arrested, and flogged into revealing my real name, the police would easily trace me. But the police never knew the real person hiding behind an assumed name, such as I had in the Party. Naturally, even the assumed names often had to be changed. Even before going to prison I had taken the name of Gligorijevi\u0107, and of Zagorac, meaning the 'man from Zagorje'. I even signed a few newspaper articles with the second.\n\nNow I had to take a new name. I adopted first the name of Rudi, but another comrade had the same name and so I was obliged to change it, adopting the name Tito. I hardly ever used Tito at first; I assumed it exclusively in 1938, when I began to sign articles with it. Why did I take this name 'Tito' and has it special significance? I took it as I would have any other, because it occurred to me at the moment. Apart from that, this name is quite frequent in my native district. The best-known Zagorje writer of the late eighteenth century was called [[Titu\u0161 Brezova\u010dki|Tito Brezova\u010dki]]; his witty comedies are still given in the Croatian theatre after more than a hundred years. The father of [[Ksaver \u0160andor Gjalski]], one of the greatest Croatian writers, was also called Tito.<ref>Dedijer, p. 81</ref>}}\n\n==Awards and decorations==\n{{main|Awards and decorations of Josip Broz Tito}}\nJosip Broz Tito received a total of 119 awards and decorations from 60 countries around the world (59 countries and Yugoslavia). 21 decorations were from [[SFR Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] itself, 18 having been awarded once, and the [[Order of the National Hero]] on three occasions. Of the 98 international awards and decorations, 92 were received once, and three on two occasions ([[Order of the White Lion]], [[Order of Polonia Restituta|Polonia Restituta]], and [[Order of Karl Marx|Karl Marx]]). The most notable awards included the French [[Legion of Honour]] and [[National Order of Merit (France)|National Order of Merit]], the British [[Order of the Bath]], the Soviet [[Order of Lenin]], the Japanese [[Order of the Chrysanthemum]], the West German [[Federal Cross of Merit]], and the [[Order of Merit of the Italian Republic|Order of Merit of Italy]].\n\nThe decorations were seldom displayed, however. After the [[Tito\u2013Stalin split]] of 1948 and his inauguration as president in 1953, Tito rarely wore his uniform except when present in a military function, and then (with rare exception) only wore his Yugoslav ribbons for obvious practical reasons. The awards were displayed in full number only at his funeral in 1980.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\">{{cite book|last1=Badurina|first1=Berislav|last2=Sara\u010devi\u0107|first2=Sead|last3=Grobenski|first3=Valent|last4=Eterovi\u0107|first4=Ivo|last5=Tudor|first5=Mladen|title=Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom|publisher=Vjesnik|year=1980|page=102}}</ref> Tito's reputation as one of the [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] leaders of [[World War II]], along with his diplomatic position as the founder of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], was primarily the cause of the favourable international recognition.<ref name=\"Bilo je \u010dasno \u017eivjeti s Titom\"/>\n\n===Domestic awards===\n<center>\n{|\n|-\n| colspan=\"7\" style=\"text-align:center;\"|{{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}} {{ribbon devices|number=0|type=award-star|ribbon=Order_of_the_National_Hero_BAR.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Yugoslavian Great Star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden slobode.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Hero of socialist labour Rib.png|width=104}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National liberation Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the Battle flag Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Orden jugoslovenske zastave1(traka).png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the partisan star with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order Republic Golden wreath RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of merits for the people with golden star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the brotherhood and unity with golden wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of the National army with laurer wreath Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order of military merits with the great star Rib.png|width=106}}\n|-\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=oak|ribbon=Order for courageousness Rib.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941 RIB.png|width=106}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal RIB.png|width=108}}\n|{{Ribbon devices|number=0|type=medal|ribbon=30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal RIB.png|width=106}}\n|}\n</center>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!1st Row\n| colspan=\"6\" style=\"text-align:center;\"| [[Order of the People's Hero]] {{smallsup|a}}\n|-\n!2nd Row\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Star|Order of the Yugoslav Great Star]]\n|[[Order of Freedom (Yugoslavia)|Order of Freedom]]\n|[[Order of the Hero of Socialist Labour]]\n|[[Order of National Liberation]]\n|[[Order of the War Flag]]\n|[[Order of the Yugoslav Flag with Sash]]\n|-\n!3rd Row\n|[[Order of the Partisan Star with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the Republic with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of People's Merit]]\n|[[Order of Brotherhood and Unity with Golden Wreath]]\n|[[Order of the People's Army with Laurel Wreath]]\n|[[Order of Military Merit with Great Star]]\n|-\n!4th Row\n|[[Order of Courage (Yugoslavia)|Order of Courage]]\n|[[Commemorative Medal of the Partisans - 1941]]\n|[[10 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[20 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Yugoslav Army Medal]]\n|[[30 Years of the Victory over Fascism Medal]]\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 1:</small> <sup>a</sup>'''<small>Awarded 3 times.</small>\n|-\n| style=\"text-align:left;\" colspan=\"7\"| '''<small>Note 2:</small>''' <small>All Yugoslav decorations are now defunct.</small>\n|}\n\n===Foreign awards===\nHere follows a short list including some of the more notable foreign awards and decorations of Tito.\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! colspan=\"2\" style=\"width:200px;\"| Award or decoration\n! style=\"width:150px;\"| Country\n! style=\"width:110px;\"| Date\n! style=\"width:80px;\"| Place\n! style=\"width:500px;\"| Note\n!
