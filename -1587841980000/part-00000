Many analysts, including ESPN's [[Adam Schefter]], believed the Dolphins would draft [[Texas A&M]] quarterback [[Ryan Tannehill]] with the 8th overall pick, if the [[2012 Cleveland Browns season|Cleveland Browns]], who held the 4th overall pick, didn't first.<ref name=\"SchefterProspect\">{{cite web|author=Walker, James |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/41140/schefter-on-dolphins-ryan-tannehill |title= Schefter on Dolphins, Ryan Tannehill|publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 19, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref> Also, many debated that Tannehill, who was once a wide receiver recently turned quarterback, was not deserving of a top 10 pick.<ref name=\"TanneProspect\">{{cite web|author=Walker, James |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/40495/browns-not-dolphins-better-for-tannehill |title=Browns, not Dolphins, better for Tannehill? |publisher=ESPN.com |date=March 29, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref>\n\nUltimately, with the 8th overall pick of the first round, the Dolphins selected Tannehill.<ref name=\"Tanne8Pick\">{{cite web|author=Walker, James |url=http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/41434/no-surprise-dolphins-get-ryan-tannehill |title=No surprise: Dolphins get Ryan Tannehill |publisher=ESPN.com |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012}}</ref> The selection marked the fourth time that the Dolphins had selected a quarterback in the first round of a draft since [[Dan Marino]] in [[1983 NFL Draft|1983]], [[Bob Griese]] in [[1967 NFL Draft|1967]], and [[Rick Norton]] in [[1966 AFL Draft|1966]].<ref name=\"PhinsQB1stRd\">{{cite web |author=Volin, Ben |url=http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/thedailydolphin/2012/04/26/miami-dolphins-draft-qb-ryan-tannehill-with-first-round-pick/ |title=Miami Dolphins draft QB Ryan Tannehill with first-round pick |publisher=[[Palm Beach Post]].com |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=December 31, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911131435/http://blogs.palmbeachpost.com/thedailydolphin/2012/04/26/miami-dolphins-draft-qb-ryan-tannehill-with-first-round-pick/ |archive-date=September 11, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref> With their second pick, the Dolphins selected offensive tackle [[Jonathan Martin (American football)|Jonathan Martin]] from [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford]].<ref name=\"PhinsTck2ndRd\">{{cite web|author=National Football League |url=http://www.nfl.com/draft/2012/profiles/jonathan-martin?id=2533041 |title=Jonathan Martin draft analysis |publisher=[[National Football League|NFL]].com |date=April 27, 2012 |accessdate= January 1, 2013}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"font-size: 95%; margin:auto\"\n|-\n!

The Dolphins received the ball on their own 42-yard line after a missed field goal by Houston kicker [[Shayne Graham]]. After a [[Reggie Bush]] recovered fumble on 3rd down on the Houston 14-yard line the Dolphins kicker [[Dan Carpenter]] attempted and successfully executed a 39-yard field goal with (3:19) left in the first quarter.\n\nBoth defenses held steady, keeping both offenses out of the redzone heading to the mid-way point of the second quarter. However, at the (7:35) point, quarterback Tannehill was intercepted by [[Johnathan Joseph]] at the 50-yard line for 36 yards. Within the shadow of their own goal posts the Dolphins held the Texans to a [[Shayne Graham]] 35-yard field goal. The interception by Tannehill was the first of his career, and marked a downhill spiral for the rest of the game.\n\nFollowing the score the Dolphins moved quickly to the Houston side of the field after a 10-yard rush by [[Reggie Bush]] and 32-yard pass to running back [[Daniel Thomas (running back)|Daniel Thomas]]. But after a few incomplete passes, Tannehill had his pass intended for receiver [[Legadu Naanee]] deflected by a defensive lineman and intercepted by linebacker [[Brian Cushing]] with (4:06) left in the second quarter. The Texans quickly turned the turnover into points, with an [[Arian Foster]] 14-yard rush.\n\nOn the first play following the Houston kickoff quarterback Tannehill again had his pass deflected by a defensive lineman, but instead was intercepted by [[Kareem Jackson]]. After a defensive pass interference penalty, running back Arian Foster rushed for his second rushing touchdown of the game at the (0:49) mark. Again following the kickoff the Dolphins again turned the ball over following a Daniel Thomas fumble. The turnover was shortly followed by a 14-yard pass touchdown from Houston quarterback [[Matt Schaub]] to receiver [[Andre Johnson]] at the (0:12) mark.\n\nFollowing a quick three and out by the Texans following halftime, punt returner [[Marcus Thigpen]] returned a punt for 72 yards for a touchdown. But for the remainder of the game the Dolphins offense failed to produce any scores, but held the Texans defense to two Shayne Graham field goals: 40 and 19 yards, respectively.\n\n====Week 2: vs. Oakland Raiders====\n{{AFB game box start\n|title= Week Two: Oakland Raiders at Miami Dolphins&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|Visitor=Raiders\n|V1=7 |V2=3 |V3=0 |V4=3\n|Host='''Dolphins'''\n|H1=7 |H2=0 |H3=14 |H4=14\n|Date=September 16, 2012\n|Location=[[Sun Life Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]\n|StartTime=1:02 p.m. EDT<ref name=\"RaidersWeek2\">NOTE: The Week 2 game vs. the [[2012 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] was originally scheduled at 4:15 p.m. EDT, but was moved up to a 1:00 p.m. EDT kickoff due to the Jewish holiday [[Rosh Hashanah]]. {{cite web |title=NFL moves up Raiders-Dolphins Week 2 kickoff |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/04/19/nfl-moves-up-raiders-dolphins-week-2-kickoff/ |publisher=profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date=April 19, 2012 |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>\n|TimeZone=[[North American Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]\n|ElapsedTime=3:10\n|Attendance=54,245\n|Weather={{convert|80|F|C}}, cloudy\n|Referee=Mike Shepherd\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Harlan]] and [[Solomon Wilcots]]\n|TVStation=CBS \n}}\n*'''Source:''' <ref>{{cite web|author=ProFootball Reference |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201209160mia.htm |title= OAK vs MIA Boxscore |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref>\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Ryan Tannehill]] 2-yard rush ([[Dan Carpenter]] kick) |Score= MIA 7\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 1 |Time= |Team=OAK |Event= [[Mike Goodson]] 64-yard pass from [[Carson Palmer]] ([[Sebastian Janikowski]] kick)  |Score= TIE 7\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 2 |Time= |Team=OAK |Event= Sebastian Janikowski 25-yard field goal |Score= OAK 10\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 3 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Reggie Bush]] 23-yard rush (Dan Carpenter kick) |Score= MIA 14\u201310}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 3 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= Reggie Bush 65-yard rush (Dan Carpenter kick)  |Score= MIA 21\u201310}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 4 |Time= |Team=OAK |Event= Sebastian Janikowski 27-yard field goal |Score= MIA 21\u201313}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 4 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Anthony Fasano]] 14-yard pass from Ryan Tannehill (Dan Carpenter kick) |Score= MIA 28\u201313}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 4 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Lamar Miller]] 15-yard rush (Dan Carpenter kick) |Score= MIA 35\u201313|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nThe Dolphins entered their second game of the season with a 0\u20131 record, hosting the 0\u20131 [[2012 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. The game marked the third consecutive season game between the two teams and 36th all-time, with the Dolphins winning the last two games with an average margin of victory of 18 points.\n\nMiami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] threw a 64-yard touchdown to [[Mike Goodson]] tying the game.\n\nThrough a majority of the second quarter both teams had a hard time moving across the 50-yard line, which was matched with impressive punting by both Dolphins punter [[Brandon Fields]] and Oakland punter [[Shane Lechler]]. By the end of the game Field punted the ball six times for 319 yards with an average yard per punt of 53.2 and Lechler punted the ball nine times for 422 yards with an average yard per punt of 46.9. However, Oakland managed to get the ball back with (3:33) left in the quarter and orchestrated a drive that ended with a [[Sebastian Janikowski]] 25-yard field goal. Both teams entered halftime evenly matched.\n\nIt didn't take long following halftime for the Dolphins rushing attack to shine. On the second possession of the half the Dolphins drove the ball down field and allowed [[Reggie Bush]] to rush for a 25-yard touchdown. On the next Miami possession, after a quick pass from Tannehill to receiver [[Brian Hartline]], Reggie Bush rushed 65 yards for another Miami touchdown. A few possessions later Oakland answered with a Janikowski 27-yard field goal.\n\nWith little opposition from the Oakland defense Miami's offense kept the ball moving and managed to score on their next two possessions. Once with an [[Anthony Fasano]] 14-yard reception touchdown from Tannehill, the first of his career, and again with a [[Lamar Miller]] 15-yard rushing touchdown, the first of his career. Oakland tried to stop the bleeding on their next drive, but quarterback Palmer was intercepted by safety [[Reshad Jones]].\n\nThe impressive game of 172 rushing yards on 26 attempts by running back Reggie Bush earned him the week 2 [[2012 NFL season#Players of the Week/Month|AFC Offensive Player of the Week]] and FedEx Air and Ground rusher of the week honors.\n\n====Week 3: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week Three: New York Jets at Miami Dolphins&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 23\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road='''Jets'''\n |R1=0|R2=3|R3=7|R4=10|R5=3\n |home=Dolphins\n |H1=7|H2=3|H3=7|H4=3|H5=0\n |stadium=Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida\n |attendance=60,102\n |weather={{convert|83|F|C}}, mostly cloudy\n |referee=[[Robert Frazer (American football official)|Robert Frazer]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Marv Albert]] and [[Rich Gannon]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*\n'''Second quarter'''\n*\n'''Third quarter'''\n*\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n'''Top rushers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n'''Top receivers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n}}\nWith the loss, the Dolphins fell to 1\u20132.\n\n====Week 4: at Arizona Cardinals====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week Four: Miami Dolphins at Arizona Cardinals&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 30\n |time=4:05 p.m. EDT/1:05 p.m. Arizona time\n |road=Dolphins\n |R1=0|R2=13|R3=0|R4=8|R5=0\n |home='''Cardinals'''\n |H1=0|H2=0|H3=7|H4=14|H5=3\n |stadium=[[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]]\n |attendance=60,183\n |weather=Played indoors (retractable roof closed)\n |referee=[[Scott Green (American football official)|Scott Green]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Bill Macatee]] and [[Steve Tasker]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*\n'''Second quarter'''\n*\n'''Third quarter'''\n*\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n'''Top rushers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n'''Top receivers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n}}\nThe Dolphins were seeking their first win in Phoenix since [[1996 Miami Dolphins season|1996]].

After a [[Reggie Bush]] recovered fumble on 3rd down on the Houston 14-yard line the Dolphins kicker [[Dan Carpenter]] attempted and successfully executed a 39-yard field goal with (3:19) left in the first quarter.\n\nBoth defenses held steady, keeping both offenses out of the redzone heading to the mid-way point of the second quarter. However, at the (7:35) point, quarterback Tannehill was intercepted by [[Johnathan Joseph]] at the 50-yard line for 36 yards. Within the shadow of their own goal posts the Dolphins held the Texans to a [[Shayne Graham]] 35-yard field goal. The interception by Tannehill was the first of his career, and marked a downhill spiral for the rest of the game.\n\nFollowing the score the Dolphins moved quickly to the Houston side of the field after a 10-yard rush by [[Reggie Bush]] and 32-yard pass to running back [[Daniel Thomas (running back)|Daniel Thomas]]. But after a few incomplete passes, Tannehill had his pass intended for receiver [[Legadu Naanee]] deflected by a defensive lineman and intercepted by linebacker [[Brian Cushing]] with (4:06) left in the second quarter. The Texans quickly turned the turnover into points, with an [[Arian Foster]] 14-yard rush.\n\nOn the first play following the Houston kickoff quarterback Tannehill again had his pass deflected by a defensive lineman, but instead was intercepted by [[Kareem Jackson]]. After a defensive pass interference penalty, running back Arian Foster rushed for his second rushing touchdown of the game at the (0:49) mark. Again following the kickoff the Dolphins again turned the ball over following a Daniel Thomas fumble. The turnover was shortly followed by a 14-yard pass touchdown from Houston quarterback [[Matt Schaub]] to receiver [[Andre Johnson]] at the (0:12) mark.\n\nFollowing a quick three and out by the Texans following halftime, punt returner [[Marcus Thigpen]] returned a punt for 72 yards for a touchdown. But for the remainder of the game the Dolphins offense failed to produce any scores, but held the Texans defense to two Shayne Graham field goals: 40 and 19 yards, respectively.\n\n====Week 2: vs. Oakland Raiders====\n{{AFB game box start\n|title= Week Two: Oakland Raiders at Miami Dolphins&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n|Visitor=Raiders\n|V1=7 |V2=3 |V3=0 |V4=3\n|Host='''Dolphins'''\n|H1=7 |H2=0 |H3=14 |H4=14\n|Date=September 16, 2012\n|Location=[[Sun Life Stadium]], [[Miami Gardens, Florida]]\n|StartTime=1:02 p.m. EDT<ref name=\"RaidersWeek2\">NOTE: The Week 2 game vs. the [[2012 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]] was originally scheduled at 4:15 p.m. EDT, but was moved up to a 1:00 p.m. EDT kickoff due to the Jewish holiday [[Rosh Hashanah]]. {{cite web |title=NFL moves up Raiders-Dolphins Week 2 kickoff |url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2012/04/19/nfl-moves-up-raiders-dolphins-week-2-kickoff/ |publisher=profootballtalk.nbcsports.com |date=April 19, 2012 |accessdate=April 19, 2012}}</ref>\n|TimeZone=[[North American Eastern Time Zone|EDT]]\n|ElapsedTime=3:10\n|Attendance=54,245\n|Weather={{convert|80|F|C}}, cloudy\n|Referee=Mike Shepherd\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Kevin Harlan]] and [[Solomon Wilcots]]\n|TVStation=CBS \n}}\n*'''Source:''' <ref>{{cite web|author=ProFootball Reference |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/201209160mia.htm |title= OAK vs MIA Boxscore |publisher= Sports Reference LLC |date=September 16, 2012 |accessdate=December 29, 2012}}</ref>\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |FirstEntry=yes|Quarter=1 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Ryan Tannehill]] 2-yard rush ([[Dan Carpenter]] kick) |Score= MIA 7\u20130}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 1 |Time= |Team=OAK |Event= [[Mike Goodson]] 64-yard pass from [[Carson Palmer]] ([[Sebastian Janikowski]] kick)  |Score= TIE 7\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 2 |Time= |Team=OAK |Event= Sebastian Janikowski 25-yard field goal |Score= OAK 10\u20137}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 3 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Reggie Bush]] 23-yard rush (Dan Carpenter kick) |Score= MIA 14\u201310}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 3 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= Reggie Bush 65-yard rush (Dan Carpenter kick)  |Score= MIA 21\u201310}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 4 |Time= |Team=OAK |Event= Sebastian Janikowski 27-yard field goal |Score= MIA 21\u201313}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 4 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Anthony Fasano]] 14-yard pass from Ryan Tannehill (Dan Carpenter kick) |Score= MIA 28\u201313}}\n    {{AFB Game Box Scoring Entry |Quarter= 4 |Time= |Team=MIA |Event= [[Lamar Miller]] 15-yard rush (Dan Carpenter kick) |Score= MIA 35\u201313|LastEntry=yes}}\n{{AFB game box end}}\n\nThe Dolphins entered their second game of the season with a 0\u20131 record, hosting the 0\u20131 [[2012 Oakland Raiders season|Oakland Raiders]]. The game marked the third consecutive season game between the two teams and 36th all-time, with the Dolphins winning the last two games with an average margin of victory of 18 points.\n\nMiami opened the game with an impressive 80-yard drive after the opening kickoff, which lead to a quarterback Ryan Tannehill two-yard rushing touchdown. Two possessions later at the (3:28) mark in the first quarter, Oakland quarterback [[Carson Palmer]] threw a 64-yard touchdown to [[Mike Goodson]] tying the game.\n\nThrough a majority of the second quarter both teams had a hard time moving across the 50-yard line, which was matched with impressive punting by both Dolphins punter [[Brandon Fields]] and Oakland punter [[Shane Lechler]]. By the end of the game Field punted the ball six times for 319 yards with an average yard per punt of 53.2 and Lechler punted the ball nine times for 422 yards with an average yard per punt of 46.9. However, Oakland managed to get the ball back with (3:33) left in the quarter and orchestrated a drive that ended with a [[Sebastian Janikowski]] 25-yard field goal. Both teams entered halftime evenly matched.\n\nIt didn't take long following halftime for the Dolphins rushing attack to shine. On the second possession of the half the Dolphins drove the ball down field and allowed [[Reggie Bush]] to rush for a 25-yard touchdown. On the next Miami possession, after a quick pass from Tannehill to receiver [[Brian Hartline]], Reggie Bush rushed 65 yards for another Miami touchdown. A few possessions later Oakland answered with a Janikowski 27-yard field goal.\n\nWith little opposition from the Oakland defense Miami's offense kept the ball moving and managed to score on their next two possessions. Once with an [[Anthony Fasano]] 14-yard reception touchdown from Tannehill, the first of his career, and again with a [[Lamar Miller]] 15-yard rushing touchdown, the first of his career. Oakland tried to stop the bleeding on their next drive, but quarterback Palmer was intercepted by safety [[Reshad Jones]].\n\nThe impressive game of 172 rushing yards on 26 attempts by running back Reggie Bush earned him the week 2 [[2012 NFL season#Players of the Week/Month|AFC Offensive Player of the Week]] and FedEx Air and Ground rusher of the week honors.\n\n====Week 3: vs. New York Jets====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week Three: New York Jets at Miami Dolphins&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 23\n |time=1:00 p.m. EDT\n |road='''Jets'''\n |R1=0|R2=3|R3=7|R4=10|R5=3\n |home=Dolphins\n |H1=7|H2=3|H3=7|H4=3|H5=0\n |stadium=Sun Life Stadium, Miami Gardens, Florida\n |attendance=60,102\n |weather={{convert|83|F|C}}, mostly cloudy\n |referee=[[Robert Frazer (American football official)|Robert Frazer]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Marv Albert]] and [[Rich Gannon]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*\n'''Second quarter'''\n*\n'''Third quarter'''\n*\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n'''Top rushers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n'''Top receivers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* NYJ \u2013\n* MIA \u2013\n}}\nWith the loss, the Dolphins fell to 1\u20132.\n\n====Week 4: at Arizona Cardinals====\n{{Americanfootballbox\n |titlestyle={{NFLPrimaryStyle|Miami Dolphins|border=2}};text-align:center;\n |state=autocollapse\n |title= Week Four: Miami Dolphins at Arizona Cardinals&nbsp;\u2013 Game summary\n |date=September 30\n |time=4:05 p.m. EDT/1:05 p.m. Arizona time\n |road=Dolphins\n |R1=0|R2=13|R3=0|R4=8|R5=0\n |home='''Cardinals'''\n |H1=0|H2=0|H3=7|H4=14|H5=3\n |stadium=[[University of Phoenix Stadium]], [[Glendale, Arizona]]\n |attendance=60,183\n |weather=Played indoors (retractable roof closed)\n |referee=[[Scott Green (American football official)|Scott Green]]\n |TV=CBS\n |TVAnnouncers=[[Bill Macatee]] and [[Steve Tasker]]\n |reference=\n |scoring=\n'''First quarter'''\n*\n'''Second quarter'''\n*\n'''Third quarter'''\n*\n'''Fourth quarter'''\n |stats=\n'''Top passers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n'''Top rushers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n'''Top receivers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n'''Top tacklers'''\n* MIA \u2013\n* ARI \u2013\n}}\nThe Dolphins were seeking their first win in Phoenix since [[1996 Miami Dolphins season|1996]].

Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|\"California 100 Company\"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general.

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

The two rivers join in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], flowing into the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].\n\nThe [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].\n\n===Regions===\n\n{{further|List of regions of California|List of places in

The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"VICE\" /> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC20170127\"/>\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.

In 1846, the total settler population of the western part of the old Alta California had been estimated to be no more than 8,000, plus about 100,000 Native Americans, down from about 300,000 before Hispanic settlement in 1769.<ref name=\"Osborne2012\">{{cite book|first=Thomas J. |last=Osborne|title=Pacific Eldorado: A History of Greater California|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=FvA3jL4CFCMC}}|date=November 29, 2012|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-1-118-29217-4}}</ref>\n\nIn 1848, only one week before the official American annexation of the area, gold was discovered in California, this being an event which was to forever alter both the state's demographics and its finances.

Still, several smaller military units within the Union army were unofficially associated with the state of California, such as the [[2nd Regiment of Cavalry, Massachusetts Volunteers|\"California 100 Company\"]], due to a majority of their members being from California.\n\nAt the time of California's admission into the Union, travel between California and the rest of the continental United States had been a time-consuming and dangerous feat. Nineteen years afterwards, in 1869, shortly after the conclusion of the Civil War, a more direct connection was developed with the completion of the [[First Transcontinental Railroad]] in 1869. California was then easy to reach.\n\nMuch of the state was extremely well suited to fruit cultivation and agriculture in general.

The cool [[California Current]] offshore often creates summer [[fog]] near the coast. Farther inland, there are colder winters and hotter summers. The maritime moderation results in the shoreline summertime temperatures of [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Francisco]] being the coolest of all major metropolitan areas of the United States and uniquely cool compared to areas on the same latitude in the interior and on the east coast of the North American continent. Even the [[San Diego]] shoreline bordering Mexico is cooler in summer than most areas in the contiguous United States. Just a few miles inland, summer temperature extremes are significantly higher, with downtown Los Angeles being several degrees [[Climate of the Los Angeles Basin|warmer]] than at the coast. The same [[microclimate]] phenomenon is seen in the [[San Francisco Bay Area#Climate|climate]] of the Bay Area, where areas sheltered from the sea experience significantly hotter summers than nearby areas closer to the ocean.\n\nNorthern parts of the state have more rain than the south. California's mountain ranges also influence the climate: some of the rainiest parts of the state are west-facing mountain slopes. Northwestern California has a [[temperate climate]], and the Central Valley has a Mediterranean climate but with greater temperature extremes than the coast. The high mountains, including the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]], have an [[alpine climate]] with snow in winter and mild to moderate heat in summer.\n\nCalifornia's mountains produce [[rain shadow]]s on the eastern side, creating extensive [[desert]]s. The higher elevation deserts of [[eastern California]] have hot summers and cold winters, while the low deserts east of the Southern California mountains have hot summers and nearly frostless mild winters.

The two rivers join in the [[Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin River Delta]], flowing into the Pacific Ocean through [[San Francisco Bay]]. Many major tributaries feed into the Sacramento\u2013San Joaquin system, including the [[Pit River]], [[Feather River]] and [[Tuolumne River]].\n\nThe [[Klamath River|Klamath]] and [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity Rivers]] drain a large area in far northwestern California. The [[Eel River (California)|Eel River]] and [[Salinas River (California)|Salinas River]] each drain portions of the California coast, north and south of San Francisco Bay, respectively. The [[Mojave River]] is the primary watercourse in the Mojave Desert, and the [[Santa Ana River]] drains much of the [[Transverse Ranges]] as it bisects Southern California. The [[Colorado River]] forms the state's southeast border with [[Arizona]].\n\nMost of California's major rivers are dammed as part of two massive water projects: the [[Central Valley Project]], providing water for agriculture in the Central Valley, and the [[California State Water Project]] diverting water from northern to southern California. The state's coasts, rivers, and other bodies of water are regulated by the [[California Coastal Commission]].\n\n===Regions===\n\n{{further|List of regions of California|List of places in

The [[California National Party]] and the [[California Freedom Coalition]] both advocate for Californian independence along the lines of [[Progressivism in the United States|progressivism]] and [[civic nationalism]].<ref>{{cite web|title=California could see new political party with independence goal|author = Jim Miller|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|accessdate=19 March 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160308223549/http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article54004530.html|archive-date=8 March 2016|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"VICE\" /> The [[Yes California]] movement attempted to organize an independence referendum via [[ballot initiative]] for 2019, which was then postponed.<ref>{{cite web|author=Tech Insider |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/calexit-explainer-california-plans-to-secede-2016-11 |title=What is 'Calexit' and how can California secede from the US? |website=Business Insider |date=2016-11-09 |accessdate=2017-03-31}}</ref><ref name=\"CNBC20170127\"/>\n\nThe Democrats also now hold a supermajority in both houses of the state legislature. There are 60 Democrats and 20 Republicans in the Assembly; and 29 Democrats and 11 Republicans in the Senate.\n\nThe trend towards the Democratic Party is most obvious in presidential elections. From [[1952 United States presidential election|1952]] through [[1988 United States presidential election|1988]], California was a Republican leaning state, with the party carrying the state's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] in nine of ten elections, with [[1964 United States presidential election|1964]] as the exception. Southern California Republicans [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Ronald Reagan]] were both elected twice as the 37th and 40th U.S. Presidents, respectively. However, Democrats have won all of California's electoral votes for the last seven elections,<!--7 thru 2016--> starting in [[1992 United States presidential election|1992]].\n\nIn the United States House, the Democrats held a 34\u201319 edge in the CA delegation of the [[110th United States Congress]] in 2007. As the result of [[gerrymandering]], the districts in California were usually dominated by one or the other party, and few districts were considered competitive. In 2008, Californians passed Proposition 20 to empower a 14-member independent citizen commission to redraw districts for both local politicians and Congress. After the 2012 elections, when the new system took effect, Democrats gained four seats and held a 38\u201315 majority in the delegation. Following the [[2018 United States House of Representatives elections|2018 midterm House elections]], Democrats won 46 out of 53 congressional house seats in California, leaving Republicans with seven.\n\nIn general, Democratic strength is centered in the populous [[Coastal California|coastal regions]] of the [[Los Angeles metropolitan area]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]. Republican strength is still greatest in eastern parts of the state. [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] had remained largely Republican until the 2016 and 2018 elections, in which a majority of the county's votes were cast for Democratic candidates.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ocvote.com/fileadmin/live/gen2016/results.htm|title=2016 Presidential General Election|website=Ocvote.com|access-date=November 10, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url= https://latimes.com/la-ol-opinion-newsletter-midterm-election-20181110-htmlstory.html |title=RIP Republican Orange County |last=Thornton |first=Paul |date=November 10, 2018 |newspaper=Los Angeles Times}}</ref> One study ranked [[Berkeley California|Berkeley]], [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[Inglewood, California|Inglewood]] and [[San Francisco]] in the top 20 most liberal American cities; and [[Bakersfield, California|Bakersfield]], [[Orange, California|Orange]], [[Escondido, California|Escondido]], [[Garden Grove, California|Garden Grove]], and [[Simi Valley, California|Simi Valley]] in the top 20 most conservative cities.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |publisher=Bay Area Center for Voting Research |title=Study Ranks America's Most Liberal and Conservative Cities |date=August 16, 2005 |access-date=February 20, 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110501140306/http://govpro.com/content/gov_imp_31439/index.html |archive-date=May 1, 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn October 2012, out of the 23,802,577 people eligible to vote, 18,245,970 people were registered to vote.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\">{{cite web |url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |title=Voter Registration by County |author=|date=October 22, 2012 |website=Elections |publisher=California Secretary of State |access-date=January 12, 2013 |url-status=dead |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130117084449/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/02-voter-reg-stats-by-county.pdf |archive-date=January 17, 2013 }}</ref> Of the people registered, the three largest registered groups were Democrats (7,966,422), Republicans (5,356,608), and [[Decline to State]] (3,820,545).<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" /> [[Los Angeles County]] had the largest number of registered Democrats (2,430,612) and Republicans (1,037,031) of any county in the state.<ref name=\"SoS2012GenVotRegStats\" />\n\n==See also==\n\n{{Portal|California|United States}}\n* [[Index of California-related articles]]\n* [[Outline of California]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{NoteFoot}}\n\n==References==\n===Citations===\n\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Works cited===\n\n* {{cite book|first=Saul Bernard|last=Cohen|title=Geopolitics of the World System|url= {{google books |plainurl=y |id=QkMD8HKRlgoC|page=115}}|date=2003|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-8476-9907-0|ref=harv}}\n* {{cite book |last=Starr |first=Kevin |authorlink=Kevin Starr |title=California: A History |series=Modern Library Chronicles |volume=23 |date=2007 |publisher=Random House Digital, Inc. |isbn=978-0-8129-7753-0 |ref=harv}}\n\n==Further reading==\n\n* {{Cite book |last=Chartkoff |first=Joseph L. |author2=Chartkoff, Kerry Kona |date=1984 |title=The archaeology of California |location=Stanford |publisher=[[Stanford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-8047-1157-9 |oclc=11351549 |url= https://archive.org/details/archaeologyofcal00char }}\n* {{Cite book |last=Fagan |first=Brian |date=2003 |title=Before California: An archaeologist looks at our earliest inhabitants |location=Lanham, MD |publisher=[[Rowman & Littlefield Publishers]] |isbn=978-0-7425-2794-2 |oclc=226025645}}\n* {{Cite book |last=Hart |first=James D. |date=1978 |title=A Companion to California |location=New York, NY |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-502400-5 |oclc=}}\n* Matthews, Glenna.
