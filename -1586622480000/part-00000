Within the Sotho-Tswana group, Southern Sotho is most closely related to  [[Lozi language|Lozi]] (''Silozi''), with which it forms the Sesotho-Lozi group within Sotho-Tswana.\n\nThe [[Northern Sotho]] group is geographical, and includes a number of dialects also closely related to Sotho-Lozi. [[Tswana language|Tswana]] is also known as \"Western Sesotho\".\n\nThe Sotho-Tswana group is in turn closely related to the other [[Southern Bantu]] languages, including the [[Venda language|Venda]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], [[Tonga language (Mozambique)|Tonga]], [[Lozi language|Lozi]] which is native to [[Zambia]] and the other surrounding [[Southern African|Southern African countries]] and [[Nguni languages]], and possibly{{clarify|date=September 2015}} also the [[Makua languages|Makua]] (zone P) languages  of [[Tanzania]] and [[Mozambique]].\n\n''Sotho'' is the root word. Various prefixes may be added for specific derivations, such as ''Sesotho'' for the Sotho language and ''Basotho'' for the [[Sotho people]]. Use of ''Sesotho'' rather than ''Sotho'' for the language in English has seen increasing use since the 1980s, especially in [[South African English]] and in Lesotho.\n\n==Dialects==\n[[File:National Women's Day detail Sesotho.jpg|left|thumb|A Mosotho woman holding up a sign protesting violence against women, written in her native Sesotho language, at a [[National Women's Day]] protest at the National University of Lesotho. The sign translates: \"If you do not listen to women, we will lose patience with you.\" (2008)]]\nExcept for faint lexical variation within Lesotho, and for marked lexical variation between the Lesotho/[[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] variety and that of the large urban townships to the north (such as [[Soweto]]) due to heavy borrowing from neighbouring languages, there is no discernible dialect variation in this language.\n\nHowever, one point that seems to often confuse authors who attempt to study the dialectology of Sesotho is the term ''[[Basotho]]'', which can variously mean \"Sotho\u2013Tswana speakers,\" \"Southern Sotho and Northern Sotho speakers,\" \"Sesotho speakers,\" and \"residents of Lesotho.\" The Nguni language [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]] has been heavily influenced by Sesotho; its speakers have mixed Nguni and Sotho\u2013Tswana ancestry. It seems that it is sometimes treated erroneously as a dialect of Sesotho called \"Sephuthi.\" However, Phuthi is mutually unintelligible with standard Sesotho and thus cannot in any sense be termed a dialect of it. The occasional tendency to label all minor languages spoken in Lesotho as \"dialects\" of Sesotho is considered patronising,{{by whom?|date=July 2019}} in addition to being linguistically inaccurate and in part serving a national myth that all citizens of Lesotho have Sesotho as their mother tongue.\n\nAdditionally, being derived from a language or dialect very closely related to modern Sesotho,<ref name = \"Sil_clik\">to the extent that it even has several words that resemble Sesotho words with clicks:\n: ''ku kala'' to begin (Sesotho ''ho qala'' {{IPA|[h\u028a\u01c3\u0251l\u0251]}})\n: ''ku kabana'' to quarrel (Sesotho ''ho qabana'' {{IPA|[h\u028a\u01c3\u0251b\u0251n\u0251]}}),\none could just as easily say that these words were imported from Nguni languages (''ukuqala'' and ''ukuxabana'', which is where the Sesotho versions come from), and the language does also contain words resembling click words from Nguni but not from Sesotho (such as ''ku kabanga'' to think, c.f. Zulu ''ukucabanga'').</ref> the [[Zambia]]n Sotho\u2013Tswana language [[Lozi language|Lozi]] is also sometimes cited as a modern dialect of Sesotho named ''Serotse'' or ''Sekololo''.\n\nThe oral history of the Basotho and Northern Sotho peoples (as contained in their [[diboko|liboko]]) states that 'Mathulare, a daughter of the chief of the ''Bafokeng'' nation (an old and respected people), was married to chief Tabane of the (Southern) ''Bakgatla'' (a branch of the ''Bahurutse'', who are one of the most ancient of the Sotho\u2013Tswana tribes), and bore the founders of five tribes: ''Bapedi'' (by Mopedi), ''Makgolokwe'' (by Kgetsi<!-- not Mokgolokwe?? -->), ''Baphuthing'' (by Mophuthing, and later the Mzizi of [[Dlamini]], connected with the present-day [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]]), ''Batlokwa'' (by Kgwadi), and ''Basia'' (by Mosia). These were the first peoples to be called \"Basotho\", before many of their descendants and other peoples came together to form [[Moshoeshoe I]]'s nation in the early 19th century. The situation is even further complicated by various historical factors, such as members of parent clans joining their descendants or various clans calling themselves by the same names (because they honour the same legendary ancestor or have the same totem).\n\nAn often repeated story is that when the modern Basotho nation was established by King [[Moshoeshoe I]], his own \"dialect\" Sekwena was chosen over two other popular variations Setlokwa and Setaung and that these two still exist as \"dialects\" of modern Sesotho.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The inclusion of Setlokwa in this scenario is confusing, as the modern language named \"Setlokwa\" is a Northern Sesotho language spoken by descendants of the same Batlokwa whose attack on the young chief Moshoeshoe's settlement during [[Difaqane|Lifaqane]] (led by the famous widow [[Mmanthatisi]]) caused them to migrate to present-day Lesotho. On the other hand, Doke & Mofokeng claims that the tendency of many Sesotho speakers to say for example ''ke ronngwe'' {{IPA|[k\u02bc\u026a\u0280\u028a\u014b\u0329\u014b\u02b7e]}} instead of ''ke romilwe'' {{IPA|[k\u02bc\u026a\u0280u\u02ccmil\u02b7e]}} when forming the perfect of the passive of verbs ending in ''-ma'' {{IPA|[m\u0251]}} (as well as forming their perfects with ''-mme'' {{IPA|[m\u0329me]}} instead of ''-mile'' {{IPA|[mile]}}) is \"a relic of the extinct Tlokwa dialect\".\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:South Africa Sotho speakers proportion map.svg|thumb|Geographical distribution of Sotho in South Africa: proportion of the population that speaks Sotho at home.\n{{columns\n|col1=\n{{legend|#EDF8E9|0\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#BAE4B3|20\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#74C476|40\u201360%}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#31A354|60\u201380%}}\n{{legend|#006D2C|80\u2013100%}}}}]]\n[[File:South Africa Sotho speakers density map.svg|thumb|Geographical distribution of Sotho in South Africa: density of Sotho home-language speakers.\n{{columns\n|col1=\n{{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#ffeda0|1\u20133 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fed976|3\u201310 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#feb24c|10\u201330 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fd8d3c|30\u2013100 /km\u00b2}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#fc4e2a|100\u2013300 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#e31a1c|300\u20131000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#bc0026|1000\u20133000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km\u00b2}}}}]]\nAccording to the [[South African National Census of 2011]], there were almost four million first language Sesotho speakers recorded in South Africa \u2013 approximately eight per cent of the population. Most Sesotho speakers in South Africa reside in [[Free State (province)|Free State]] and [[Gauteng]]. [[Sesotho]] is also the main language spoken by the people of [[Lesotho]], where, according to 1993 data, it was spoken by about 1,493,000 people, or 85% of the population. The census fails to record other South Africans for whom [[Sesotho]] is a second or third language. Such speakers are found in all major residential areas of [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|Metropolitan Municipalities]] - such as [[Johannesburg]], and [[Tshwane]] - where multilingualism and polylectalism are very high.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Official status===\nSesotho is one of the eleven [[official languages of South Africa]], one of the two official [[languages of Lesotho]] and one of the sixteen official [[languages of Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Derived languages==\nSesotho is one of the many languages from which the pseudo-language [[Tsotsitaal]] is derived. Tsotsitaal is not a proper language, as it is primarily a unique vocabulary and a set of idioms but used with the grammar and inflexion rules of another language (usually Sesotho or [[Zulu language|Zulu]]). It is a part of the youth culture in most Southern [[Gauteng]] \"[[township (South Africa)|townships]]\" and is the primary language used in [[kwaito|Kwaito music]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{main|Sesotho phonology}}\nThe sound system of Sesotho is unusual in many respects. It has [[ejective consonant]]s, [[click consonant]]s, a [[uvular trill]], a relatively large number of [[affricate consonant]]s, no [[prenasalised consonant]]s, and a rare form of vowel-height (alternatively, [[advanced tongue root]]) harmony. In total, the language contains some 39 consonantal<ref name = \"lab_cons\">75 if you include the [[Sesotho phonology#pp labialization|labialized]] consonants.</ref> and 9 vowel [[phonemes]].\n\nIt also has a large number of complex sound transformations which often change the phones of words due to the influence of other (sometimes invisible) sounds.\n\n\n{| class = \"wikitable\" style = \"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br>alveolar]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[central consonant|central]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[Lateral consonant|lateral]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|[[Click consonant|Click]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[glottalization|glottalized]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u01c3\u02c0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u01c3\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|nasal\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|{{IPA|m}}||{{IPA|n}}||&nbsp;||colspan=2|{{IPA|\u0272}}||{{IPA|\u014b}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[ejective consonant|ejective]]\n|{{IPA|p\u02bc}}||{{IPA|t\u02bc}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|k\u02bc}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]]\n|{{IPA|p\u02b0}}||{{IPA|t\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|k\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[voiced consonant|voiced]]\n|{{IPA|b}}||{{IPA|(d)}}<sup>1</sup>||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\" |[[ejective consonant|ejective]]\n|&nbsp;||{{IPA|ts\u02bc}}||{{IPA|t\u026c\u02bc}}||{{IPA|t\u0283\u02bc}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]]\n|&nbsp;||{{IPA|ts\u02b0}}||{{IPA|t\u026c\u02b0}}||{{IPA|t\u0283\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|kx\u02b0}} / {{IPA|x}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|voiceless\n|{{IPA|f}}||{{IPA|s}}||{{IPA|\u026c}}||{{IPA|\u0283}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|h}} ~ {{IPA|\u0266}}\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|voiced\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u0292}} / {{IPA|d\u0292}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|l}}||&nbsp;||{{IPA|j}}||{{IPA|w}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u0280}}||&nbsp;\n|}\n\n# {{IPA|[d]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/l/}}, occurring only before the close vowels ({{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}).

The grammatical gender system does not encode sex gender, and indeed, Bantu languages in general are not [[Grammatical marker|grammatically marked]] for gender.\n\nAnother well-known property of the Bantu languages is their [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] morphology. Additionally, they tend to lack any [[grammatical case]] systems, indicating noun roles almost exclusively through word order.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sotho calendar]]\n* [[Sotho people]]\n* [[South African Translators' Association]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Batibo, H.

The sign translates: \"If you do not listen to women, we will lose patience with you.\" (2008)]]\nExcept for faint lexical variation within Lesotho, and for marked lexical variation between the Lesotho/[[Free State (South African province)|Free State]] variety and that of the large urban townships to the north (such as [[Soweto]]) due to heavy borrowing from neighbouring languages, there is no discernible dialect variation in this language.\n\nHowever, one point that seems to often confuse authors who attempt to study the dialectology of Sesotho is the term ''[[Basotho]]'', which can variously mean \"Sotho\u2013Tswana speakers,\" \"Southern Sotho and Northern Sotho speakers,\" \"Sesotho speakers,\" and \"residents of Lesotho.\" The Nguni language [[Phuthi language|Phuthi]] has been heavily influenced by Sesotho; its speakers have mixed Nguni and Sotho\u2013Tswana ancestry. It seems that it is sometimes treated erroneously as a dialect of Sesotho called \"Sephuthi.\" However, Phuthi is mutually unintelligible with standard Sesotho and thus cannot in any sense be termed a dialect of it. The occasional tendency to label all minor languages spoken in Lesotho as \"dialects\" of Sesotho is considered patronising,{{by whom?|date=July 2019}} in addition to being linguistically inaccurate and in part serving a national myth that all citizens of Lesotho have Sesotho as their mother tongue.\n\nAdditionally, being derived from a language or dialect very closely related to modern Sesotho,<ref name = \"Sil_clik\">to the extent that it even has several words that resemble Sesotho words with clicks:\n: ''ku kala'' to begin (Sesotho ''ho qala'' {{IPA|[h\u028a\u01c3\u0251l\u0251]}})\n: ''ku kabana'' to quarrel (Sesotho ''ho qabana'' {{IPA|[h\u028a\u01c3\u0251b\u0251n\u0251]}}),\none could just as easily say that these words were imported from Nguni languages (''ukuqala'' and ''ukuxabana'', which is where the Sesotho versions come from), and the language does also contain words resembling click words from Nguni but not from Sesotho (such as ''ku kabanga'' to think, c.f. Zulu ''ukucabanga'').</ref> the [[Zambia]]n Sotho\u2013Tswana language [[Lozi language|Lozi]] is also sometimes cited as a modern dialect of Sesotho named ''Serotse'' or ''Sekololo''.\n\nThe oral history of the Basotho and Northern Sotho peoples (as contained in their [[diboko|liboko]]) states that 'Mathulare, a daughter of the chief of the ''Bafokeng'' nation (an old and respected people), was married to chief Tabane of the (Southern) ''Bakgatla'' (a branch of the ''Bahurutse'', who are one of the most ancient of the Sotho\u2013Tswana tribes), and bore the founders of five tribes: ''Bapedi'' (by Mopedi), ''Makgolokwe'' (by Kgetsi<!-- not Mokgolokwe?? -->), ''Baphuthing'' (by Mophuthing, and later the Mzizi of [[Dlamini]], connected with the present-day [[Ndebele people (Zimbabwe)|Ndebele]]), ''Batlokwa'' (by Kgwadi), and ''Basia'' (by Mosia). These were the first peoples to be called \"Basotho\", before many of their descendants and other peoples came together to form [[Moshoeshoe I]]'s nation in the early 19th century. The situation is even further complicated by various historical factors, such as members of parent clans joining their descendants or various clans calling themselves by the same names (because they honour the same legendary ancestor or have the same totem).\n\nAn often repeated story is that when the modern Basotho nation was established by King [[Moshoeshoe I]], his own \"dialect\" Sekwena was chosen over two other popular variations Setlokwa and Setaung and that these two still exist as \"dialects\" of modern Sesotho.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} The inclusion of Setlokwa in this scenario is confusing, as the modern language named \"Setlokwa\" is a Northern Sesotho language spoken by descendants of the same Batlokwa whose attack on the young chief Moshoeshoe's settlement during [[Difaqane|Lifaqane]] (led by the famous widow [[Mmanthatisi]]) caused them to migrate to present-day Lesotho. On the other hand, Doke & Mofokeng claims that the tendency of many Sesotho speakers to say for example ''ke ronngwe'' {{IPA|[k\u02bc\u026a\u0280\u028a\u014b\u0329\u014b\u02b7e]}} instead of ''ke romilwe'' {{IPA|[k\u02bc\u026a\u0280u\u02ccmil\u02b7e]}} when forming the perfect of the passive of verbs ending in ''-ma'' {{IPA|[m\u0251]}} (as well as forming their perfects with ''-mme'' {{IPA|[m\u0329me]}} instead of ''-mile'' {{IPA|[mile]}}) is \"a relic of the extinct Tlokwa dialect\".\n\n==Geographic distribution==\n[[File:South Africa Sotho speakers proportion map.svg|thumb|Geographical distribution of Sotho in South Africa: proportion of the population that speaks Sotho at home.\n{{columns\n|col1=\n{{legend|#EDF8E9|0\u201320%}}\n{{legend|#BAE4B3|20\u201340%}}\n{{legend|#74C476|40\u201360%}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#31A354|60\u201380%}}\n{{legend|#006D2C|80\u2013100%}}}}]]\n[[File:South Africa Sotho speakers density map.svg|thumb|Geographical distribution of Sotho in South Africa: density of Sotho home-language speakers.\n{{columns\n|col1=\n{{legend|#ffffcc|&lt;1 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#ffeda0|1\u20133 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fed976|3\u201310 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#feb24c|10\u201330 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#fd8d3c|30\u2013100 /km\u00b2}}\n|col2=\n{{legend|#fc4e2a|100\u2013300 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#e31a1c|300\u20131000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#bc0026|1000\u20133000 /km\u00b2}}\n{{legend|#800026|&gt;3000 /km\u00b2}}}}]]\nAccording to the [[South African National Census of 2011]], there were almost four million first language Sesotho speakers recorded in South Africa \u2013 approximately eight per cent of the population. Most Sesotho speakers in South Africa reside in [[Free State (province)|Free State]] and [[Gauteng]]. [[Sesotho]] is also the main language spoken by the people of [[Lesotho]], where, according to 1993 data, it was spoken by about 1,493,000 people, or 85% of the population. The census fails to record other South Africans for whom [[Sesotho]] is a second or third language. Such speakers are found in all major residential areas of [[Metropolitan municipality (South Africa)|Metropolitan Municipalities]] - such as [[Johannesburg]], and [[Tshwane]] - where multilingualism and polylectalism are very high.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\n===Official status===\nSesotho is one of the eleven [[official languages of South Africa]], one of the two official [[languages of Lesotho]] and one of the sixteen official [[languages of Zimbabwe]].\n\n==Derived languages==\nSesotho is one of the many languages from which the pseudo-language [[Tsotsitaal]] is derived. Tsotsitaal is not a proper language, as it is primarily a unique vocabulary and a set of idioms but used with the grammar and inflexion rules of another language (usually Sesotho or [[Zulu language|Zulu]]). It is a part of the youth culture in most Southern [[Gauteng]] \"[[township (South Africa)|townships]]\" and is the primary language used in [[kwaito|Kwaito music]].\n\n==Phonology==\n{{main|Sesotho phonology}}\nThe sound system of Sesotho is unusual in many respects. It has [[ejective consonant]]s, [[click consonant]]s, a [[uvular trill]], a relatively large number of [[affricate consonant]]s, no [[prenasalised consonant]]s, and a rare form of vowel-height (alternatively, [[advanced tongue root]]) harmony. In total, the language contains some 39 consonantal<ref name = \"lab_cons\">75 if you include the [[Sesotho phonology#pp labialization|labialized]] consonants.</ref> and 9 vowel [[phonemes]].\n\nIt also has a large number of complex sound transformations which often change the phones of words due to the influence of other (sometimes invisible) sounds.\n\n\n{| class = \"wikitable\" style = \"text-align: center\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|&nbsp;\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Labial consonant|Labial]]\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Alveolar consonant|Alveolar]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Postalveolar consonant|Post-<br>alveolar]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Palatal consonant|Palatal]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Velar consonant|Velar]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Uvular consonant|Uvular]]\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Glottal consonant|Glottal]]\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[central consonant|central]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[Lateral consonant|lateral]]\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|[[Click consonant|Click]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[glottalization|glottalized]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u01c3\u02c0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u01c3\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|nasal\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u1d51\u01c3}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\"|[[Nasal consonant|Nasal]]\n|{{IPA|m}}||{{IPA|n}}||&nbsp;||colspan=2|{{IPA|\u0272}}||{{IPA|\u014b}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"3\"|[[Stop consonant|Stop]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[ejective consonant|ejective]]\n|{{IPA|p\u02bc}}||{{IPA|t\u02bc}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|k\u02bc}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]]\n|{{IPA|p\u02b0}}||{{IPA|t\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|k\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[voiced consonant|voiced]]\n|{{IPA|b}}||{{IPA|(d)}}<sup>1</sup>||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Affricate consonant|Affricate]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\" |[[ejective consonant|ejective]]\n|&nbsp;||{{IPA|ts\u02bc}}||{{IPA|t\u026c\u02bc}}||{{IPA|t\u0283\u02bc}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|[[aspiration (linguistics)|aspirated]]\n|&nbsp;||{{IPA|ts\u02b0}}||{{IPA|t\u026c\u02b0}}||{{IPA|t\u0283\u02b0}}||&nbsp;||rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|kx\u02b0}} / {{IPA|x}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|[[Fricative consonant|Fricative]]\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|voiceless\n|{{IPA|f}}||{{IPA|s}}||{{IPA|\u026c}}||{{IPA|\u0283}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||rowspan=\"2\"|{{IPA|h}} ~ {{IPA|\u0266}}\n|-\n!style = \"text-align: left; font-size: 80%\"|voiced\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u0292}} / {{IPA|d\u0292}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |[[Approximant consonant|Approximant]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|l}}||&nbsp;||{{IPA|j}}||{{IPA|w}}||&nbsp;||&nbsp;\n|-\n!colspan=\"2\" |[[Trill consonant|Trill]]\n|&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||&nbsp;||{{IPA|\u0280}}||&nbsp;\n|}\n\n# {{IPA|[d]}} is an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/l/}}, occurring only before the close vowels ({{IPA|/i/}} and {{IPA|/u/}}).

The grammatical gender system does not encode sex gender, and indeed, Bantu languages in general are not [[Grammatical marker|grammatically marked]] for gender.\n\nAnother well-known property of the Bantu languages is their [[agglutinative language|agglutinative]] morphology. Additionally, they tend to lack any [[grammatical case]] systems, indicating noun roles almost exclusively through word order.\n\n==See also==\n* [[Sotho calendar]]\n* [[Sotho people]]\n* [[South African Translators' Association]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Batibo, H.

{"title_page": "Volume of an n-ball", "text_new": "{{Short description|Generalizing the notion of 3-dimensional volume to regions of points in n-dimensional Euclidean space with distance to a center less than a constant}}\n{{DISPLAYTITLE:Volume of an ''n''-ball}}\n{{hypersphere_volume_and_surface_area_graphs.svg|250px}}\nIn [[geometry]], a '''[[ball (mathematics)|ball]]''' is a region in space comprising all points within a fixed distance from a given point; that is, it is the region enclosed by a [[sphere]] or [[hypersphere]]. An {{math|''n''}}-ball is a ball in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The '''volume of a unit {{math|''n''}}-ball''' is an important expression that occurs in formulas throughout mathematics; it generalizes the notion of the volume enclosed by a sphere in 3-dimensional space.\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n=== The volume ===\nThe {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:<ref>Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/5.19#E4, Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.</ref>\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n,</math>\nwhere {{math|\u0393}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]].  The gamma function extends the [[factorial]] function to non-integer arguments.  It satisfies {{math|\u0393(''n'') {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 1)!}} if {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and {{math|\u0393(''n'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 {{sfrac|1|2}}) \u00b7 (''n'' \u2212 {{sfrac|3|2}}) \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u03c0<sup>1/2</sup>}} if {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative integer.\n\n=== Alternative forms ===\nUsing explicit formulas for [[particular values of the gamma function]] at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}V_{2k}(R) &= \\frac{\\pi^k}{k!}R^{2k}, \\\\\nV_{2k+1}(R) &= \\frac{2^{k+1}\\pi^k}{(2k+1)!!}R^{2k+1} = \\frac{2(k!)(4\\pi)^k}{(2k+1)!}R^{2k+1}.\\end{align}</math>\nIn the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [[double factorial]] {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!!}} is defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} as {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!! {{=}} 1 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7 (2''k'' \u2212 1) \u00b7 (2''k'' + 1)}}. \n\nInstead of expressing the volume {{math|''V''}} of the ball in terms of its radius {{math|''R''}}, the formula can be [[Inverse function|inverted]] to express the radius as a function of the volume:\n:<math>R_n(V) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)^\\frac{1}{n}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}V^\\frac{1}{n}.</math>\nThis formula, too, can be separated into even- and odd-dimensional cases using factorials and double factorials in place of the gamma function:\n:<math>\\begin{align}R_{2k}(V) &= \\frac{(k!V)^\\frac{1}{2k}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}, \\\\\nR_{2k+1}(V) &= \\left(\\frac{(2k+1)!!V}{2^{k+1}\\pi^k}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2k+1}.\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Recursions ===\nThe volume satisfies several recursive formulas. These formulas can either be proved directly or proved as consequences of the general volume formula above. The simplest to state is a formula for the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball in terms of the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball of the same radius:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R).</math>\n\nThere is also a formula for the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball in terms of the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball of the same radius:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} V_{n-1}(R).</math>\nUsing explicit formulas for the gamma function again shows that the one-dimension recursion formula can also be written as:\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_{2k}(R) &= R\\pi \\frac{(2k - 1)!!}{2^k k!} V_{2k-1}(R) = R\\pi \\frac{(2k-1)(2k-3) \\cdots 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1}{(2k)(2k - 2) \\cdots 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2} V_{2k-1}(R), \\\\[10px]\nV_{2k+1}(R) &= 2R\\frac{2^k k!}{(2k+1)!!} V_{2k}(R) = 2R\\frac{(2k)(2k - 2) \\cdots 6 \\cdot 4 \\cdot 2}{(2k+1)(2k-1) \\cdots 5 \\cdot 3 \\cdot 1} V_{2k}(R).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nThe radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} may be expressed recursively in terms of the radius of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball or an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball.

Then the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} approaches zero as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity. This can be shown using the two-dimension recursion formula. At each step, the new factor being multiplied into the volume is proportional to {{math|1 / ''n''}}, where the constant of proportionality {{math|2\u03c0''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is independent of {{math|''n''}}. Eventually, {{math|''n''}} is so large that the new factor is less than 1. From then on, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball must decrease at least geometrically, and therefore it tends to zero. A variant on this proof uses the one-dimension recursion formula. Here, the new factor is proportional to a quotient of gamma functions. [[Gautschi's inequality]] bounds this quotient above by {{math|''n''<sup>\u22121/2</sup>}}. The argument concludes as before by showing that the volumes decrease at least geometrically.\n\nA more precise description of the high dimensional behavior of the volume can be obtained using [[Stirling's approximation]]. It implies the [[asymptotic formula]]:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\pi}}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi e}{n}\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}R^n.</math>\nThe error in this approximation is a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. Stirling's approximation is in fact an underestimate of the gamma function, so the above formula is an upper bound. This provides another proof that the volume of the ball decreases exponentially: When {{math|''n''}} is sufficiently large, the factor {{math|''R''{{sqrt|2\u03c0''e''/''n''}}}} is less than one, and then the same argument as before applies.\n\nIf instead {{math|''V''}} is fixed while {{math|''n''}} is large, then by Stirling's approximation again, the radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} is approximately\n:<math>R_n(V) \\sim (\\pi n)^{\\frac{1}{2n}}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2\\pi e}}V^{\\frac{1}{n}}.</math>\nThis expression is a lower bound for {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}}, and the error is again a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. As {{math|''n''}} increases, {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}} grows as <math>\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}).</math>\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nLet {{math|''A{{sub|n}}''(''R'')}} denote the surface area of the [[n-sphere|{{math|''n''}}-sphere]] of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the boundary of the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball is a union of concentric spheres, and consequently the surface area and the volume are related by:\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{d}{dR}V_{n+1}(R).</math>\nCombining this with the explicit formula for the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball gives\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n + 1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\big(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\big)}R^n.</math>\n\nSince the volume is proportional to a power of the radius, the above relation leads to a simple equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball. By applying the two-dimension recursion formula, it also gives an equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball.  These formulas, together with the volume and surface area of zero-dimensional balls, can be used as a system of recurrence relations for the volumes and surface areas of balls:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_0(R) &= 1, \\\\\nA_0(R) &= 2, \\\\\nV_{n+1}(R) &= \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R), \\\\\nA_{n+1}(R) &= (2\\pi R)V_n(R).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Dimension maximizing the volume of a fixed-radius ball ===\nSuppose that {{math|''R''}} is a fixed positive real number, and consider the volume {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} as a function of the positive integer {{nowrap|dimension {{math|''n''}}.}} Since the volume of a ball with fixed positive radius tends to zero as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}}, the maximum volume is achieved for some value of {{mvar|n}}. The dimension in which this happens depends on the radius {{math|''R''}}.\n\nTo find the {{mvar|n}} for which the maximum occurs, interpolate the function <math>n \\mapsto V_n(R)</math> to all real {{math|''x'' > 0}} by defining\n:<math>V(x, R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{x}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right)}R^x.</math>\nWhen {{math|''x''}} is not a positive integer, this function has no obvious geometric interpretation. However, it is smooth, so the techniques of calculus can be used to find maxima. \n\nThe extrema of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} for fixed {{mvar|R}} may occur only at the critical points or at the boundaries {{math|''x'' \u2192 0<sup>+</sup>}} and {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u221e}}.  Because the logarithm is monotonically increasing, the critical points of <math>V(x, R)</math> are the same as those of its logarithm.  The derivative of <math>\\log V(x, R)</math> with respect to {{mvar|x}} is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big(\\log V(x, R)\\big) = \\frac{\\log \\pi}{2} + \\log R - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c8}} is the [[digamma function]], the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the [[gamma function]].  The critical points of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} therefore occur at the solutions of\n:<math>\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R.</math>\n\nBecause the gamma function is [[logarithmically convex]] on the positive real axis, the digamma function is monotonically increasing there, so the above equation has at most one solution.  Because <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\psi(x) = -\\infty</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\psi(x) = +\\infty</math>, there is at least one positive real solution.  Therefore the above equation has a unique solution.  Denoting the solution by {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, we have\n:<math>x_0 =  2\\psi^{-1}(\\log \\pi + 2\\log R) - 2.</math>\n\nThe monotonicity of the digamma function along the positive real axis further implies that {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is increasing for all {{math|''x'' < ''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and decreasing for all {{math|''x'' > ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.  It follows that {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is the unique maximum of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and that the maxima of {{math|''n'' \u21a6 ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} are contained in the set <math>\\{\\lfloor x_0\\rfloor, \\lceil x_0\\rceil\\}</math>.  If {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is an integer, then this set has only one element, and this element is the unique maximum of both {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}.  Otherwise, the set has two elements, and either {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} assumes its unique maximum at one of the two elements in the set, or {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is maximized at both these elements.\n\nMore explicit, though less precise, estimates may be derived by bounding the digamma function.  For {{math|''y'' > 1}}, the digamma function satisfies:<ref>N. Elezovic, C. Giordano and J. Pecaric, ''The best bounds in Gautschi\u2019s inequality'', Math. Inequal. Appl. 3 (2000), 239\u2013252.</ref>\n:<math>\\log\\left(y - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi(y) < \\log(y + e^{-\\gamma} - 1),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]].  Applying these bounds with {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''<sub>0</sub>|2}} + 1}} yields\n:<math>\\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R < \\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + e^{-\\gamma}\\right),</math>\nwhence\n:<math>2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma} < x_0 < 2\\pi R^2 - 1.</math>\n\nTherefore the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is achieved for some integer {{mvar|n}} such that\n:<math>\\lfloor 2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma}\\rfloor \\le n \\le \\lceil 2\\pi R^2 - 1\\rceil.</math>\nTo find the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}, it suffices to maximize it over all {{math|''n''}} in this interval.  Because <math>|2e^{-\\gamma} - 1| < 0.2</math>, this interval contains at most three integers and often only two.\n\nFor example, when {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1}}, these bounds imply that the maximum volume is achieved for some {{mvar|n}} for which {{math|\u230a5.08\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23085.28\u2309}}, that is, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}} or {{math|''n'' {{=}} 6}}.  An examination of the table above shows that it is achieved at the lower bound, in dimension {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}}.  When {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1.1}}, the bounds are {{math|\u230a6.48\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.60\u2309}}, and the maximum is achieved at the upper bound, that is, when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}.  Finally, if <math>R = \\exp(11/12 - \\gamma/2) / \\sqrt\\pi \\approx 1.057</math>, then the bounds are {{math|\u230a5.90\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.02\u2309}}, so the interval of possible {{math|''n''}} contains three integers, and the maximum of both {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} and {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is achieved at the integer {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 6}}.\n\n== Proofs ==\nThere are many proofs of the above formulas.\n\n=== The volume is proportional to the {{math|''n''}}th power of the radius ===\nAn important step in several proofs about volumes of {{math|''n''}}-balls, and a generally useful fact besides, is that the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is proportional to {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\propto R^n.</math>\nThe proportionality constant is the volume of the unit ball.\n\nThis is a special case of a general fact about volumes in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space: If {{math|''K''}}\nis a body (measurable set) in that space and {{math|''RK''}} is the body obtained by stretching in all directions by the factor {{math|''R''}} then the volume of {{math|''RK''}} equals {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}} times the volume of {{math|''K''}}. This is a direct consequence of the change of variables formula:\n:<math> V(RK) = \\int_{RK} dx = \\int_K R^n\\, dy = R^n V(K) </math>\nwhere {{math|1=''dx'' = ''dx''<sub>1</sub>\u2026''dx<sub>n</sub>''}} and the substitution {{math|1=''x'' = ''Ry''}} was made.\n\nAnother proof of the above relation, which avoids multi-dimensional integration, uses induction: The base case is {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, where the proportionality is obvious. For the inductive case, assume that proportionality is true in dimension {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}. Note that the intersection of an {{math|''n''}}-ball with a hyperplane is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. When the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball is written as an integral of volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\\right) \\,dx,</math>\nit is possible by the inductive assumption to remove a factor of {{math|''R''}} from the radius of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball to get:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^{n-1} \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2}\\right) \\,dx.</math>\nMaking the change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|x|R}}''}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^n \\int_{-1}^1 V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - t^2}\\right) \\,dt = R^n V_n(1),</math>\nwhich demonstrates the proportionality relation in dimension {{math|''n''}}. By induction, the proportionality relation is true in all dimensions.\n\n=== The two-dimension recursion formula ===\nA proof of the recursion formula relating the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball can be given using the proportionality formula above and integration in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]. Fix a plane through the center of the ball. Let {{math|''r''}} denote the distance between a point in the plane and the center of the sphere, and let {{math|''\u03b8''}} denote the azimuth. Intersecting the {{math|''n''}}-ball with the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-dimensional plane defined by fixing a radius and an azimuth gives an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball of radius {{math|{{sqrt|''R''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}. The volume of the ball can therefore be written as an iterated integral of the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls over the possible radii and azimuths:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R V_{n-2}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\right) \\,r\\,dr\\,d\\theta,</math>\nThe azimuthal coordinate can be immediately integrated out. Applying the proportionality relation shows that the volume equals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\int_0^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,r\\,dr.</math>\nThe integral can be evaluated by making the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 \u2212 (''{{sfrac|r|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}} to get:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_n(R) &= 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\cdot \\left[-\\frac{R^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}\\right]_{r=0}^{r=R} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2\\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R),\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich is the two-dimension recursion formula.\n\nThe same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula. The base cases of the induction are the 0-ball and the 1-ball, which can be checked directly using the facts {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|{{sqrt|\u03c0}}|2}}}}. The inductive step is similar to the above, but instead of applying proportionality to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls, the inductive assumption is applied instead.\n\n=== The one-dimension recursion formula ===\nThe proportionality relation can also be used to prove the recursion formula relating the volumes of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. As in the proof of the proportionality formula, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball can be written as an integral over the volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls. Instead of making a substitution, however, the proportionality relation can be applied to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls in the integrand:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\int_{-R}^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-1}{2} \\,dx.</math>\nThe integrand is an [[even function]], so by symmetry the interval of integration can be restricted to {{math|[0, ''R'']}}. On the interval {{math|[0, ''R'']}}, it is possible to apply the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''{{sfrac|x|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}}. This transforms the expression into:\n:<math>V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\int_0^1 (1-u)^\\frac{n-1}{2}u^{-\\frac12}\\,du</math>\nThe integral is a value of a well-known [[special function]] called the [[beta function]] {{math|\u0392(''x,y'')}}, and the volume in terms of the beta function is:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\Beta\\left(\\tfrac{n + 1}{2}, \\tfrac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta function can be expressed in terms of the gamma function in much the same way that factorials are related to [[binomial coefficient]]s. Applying this relationship gives:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nUsing the value {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} gives the one-dimension recursion formula:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} V_{n-1}(R).</math>\n\nAs with the two-dimension recursive formula, the same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula.\n\n=== Direct integration in spherical coordinates ===\nThe volume can be computed by integrating the volume element in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]. The spherical coordinate system has a radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular coordinates {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}}, where the domain of each {{math|''\u03c6''}} except {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, \u03c0)}}, and the domain of {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, 2\u03c0)}}. The spherical volume element is:\n:<math>dV = r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\sin^{n-3}(\\varphi_2) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,dr\\,d\\varphi_1\\,d\\varphi_2 \\cdots d\\varphi_{n-1},</math>\nand the volume is the integral of this quantity over {{math|''r''}} between 0 and {{math|''R''}} and all possible angles:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\pi \\cdots \\int_0^{2\\pi} r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,d\\varphi_{n-1} \\cdots d\\varphi_1\\,dr.</math>\nEach of the factors in the integrand depends on only a single variable, and therefore the iterated integral can be written as a product of integrals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\left(\\int_0^R r^{n-1}\\,dr\\right)\\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right)\\cdots\\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nThe integral over the radius is {{math|''{{sfrac|R<sup>n</sup>|n}}''}}. The intervals of integration on the angular coordinates can, by symmetry, be changed to {{math|[0, {{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}]}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\left(2\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right) \\cdots \\left(4\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nEach of the remaining integrals is now a particular value of the beta function:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\cdots \\Beta\\left(1, \\frac12\\right) \\cdot 2\\Beta\\left(\\frac12, \\frac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta functions can be rewritten in terms of gamma functions:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac32\\right)} \\cdot 2 \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)}.</math>\nThis product telescopes. Combining this with the values {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} and {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\n\n=== Gaussian integrals ===\nThe volume formula can be proven directly using [[Gaussian integral]]s. Consider the function:\n:<math>f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right).</math>\nThis function is both rotationally invariant and a product of functions of one variable each. Using the fact that it is a product and the formula for the Gaussian integral gives:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 x_i^2\\right)\\,dx_i\\right) = (2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2},</math>\nwhere {{math|''dV''}} is the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume element. Using rotational invariance, the same integral can be computed in spherical coordinates:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{S^{n-1}(r)} \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right) \\,dA\\,dr,</math>\nwhere {{math|''S''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup>(''r'')}} is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dA''}} is the area element (equivalently, the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-dimensional volume element). The surface area of the sphere satisfies a proportionality equation similar to the one for the volume of a ball: If {{math|''A''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>(''r'')}} is the surface area of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}}, then:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(r) = r^{n-1} A_{n-1}(1).</math>\nApplying this to the above integral gives the expression:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right)\\,r^{n-1}\\,dr.</math>\nBy substituting {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''r''<sup>2</sup>|2}}}}, the expression is transformed into:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) 2^\\frac{n-2}{2} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-t} t^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,dt.</math>\nThis is the gamma function evaluated at {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}}.\n\nCombining the two integrations shows that:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nTo derive the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} from this formula, integrate the surface area of a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} for {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' \u2264 ''R''}} and apply the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\,r^{n-1}\\,dr = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}R^n = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n.</math>\n\n=== Geometric proof ===\n\nThe relations <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math> and <math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> and thus the volumes of ''n''-balls and areas of ''n''-spheres can also be derived geometrically.  As noted above, because a ball of radius <math>R</math> is obtained from a unit ball <math>B_n</math> by rescaling all directions in <math>R</math> times, <math>V_n(R)</math> is proportional to <math>R^n</math>, which implies <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR} = \\frac{n}{R} V_n(R)</math>.  Also, <math display=\"inline\">A_{n-1}(R) = \\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR}</math> because a ball is a union of concentric spheres and increasing radius by ''\u03b5'' corresponds to a shell of thickness ''\u03b5''.  Thus, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n}(R) = \\frac{R}{n}A_{n-1}(R)</math>; equivalently, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math>.\n\n<math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> follows from existence of a volume-preserving bijection between the unit sphere <math>S_{n+1}</math> and <math> S_1 \\times B_n</math>:\n: <math>(x,y,\\vec{z}) \\rarr \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\vec{z}\\right)</math>\n(<math>\\vec{z}</math> is an ''n''-tuple; <math>|(x,y,\\vec{z})|=1</math>; we are ignoring sets of measure 0).  Volume is preserved because at each point, the difference from [[isometry]] is a stretching in the ''xy'' plane (in <math display=\"inline\">1/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math> times in the direction of constant <math>x^2+y^2</math>) that exactly matches the compression in the direction of the [[gradient]] of <math>|\\vec{z}|</math> on <math>S_n</math> (the relevant angles being equal).  For <math>S_2</math>, a similar argument was originally made by [[Archimedes]] in [[On the Sphere and Cylinder]].\n\n== Balls in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norms ==\nThere are also explicit expressions for the volumes of balls in [[Lp space|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm]]s. The {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm of the vector {{math|''x'' {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is:\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n | x_i |^p \\right)^\\frac{1}{p},</math>\nand an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball is the set of all vectors whose {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm is less than or equal to a fixed number called the radius of the ball. The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} is the standard Euclidean distance function, but other values of {{math|''p''}} occur in diverse contexts such as [[information theory]], [[coding theory]], and [[dimensional regularization]].\n\nThe volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\frac{\\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{p} + 1\\right)R\\right)^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nThese volumes satisfy a recurrence relation similar to the one dimension recurrence for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{p} + 1\\right) R\\right) \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{p} + 1\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)} V^p_{n-1}(R).</math>\nFor {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, one recovers the recurrence for the volume of a Euclidean ball because {{math|2\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}}.\n\nFor example, in the cases {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} ([[taxicab norm]]) and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}} ([[max norm]]), the volumes are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} V^1_n(R) &= \\frac{2^n}{n!}R^n, \\\\ V^\\infty_n(R) &= (2R)^n. \\end{align}</math>\nThese agree with elementary calculations of the volumes of [[cross-polytope]]s and [[hypercubes]].\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nFor most values of {{math|''p''}}, the surface area, <math>A_n^p(R)</math>, of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} (the boundary of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}}) cannot be calculated by differentiating the volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball with respect to its radius. While the volume can be expressed as an integral over the surface areas using the [[coarea formula]], the coarea formula contains a correction factor that accounts for how the {{math|''p''}}-norm varies from point to point. For {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, this factor is one. However, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} then the correction factor is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}: the surface area of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} times the derivative of the volume of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} ball.  This can be seen most simply by applying the [[divergence theorem]] to the vector field {{math|'''F'''(x) {{=}} x}} to get\n\n:<math>nV^1_n(R) = </math>{{oiint\n| preintegral = <math>\\iiint_V\\left(\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{F}\\right)\\,dV=</math>\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>(\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = </math> {{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}(|x_1|+\\cdots+|x_n|)\\,dS </math>\n}}  <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} </math>{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} A^1_n(R) </math>.\nFor other values of {{math|''p''}}, the constant is a complicated integral.\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nThe volume formula can be generalized even further.

An {{math|''n''}}-ball is a ball in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. The '''volume of a unit {{math|''n''}}-ball''' is an important expression that occurs in formulas throughout mathematics; it generalizes the notion of the volume enclosed by a sphere in 3-dimensional space.\n\n== Formulas ==\n\n=== The volume ===\nThe {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume of a Euclidean ball of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional Euclidean space is:<ref>Equation 5.19.4, ''NIST Digital Library of Mathematical Functions.'' http://dlmf.nist.gov/5.19#E4, Release 1.0.6 of 2013-05-06.</ref>\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n,</math>\nwhere {{math|\u0393}} is [[Leonhard Euler]]'s [[gamma function]].  The gamma function extends the [[factorial]] function to non-integer arguments.  It satisfies {{math|\u0393(''n'') {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 1)!}} if {{math|''n''}} is a positive integer and {{math|\u0393(''n'' + {{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} (''n'' \u2212 {{sfrac|1|2}}) \u00b7 (''n'' \u2212 {{sfrac|3|2}}) \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7 {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u03c0<sup>1/2</sup>}} if {{math|''n''}} is a non-negative integer.\n\n=== Alternative forms ===\nUsing explicit formulas for [[particular values of the gamma function]] at the integers and half integers gives formulas for the volume of a Euclidean ball that do not require an evaluation of the gamma function. These are:\n:<math>\\begin{align}V_{2k}(R) &= \\frac{\\pi^k}{k!}R^{2k}, \\\\\nV_{2k+1}(R) &= \\frac{2^{k+1}\\pi^k}{(2k+1)!!}R^{2k+1} = \\frac{2(k!)(4\\pi)^k}{(2k+1)!}R^{2k+1}.\\end{align}</math>\nIn the formula for odd-dimensional volumes, the [[double factorial]] {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!!}} is defined for odd integers {{math|2''k'' + 1}} as {{math|(2''k'' + 1)!! {{=}} 1 \u00b7 3 \u00b7 5 \u00b7 \u2026 \u00b7 (2''k'' \u2212 1) \u00b7 (2''k'' + 1)}}. \n\nInstead of expressing the volume {{math|''V''}} of the ball in terms of its radius {{math|''R''}}, the formula can be [[Inverse function|inverted]] to express the radius as a function of the volume:\n:<math>R_n(V) = \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)^\\frac{1}{n}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}V^\\frac{1}{n}.</math>\nThis formula, too, can be separated into even- and odd-dimensional cases using factorials and double factorials in place of the gamma function:\n:<math>\\begin{align}R_{2k}(V) &= \\frac{(k!V)^\\frac{1}{2k}}{\\sqrt{\\pi}}, \\\\\nR_{2k+1}(V) &= \\left(\\frac{(2k+1)!!V}{2^{k+1}\\pi^k}\\right)^\\frac{1}{2k+1}.\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Recursions ===\nThe volume satisfies several recursive formulas. These formulas can either be proved directly or proved as consequences of the general volume formula above.

Then the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} approaches zero as {{math|''n''}} tends to infinity. This can be shown using the two-dimension recursion formula. At each step, the new factor being multiplied into the volume is proportional to {{math|1 / ''n''}}, where the constant of proportionality {{math|2\u03c0''R''<sup>2</sup>}} is independent of {{math|''n''}}. Eventually, {{math|''n''}} is so large that the new factor is less than 1. From then on, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball must decrease at least geometrically, and therefore it tends to zero. A variant on this proof uses the one-dimension recursion formula. Here, the new factor is proportional to a quotient of gamma functions. [[Gautschi's inequality]] bounds this quotient above by {{math|''n''<sup>\u22121/2</sup>}}. The argument concludes as before by showing that the volumes decrease at least geometrically.\n\nA more precise description of the high dimensional behavior of the volume can be obtained using [[Stirling's approximation]]. It implies the [[asymptotic formula]]:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\sim \\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n\\pi}}\\left(\\frac{2\\pi e}{n}\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}R^n.</math>\nThe error in this approximation is a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. Stirling's approximation is in fact an underestimate of the gamma function, so the above formula is an upper bound. This provides another proof that the volume of the ball decreases exponentially: When {{math|''n''}} is sufficiently large, the factor {{math|''R''{{sqrt|2\u03c0''e''/''n''}}}} is less than one, and then the same argument as before applies.\n\nIf instead {{math|''V''}} is fixed while {{math|''n''}} is large, then by Stirling's approximation again, the radius of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of volume {{math|''V''}} is approximately\n:<math>R_n(V) \\sim (\\pi n)^{\\frac{1}{2n}}\\sqrt{\\frac{n}{2\\pi e}}V^{\\frac{1}{n}}.</math>\nThis expression is a lower bound for {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}}, and the error is again a factor of {{math|1 + O(''n''<sup>\u22121</sup>)}}. As {{math|''n''}} increases, {{math|''R''<sub>''n''</sub>(''V'')}} grows as <math>\\Theta(\\sqrt{n}).</math>\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nLet {{math|''A{{sub|n}}''(''R'')}} denote the surface area of the [[n-sphere|{{math|''n''}}-sphere]] of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|''n''}}-sphere is the boundary of the {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}}. The {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball is a union of concentric spheres, and consequently the surface area and the volume are related by:\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{d}{dR}V_{n+1}(R).</math>\nCombining this with the explicit formula for the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball gives\n:<math>A_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^{\\frac{n + 1}{2}}}{\\Gamma\\big(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\big)}R^n.</math>\n\nSince the volume is proportional to a power of the radius, the above relation leads to a simple equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' + 1)}}-ball. By applying the two-dimension recursion formula, it also gives an equation relating the surface area of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and the volume of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball.  These formulas, together with the volume and surface area of zero-dimensional balls, can be used as a system of recurrence relations for the volumes and surface areas of balls:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_0(R) &= 1, \\\\\nA_0(R) &= 2, \\\\\nV_{n+1}(R) &= \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R), \\\\\nA_{n+1}(R) &= (2\\pi R)V_n(R).\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n=== Dimension maximizing the volume of a fixed-radius ball ===\nSuppose that {{math|''R''}} is a fixed positive real number, and consider the volume {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} as a function of the positive integer {{nowrap|dimension {{math|''n''}}.}} Since the volume of a ball with fixed positive radius tends to zero as {{math|''n'' \u2192 \u221e}}, the maximum volume is achieved for some value of {{mvar|n}}. The dimension in which this happens depends on the radius {{math|''R''}}.\n\nTo find the {{mvar|n}} for which the maximum occurs, interpolate the function <math>n \\mapsto V_n(R)</math> to all real {{math|''x'' > 0}} by defining\n:<math>V(x, R) = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{x}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right)}R^x.</math>\nWhen {{math|''x''}} is not a positive integer, this function has no obvious geometric interpretation. However, it is smooth, so the techniques of calculus can be used to find maxima. \n\nThe extrema of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} for fixed {{mvar|R}} may occur only at the critical points or at the boundaries {{math|''x'' \u2192 0<sup>+</sup>}} and {{math|''x'' \u2192 \u221e}}.  Because the logarithm is monotonically increasing, the critical points of <math>V(x, R)</math> are the same as those of its logarithm.  The derivative of <math>\\log V(x, R)</math> with respect to {{mvar|x}} is\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial x}\\big(\\log V(x, R)\\big) = \\frac{\\log \\pi}{2} + \\log R - \\frac{1}{2}\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right),</math>\nwhere {{mvar|\u03c8}} is the [[digamma function]], the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the [[gamma function]].  The critical points of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} therefore occur at the solutions of\n:<math>\\psi\\left(\\frac{x}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R.</math>\n\nBecause the gamma function is [[logarithmically convex]] on the positive real axis, the digamma function is monotonically increasing there, so the above equation has at most one solution.  Because <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to 0^+} \\psi(x) = -\\infty</math> and <math>\\textstyle\\lim_{x \\to \\infty} \\psi(x) = +\\infty</math>, there is at least one positive real solution.  Therefore the above equation has a unique solution.  Denoting the solution by {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}}, we have\n:<math>x_0 =  2\\psi^{-1}(\\log \\pi + 2\\log R) - 2.</math>\n\nThe monotonicity of the digamma function along the positive real axis further implies that {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is increasing for all {{math|''x'' < ''x''<sub>0</sub>}} and decreasing for all {{math|''x'' > ''x''<sub>0</sub>}}.  It follows that {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is the unique maximum of {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and that the maxima of {{math|''n'' \u21a6 ''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} are contained in the set <math>\\{\\lfloor x_0\\rfloor, \\lceil x_0\\rceil\\}</math>.  If {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub>}} is an integer, then this set has only one element, and this element is the unique maximum of both {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} and {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}.  Otherwise, the set has two elements, and either {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} assumes its unique maximum at one of the two elements in the set, or {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is maximized at both these elements.\n\nMore explicit, though less precise, estimates may be derived by bounding the digamma function.  For {{math|''y'' > 1}}, the digamma function satisfies:<ref>N. Elezovic, C. Giordano and J. Pecaric, ''The best bounds in Gautschi\u2019s inequality'', Math. Inequal. Appl. 3 (2000), 239\u2013252.</ref>\n:<math>\\log\\left(y - \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi(y) < \\log(y + e^{-\\gamma} - 1),</math>\nwhere {{math|''\u03b3''}} is the [[Euler\u2013Mascheroni constant]].  Applying these bounds with {{math|''y'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''x''<sub>0</sub>|2}} + 1}} yields\n:<math>\\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + \\tfrac{1}{2}\\right) < \\psi\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + 1\\right) = \\log \\pi + 2\\log R < \\log\\left(\\tfrac{x_0}{2} + e^{-\\gamma}\\right),</math>\nwhence\n:<math>2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma} < x_0 < 2\\pi R^2 - 1.</math>\n\nTherefore the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} is achieved for some integer {{mvar|n}} such that\n:<math>\\lfloor 2\\pi R^2 - 2e^{-\\gamma}\\rfloor \\le n \\le \\lceil 2\\pi R^2 - 1\\rceil.</math>\nTo find the maximum of {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}}, it suffices to maximize it over all {{math|''n''}} in this interval.  Because <math>|2e^{-\\gamma} - 1| < 0.2</math>, this interval contains at most three integers and often only two.\n\nFor example, when {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1}}, these bounds imply that the maximum volume is achieved for some {{mvar|n}} for which {{math|\u230a5.08\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23085.28\u2309}}, that is, for {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}} or {{math|''n'' {{=}} 6}}.  An examination of the table above shows that it is achieved at the lower bound, in dimension {{math|''n'' {{=}} 5}}.  When {{math|''R'' {{=}} 1.1}}, the bounds are {{math|\u230a6.48\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.60\u2309}}, and the maximum is achieved at the upper bound, that is, when {{math|''n'' {{=}} 7}}.  Finally, if <math>R = \\exp(11/12 - \\gamma/2) / \\sqrt\\pi \\approx 1.057</math>, then the bounds are {{math|\u230a5.90\u230b \u2264 ''n'' \u2264 \u23086.02\u2309}}, so the interval of possible {{math|''n''}} contains three integers, and the maximum of both {{math|''V''<sub>''n''</sub>(''R'')}} and {{math|''V''(''x'', ''R'')}} is achieved at the integer {{math|''x''<sub>0</sub> {{=}} 6}}.\n\n== Proofs ==\nThere are many proofs of the above formulas.\n\n=== The volume is proportional to the {{math|''n''}}th power of the radius ===\nAn important step in several proofs about volumes of {{math|''n''}}-balls, and a generally useful fact besides, is that the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is proportional to {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) \\propto R^n.</math>\nThe proportionality constant is the volume of the unit ball.\n\nThis is a special case of a general fact about volumes in {{math|''n''}}-dimensional space: If {{math|''K''}}\nis a body (measurable set) in that space and {{math|''RK''}} is the body obtained by stretching in all directions by the factor {{math|''R''}} then the volume of {{math|''RK''}} equals {{math|''R''<sup>''n''</sup>}} times the volume of {{math|''K''}}. This is a direct consequence of the change of variables formula:\n:<math> V(RK) = \\int_{RK} dx = \\int_K R^n\\, dy = R^n V(K) </math>\nwhere {{math|1=''dx'' = ''dx''<sub>1</sub>\u2026''dx<sub>n</sub>''}} and the substitution {{math|1=''x'' = ''Ry''}} was made.\n\nAnother proof of the above relation, which avoids multi-dimensional integration, uses induction: The base case is {{math|''n'' {{=}} 0}}, where the proportionality is obvious. For the inductive case, assume that proportionality is true in dimension {{math|''n'' \u2212 1}}. Note that the intersection of an {{math|''n''}}-ball with a hyperplane is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. When the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball is written as an integral of volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - x^2}\\right) \\,dx,</math>\nit is possible by the inductive assumption to remove a factor of {{math|''R''}} from the radius of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball to get:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^{n-1} \\int_{-R}^R V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2}\\right) \\,dx.</math>\nMaking the change of variables {{math|''t'' {{=}} ''{{sfrac|x|R}}''}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R^n \\int_{-1}^1 V_{n-1}\\left(\\sqrt{1 - t^2}\\right) \\,dt = R^n V_n(1),</math>\nwhich demonstrates the proportionality relation in dimension {{math|''n''}}. By induction, the proportionality relation is true in all dimensions.\n\n=== The two-dimension recursion formula ===\nA proof of the recursion formula relating the volume of the {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball can be given using the proportionality formula above and integration in [[Cylindrical coordinate system|cylindrical coordinates]]. Fix a plane through the center of the ball. Let {{math|''r''}} denote the distance between a point in the plane and the center of the sphere, and let {{math|''\u03b8''}} denote the azimuth. Intersecting the {{math|''n''}}-ball with the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-dimensional plane defined by fixing a radius and an azimuth gives an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-ball of radius {{math|{{sqrt|''R''<sup>2</sup> \u2212 ''r''<sup>2</sup>}}}}. The volume of the ball can therefore be written as an iterated integral of the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls over the possible radii and azimuths:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^{2\\pi} \\int_0^R V_{n-2}\\left(\\sqrt{R^2 - r^2}\\right) \\,r\\,dr\\,d\\theta,</math>\nThe azimuthal coordinate can be immediately integrated out. Applying the proportionality relation shows that the volume equals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\int_0^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,r\\,dr.</math>\nThe integral can be evaluated by making the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} 1 \u2212 (''{{sfrac|r|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}} to get:\n:<math>\\begin{align}\nV_n(R) &= 2\\pi V_{n-2}(R) \\cdot \\left[-\\frac{R^2}{n}\\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{r}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n}{2}\\right]_{r=0}^{r=R} \\\\\n&= \\frac{2\\pi R^2}{n} V_{n-2}(R),\n\\end{align}</math>\nwhich is the two-dimension recursion formula.\n\nThe same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula. The base cases of the induction are the 0-ball and the 1-ball, which can be checked directly using the facts {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|1|2}} \u00b7 \u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sfrac|{{sqrt|\u03c0}}|2}}}}. The inductive step is similar to the above, but instead of applying proportionality to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 2)}}-balls, the inductive assumption is applied instead.\n\n=== The one-dimension recursion formula ===\nThe proportionality relation can also be used to prove the recursion formula relating the volumes of an {{math|''n''}}-ball and an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-ball. As in the proof of the proportionality formula, the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball can be written as an integral over the volumes of {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls. Instead of making a substitution, however, the proportionality relation can be applied to the volumes of the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-balls in the integrand:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\int_{-R}^R \\left(1 - \\left(\\frac{x}{R}\\right)^2\\right)^\\frac{n-1}{2} \\,dx.</math>\nThe integrand is an [[even function]], so by symmetry the interval of integration can be restricted to {{math|[0, ''R'']}}. On the interval {{math|[0, ''R'']}}, it is possible to apply the substitution {{math|''u'' {{=}} (''{{sfrac|x|R}}''){{su|p=2}}}}. This transforms the expression into:\n:<math>V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\int_0^1 (1-u)^\\frac{n-1}{2}u^{-\\frac12}\\,du</math>\nThe integral is a value of a well-known [[special function]] called the [[beta function]] {{math|\u0392(''x,y'')}}, and the volume in terms of the beta function is:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\Beta\\left(\\tfrac{n + 1}{2}, \\tfrac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta function can be expressed in terms of the gamma function in much the same way that factorials are related to [[binomial coefficient]]s. Applying this relationship gives:\n:<math>V_n(R) = V_{n-1}(R) \\cdot R \\cdot \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n + 1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nUsing the value {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} gives the one-dimension recursion formula:\n:<math>V_n(R) = R\\sqrt{\\pi}\\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n+1}{2}\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)} V_{n-1}(R).</math>\n\nAs with the two-dimension recursive formula, the same technique can be used to give an inductive proof of the volume formula.\n\n=== Direct integration in spherical coordinates ===\nThe volume can be computed by integrating the volume element in [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical coordinates]]. The spherical coordinate system has a radial coordinate {{math|''r''}} and angular coordinates {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}}, where the domain of each {{math|''\u03c6''}} except {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, \u03c0)}}, and the domain of {{math|''\u03c6''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>}} is {{math|[0, 2\u03c0)}}. The spherical volume element is:\n:<math>dV = r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\sin^{n-3}(\\varphi_2) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,dr\\,d\\varphi_1\\,d\\varphi_2 \\cdots d\\varphi_{n-1},</math>\nand the volume is the integral of this quantity over {{math|''r''}} between 0 and {{math|''R''}} and all possible angles:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\int_0^\\pi \\cdots \\int_0^{2\\pi} r^{n-1}\\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1) \\cdots \\sin(\\varphi_{n-2})\\,d\\varphi_{n-1} \\cdots d\\varphi_1\\,dr.</math>\nEach of the factors in the integrand depends on only a single variable, and therefore the iterated integral can be written as a product of integrals:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\left(\\int_0^R r^{n-1}\\,dr\\right)\\left(\\int_0^\\pi \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right)\\cdots\\left(\\int_0^{2\\pi} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nThe integral over the radius is {{math|''{{sfrac|R<sup>n</sup>|n}}''}}. The intervals of integration on the angular coordinates can, by symmetry, be changed to {{math|[0, {{sfrac|\u03c0|2}}]}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\left(2\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} \\sin^{n-2}(\\varphi_1)\\,d\\varphi_1\\right) \\cdots \\left(4\\int_0^\\frac{\\pi}{2} d\\varphi_{n-1}\\right).</math>\nEach of the remaining integrals is now a particular value of the beta function:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\Beta\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}, \\frac12\\right) \\cdots \\Beta\\left(1, \\frac12\\right) \\cdot 2\\Beta\\left(\\frac12, \\frac12\\right).</math>\nThe beta functions can be rewritten in terms of gamma functions:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{R^n}{n} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-2}{2}\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n - 1}{2}\\right)} \\cdots \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac32\\right)} \\cdot 2 \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)\\Gamma\\left(\\frac12\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(1\\right)}.</math>\nThis product telescopes. Combining this with the values {{math|\u0393({{sfrac|1|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}} and {{math|\u0393(1) {{=}} 1}} and the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}} leads to:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}R^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}.</math>\n\n=== Gaussian integrals ===\nThe volume formula can be proven directly using [[Gaussian integral]]s. Consider the function:\n:<math>f(x_1, \\ldots, x_n) = \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 \\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2\\right).</math>\nThis function is both rotationally invariant and a product of functions of one variable each. Using the fact that it is a product and the formula for the Gaussian integral gives:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\prod_{i=1}^n \\left(\\int_{-\\infty}^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 x_i^2\\right)\\,dx_i\\right) = (2\\pi)^\\frac{n}{2},</math>\nwhere {{math|''dV''}} is the {{math|''n''}}-dimensional volume element. Using rotational invariance, the same integral can be computed in spherical coordinates:\n:<math>\\int_{\\mathbf{R}^n} f \\,dV = \\int_0^\\infty \\int_{S^{n-1}(r)} \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right) \\,dA\\,dr,</math>\nwhere {{math|''S''<sup>''n'' \u2212 1</sup>(''r'')}} is an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} and {{math|''dA''}} is the area element (equivalently, the {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-dimensional volume element). The surface area of the sphere satisfies a proportionality equation similar to the one for the volume of a ball: If {{math|''A''<sub>''n'' \u2212 1</sub>(''r'')}} is the surface area of an {{math|(''n'' \u2212 1)}}-sphere of radius {{math|''r''}}, then:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(r) = r^{n-1} A_{n-1}(1).</math>\nApplying this to the above integral gives the expression:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) \\int_0^\\infty \\exp\\left(-\\tfrac12 r^2\\right)\\,r^{n-1}\\,dr.</math>\nBy substituting {{math|''t'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''r''<sup>2</sup>|2}}}}, the expression is transformed into:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) 2^\\frac{n-2}{2} \\int_0^\\infty e^{-t} t^\\frac{n-2}{2}\\,dt.</math>\nThis is the gamma function evaluated at {{math|{{sfrac|''n''|2}}}}.\n\nCombining the two integrations shows that:\n:<math>A_{n-1}(1) = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}.</math>\nTo derive the volume of an {{math|''n''}}-ball of radius {{math|''R''}} from this formula, integrate the surface area of a sphere of radius {{math|''r''}} for {{math|0 \u2264 ''r'' \u2264 ''R''}} and apply the functional equation {{math|''z''\u0393(''z'') {{=}} \u0393(''z'' + 1)}}:\n:<math>V_n(R) = \\int_0^R \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)} \\,r^{n-1}\\,dr = \\frac{2\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{n\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2}\\right)}R^n = \\frac{\\pi^\\frac{n}{2}}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{2} + 1\\right)}R^n.</math>\n\n=== Geometric proof ===\n\nThe relations <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math> and <math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> and thus the volumes of ''n''-balls and areas of ''n''-spheres can also be derived geometrically.  As noted above, because a ball of radius <math>R</math> is obtained from a unit ball <math>B_n</math> by rescaling all directions in <math>R</math> times, <math>V_n(R)</math> is proportional to <math>R^n</math>, which implies <math display=\"inline\">\\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR} = \\frac{n}{R} V_n(R)</math>.  Also, <math display=\"inline\">A_{n-1}(R) = \\frac{dV_n(R)}{dR}</math> because a ball is a union of concentric spheres and increasing radius by ''\u03b5'' corresponds to a shell of thickness ''\u03b5''.  Thus, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n}(R) = \\frac{R}{n}A_{n-1}(R)</math>; equivalently, <math display=\"inline\">V_{n+1}(R) = \\frac{R}{n+1}A_n(R)</math>.\n\n<math>A_{n+1}(R) = (2\\pi R)V_n(R)</math> follows from existence of a volume-preserving bijection between the unit sphere <math>S_{n+1}</math> and <math> S_1 \\times B_n</math>:\n: <math>(x,y,\\vec{z}) \\rarr \\left(\\frac{x}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\frac{y}{\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}},\\vec{z}\\right)</math>\n(<math>\\vec{z}</math> is an ''n''-tuple; <math>|(x,y,\\vec{z})|=1</math>; we are ignoring sets of measure 0).  Volume is preserved because at each point, the difference from [[isometry]] is a stretching in the ''xy'' plane (in <math display=\"inline\">1/\\sqrt{x^2+y^2}</math> times in the direction of constant <math>x^2+y^2</math>) that exactly matches the compression in the direction of the [[gradient]] of <math>|\\vec{z}|</math> on <math>S_n</math> (the relevant angles being equal).  For <math>S_2</math>, a similar argument was originally made by [[Archimedes]] in [[On the Sphere and Cylinder]].\n\n== Balls in {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norms ==\nThere are also explicit expressions for the volumes of balls in [[Lp space|{{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm]]s. The {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm of the vector {{math|''x'' {{=}} (''x''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''x''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is:\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i=1}^n | x_i |^p \\right)^\\frac{1}{p},</math>\nand an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball is the set of all vectors whose {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} norm is less than or equal to a fixed number called the radius of the ball. The case {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} is the standard Euclidean distance function, but other values of {{math|''p''}} occur in diverse contexts such as [[information theory]], [[coding theory]], and [[dimensional regularization]].\n\nThe volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}} is:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\frac{\\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{1}{p} + 1\\right)R\\right)^n}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)}.</math>\nThese volumes satisfy a recurrence relation similar to the one dimension recurrence for {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}:\n:<math>V^p_n(R) = \\left(2\\Gamma\\left(\\tfrac{1}{p} + 1\\right) R\\right) \\frac{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n-1}{p} + 1\\right)}{\\Gamma\\left(\\frac{n}{p} + 1\\right)} V^p_{n-1}(R).</math>\nFor {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}}, one recovers the recurrence for the volume of a Euclidean ball because {{math|2\u0393({{sfrac|3|2}}) {{=}} {{sqrt|\u03c0}}}}.\n\nFor example, in the cases {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, the volumes are:\n:<math>\\begin{align} V^1_n(R) &= \\frac{2^n}{n!}R^n, \\\\ V^\\infty_n(R) &= (2R)^n. \\end{align}</math>\nThese agree with elementary calculations of the volumes of [[cross-polytope]]s and [[hypercubes]].\n\n=== Relation with surface area ===\nFor most values of {{math|''p''}}, the surface area, <math>A_n^p(R)</math>, of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} (the boundary of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball of radius {{math|''R''}}) cannot be calculated by differentiating the volume of an {{math|''L''{{isup|''p''}}}} ball with respect to its radius. While the volume can be expressed as an integral over the surface areas using the [[coarea formula]], the coarea formula contains a correction factor that accounts for how the {{math|''p''}}-norm varies from point to point. For {{math|''p'' {{=}} 2}} and {{math|''p'' {{=}} \u221e}}, this factor is one. However, if {{math|''p'' {{=}} 1}} then the correction factor is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}}: the surface area of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} sphere of radius {{math|''R''}} in {{math|'''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>}} is {{math|{{sqrt|''n''}}}} times the derivative of the volume of an {{math|''L''<sup>1</sup>}} ball.  This can be seen most simply by applying the [[divergence theorem]] to the vector field {{math|'''F'''(x) {{=}} x}} to get\n\n:<math>nV^1_n(R) = </math>{{oiint\n| preintegral = <math>\\iiint_V\\left(\\mathbf{\\nabla}\\cdot\\mathbf{F}\\right)\\,dV=</math>\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>(\\mathbf{F}\\cdot\\mathbf{n})\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = </math> {{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{n}}(|x_1|+\\cdots+|x_n|)\\,dS </math>\n}}  <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} </math>{{oiint\n| intsubscpt = <math>\\scriptstyle S</math>\n| integrand = <math>\\,dS </math>\n}} <math> = \\frac{R}{\\sqrt{n}} A^1_n(R) </math>.\nFor other values of {{math|''p''}}, the constant is a complicated integral.\n\n=== Generalizations ===\nThe volume formula can be generalized even further. For positive real numbers {{math|''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>}}, define the unit {{math|(''p''<sub>1</sub>, \u2026, ''p''<sub>''n''</sub>)}} ball to be:\n:<math>B_{p_1, \\ldots, p_n} = \\left\\{ x = (x_1, \\ldots, x_n) \\in \\mathbf{R}^n : \\vert x_1 \\vert^{p_1} + \\cdots + \\vert x_n \\vert^{p_n} \\le 1 \\right\\}.</math>\nThe volume of this ball has been known since the time of Dirichlet:<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dirichlet|first=P.

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it be necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\nBy the end of the day Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. The Parliamentarian army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Earlier the same day Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester, and having rendezvoused with Wilmot, now had some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]].

It took place between 10 August and 5 September 1643, between the defending Parliamentarian garrison of [[Gloucester]] and the besieging army of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]. The siege ended with the arrival of a relieving Parliamentarian army under the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]]. The Royalist forces withdrew, having sustained heavy casualties and had several cannons disabled as a result of sallies made by the defenders.\n\n==Prelude==\nFollowing the Royalist defeat at the [[Battle of Edgehill]] in October 1642, King Charles I's control of the south was limited to [[Cornwall]], [[Wales]] and the [[Welsh Marches|Marches]], and a pocket of the [[Thames Valley]] around [[Oxford]], where he based his wartime capital.<ref>Day 2007 p. 29</ref> The ruling [[Puritans|Puritan]] elite of [[Gloucester]] ensured the city of some 5,000 inhabitants would be from the outset a staunchly Parliamentarian stronghold in the struggle against an anti-Puritan King and his [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] Queen.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 59\u201360</ref> Possession of Gloucester, along with [[Bristol]] to the south, threatened both Oxford and access to the Royalist recruiting grounds of Wales.<ref>Day 2007 p. 21</ref>\n\nAn unsuccessful attempt to rally Royalist support in [[Cirencester]] in August 1642 prompted Parliamentarians in [[Gloucestershire]] to muster the [[Militia (English)|militia]], and in November the first regular troops were garrisoned in Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 p. 60</ref> In February 1643 the Royalist commander [[Prince Rupert of the Rhine|Prince Rupert]] easily defeated a militia garrison at Cirencester, prompting the Parliamentarians to recall their outposts at [[Berkeley, Gloucestershire|Berkeley]], [[Sudeley Castle|Sudeley]] and [[Tewkesbury]]. The next day Rupert appeared before Gloucester, but lacked the strength to enforce his demand for the city's surrender. Later that month an army of 2,000 Welshman led by [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|Lord Herbert of Raglan]] arrived on the west bank of the Severn opposite the city, but lacked the strength for an assault across the river. Its presence caused great consternation in Gloucester until a Parliamentarian army commanded by Sir [[William Waller]] defeated it on 24 March.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 60\u201362</ref>\n\nThe defeat of Waller in the [[Battle of Roundway Down]] on 13 July by the Royalist Western Army left both Bristol and Gloucester vulnerable, and on 18 July Rupert led another Royalist army out of Oxford to take control of the Severn valley. On 26 July Rupert's Oxford Army, supported by the Western Army, seized Bristol. Royalist casualties were high, and despite Rupert's instructions to the contrary, the victorious troops plundered the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 21\u201325</ref> Rupert was appointed governor of Bristol, but infighting within the Royalist leadership and concerns that an attack on Gloucester would result in the same high casualties prompted [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] to travel to Bristol for a council of war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 26\u201328</ref> He arrived on 2 August, and over the next five days consulted with his advisers on the best course of action. The strategic situation since Edgehill had improved significantly for the Royalists, with victories in the north of England, the arrival of reinforcements and materiel in June, and an opposition that had fallen into disarray.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 29\u201331</ref> Rupert's plan to consolidate the Royalist grip on the west by seizing Gloucester faced opposition from those in the King's camp, led by his wife Queen [[Henrietta Maria of France|Henrietta Maria]], who believed a march on London could end the war.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 51\u201353</ref>\n\nThe capture of Gloucester would give Charles some advantages. It would allow the Royalist garrisons farther up the Severn at [[Worcester]] and [[Shrewsbury]] to be supplied from Bristol, with consequent benefit to the economy of that city. Gloucestershire \u2013 populous, wealthy and Parliamentarian \u2013 could be punitively taxed, and Welsh manpower and money could be freely deployed against the King's enemies in the rest of the country. Although it was likely that Rupert would have been able to storm a city that was less well defended than Bristol, Charles was not willing to risk the casualties an assault would incur.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 54\u201355</ref> On 6 August the Parliamentarian governor of Gloucester, Lieutenant-Colonel [[Edward Massey]], refused to surrender the city, but in a secret communication he let it be known that he would do so if the King, rather than Rupert, led the army on Gloucester. Charles decided the next day that this was the best chance of securing Gloucester quickly and without bloodshed. This compromise plan pleased neither the Queen's faction, who saw it as an unnecessary diversion from the more decisive objective of London, nor Rupert, who remained in Bristol in the belief that the Royalist army was not strong enough to allow Massey to honourably surrender without a fight.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 55\u201357</ref>\n\n==Gloucester defences==\nGloucester's strength lay in its location. To the west, the River Severn formed a natural defence against an assaulting army. To the north and north-east the marshy ground was unsuitable for siege operations, and the River Twyver and a tributary stream added to the obstacles. This left the higher and drier ground to the east and south as the only feasible directions for an attack. In the preceding centuries the city had grown beyond its medieval defences, of which only the ruined [[Gloucester Castle|castle]] by the river and a stretch of wall that linked the south, east and original north fates, the last known as the inner north gate and now well within the city, still survived. From the south gate to the east gate the wall was high but not thick enough to withstand 17th-century artillery or mining operations.<ref name=Day65\u201366>Day 2007 pp. 65\u201366</ref>\n\nThe fall of Bristol prompted the hurried reinforcement of the existing defences. New earthworks and a narrow water-filled ditch completed the line of fortifications from the south gate to the Severn. Another earthwork was extended north from Whitefriars Barn on the north-east corner of the medieval wall to the outer north gate. From there the River Twyver formed a moat as the earthwork followed it north-west to Alvin Gate then on to the river's junction with the Old Severn.<ref name=Day65\u201366 /> This easternmost channel of the River Severn had dried up by the 19th century, but at the time of the civil war it was still a navigable river.<ref>Herbert 1988 para. 2</ref><ref>Rhodes 2006 p. 14</ref> The earthwork then followed the Old Severn south-west to a point a short distance north of Westgate Street, from where it was extended the other side of the Old Severn to the River Severn just above the west gate.<ref name=Day66>Day 2007 p. 66</ref> Inside the city, an earthwork was extended west from the end of the medieval wall at the inner north gate via [[Gloucester Cathedral]] to [[St Oswald's Priory, Gloucester|St Oswald's Priory]], where it met the new outer earthwork.<ref name=Day66 /> The outer north gate and Alvin Gate were fortified with earthwork [[bastion]]s,<ref name=Day66 /> a drawbridge was installed at Westgate Bridge and the Old Severn was dammed at Dockham, causing the ground to north-west of the city to flood.<ref>Rhodes 2006 pp. 17, 29\u201330</ref>\n\nThe garrison numbered no more than 1,500 troops. The bulk of these comprised two half-strength regiments each of some 600 men: the [[Henry Grey, 1st Earl of Stamford|Earl of Stamford]]'s Regiment of Foot, recruited from London and Leicestershire, and a locally recruited regiment known as the Town Regiment. The remainder comprised a company of [[Trained bands|trained band]], 100 [[dragoon]]s and a [[troop]] of cavalry. The city's dozen or so artillery pieces ranged in size from light cannon to two nine-pounder [[demi-culverin]]s. Stamford's regiment was experienced and well led, though of uncertain discipline. The Town Regiment lacked experience but was motivated by its ties to the city it was defending, although there is evidence that some of its men would refuse to oppose the King. The city could support itself with basic necessities, but it lacked sufficient gunpowder to withstand an assault or prolonged siege.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 63\u201365</ref>\n\nMassey was an autocratic military commander, but his authority in the city was shared with the civilian administration. A committee had been established in December 1642 to manage the Parliamentarian war effort in the county, but [[Thomas Pury]], the [[member of parliament]] for Gloucester, was the only committee member in the city. Civic authority was held by a forty-member council, though in practice an inner core of some fifteen [[Alderman|aldermen]], including the mayor, wielded power. As many of these were, like Pury, officers in the city's garrison, political and military command was largely integrated.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 66\u201367</ref> In the days immediately following the fall of Bristol, morale in the city, both military and civilian, was low.<ref>Day 2007 p. 68</ref> It's possible that this was what prompted Massey consider surrendering the city, though his message suggesting he would may have been a subterfuge designed to buy some time.<ref>Day 2007 p. 73</ref> There is strong evidence that the conduct and actions of the city elite, including Massey and particularly Pury, did much to stiffen the city's resolve. Officers and councillors with Royalist sympathies were given the opportunity to leave, and those who remained were required to restate an oath of allegiance to Parliament. The discipline of the troops was improved by paying them, and civilians were kept busy reinforcing the city's defences.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 69\u201370</ref>\n\n==Siege==\nAs Charles marched north from Bristol, reinforcements were converging on Gloucester from Oxford, Worcester and Herefordshire.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 86\u201387</ref> By the afternoon of 10 August the Royalist army, comprising some 6,000 infantry and 2,500 mounted troops, began assembling around the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 90\u201391</ref> Charles set up his headquarters at [[Matson, Gloucester|Matson]] House.<ref>Day 2007 p. 97</ref> His demand for Gloucester's surrender was unanimously and somewhat insolently rejected, and the Parliamentarians set fire to the suburbs outside the city defences to clear lines of fire and deprive the Royalists of cover.<ref>Day 2007 pp. , 91\u201393,96</ref> Charles had decided to march on Gloucester in the belief that the city would be quickly surrendered. Now that gambit had failed, he decided to besiege it. His pride had been wounded by the manner of the Parliamentarian rejection. His commanders, assessing the state of the city's defences, supplies and morale, persuaded him the city could be taken within ten days without an assault. Intelligence indicated the even if the Parliamentarians were able to send a relieving force, it could be easily defeated before it could reach the city. Most decisively, the [[William Cavendish, 1st Duke of Newcastle|Earl of Newcastle]], whose support was necessary in any campaign against London, declared himself unable to march south while Hull remained in Parliamentarian hands, leaving Charles too weak to contemplate such a move.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 93\u201395</ref>\n\nThe first shots were fired in the afternoon as Sir [[Jacob Astley, 1st Baron Astley of Reading|Jacob Astley]] established his forces near Issold's House on the eastern side of the city. [[Patrick Ruthven, 1st Earl of Forth|Lord Forth]], who had been given overall command of the siege, set up a fortified leaguer to the rear of the ruined [[Llanthony Secunda Priory]] and established his forces to the south of the city.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 95\u201396, 99, 100\u2013101</ref> By dawn on 11 August, a line of trenches had been dug some {{convert|130|yd|m}} from the walls, placing the two sides within musket range of each other, stretching from [[Brunswick Square, Gloucester|Gaudy Green]] on the south side to Issold's House on the east.<ref>Day 2007 p. 99</ref> Massey responded with spoiling tactics in an attempt to hinder Royalist siege operations and delay the assault he was expecting. At midnight a small raiding party succeeded in disrupting Royalist entrenching operations on Gaudy Green, and a larger raid on the green the next morning, 12 August, resulted in the capture of Royalist men, tools and weapons.<ref>Day 2007 p. 100</ref> By this time, the reinforcements from Herefordshire and Worcester under the command of Sir William Vavasour arrived on the west bank of the Severn and began crossing the river to take up positions at Kingsholm, to the north of the city. This force increased the size of the besieging army by another 2,400 infantry and over 300 cavalry. They too were the target of a Parliamentarian raid which inflicted up to fifteen casualties on the Royalists.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 100</ref>\n\nLater on 12 August, Forth completed an earthwork square on Gaudy Green, in which he placed two 24-pounders, the largest of the Royalist's eight cannon, along with a 12-pounder to target the south wall. Another artillery emplacement was positioned to target the east wall nearby.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 10, 99\u2013102</ref> With the artillery in place, the Royalists began bombarding the walls, with the main effort beginning at 11:00 on 13 August. The cannon were too light to have any significant impact, and of the two mortars the Royalists possessed, one, reputed to be the largest in the country, exploded on its first use. When it became evident the Royalists were focusing their efforts on the south-east corner of the city defences, Massey quickly buttressed the medieval walls with up to {{convert|5|ft|m}} of earth, which ensured that the defences held. Meanwhile, the majority of Vavasour's troops completed their crossing of the Severn, leaving behind a small contingent to blockade the west bank.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 100\u2013102</ref>\n\nReacting to rumours that Vavasour had received a reinforcement of artillery, the Parliamentarians mounted another raid to the north of the city on 14 August. They captured two prisoners but failed in their primary objective of locating and spiking any guns.<ref>Day 2007 p. 102</ref> The Royalist bombardment continued through 14 August, but a breach blown in the wall by the larger guns on Gaudy Green was quickly plugged by the defenders with woolsacks and [[gabion]]s. Royalist engineers mining towards the walls from trenches at the green succeeded in draining the ditch below the walls, but this was not followed up with an assault. By the end of the day the Royalist guns had fallen silent; the evidence suggests they had run out of ammunition.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 102\u2013103</ref>\n\nThe following day Vavasour received a reinforcement of 500 [[Glamorgan]] militia and 450 musketeers from Bristol, while the Parliamentarians bolstered the earthwork defences around the south and north gates. On 16 August Rupert accompanied Charles to Oxford, and neither were at Gloucester to witness the most ambitious Parliamentarian raid yet. Just before sunset, 150 musketeers of Stamford's regiment sallied out of the north gate to attack the Royalist trenches east of the city. The Parliamentarians claimed 100 Royalist killed for the cost of 2 injured, while Royalist sources report 24 Parliamentarians killed and more wounded, for the loss of 4 Royalists killed.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 103\u2013105</ref>\n\nStruggling with a shortage of gunpowder and with the guns quiet, the Royalists concentrated on mining operations to breach the city walls. Miners recruited from the [[Forest of Dean]] were set to work under a protective gallery to fill the {{convert|12|ft|m|adj=on}} deep by {{convert|30|ft|m|adj=on}} wide moat which, when completed, would allow them to undermine the walls. It was slow work, estimated to need a week to complete. The faster alternative was to forgo the protection and fill the moat with [[fascine]]s. An attempt to do this was beaten back by musket fire from the walls, and resulted in the desertion of the miners.<ref>Day 2007 103, 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy 18 August Vavasour had deployed three cannon in front of his main camp at Kingsholm and another opposite Alvin Gate. These were the targets of a Parliamentarian raid that morning that was even larger than previous efforts; a diversionary attack by 50 men and a main force of 400. All four of Vavasour's cannon were disabled, the Parliamentarians claiming over 100 Royalist casualties for the loss of 6, the Royalists admitting 28 casualties and claiming to have killed 27 Parliamentarians. Another Parliamentarian raid the same day involved their only recorded use of cavalry during the siege, when 150 musketeers and 40 cavalry mounted an ineffectual attack on Royalist positions to the east of the city. Charles, meanwhile, was on his way back to Gloucester with another 1,000 reinforcements.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 106\u2013107</ref>\n\nBy the morning of 19 August, two 6-pounder cannon had been installed in a third emplacement opposite the east gate, bringing all the original artillery online. At 10:00, the bombardment was resumed in a last effort to subdue the city by the original ten-day deadline. Constrained by the limited supplies of ammunition and gunpowder, the bombardment had little material effect, though it prompted Massey to hastily erect a breastwork in the open ground of Friar's Orchard, at the south east corner of the city where the Royalist artillery was being concentrated. A Royalist attempt to cross the moat after dark was beaten back by musket fire. The objective of forcing the surrender of Gloucester by siege in ten days had failed, partly due to the city's resolve and Massey's spoiling attacks, but mainly due to the inadequacy of the Royalist artillery.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 107\u2013109</ref> \n\nThe Parliamentarians mounted another raid at dawn on 21 August. It was a two-pronged attack designed to disable the Royalist artillery south and east of the walls. One detachment travelled by boat down the Severn, landed between Forth's camp and a redoubt opposite the castle and successfuly stormed the redoubt. The second detachment of 200 musketeers sallied from the north gate. Intending first to attack the battery opposite the east gate, this force became lost and blundered into Royalist infantry camps. When Massey saw that the raid was not going to plan, he sounded the recall. The Parliamentarians suffered eight casualties, the Royalists more than twenty. Such raids were proving risky and wasteful of the garrison's limited ammunition, and this was the last large-scale operation mounted by the Parliamentarians.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 112\u2013113</ref>\n\nAs the Royalists set about replenishing their stocks of ammunition, they intensified their mining efforts. It was anticipated that the original effort to bridge the moat would allow the besiegers to reach the east wall on 24 August. A second effort to bridge the moat to the south was begun, as was a more complicated project to tunnel towards the east gate. Royalist agents attempted to persuade the garrison to surrender, and Royalist cavalry staged a mock battle in an unsuccessful attempt to lure the garrison out of the city in the belief that a relief force had arrived.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 114\u2013115</ref> A desultory bombardment was maintained, particularly by the mortars, until 25 August, when it was intensified. An attempt that day by Massey to disrupt it with a sally from the north gate was beaten back by cavalry, but as before, a shortage of ammunition \u2013 at one stage the Royalists resorted to firing stones \u2013 blunted the impact, and little damage was done to the city.<ref>Day 2007 p. 116</ref>\n\nFollowing news that the [[Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex|Earl of Essex]] was raising a Parliamentarian army in London, Charles and Rupert travelled to Oxford on 26 August, where they held a two-day council of war. With no intelligence of Essex's plans, the Royalists bolstered the defences of Oxford with troops earmarked for the siege of Gloucester while the Royalist garrison at Bristol was urged to send all the forces it could spare to Gloucester. Believing that Essex could muster no more than 6,000 troops, the decision was made to continue the siege, though contingency plans for the blockade of Gloucester were drawn up in case it had to be lifted. [[Henry Wilmot, 1st Earl of Rochester|Lord Wilmot]] was instructed to muster 2,000 cavalry around [[Banbury]]. Their task would be to delay the Parliamentarians in the [[Cotswolds]] until Rupert could come up with the rest of the Royalist cavalry in support, should Essex march to the relief of Gloucester.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 117\u2013118</ref>\n\nEssex began his march from [[Colnbrook]], west of London, on 26 August.<ref>Day 2007 p. 127</ref> His plan was to relieve Gloucester without provoking a major battle in which, with the Royalist superiority in cavalry, he would be at a disdvantage. His route was dictated by the desire to minimise the amount of open country favourable to cavalry operations he would have to pass through, and took him north of Oxford via Aylesbury and Bicester and then across the Cotswolds.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 124\u2013126</ref> At the beginning of September Essex was due north of Oxford with an army of some 10,500 infantry, no more than 4,500 mounted troops and an artillery train that is estimated at no more than 50 guns.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 130\u2013131, 133</ref>\n\nMining was now the principal tactic by which the Royalists hoped to bring the siege to a successful conclusion. Priority was given to tunnelling at the east gate, which caused progress on efforts to fill the moat below the south and east walls to slow, possibly as a result of a lack of miners and engineers. Parliamentarian countermining at the east gate on 28 August was quickly abandoned because of springs that caused flooding, which accounts for the slow pace of the Royalist efforts there.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 136\u2013138</ref> Massey continued to harass the besiegers with sniping and artillery fire, and he resumed countermining operations at the east gate after a reconnaissance party had reported Royalists miners were still working on their mine. The progress of the Royalist mines closer towards the walls, quickened by the arrival of Welsh miners on 29 August, led Massey to believe an an assault was imminent. On 1 September he fortified Friars Orchard with an earthwork wall and [[Sconce (fortification)|sconce]], a fort in which he placed four pieces of artillery that could be brought to bear on any Royalists who broke through the south-east corner or the east gate.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 138\u2013140</ref>\n\nOn 3 September the Parliamentarians placed a [[Saker (cannon)|saker]] in a gun port they had been secretly building in east wall above the gallery protecting the Royalist miners. The medium-sized cannon was employed most of the day against the gallery, to little effect, until the Royalists targeted it with a cannon of their own, at which point it was withdrawn. The Royalists anticipated their mine would reach the east gate the next day, while they believed Essex could be delayed in the Cotswolds for four days. The Bristol garrison was being stripped for reinforcements and orders had been sent to Oxford for ten field guns and the equipment necessary to make the guns already at Gloucester mobile, should it be necessary to redeploy them from siegework to use in open battle.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 140\u2013141</ref>\n\nBy the end of the day Essex's lead element, the London brigade, was at [[Oddington, Gloucestershire|Oddington]], {{convert|2|mi|km}} east of [[Stow-on-the-Wold]]. His army was largely untroubled by Wilmot's Royalist cavalry, and because of the differing rates of march it was strung out as far back as [[Chipping Norton]], nearly {{convert|6|mi|km}} to the east. Earlier the same day Rupert had led the rest of the Royalist cavalry from Gloucester, and having rendezvoused with Wilmot, now had some 5,000 men camped around [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], {{convert|4|mi|km}} south-west of Stow.<ref>Day 2007 pp. 141\u2013143, 146</ref>\n\nBy the end of the siege, Massey had only three barrels of gunpowder left for the defence of the city.\n\n==Aftermath==\nWith the arrival of the Earl of Essex, the Royalists forces withdrew and began to march on towards London. They intercepted Essex's army at the [[First Battle of Newbury]], but failed to destroy it. For the remainder of the war, Massey's force based in Gloucester continually threatened the lines of communication between Oxford, the King's wartime capital, and Wales and the West Country.\n\nFollowing the return of Charles II to the throne, the king took his revenge upon the city by having its walls torn down. The foundations of the wall, however, are still visible in parts of the city today.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist|30em}}\n\n==Commemoration==\nFor centuries afterwards, the lifting of the siege was marked by an annual [[Gloucester Day]]. This died out in the nineteenth century but was reinstated in 2009.<ref name=bbc>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/gloucestershire/8239588.stm Tradition revived for city pride.] BBC News, 5 September 2009.

However, these relationships do not explain more detailed patterns of biogeography, such as why epidemic HIV-2 groups (A and B) only evolved in the [[Ivory Coast]], which is one of only six countries harbouring the sooty mangabey.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} It is also unclear why the SIVcpz endemic in the [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]] subspecies ''Pan troglodytes schweinfurthii'' (inhabiting the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], Central African Republic, [[Rwanda]], Burundi, [[Uganda]], and [[Tanzania]]) did not spawn an epidemic HIV-1 strain to humans, while the Democratic Republic of Congo was the main centre of HIV-1 group M, a virus descended from SIVcpz strains of a subspecies (''Pan troglodytes troglodytes'') that does not exist in this country.

All of them propose that the simultaneous epidemic emergences of four HIV groups in the late 19th-early 20th century, and the lack of previous known emergences, are explained by new factor(s) that appeared in the relevant African regions in that timeframe. These new factor(s) would have acted either to increase human exposures to SIV, to help it to adapt to the human organism by [[mutation]] (thus enhancing its between-humans transmissibility), or to cause an initial burst of transmissions crossing an [[epidemiological]] threshold, and therefore increasing the probability of continued spread.\n\nGenetic studies of the virus suggested in 2008 that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to the [[Belgian Congo]] city of [[L\u00e9opoldville]] (modern [[Kinshasa]]), circa 1910.<ref name=Worobey2008 /> Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of [[colonialism]] and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of non-monogamous sexual activity, the spread of [[prostitution]], and the concomitant high frequency of [[genital ulcer]] diseases (such as [[syphilis]]) in nascent colonial cities.<ref name=Sousa2010 />\n\nIn 2014, a study conducted by scientists from the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, revealed that because approximately one million people every year would flow through the prominent city of Kinshasa,<ref name=pppppavab /> which served as the origin of the first known HIV cases in the 1920s,<ref name=pppppavab /> passengers riding on the region's Belgian railway trains were able to spread the virus to larger areas.<ref name=pppppavab />  The study also attributed a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics as other factors which contributed to the emergence of the Africa HIV epidemic.<ref name=pppppavab />\n\n==== Social changes and urbanization ====\n\nBeatrice Hahn, [[Paul M.

This process favors the accumulation of [[adaptive mutation]]s more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted viral variant will appear in the host before the [[immune system]] suppresses the virus.<ref name=Marx2001/> Such better adapted variants could then survive in the human host for longer than the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period, in high numbers (high [[viral load]]), which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread.\n\nMarx ''et al.'' reported experiments of cross-species transfer of SIV in captive monkeys (some of which made by themselves), in which the use of [[serial passage]] helped to adapt SIV to the new monkey species after passage by three or four animals.<ref name=Marx2001/>\n\nIn agreement with this model is also the fact that, while both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] attain substantial [[viral load]]s in the human organism, adventitious [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV [[viral load]].<ref name=Kalish2005/> This suggests that both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] are adapted to humans, and [[serial passage]] could have been the process responsible for it.\n\nMarx ''et al.'' proposed that unsterile injections (that is, injections where the needle or syringe is reused without sterilization or cleaning between uses), which were likely very prevalent in Africa, during both the colonial period and afterwards, provided the mechanism of [[serial passage]] that permitted HIV to adapt to humans, therefore explaining why it emerged epidemically only in the 20th century.<ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Drucker2001/>\n\n==== Massive injections of the antibiotic era ====\n\nMarx ''et al.'' emphasize the massive number of injections administered in Africa after [[antibiotic]]s were introduced (around 1950) as being the most likely implicated in the origin of HIV because, by these times (roughly in the period 1950 to 1970), injection intensity in Africa was maximal. They argued that a [[serial passage]] chain of 3 or 4 transmissions between humans is an unlikely event (the probability of transmission after a needle reuse is something between 0.3% and 2%, and only a few people have an acute SIV infection at any time), and so HIV emergence may have required the very high frequency of injections of the [[antibiotic]] era.<ref name=Marx2001/>\n\nThe molecular dating studies place the initial spread of the epidemic HIV groups before that time (see above).<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/><ref name=Lemey2003/><ref name=Wertheim/> According to Marx ''et al.'', these studies could have overestimated the age of the HIV groups, because they depend on a [[molecular clock]] assumption, may not have accounted for the effects of [[natural selection]] in the viruses, and the [[serial passage]] process alone would be associated with strong [[natural selection]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manoramaonline.com/environment/earth-n-colors/2019/08/03/new-plant-species-found-in-western-ghats.html|title=\u0d2a\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d18\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d2a\u0d41\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f \u0d14\u0d37\u0d27\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d46\u0d1f\u0d3f; '\u0d39\u0d3f\u0d21\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d4b\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d38\u0d4d \u0d07\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d26\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d46'|website=ManoramaOnline|language=ml|access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref><ref name=Marx2001/>\n\n==== Injection campaigns against sleeping sickness ====\n\nDavid Gisselquist proposed that the mass injection campaigns to treat [[trypanosomiasis]] ([[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]) in Central Africa were responsible for the emergence of HIV-1.<ref name=Gisselquist2003>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gisselquist D | title = Emergence of the HIV type 1 epidemic in the twentieth century: comparing hypotheses to evidence | journal = AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 1071\u201378 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14709242 | doi = 10.1089/088922203771881158 }}</ref> Unlike Marx ''et al.'',<ref name=Marx2001/> Gisselquist argued that the millions of unsafe injections administered during these campaigns were sufficient to spread rare HIV infections into an epidemic, and that evolution of HIV through [[serial passage]] was not essential to the emergence of the HIV epidemic in the 20th century.<ref name=Gisselquist2003/>\n\nThis theory focuses on injection campaigns that peaked in the period 1910\u201340, that is, around the time the [[HIV-1]] groups started to spread.<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/> It also focuses on the fact that many of the injections in these campaigns were intravenous (which are more likely to transmit SIV/HIV than subcutaneous or intramuscular injections), and many of the patients received many (often more than 10) injections per year, therefore increasing the odds of SIV [[serial passage]].<ref name=Gisselquist2003/>\n\n===== Other early injection campaigns =====\n\nJacques P\u00e9pin and Annie-Claude Labb\u00e9 reviewed the colonial health reports of [[Cameroon]] and [[French Equatorial Africa]] for the period 1921\u201359, calculating the incidences of the diseases requiring intravenous injections.

Each HIV group necessarily crossed to humans between this time and the time when it started to spread (the time of the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]]), because after the MRCA certainly all lineages were already in humans, and before the split with the closest [[simian]] strain, the lineage was in a simian. HIV-1 groups M and O split from their closest SIVs around 1931 and 1915, respectively.

The colonial authorities recruited men to work in railways, fluvial and sea ports, and other infrastructure projects, and most of these men did not bring their wives with them. Then, the highly male-biased [[sex ratio]] favoured prostitution, which in its turn caused an explosion of [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] (especially [[syphilis]] and [[chancroid]]). After the mid-1930s, people's movements were more tightly controlled, and mass surveys and treatments (of [[arsenical]]s and other drugs) were organized, and so the GUD incidences started to decline. They declined even further after World War II, because of the heavy use of [[antibiotic]]s, so that, by the late 1950s, L\u00e9opoldville (which is the probable center of HIV-1 group M) had a very low GUD incidence. Similar processes happened in the cities of [[Cameroon]] and [[Ivory Coast]], where HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 respectively evolved.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\nTherefore, the peak GUD incidences in cities<ref name=Sousa2010/> have a good temporal coincidence with the period when all main HIV groups crossed to humans and started to spread.<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/><ref name=Lemey2003/><ref name=Wertheim/> In addition, the authors gathered evidence that [[syphilis]] and the other GUDs were, like injections, absent from the densely forested areas of Central and West Africa before organized [[colonialism]] socially disrupted these areas (starting in the 1880s).<ref name=Sousa2010/> Thus, this theory also potentially explains why HIV emerged only after the late 19th century.\n\n===== Female genital mutilation =====\n\nUli Linke has argued that the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (either or both of clitoridectomy and infibulation) is responsible for the high incidence of AIDS in Africa, since intercourse with a female who has undergone [[clitoridectomy]] is conducive to exchange of blood.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Linke | first=Uli | title = AIDS in Africa | journal = Science | volume = 231 | page = 203 | date = January 1986 | doi=10.1126/science.231.4735.203-b | pmid=3941894 | issue=4735|bibcode = 1986Sci...231..203L }}</ref>\n\n=====Male circumcision distribution and HIV origins=====\n\nMale [[circumcision]] may reduce the probability of HIV acquisition by [[Circumcision and HIV|men]].

The reason is that many [[ethnic group]]s not performing circumcision by that time gradually adopted it, to imitate other ethnic groups and enhance the social acceptance of their boys ([[colonialism]] produced massive intermixing between African ethnic groups).<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Friedrichs1924/> About 15\u201330% of men in L\u00e9opoldville and [[Douala]] in the early 20th century should be uncircumcised, and these cities were the probable centers of HIV-1 groups M and O, respectively.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\nThe authors studied early [[circumcision]] frequencies in 12 cities of Central and West Africa, to test if this variable correlated with HIV emergence. This [[correlation]] was strong for [[HIV-2]]: among 6 West African cities that could have received immigrants infected with SIVsmm, the two cities from the [[Ivory Coast]] studied ([[Abidjan]] and [[Bouak\u00e9]]) had much higher frequency of uncircumcised men (60\u201385%) than the others, and epidemic [[HIV-2]] groups emerged initially in this country only. This correlation was less clear for [[HIV-1]] in Central Africa.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\n===== Computer simulations of HIV emergence =====\n\nSousa ''et al.'' then built [[computer simulation]]s to test if an 'ill-adapted SIV' (meaning a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] already infecting a human but incapable of transmission beyond the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period) could spread in colonial cities. The simulations used [[parameter]]s of sexual transmission obtained from the current HIV literature. They modelled people's 'sexual links', with different levels of sexual partner change among different categories of people (prostitutes, single women with several partners a year, married women, and men), according to data obtained from modern studies of sexual activity in African cities. The simulations let the parameters (city size, proportion of people married, [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] frequency, male [[circumcision]] frequency, and transmission parameters) vary, and explored several scenarios. Each scenario was run 1,000 times, to test the probability of SIV generating long chains of sexual transmission. The authors postulated that such long chains of sexual transmission were necessary for the SIV strain to adapt better to humans, becoming an HIV capable of further epidemic emergence.\n\nThe main result was that [[genital ulcer]] frequency was by far the most decisive factor. For the GUD levels prevailing in L\u00e9opoldville in the early 20th century, long chains of SIV transmission had a high probability. For the lower [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] levels existing in the same city in the late 1950s (see above), they were much less likely. And without GUD (a situation typical of villages in forested equatorial Africa before [[colonialism]]) SIV could not spread at all. City size was not an important factor. The authors propose that these findings explain the temporal patterns of HIV emergence: no HIV emerging in tens of thousands of years of human slaughtering of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s, several HIV groups emerging in the nascent, GUD-riddled, colonial cities, and no epidemically successful HIV group emerging in mid-20th century, when GUD was more controlled, and cities were much bigger.\n\nMale [[circumcision]] had little to moderate effect in their simulations, but, given the geographical [[correlation]] found, the authors propose that it could have had an indirect role, either by increasing [[genital ulcer disease]] itself (it is known that [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]], and several other GUDs have higher incidences in uncircumcised men), or by permitting further spread of the HIV strain, after the first chains of sexual transmission permitted [[adaptation]] to the human organism.\n\nOne of the main advantages of this theory is stressed by the authors: \"It [the theory] also offers a conceptual simplicity because it proposes as causal factors for SIV adaptation to humans and initial spread the very same factors that most promote the continued spread of HIV nowadays: promiscuous [sic] sex, particularly involving sex workers, GUD, and possibly lack of circumcision.\"<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\n==== Iatrogenic and other theories ====\n\n[[Iatrogenic]] theories propose that medical interventions were responsible for HIV origins. By proposing factors that only appeared in Central and West Africa after the late 19th century, they seek to explain why all HIV groups also started after that.\n\nThe theories centred on the role of [[parenteral]] risks, such as unsterile injections, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s,<ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Chitnis2000/><ref name=Gisselquist2003/><ref name=Pepin2008/> or [[smallpox]] vaccinations<ref name=Chitnis2000/> are accepted as plausible by most scientists of the field.\n\n[[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories]] include several iatrogenic theories, such as the [[OPV AIDS hypothesis|polio vaccine hypothesis]] which argues that the early [[Polio vaccine|oral polio vaccine]]s were contaminated with a chimpanzee virus, leading to the Central African outbreak.<ref name= Lancet>{{cite journal | author = Ramsay S | year = 2001 | title = Cold water downstream from The River | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)04536-0/fulltext#article_upsell | journal = The Lancet | volume = 357 | issue = 9265| page = 1343 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04536-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Pathogenicity of SIV in non-human primates ==\n\nIn most non-human primate species, natural [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infection does not cause a fatal disease (but see below). Comparison of the gene sequence of SIV with HIV should, therefore, give us information about the factors necessary to cause disease in humans. The factors that determine the virulence of HIV as compared to most SIVs are only now being elucidated. Non-human SIVs contain a ''nef'' gene that down-regulates [[CD3 (immunology)|CD3]], [[CD4]], and [[MHC class I]] expression; most non-human SIVs, therefore, do not induce immunodeficiency; the [[HIV-1]] ''nef'' gene, however, has lost its ability to down-regulate CD3, which results in the immune activation and apoptosis that is characteristic of chronic HIV infection.<ref>{{cite journal | vauthors = Schindler M, M\u00fcnch J, Kutsch O, Li H, Santiago ML, Bibollet-Ruche F, M\u00fcller-Trutwin MC, Novembre FJ, Peeters M, Courgnaud V, Bailes E, Roques P, Sodora DL, Silvestri G, Sharp PM, Hahn BH, Kirchhoff F | title = Nef-mediated suppression of T cell activation was lost in a lentiviral lineage that gave rise to HIV-1 | journal = Cell | volume = 125 | issue = 6 | pages = 1055\u201367 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16777597 | doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2006.04.033 | doi-access = free }}</ref>\n\nIn addition, a long-term survey of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s naturally infected with SIVcpz in Gombe, [[Tanzania]] found that, contrary to the previous [[paradigm]], chimpanzees with SIVcpz infection do experience an increased mortality, and also suffer from a Human AIDS-like illness.<ref name=Keele2009>{{cite journal | vauthors = Keele BF, Jones JH, Terio KA, Estes JD, Rudicell RS, Wilson ML, Li Y, Learn GH, Beasley TM, Schumacher-Stankey J, Wroblewski E, Mosser A, Raphael J, Kamenya S, Lonsdorf EV, Travis DA, Mlengeya T, Kinsel MJ, Else JG, Silvestri G, Goodall J, Sharp PM, Shaw GM, Pusey AE, Hahn BH | title = Increased mortality and AIDS-like immunopathology in wild chimpanzees infected with SIVcpz | journal = Nature | volume = 460 | issue = 7254 | pages = 515\u201319 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19626114 | pmc = 2872475 | doi = 10.1038/nature08200 | bibcode = 2009Natur.460..515K }}</ref> SIV pathogenicity in wild animals could exist in other chimpanzee subspecies and other primate species as well, and stay unrecognized by lack of relevant long term studies.\n\n== History of spread ==\n{{Main|Timeline of early HIV/AIDS cases}}\n\n===1959: David Carr===\nDavid Carr was an apprentice printer (usually mistakenly referred to as a sailor; Carr had served in the Navy between 1955 and 1957) from Manchester, England who died August 31, 1959, and was for some time mistakenly reported to have died from AIDS-defining opportunistic infections (ADOIs).

It starts by stating that up to September 1988, IDU was the risk behaviour in 19,139 (or 26%) of the first 72,223 cases of AIDS in the US.<ref name=Jarlais_1/> Cases among IDUs in New York in the same period numbered 6,182 (approximately a third of national IDU cases). The study continues to outline the [[methodology]] used in the compilation of data. It says that while truly representative samples of IDUs within a community are probably impossible to obtain, samples of IDUs entering treatment provide a good source for monitoring trends. In the results section it states (quoting): \"The first evidence for HIV-1 infection among IV drug users in New York is from three cases of AIDS in children born in 1977. These cases were later reported to the New York City Department of Health AIDS Surveillance Unit. These children did not receive any known [[Blood transfusion|transfusions]] prior to developing AIDS and were born to mothers known to be IV drug users.\"<ref name=Jarlais_1/>\n\nIt continues to outline that the earliest known case of AIDS in an adult IDU occurred in 1979 (mixed risk) and that known cases among IDUs increased rapidly from the 8 cases in 1980 (3 mixed risk), to 31 cases in 1981, to 160 cases in 1982, and to 340 cases in 1983.<ref name=Jarlais_1/> Statistics on the amount of positive tests for HIV, mainly using archived samples, are: 1978 1 out of 11; 1979 13/50; 1980 8/21; 1981\u201383 14/28; 1984 75/137 and 38/63; 1986 36/55 and 1987 169 out of 294.<ref name=Jarlais_1/> In the comments section, it states: \"The three cases in 1977 of apparent [[Vertically transmitted infection|perinatal transmission]] (mother-to-child) from IV drug-using women strongly suggest that the introduction of HIV-1 into the IV drug-use group occurred around 1975 or 1976, or perhaps even earlier.\"<ref name=Jarlais_1/> It says that without extensive samples from this period, it is not possible to be certain about the spread of HIV among IDUs, but the samples from IDUs with chronic [[liver disease]] suggest that the rates of infection were below 20% for the first 3 or 4 years after its introduction.<ref name=Jarlais_1/>\n\nHIV is thought to have entered the population of people using intravenous drugs in New York in approximately 1975.<ref name=Friedman_1>{{cite journal| title=Harm reduction theory: Users culture, micro-social indigenous harm reduction, and the self-organization and outside-organizing of users' groups| author1=S.R.

All of them propose that the simultaneous epidemic emergences of four HIV groups in the late 19th-early 20th century, and the lack of previous known emergences, are explained by new factor(s) that appeared in the relevant African regions in that timeframe. These new factor(s) would have acted either to increase human exposures to SIV, to help it to adapt to the human organism by [[mutation]] (thus enhancing its between-humans transmissibility), or to cause an initial burst of transmissions crossing an [[epidemiological]] threshold, and therefore increasing the probability of continued spread.\n\nGenetic studies of the virus suggested in 2008 that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV-1 M group dates back to the [[Belgian Congo]] city of [[L\u00e9opoldville]] (modern [[Kinshasa]]), circa 1910.<ref name=Worobey2008 /> Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of [[colonialism]] and growth of large colonial African cities, leading to social changes, including a higher degree of non-monogamous sexual activity, the spread of [[prostitution]], and the concomitant high frequency of [[genital ulcer]] diseases (such as [[syphilis]]) in nascent colonial cities.<ref name=Sousa2010 />\n\nIn 2014, a study conducted by scientists from the University of Oxford and the University of Leuven, in Belgium, revealed that because approximately one million people every year would flow through the prominent city of Kinshasa,<ref name=pppppavab /> which served as the origin of the first known HIV cases in the 1920s,<ref name=pppppavab /> passengers riding on the region's Belgian railway trains were able to spread the virus to larger areas.<ref name=pppppavab />  The study also attributed a roaring sex trade, rapid population growth and unsterilised needles used in health clinics as other factors which contributed to the emergence of the Africa HIV epidemic.<ref name=pppppavab />\n\n==== Social changes and urbanization ====\n\nBeatrice Hahn, [[Paul M.

This process favors the accumulation of [[adaptive mutation]]s more rapidly, therefore increasing the odds that a better adapted viral variant will appear in the host before the [[immune system]] suppresses the virus.<ref name=Marx2001/> Such better adapted variants could then survive in the human host for longer than the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period, in high numbers (high [[viral load]]), which would grant it more possibilities of epidemic spread.\n\nMarx ''et al.'' reported experiments of cross-species transfer of SIV in captive monkeys (some of which made by themselves), in which the use of [[serial passage]] helped to adapt SIV to the new monkey species after passage by three or four animals.<ref name=Marx2001/>\n\nIn agreement with this model is also the fact that, while both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] attain substantial [[viral load]]s in the human organism, adventitious [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infecting humans seldom does so: people with SIV antibodies often have very low or even undetectable SIV [[viral load]].<ref name=Kalish2005/> This suggests that both [[HIV-1]] and [[HIV-2]] are adapted to humans, and [[serial passage]] could have been the process responsible for it.\n\nMarx ''et al.'' proposed that unsterile injections (that is, injections where the needle or syringe is reused without sterilization or cleaning between uses), which were likely very prevalent in Africa, during both the colonial period and afterwards, provided the mechanism of [[serial passage]] that permitted HIV to adapt to humans, therefore explaining why it emerged epidemically only in the 20th century.<ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Drucker2001/>\n\n==== Massive injections of the antibiotic era ====\n\nMarx ''et al.'' emphasize the massive number of injections administered in Africa after [[antibiotic]]s were introduced (around 1950) as being the most likely implicated in the origin of HIV because, by these times (roughly in the period 1950 to 1970), injection intensity in Africa was maximal. They argued that a [[serial passage]] chain of 3 or 4 transmissions between humans is an unlikely event (the probability of transmission after a needle reuse is something between 0.3% and 2%, and only a few people have an acute SIV infection at any time), and so HIV emergence may have required the very high frequency of injections of the [[antibiotic]] era.<ref name=Marx2001/>\n\nThe molecular dating studies place the initial spread of the epidemic HIV groups before that time (see above).<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/><ref name=Lemey2003/><ref name=Wertheim/> According to Marx ''et al.'', these studies could have overestimated the age of the HIV groups, because they depend on a [[molecular clock]] assumption, may not have accounted for the effects of [[natural selection]] in the viruses, and the [[serial passage]] process alone would be associated with strong [[natural selection]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.manoramaonline.com/environment/earth-n-colors/2019/08/03/new-plant-species-found-in-western-ghats.html|title=\u0d2a\u0d36\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d3f\u0d2e\u0d18\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d24\u0d4d\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d7d \u0d2a\u0d41\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d2f \u0d14\u0d37\u0d27\u0d1a\u0d4d\u0d1a\u0d46\u0d1f\u0d3f; '\u0d39\u0d3f\u0d21\u0d3f\u0d2f\u0d4b\u0d1f\u0d4d\u0d1f\u0d3f\u0d38\u0d4d \u0d07\u0d28\u0d4d\u0d26\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d46'|website=ManoramaOnline|language=ml|access-date=2019-08-03}}</ref><ref name=Marx2001/>\n\n==== Injection campaigns against sleeping sickness ====\n\nDavid Gisselquist proposed that the mass injection campaigns to treat [[trypanosomiasis]] ([[African trypanosomiasis|sleeping sickness]]) in Central Africa were responsible for the emergence of HIV-1.<ref name=Gisselquist2003>{{cite journal | vauthors = Gisselquist D | title = Emergence of the HIV type 1 epidemic in the twentieth century: comparing hypotheses to evidence | journal = AIDS Res Hum Retroviruses | volume = 19 | issue = 12 | pages = 1071\u201378 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14709242 | doi = 10.1089/088922203771881158 }}</ref> Unlike Marx ''et al.'',<ref name=Marx2001/> Gisselquist argued that the millions of unsafe injections administered during these campaigns were sufficient to spread rare HIV infections into an epidemic, and that evolution of HIV through [[serial passage]] was not essential to the emergence of the HIV epidemic in the 20th century.<ref name=Gisselquist2003/>\n\nThis theory focuses on injection campaigns that peaked in the period 1910\u201340, that is, around the time the [[HIV-1]] groups started to spread.<ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/> It also focuses on the fact that many of the injections in these campaigns were intravenous (which are more likely to transmit SIV/HIV than subcutaneous or intramuscular injections), and many of the patients received many (often more than 10) injections per year, therefore increasing the odds of SIV [[serial passage]].<ref name=Gisselquist2003/>\n\n===== Other early injection campaigns =====\n\nJacques P\u00e9pin and Annie-Claude Labb\u00e9 reviewed the colonial health reports of [[Cameroon]] and [[French Equatorial Africa]] for the period 1921\u201359, calculating the incidences of the diseases requiring intravenous injections.

These diseases increase the probability of HIV transmission dramatically, from around 0.01\u20130.1% to 4\u201343% per heterosexual act, because the genital ulcers provide a portal of viral entry, and contain many activated [[T cell]]s expressing the [[CCR5]] co-receptor, the main cell targets of HIV.<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Cameron>{{cite journal | vauthors = Cameron DW, Simonsen JN, D'Costa LJ, Ronald AR, Maitha GM, Gakinya MN, Cheang M, Ndinya-Achola JO, Piot P, Brunham RC | title = Female to male transmission of human immunodeficiency virus type 1: risk factors for seroconversion in men | journal = Lancet | volume = 334 | issue = 8660 | pages = 403\u201307 | year = 1989 | pmid = 2569597 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(89)90589-8 | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(89)90589-8/abstract }}</ref>\n\n===== Probable time interval of cross-species transfer =====\n\nSousa ''et al.'' use molecular dating techniques to estimate the time when each HIV group split from its closest [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] lineage. Each HIV group necessarily crossed to humans between this time and the time when it started to spread (the time of the [[most recent common ancestor|MRCA]]), because after the MRCA certainly all lineages were already in humans, and before the split with the closest [[simian]] strain, the lineage was in a simian. HIV-1 groups M and O split from their closest SIVs around 1931 and 1915, respectively. This information, together with the datations of the HIV groups' MRCAs, mean that all HIV groups likely crossed to humans in the early 20th century.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\n===== Strong GUD incidence in nascent colonial cities =====\n\nThe authors reviewed colonial medical articles and archived medical reports of the countries at or near the ranges of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s, [[gorilla]]s and [[sooty mangabey]]s, and found that [[genital ulcer disease]]s peaked in the colonial cities during their early growth period (up to 1935). The colonial authorities recruited men to work in railways, fluvial and sea ports, and other infrastructure projects, and most of these men did not bring their wives with them. Then, the highly male-biased [[sex ratio]] favoured prostitution, which in its turn caused an explosion of [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] (especially [[syphilis]] and [[chancroid]]). After the mid-1930s, people's movements were more tightly controlled, and mass surveys and treatments (of [[arsenical]]s and other drugs) were organized, and so the GUD incidences started to decline. They declined even further after World War II, because of the heavy use of [[antibiotic]]s, so that, by the late 1950s, L\u00e9opoldville (which is the probable center of HIV-1 group M) had a very low GUD incidence. Similar processes happened in the cities of [[Cameroon]] and [[Ivory Coast]], where HIV-1 group O and HIV-2 respectively evolved.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\nTherefore, the peak GUD incidences in cities<ref name=Sousa2010/> have a good temporal coincidence with the period when all main HIV groups crossed to humans and started to spread.<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Salemi/><ref name=Korber/><ref name=Lemey2004/><ref name=Worobey2008/><ref name=Lemey2003/><ref name=Wertheim/> In addition, the authors gathered evidence that [[syphilis]] and the other GUDs were, like injections, absent from the densely forested areas of Central and West Africa before organized [[colonialism]] socially disrupted these areas (starting in the 1880s).<ref name=Sousa2010/> Thus, this theory also potentially explains why HIV emerged only after the late 19th century.\n\n===== Female genital mutilation =====\n\nUli Linke has argued that the practice of [[female genital mutilation]] (either or both of clitoridectomy and infibulation) is responsible for the high incidence of AIDS in Africa, since intercourse with a female who has undergone [[clitoridectomy]] is conducive to exchange of blood.<ref>{{cite journal | last=Linke | first=Uli | title = AIDS in Africa | journal = Science | volume = 231 | page = 203 | date = January 1986 | doi=10.1126/science.231.4735.203-b | pmid=3941894 | issue=4735|bibcode = 1986Sci...231..203L }}</ref>\n\n=====Male circumcision distribution and HIV origins=====\n\nMale [[circumcision]] may reduce the probability of HIV acquisition by [[Circumcision and HIV|men]]. Leaving aside blood [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s, the highest [[HIV-1]] transmissibility ever measured was from GUD-suffering female prostitutes to uncircumcised men\u2014the measured risk was 43% in a single sexual act.<ref name=Cameron/> Sousa ''et al.'' reasoned that the adaptation and epidemic emergence of each HIV group may have required such extreme conditions, and thus reviewed the existing [[ethnography|ethnographic]] literature for patterns of male [[circumcision]] and hunting of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s for [[bushmeat]], focusing on the period 1880\u20131960, and on most of the 318 [[ethnic group]]s living in Central and West Africa.<ref name=Sousa2010/> They also collected censuses and other literature showing the ethnic composition of colonial cities in this period. Then, they estimated the circumcision frequencies of the Central African cities over time.\n\nSousa ''et al.'' charts reveal that male circumcision frequencies were much lower in several cities of western and central Africa in the early 20th century than they are currently. The reason is that many [[ethnic group]]s not performing circumcision by that time gradually adopted it, to imitate other ethnic groups and enhance the social acceptance of their boys ([[colonialism]] produced massive intermixing between African ethnic groups).<ref name=Sousa2010/><ref name=Friedrichs1924/> About 15\u201330% of men in L\u00e9opoldville and [[Douala]] in the early 20th century should be uncircumcised, and these cities were the probable centers of HIV-1 groups M and O, respectively.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\nThe authors studied early [[circumcision]] frequencies in 12 cities of Central and West Africa, to test if this variable correlated with HIV emergence. This [[correlation]] was strong for [[HIV-2]]: among 6 West African cities that could have received immigrants infected with SIVsmm, the two cities from the [[Ivory Coast]] studied ([[Abidjan]] and [[Bouak\u00e9]]) had much higher frequency of uncircumcised men (60\u201385%) than the others, and epidemic [[HIV-2]] groups emerged initially in this country only. This correlation was less clear for [[HIV-1]] in Central Africa.<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\n===== Computer simulations of HIV emergence =====\n\nSousa ''et al.'' then built [[computer simulation]]s to test if an 'ill-adapted SIV' (meaning a [[simian immunodeficiency virus]] already infecting a human but incapable of transmission beyond the short [[acute HIV infection|acute infection]] period) could spread in colonial cities. The simulations used [[parameter]]s of sexual transmission obtained from the current HIV literature. They modelled people's 'sexual links', with different levels of sexual partner change among different categories of people (prostitutes, single women with several partners a year, married women, and men), according to data obtained from modern studies of sexual activity in African cities. The simulations let the parameters (city size, proportion of people married, [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] frequency, male [[circumcision]] frequency, and transmission parameters) vary, and explored several scenarios. Each scenario was run 1,000 times, to test the probability of SIV generating long chains of sexual transmission. The authors postulated that such long chains of sexual transmission were necessary for the SIV strain to adapt better to humans, becoming an HIV capable of further epidemic emergence.\n\nThe main result was that [[genital ulcer]] frequency was by far the most decisive factor. For the GUD levels prevailing in L\u00e9opoldville in the early 20th century, long chains of SIV transmission had a high probability. For the lower [[genital ulcer disease|GUD]] levels existing in the same city in the late 1950s (see above), they were much less likely. And without GUD (a situation typical of villages in forested equatorial Africa before [[colonialism]]) SIV could not spread at all. City size was not an important factor. The authors propose that these findings explain the temporal patterns of HIV emergence: no HIV emerging in tens of thousands of years of human slaughtering of [[ape]]s and [[monkey]]s, several HIV groups emerging in the nascent, GUD-riddled, colonial cities, and no epidemically successful HIV group emerging in mid-20th century, when GUD was more controlled, and cities were much bigger.\n\nMale [[circumcision]] had little to moderate effect in their simulations, but, given the geographical [[correlation]] found, the authors propose that it could have had an indirect role, either by increasing [[genital ulcer disease]] itself (it is known that [[syphilis]], [[chancroid]], and several other GUDs have higher incidences in uncircumcised men), or by permitting further spread of the HIV strain, after the first chains of sexual transmission permitted [[adaptation]] to the human organism.\n\nOne of the main advantages of this theory is stressed by the authors: \"It [the theory] also offers a conceptual simplicity because it proposes as causal factors for SIV adaptation to humans and initial spread the very same factors that most promote the continued spread of HIV nowadays: promiscuous [sic] sex, particularly involving sex workers, GUD, and possibly lack of circumcision.\"<ref name=Sousa2010/>\n\n==== Iatrogenic and other theories ====\n\n[[Iatrogenic]] theories propose that medical interventions were responsible for HIV origins. By proposing factors that only appeared in Central and West Africa after the late 19th century, they seek to explain why all HIV groups also started after that.\n\nThe theories centred on the role of [[parenteral]] risks, such as unsterile injections, [[Blood transfusion|transfusion]]s,<ref name=Marx2001/><ref name=Chitnis2000/><ref name=Gisselquist2003/><ref name=Pepin2008/> or [[smallpox]] vaccinations<ref name=Chitnis2000/> are accepted as plausible by most scientists of the field.\n\n[[Discredited HIV/AIDS origins theories]] include several iatrogenic theories, such as the [[OPV AIDS hypothesis|polio vaccine hypothesis]] which argues that the early [[Polio vaccine|oral polio vaccine]]s were contaminated with a chimpanzee virus, leading to the Central African outbreak.<ref name= Lancet>{{cite journal | author = Ramsay S | year = 2001 | title = Cold water downstream from The River | url = http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(00)04536-0/fulltext#article_upsell | journal = The Lancet | volume = 357 | issue = 9265| page = 1343 | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(00)04536-0 }}</ref>\n\n== Pathogenicity of SIV in non-human primates ==\n\nIn most non-human primate species, natural [[simian immunodeficiency virus|SIV]] infection does not cause a fatal disease (but see below).

It starts by stating that up to September 1988, IDU was the risk behaviour in 19,139 (or 26%) of the first 72,223 cases of AIDS in the US.<ref name=Jarlais_1/> Cases among IDUs in New York in the same period numbered 6,182 (approximately a third of national IDU cases). The study continues to outline the [[methodology]] used in the compilation of data. It says that while truly representative samples of IDUs within a community are probably impossible to obtain, samples of IDUs entering treatment provide a good source for monitoring trends. In the results section it states (quoting): \"The first evidence for HIV-1 infection among IV drug users in New York is from three cases of AIDS in children born in 1977.
