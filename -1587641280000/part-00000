Brian built on the achievements of his father, [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorcain]], and especially his elder brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], Brian first made himself [[King of Munster]], then subjugated [[Leinster]], eventually becoming High King of [[Ireland]]. He was the founder of the [[O'Brien dynasty]], and is widely regarded as one of the most successful and unifying monarchs in medieval Ireland.\n\nWith a population of under 500,000 people, Ireland had over 150 kings, with greater or lesser domains.<ref>Donnchadh O Corrain, ''Ireland before the Normans'' (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1972)</ref> The U\u00ed N\u00e9ill king [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]], abandoned by his northern kinsmen of the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] and [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]], acknowledged Brian as High King at [[Athlone]] in 1002. In the decade that followed, Brian campaigned against the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, who refused to accept his claims, against Leinster, where resistance was frequent, and against the [[Norse Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] [[Kingdom of Dublin]].\n\nBrian's hard-won authority was seriously challenged in 1013 when his ally M\u00e1el Sechnaill was attacked by the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain king [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]], with the [[Ulster]]men as his allies. This was followed by further attacks on M\u00e1el Sechnaill by the Dubliners under their king [[Sihtric Silkbeard]] and the Leinstermen led by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Brian campaigned against these enemies in 1013. In 1014, Brian's armies confronted the armies of Leinster and Dublin. The resulting [[Battle of Clontarf]] saw Brian killed, his army nonetheless victorious against the Leinstermen and Norsemen. The battle is widely lauded as an instrumental moment in Irish history, and is well known in popular memory.\n\nBrian was well regarded by contemporary chroniclers. The Norse-Gaels and Scandinavians also produced works mentioning Brian, including ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', and the now-lost ''[[Brj\u00e1ns saga|Brian's Saga]]''. Brian's war against M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sihtric was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to [[Gormlaith ingen Murchada|Gormlaith]], M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], king of Dublin and [[Scandinavian York|York]], then of M\u00e1el Sechnaill, and finally of Brian.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family background===\n[[File:Brain Boru sculpture outside Chapel Royal outside Dublin Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Brian Boru sculpture outside [[Chapel Royal, Dublin]], [[Dublin Castle]]]]\nHe was one of the 12 sons of [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in]] (d. 951), king of [[D\u00e1l gCais]] and king of Tuadmumu ([[Thomond]]), modern [[County Clare]], then a sub-kingdom in the north of [[Munster]]. Cenn\u00e9tig was described as ''r\u00edgdamna Caisil'', meaning that he was either heir or candidate (\"king material\") to the kingship of Cashel or Munster,<ref name=ODNB>Duffy, \"Brian B\u00f3ruma\"</ref> although this might be a later interpolation. Brian's mother was [[B\u00e9 Binn inion Urchadh]], daughter of [[Urchadh mac Murchadh]] (d. 945), king of [[Maigh Se\u00f3la]] in west Connacht.<ref name=Jaski45>Jaski, \"Brian Boru\", p. 45.</ref><ref name=ODNB /> That they belonged to the [[U\u00ed Bri\u00fain Se\u00f3la]] may explain why he received the name Brian, which was rare among the D\u00e1l gCais.<ref name=ODNB />\n\nBrian's family were descended from the Ui Tairdelbach branch of the Dal gCais (or Deis Tuisceart). This branch had recently taken power from the more powerful Ui \u00d3engusso branch which had traditionally supplied the Kings of the Dal gCais. This power shift occurred after the death of Ui \u00d3engusso King Rebechan Mac Mothla who died as King of the Dal gCais in 934. The sons of Brian's grandfather Lorcan seized the opportunity and took power from the rival branch, with Brian's father [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in|Cenn\u00e9tig]] being the most successful of these. His father was the first King of the Dal gCais to lead an army beyond his own territory and lead an expedition as far north as [[Athlone]]. By his death in 951 had been acknowledged as \"King of Tuadmumu\".<ref>Brian Boru and The Battle of Clontarf, Se\u00e1n Duffy</ref> His brother [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]] built on these achievements and was the first to capture [[Rock of Cashel|Cashel]] and become [[King of Munster]].\n\nBrian was born at Kincora, [[Killaloe, County Clare|Killaloe]], a town in the region of Tuadmumu.<ref name=ODNB /> Brian's posthumous cognomen \"B\u00f3ruma\" (anglicised as Boru) may have referred to \"[[Brian Boru's Fort|B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma]]\", a fort north of Killaloe, where the D\u00e1l gCais held sway.<ref name=Jaski45 /><ref name=ODNB /><ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 15, notes that Brian is associated with B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma in a poem attributed to [[C\u00fa\u00e1n \u00faa Lothch\u00e1in]] (d. 1024).</ref> Another explanation, though possibly a late (re-)interpretation, is that the nickname represented Old Irish ''b\u00f3ruma'' \"of the cattle tribute\", referring to his capacity as a powerful overlord.<ref name=Jaski45 />\n\nThe [[River Shannon]] served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of [[Connacht]] and [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]]. Both Brian's father, Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in, and his older brother Mathgamain conducted river-borne raids, in which the young Brian would undoubtedly have participated. This was probably the root of his appreciation for [[navy|naval forces]] in his later career. Thus an important influence upon the Dalcassians was the presence of the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Hiberno-Norse]] city of [[Limerick]] on an [[isthmus]] around which the Shannon River winds (known today as [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]] or the Island Field). The Norse had made many a raid themselves from the Shannon, and the Dalcassians likely benefited from some interaction with them, from which they would have been exposed to innovations such as superior weapons and ship design, all factors that may have contributed to their growing power.\n\nWhen their father died, the kingship of Tuadmumu passed to Brian's older brother, Mathgamain, and, when Mathgamain was killed in 976, Brian replaced him. Subsequently, he became the king of the entire kingdom of Munster.<ref name=McCullough106>McCullough(2002), p.106</ref>\n\n===Reign of his brother, Mathgamain===\nIn 964, Brian's older brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], claimed control over the entire province of Munster by capturing the [[Rock of Cashel]], capital of the ancient [[E\u00f3ganachta]], the hereditary overlords or High Kings of Munster, but who in dynastic strife and with multiple assassinations had weakened themselves to the point they were now impotent. Earlier attacks from both the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] and Vikings were also factors. This situation allowed the illegitimate (from the E\u00f3ganacht perspective) but militarized D\u00e1l Cais to attempt to seize the provincial kingship. Mathgamain was never fully recognized and was opposed throughout his career in the 960s and 970s by [[M\u00e1el Muad mac Brain]], a semi-outsider from the Cashel perspective but still a legitimate E\u00f3ganacht claimant from far south Munster.\n\nIn addition to M\u00e1el Muad, the Norse king [[Ivar of Limerick]] was a threat and may have been attempting to establish some overlordship in the province or a region of it himself, with the ''[[Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib]]'' even asserting he actually achieved this until routed by Mathgamain in the celebrated [[Battle of Sulcoit]] in 967. This victory was not decisive and eventually there grew up a brief alliance of sorts between Mathgamain, M\u00e1el Muad and others to drive the Norse \"soldiers\" or \"officials\" out of Munster and destroy their Limerick fortress in 972.<ref>[[Annals of Inisfallen]], 972</ref> The two Gaelic claimants were soon back to fighting and the fortuitous capture of Mathgamain in 976 by [[Donnub\u00e1n mac Cathail]] allowed him to be effortlessly dispatched or murdered by M\u00e1el Muad, who would now rule as king of Cashel for two years.\n\nThe D\u00e1l Cais remained a powerful force and Brian quickly proved to be as fine a commander of armies as his brother. After first dispatching the already much weakened Ivar in 977, he challenged M\u00e1el Muad in 978 and defeated him in the fateful [[Battle of Belach Lechta]], after which all the E\u00f3ganachta were no longer viable at the provincial level and Brian and the D\u00e1l Cais now enjoyed the overlordship, although not the traditional kingship of the province, which was based on lineage. Either soon before or soon after his victory over M\u00e1el Muad, Brian routed Donnub\u00e1n and the remainder of the Norse army in the [[Battle of Cathair Cuan]], there probably slaying the last of Ivar's sons and successor Aralt. He then allowed some of the Norse to remain in their settlement, but they were wealthy and now central to trade in the region, with a fleet of great value.\n\n[[Cian mac M\u00e1elmuaid|Cian]], the son of his brother Mathgamain's sworn enemy M\u00e1el Muad, later became a loyal ally of Brian and served under him in a number of campaigns.\n\n===Extending authority===\n[[File:Brian Boru Banner.jpg|thumb|left|Banner reputedly used by Brian <ref>Sir Lee MacMahon, ' Some Celtic Tribal Heraldry and Ancient Arms of Ireland, ' Irish-American Genealogist. The Augustan Society: Torrance, CA. Annual 1979. Pp. 256-259.</ref> of which the Clare GAA colors are based.]]\nHaving established unchallenged rule over his home Province of Munster, Brian turned to extending his authority over the neighboring provinces of [[Leinster]] to the east and Connacht to the north. By doing so, he came into conflict with High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] whose power base was the Province of [[Meath (province)|Meath]].\n\nFor the next fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill repeatedly led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, like his father and brother before him, led his naval forces up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath on either side of the river. He suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but appears to have learned from his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career: the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland's coast. Brian's naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control, provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a [[Pincer movement|strategic pincer]], the army forming the other arm.\n\nIn 996 Brian finally managed to control the province of [[Leinster]], which may have been what led M\u00e1el Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. By recognising Brian's authority over ''[[Leth Moga]]'', that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), M\u00e1el Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over ''[[Leth Cuinn]]'', that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, [[Connacht]], and [[Ulster]].\n\nPrecisely because he had submitted to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Given the circumstances under which M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda had been appointed, it is not surprising that he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.\n\nIn response, Brian assembled the forces of the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's ally and cousin, [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]]. Together M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian's army in battle rather than risk a [[siege]]. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the [[Battle of Glenmama]]. The [[Irish annals]] all agree that this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Sulcoit]] thirty-two years before, by capturing and [[Looting|sacking]] the enemy's city.\n\nOnce again Brian opted for reconciliation; he requested Sigtrygg to return and resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, just as he had with the Eoganacht King, Cian. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg's mother and M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister [[Gormflaith]], the former wife of M\u00e1el Sechnaill.\n\n===The struggle for Ireland===\n[[File:The history of Ireland - from the earliest period to the present time; derived from native annals, and from the researches of Dr. O'Donovan, Eugene Curry, C. P. Meehan, R. R. Madden, and other eminent (14784629332).jpg|thumb|Engraving of Brian (1884)]]\nBrian made it clear that his ambitions had not been satisfied by the compromise of 997 when, in the year 1000, he led a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army in an attack on High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]]'s home province of Meath. The struggle over who would control all of Ireland was renewed. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's most important ally was the [[King of Connacht]], [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (O'Connor), but this presented a number of problems. The provinces of Meath and Connacht were separated by the Shannon River, which served as both a route by which Brian's naval forces could attack the shores of either province and as a barrier to the two rulers providing mutual support for each other. M\u00e1el Sechnaill came up with an ingenious solution; two bridges would be erected across the Shannon. These bridges would serve as both obstacles preventing Brian's fleet from traveling up the Shannon and a means by which the armies of the provinces of Meath and Connacht could cross over into each other's kingdoms.\n\nThe Annals state that, in the year 1002, M\u00e1el Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about how or why this came about. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' provides a story in which Brian challenges High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill to a battle at the [[Hill of Tara]] in the province of Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. M\u00e1el Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.\n\nThere have been some doubts expressed about this explanation, given Brian's style of engaging in war; if he had found his opponent at a disadvantage it is most likely he would  have taken full advantage of it rather than allowing his enemy the time to even the odds. Also, given the length and intensity of the struggle between M\u00e1el Sechnaill and Brian, it seems unlikely that the High King would surrender his title without a fight. It is generally accepted that in 1002 Brian became the new High King of Ireland.\n\nUnlike some who had previously held the title, Brian intended to be High King in more than name. To accomplish this he needed to impose his will upon the regional rulers of the only province that did not already recognise his authority, [[Ulster]].\n\nUlster's geography presented a formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, and all three favoured the defenders. Brian first had to find a means of getting through or around these defensive [[choke point]]s, and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.\n\n===High King===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nIt was during this process that Brian pursued an alternative means of consolidating his control, not merely over the province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the [[Christianity in Ireland|Church in Ireland]] was centred, not around the bishops of [[diocese]]s and archbishops of [[archdiocese]]s, but rather around [[monastery|monasteries]] headed by powerful abbots who were members of the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was [[Armagh]], located in the Province of Ulster.\n\nBrian's advisor, [[Maelsuthain O'Carroll]], documented in the '[[Book of Armagh]]' that, in the year 1005, Brian donated 22 ounces of gold to this monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland, to which all other monasteries should send the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King. Therefore, it was in the interest of Armagh to support Brian with all their wealth and power.\n\nBrian is not referred to in the passage from the 'Book of Armagh' as the 'Ard R\u00ed' \u2014that is, High-King\u2014 but rather he is declared \"''Imperator Scottorum'',\" or \"Emperor of the Gaels\".\n\nThough it is only speculation, it has been suggested that Brian and the Church in Ireland were together seeking to establish a new form of kingship in Ireland, one that was modelled after the kingships of England and France, in which there were no lesser ranks of regional kings \u2013 simply one king who had (or sought to have) power over all in a [[unitary state]]. In any case, whether as High King or Emperor, by 1011 all of the regional rulers in Ireland acknowledged Brian's authority. No sooner had this been achieved than it was lost again.\n\n[[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] had only accepted Brian's authority grudgingly, and in 1012 he rose in rebellion. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' relates a story in which one of Brian's sons insults M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda, which leads him to declare his independence from Brian's authority. Whatever the actual reason was, M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought allies with which to defy the High-King. He found one in a regional ruler in Ulster who had only recently submitted to Brian. Together they attacked the province of Meath, where the former High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill sought Brian's help to defend his kingdom.\n\nIn 1013 Brian led a force from his own province of Munster and from southern Connacht into Leinster; a detachment under his son Murchad ravaged the southern half of the province of Leinster for three months. The forces under Murchad and Brian were reunited on 9 September outside the walls of Dublin. The city was blockaded, but it was the High King's army that ran out of supplies first, so that Brian was forced to abandon the siege and return to Munster around [[Christmas]].\n\n===Battle of Clontarf===\n{{Main|Battle of Clontarf}}\n[[File:'Battle of Clontarf', oil on canvas painting by Hugh Frazer, 1826.jpg|300px|thumb|Oil painting of Battle of Clontarf by [[Hugh Frazer (artist)|Hugh Frazer]] 1826]]\nM\u00e1el M\u00f3rda was aware that the High King would return to Dublin in 1014 to try once more to defeat him. He may have hoped that by defying Brian, he could enlist the aid of all the other regional rulers. If so, he was sorely disappointed.  The province of Ulster and most of the province of Connacht failed to support either side of the conflict, with the exception of a single ruler in Ulster who sent troops to M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. His inability to obtain troops from any rulers in Ireland, may explain why M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought support from rulers outside Ireland. He instructed his subordinate and cousin, Sigtrygg, the ruler of Dublin, to travel overseas to enlist aid.\n\nSigtrygg sailed to [[Orkney]], and on his return stopped at the [[Isle of Man]]. These islands had been occupied by the Vikings long before and the Hiberno-Norse had close ties with Orkney and the Isle of Man. There was even a precedent for employing Norsemen from the isles; they had been used by Sigtrygg's father, [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], in 980, and by Sigtrygg himself in 990. Their incentive was loot, not land.\n\nContrary to the assertions made in the ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'', this was not an attempt by the Vikings to reconquer Ireland. All of the Norsemen, both the [[Norse-Gaels]] of Dublin and the Norsemen from the Isles, were in the service of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. The High King had 'Vikings' in his army as well:  the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick and probably those of Waterford, Wexford, and Cork as well. Some sources include a rival gang of Norse mercenaries from the Isle of Man.  Essentially this conflict was an Irish civil war with minor foreign participation.<ref name=McCullough109>McCullough(2002), p.109</ref>\n\nAlong with whatever troops he obtained from abroad, Brian mustered troops from his home province of Munster, southern Connacht, and the province of Meath, commanded by his old rival M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill. Brian's army may have outnumbered M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's, since Brian felt secure enough to dispatch a mounted detachment under the command of his youngest son, Donnchad, to raid southern Leinster, presumably hoping to force M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda to release his contingents from there to return to defend their homes.\n\nA disagreement with the King of Meath resulted in M\u00e1el Sechnaill withdrawing his support. Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad and ask him to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian's problems, the Norse contingents, led by [[Sigurd Hlodvirsson]], [[Earl of Orkney]] and [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of the Isle of Man, arrived on [[Palm Sunday]], 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on [[Good Friday]], 23 April 1014 just north of the city of [[Dublin]], at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]].<ref name=McCullough111>McCullough(2002), p.111</ref>\n\n[[File:07 Brian on the Morning of Clontarf.jpg|thumb|Brian on the Morning of Clontarf]]\n[[File:St Patrick's (COI) Cathedral, Armagh 087.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Brian Boru's burial place in St. Patrick's Cathedral, (COI), Armagh]]\n\nAll of the accounts state that the [[Battle of Clontarf]] lasted all day.

Recent research has suggested that it might have been commissioned by Muirchertach's contemporary and cousin, Brian Glinne Maidhir, or at least someone favourable to the line descended from Brian's son, Donnchad.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Casey|first=Denis|year=2013|title=A reconsideration of the authorship and transmission of Cogadh Gaedhel re Gallaibh.|jstor=42751271|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy, Section C|volume=113C|pages=139\u201361|via=}}</ref>\n\nThe influence of this book on both scholarly and popular authors cannot be exaggerated. Until the 1970s most scholarly writing concerning the Vikings' activities in Ireland, as well as the career of Brian Boru, accepted the claims of ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'' at face value.\n\nWhile Brian did not free Ireland from a Norse ([[Vikings|Viking]]) occupation, simply because it was never entirely conquered by the Vikings, his rule saw consistent conflict against Vikings and Viking-founded settlements, the latter all having been founded to give raiders easier access to the interior of Ireland. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, beginning in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. Within only a few generations, some Norse had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and had often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.<ref name=\"Campbell2013\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Kenneth L.|title=Ireland's History: Prehistory to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaBOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT46|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-6784-0|pages=46\u201351}}</ref>\n\nSuch Hiberno-Norse cities occupied a tenuous position within Ireland's political scene long before the birth of Brian. They often suffered attacks from Irish rulers, and made alliances with others. The Norse, who initially attacked and subsequently settled in Ireland, were partially assimilated by the Irish.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Newman |first=Roger Chatterton |title=Brian Boru: King of Ireland |location=Dublin |publisher=Anvil Books |year=1983|page=92|isbn=978-1-85635-719-7 }}</ref> However, Brian's father was likely slain by the Norse of Limerick and he himself died during a revolt that was supported by multiple Viking leaders, specifically the Norse of Mann.\n\n==Wives and children==\nBrian's first wife was M\u00f3r, daughter of the King of [[U\u00ed Fiachrach Aidne]] of Connacht. She is said to have been the mother of his sons Murchad, Conchobar and Flann. Later genealogies claimed that these sons left no descendants, although in fact Murchad's son Tadc is recorded as being killed at Clontarf along with his father and grandfather.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 31; Duffy.</ref>\n\nAnother wife, Echrad, was a daughter of Carlus mac Ailella, King of U\u00ed \u00c1eda Odba, an obscure branch of the southern [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]]. She was the mother of Brian's son [[Tadc mac Briain|Tadc]], whose son [[Toirdelbach Ua Briain|Toirdelbach]] and grandson [[Muirchertach Ua Briain|Muirchertach]] rivalled Brian in power and fame.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 32; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian's most famous marriage was with [[Gormflaith ingen Murchada|Gormflaith]], sister of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda of Leinster. [[Donnchad mac Briain|Donnchad]], who had his half-brother Tadc killed in 1023 and ruled Munster for 40 years thereafter, was the result of this union.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, pp. 31\u201332; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian had a sixth son, Domnall. Although he predeceased his father, Domnall apparently had at least one surviving child, a son whose name is not recorded. Domnall may perhaps have been the son of Brian's fourth known wife, Dub Choblaig, who died in 1009. She was a daughter of King [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] of Connacht.<ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, pp. 31 & 32\u201333; Duffy.</ref>\n\nBrian had at least three daughters, but their mothers are not recorded. Sadb, whose death in 1048 is recorded by the ''Annals of Innisfallen'', was married to [[Cian mac M\u00e1el Muaid|Cian]], son of [[M\u00e1el Muad mac Brain]]. B\u00e9 Binn was married to the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill king [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]].

Brian built on the achievements of his father, [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorcain]], and especially his elder brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], Brian first made himself [[King of Munster]], then subjugated [[Leinster]], eventually becoming High King of [[Ireland]]. He was the founder of the [[O'Brien dynasty]], and is widely regarded as one of the most successful and unifying monarchs in medieval Ireland.\n\nWith a population of under 500,000 people, Ireland had over 150 kings, with greater or lesser domains.<ref>Donnchadh O Corrain, ''Ireland before the Normans'' (Dublin: Gill and Macmillan, 1972)</ref> The U\u00ed N\u00e9ill king [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]], abandoned by his northern kinsmen of the [[Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain]] and [[Cen\u00e9l Conaill]], acknowledged Brian as High King at [[Athlone]] in 1002. In the decade that followed, Brian campaigned against the northern U\u00ed N\u00e9ill, who refused to accept his claims, against Leinster, where resistance was frequent, and against the [[Norse Gaels|Norse-Gaelic]] [[Kingdom of Dublin]].\n\nBrian's hard-won authority was seriously challenged in 1013 when his ally M\u00e1el Sechnaill was attacked by the Cen\u00e9l nE\u00f3gain king [[Flaithbertach Ua N\u00e9ill]], with the [[Ulster]]men as his allies. This was followed by further attacks on M\u00e1el Sechnaill by the Dubliners under their king [[Sihtric Silkbeard]] and the Leinstermen led by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Brian campaigned against these enemies in 1013. In 1014, Brian's armies confronted the armies of Leinster and Dublin. The resulting [[Battle of Clontarf]] saw Brian killed, his army nonetheless victorious against the Leinstermen and Norsemen. The battle is widely lauded as an instrumental moment in Irish history, and is well known in popular memory.\n\nBrian was well regarded by contemporary chroniclers. The Norse-Gaels and Scandinavians also produced works mentioning Brian, including ''[[Njal's Saga]]'', the ''[[Orkneyinga Saga]]'', and the now-lost ''[[Brj\u00e1ns saga|Brian's Saga]]''. Brian's war against M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sihtric was to be inextricably connected with his complicated marital relations, in particular his marriage to [[Gormlaith ingen Murchada|Gormlaith]], M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister and Sihtric's mother, who had been in turn the wife of [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], king of Dublin and [[Scandinavian York|York]], then of M\u00e1el Sechnaill, and finally of Brian.\n\n==Biography==\n===Family background===\n[[File:Brain Boru sculpture outside Chapel Royal outside Dublin Castle.JPG|thumb|left|Brian Boru sculpture outside [[Chapel Royal, Dublin]], [[Dublin Castle]]]]\nHe was one of the 12 sons of [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in]] (d. 951), king of [[D\u00e1l gCais]] and king of Tuadmumu ([[Thomond]]), modern [[County Clare]], then a sub-kingdom in the north of [[Munster]].

This branch had recently taken power from the more powerful Ui \u00d3engusso branch which had traditionally supplied the Kings of the Dal gCais. This power shift occurred after the death of Ui \u00d3engusso King Rebechan Mac Mothla who died as King of the Dal gCais in 934. The sons of Brian's grandfather Lorcan seized the opportunity and took power from the rival branch, with Brian's father [[Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in|Cenn\u00e9tig]] being the most successful of these. His father was the first King of the Dal gCais to lead an army beyond his own territory and lead an expedition as far north as [[Athlone]]. By his death in 951 had been acknowledged as \"King of Tuadmumu\".<ref>Brian Boru and The Battle of Clontarf, Se\u00e1n Duffy</ref> His brother [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]] built on these achievements and was the first to capture [[Rock of Cashel|Cashel]] and become [[King of Munster]].\n\nBrian was born at Kincora, [[Killaloe, County Clare|Killaloe]], a town in the region of Tuadmumu.<ref name=ODNB /> Brian's posthumous cognomen \"B\u00f3ruma\" (anglicised as Boru) may have referred to \"[[Brian Boru's Fort|B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma]]\", a fort north of Killaloe, where the D\u00e1l gCais held sway.<ref name=Jaski45 /><ref name=ODNB /><ref>N\u00ed Mhaonaigh, p. 15, notes that Brian is associated with B\u00e9al B\u00f3ruma in a poem attributed to [[C\u00fa\u00e1n \u00faa Lothch\u00e1in]] (d. 1024).</ref> Another explanation, though possibly a late (re-)interpretation, is that the nickname represented Old Irish ''b\u00f3ruma'' \"of the cattle tribute\", referring to his capacity as a powerful overlord.<ref name=Jaski45 />\n\nThe [[River Shannon]] served as an easy route by which raids could be made against the provinces of [[Connacht]] and [[Kingdom of Mide|Meath]]. Both Brian's father, Cenn\u00e9tig mac Lorc\u00e1in, and his older brother Mathgamain conducted river-borne raids, in which the young Brian would undoubtedly have participated. This was probably the root of his appreciation for [[navy|naval forces]] in his later career. Thus an important influence upon the Dalcassians was the presence of the [[Norse\u2013Gaels|Hiberno-Norse]] city of [[Limerick]] on an [[isthmus]] around which the Shannon River winds (known today as [[King's Island, Limerick|King's Island]] or the Island Field). The Norse had made many a raid themselves from the Shannon, and the Dalcassians likely benefited from some interaction with them, from which they would have been exposed to innovations such as superior weapons and ship design, all factors that may have contributed to their growing power.\n\nWhen their father died, the kingship of Tuadmumu passed to Brian's older brother, Mathgamain, and, when Mathgamain was killed in 976, Brian replaced him. Subsequently, he became the king of the entire kingdom of Munster.<ref name=McCullough106>McCullough(2002), p.106</ref>\n\n===Reign of his brother, Mathgamain===\nIn 964, Brian's older brother, [[Mathgamain mac Cenn\u00e9tig|Mathgamain]], claimed control over the entire province of Munster by capturing the [[Rock of Cashel]], capital of the ancient [[E\u00f3ganachta]], the hereditary overlords or High Kings of Munster, but who in dynastic strife and with multiple assassinations had weakened themselves to the point they were now impotent. Earlier attacks from both the [[U\u00ed N\u00e9ill]] and Vikings were also factors. This situation allowed the illegitimate (from the E\u00f3ganacht perspective) but militarized D\u00e1l Cais to attempt to seize the provincial kingship. Mathgamain was never fully recognized and was opposed throughout his career in the 960s and 970s by [[M\u00e1el Muad mac Brain]], a semi-outsider from the Cashel perspective but still a legitimate E\u00f3ganacht claimant from far south Munster.\n\nIn addition to M\u00e1el Muad, the Norse king [[Ivar of Limerick]] was a threat and may have been attempting to establish some overlordship in the province or a region of it himself, with the ''[[Cogad Gaedel re Gallaib]]'' even asserting he actually achieved this until routed by Mathgamain in the celebrated [[Battle of Sulcoit]] in 967. This victory was not decisive and eventually there grew up a brief alliance of sorts between Mathgamain, M\u00e1el Muad and others to drive the Norse \"soldiers\" or \"officials\" out of Munster and destroy their Limerick fortress in 972.<ref>[[Annals of Inisfallen]], 972</ref> The two Gaelic claimants were soon back to fighting and the fortuitous capture of Mathgamain in 976 by [[Donnub\u00e1n mac Cathail]] allowed him to be effortlessly dispatched or murdered by M\u00e1el Muad, who would now rule as king of Cashel for two years.\n\nThe D\u00e1l Cais remained a powerful force and Brian quickly proved to be as fine a commander of armies as his brother. After first dispatching the already much weakened Ivar in 977, he challenged M\u00e1el Muad in 978 and defeated him in the fateful [[Battle of Belach Lechta]], after which all the E\u00f3ganachta were no longer viable at the provincial level and Brian and the D\u00e1l Cais now enjoyed the overlordship, although not the traditional kingship of the province, which was based on lineage. Either soon before or soon after his victory over M\u00e1el Muad, Brian routed Donnub\u00e1n and the remainder of the Norse army in the [[Battle of Cathair Cuan]], there probably slaying the last of Ivar's sons and successor Aralt. He then allowed some of the Norse to remain in their settlement, but they were wealthy and now central to trade in the region, with a fleet of great value.\n\n[[Cian mac M\u00e1elmuaid|Cian]], the son of his brother Mathgamain's sworn enemy M\u00e1el Muad, later became a loyal ally of Brian and served under him in a number of campaigns.\n\n===Extending authority===\n[[File:Brian_Boru_Banner.jpg|thumb|left|Banner reputedly used by Brian <ref>Sir Lee MacMahon, ' Some Celtic Tribal Heraldry and Ancient Arms of Ireland, ' Irish-American Genealogist. The Augustan Society: Torrance, CA. Annual 1979. Pp. 256-259.</ref> of which the Clare GAA colors are based.]]\nHaving established unchallenged rule over his home Province of Munster, Brian turned to extending his authority over the neighboring provinces of [[Leinster]] to the east and Connacht to the north. By doing so, he came into conflict with High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]] whose power base was the Province of [[Meath (province)|Meath]].\n\nFor the next fifteen years, from 982 to 997, High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill repeatedly led armies into Leinster and Munster, while Brian, like his father and brother before him, led his naval forces up the Shannon to attack Connacht and Meath on either side of the river. He suffered quite a few reverses in this struggle, but appears to have learned from his setbacks. He developed a military strategy that would serve him well throughout his career: the coordinated use of forces on both land and water, including on rivers and along Ireland's coast. Brian's naval forces, which included contingents supplied by the Hiberno-Norse cities that he brought under his control, provided both indirect and direct support for his forces on land. Indirect support involved a fleet making a diversionary attack on an enemy in a location far away from where Brian planned to strike with his army. Direct support involved naval forces acting as one arm in a [[Pincer movement|strategic pincer]], the army forming the other arm.\n\nIn 996 Brian finally managed to control the province of [[Leinster]], which may have been what led M\u00e1el Sechnaill to reach a compromise with him in the following year. By recognising Brian's authority over ''[[Leth Moga]]'', that is, the Southern Half, which included the Provinces of Munster and Leinster (and the Hiberno-Norse cities within them), M\u00e1el Sechnaill was simply accepting the reality that confronted him and retained control over ''[[Leth Cuinn]]'', that is, the Northern Half, which consisted of the Provinces of Meath, [[Connacht]], and [[Ulster]].\n\nPrecisely because he had submitted to Brian's authority, the King of Leinster was overthrown in 998 and replaced by [[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]]. Given the circumstances under which M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda had been appointed, it is not surprising that he launched an open rebellion against Brian's authority.\n\nIn response, Brian assembled the forces of the Province of Munster with the intention of laying siege to the Hiberno-Norse city of Dublin, which was ruled by M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's ally and cousin, [[Sigtrygg Silkbeard]]. Together M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda and Sigtrygg determined to meet Brian's army in battle rather than risk a [[siege]]. Thus, in 999, the opposing armies fought the [[Battle of Glenmama]]. The [[Irish annals]] all agree that this was a particularly fierce and bloody engagement, although claims that it lasted from morning until midnight, or that the combined Leinster-Dublin force lost 4,000 killed are open to question. In any case, Brian followed up his victory, as he and his brother had in the aftermath of the [[Battle of Sulcoit]] thirty-two years before, by capturing and [[Looting|sacking]] the enemy's city.\n\nOnce again Brian opted for reconciliation; he requested Sigtrygg to return and resume his position as ruler of Dublin, giving Sigtrygg the hand of one of his daughters in marriage, just as he had with the Eoganacht King, Cian. It may have been on this occasion that Brian married Sigtrygg's mother and M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's sister [[Gormflaith]], the former wife of M\u00e1el Sechnaill.\n\n===The struggle for Ireland===\n[[File:The history of Ireland - from the earliest period to the present time; derived from native annals, and from the researches of Dr. O'Donovan, Eugene Curry, C. P. Meehan, R. R. Madden, and other eminent (14784629332).jpg|thumb|Engraving of Brian (1884)]]\nBrian made it clear that his ambitions had not been satisfied by the compromise of 997 when, in the year 1000, he led a combined Munster-Leinster-Dublin army in an attack on High King [[M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill]]'s home province of Meath. The struggle over who would control all of Ireland was renewed. M\u00e1el Sechnaill's most important ally was the [[King of Connacht]], [[Cathal mac Conchobar mac Taidg]] (O'Connor), but this presented a number of problems. The provinces of Meath and Connacht were separated by the Shannon River, which served as both a route by which Brian's naval forces could attack the shores of either province and as a barrier to the two rulers providing mutual support for each other. M\u00e1el Sechnaill came up with an ingenious solution; two bridges would be erected across the Shannon. These bridges would serve as both obstacles preventing Brian's fleet from traveling up the Shannon and a means by which the armies of the provinces of Meath and Connacht could cross over into each other's kingdoms.\n\nThe Annals state that, in the year 1002, M\u00e1el Sechnaill surrendered his title to Brian, although they do not say anything about how or why this came about. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' provides a story in which Brian challenges High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill to a battle at the [[Hill of Tara]] in the province of Meath, but the High King requests a month-long truce so that he can mobilise his forces, which Brian grants him. M\u00e1el Sechnaill fails to rally the regional rulers who are nominally his subordinates by the time the deadline arrives, and he is forced to surrender his title to Brian.\n\nThere have been some doubts expressed about this explanation, given Brian's style of engaging in war; if he had found his opponent at a disadvantage it is most likely he would  have taken full advantage of it rather than allowing his enemy the time to even the odds. Also, given the length and intensity of the struggle between M\u00e1el Sechnaill and Brian, it seems unlikely that the High King would surrender his title without a fight. It is generally accepted that in 1002 Brian became the new High King of Ireland.\n\nUnlike some who had previously held the title, Brian intended to be High King in more than name. To accomplish this he needed to impose his will upon the regional rulers of the only province that did not already recognise his authority, [[Ulster]].\n\nUlster's geography presented a formidable challenge. There were three main routes by which an invading army could enter the province, and all three favoured the defenders. Brian first had to find a means of getting through or around these defensive [[choke point]]s, and then he had to subdue the fiercely independent regional Kings of Ulster. It took Brian ten years of campaigning to achieve his goal, which, considering that he could and did call on all of the military forces of the rest of Ireland, indicates how formidable the Kings of Ulster were. Once again, it was his coordinated use of forces on land and at sea that allowed him to triumph; while the rulers of Ulster could bring the advance of Brian's army to a halt, they could not prevent his fleet from attacking the shores of their kingdoms. Once Brian entered the province of Ulster, he systematically defeated each of the regional rulers who defied him, forcing them to recognise him as their overlord.\n\n===High King===\n{{unreferenced section|date=April 2020}}\nIt was during this process that Brian pursued an alternative means of consolidating his control, not merely over the province of Ulster, but over Ireland as a whole. In contrast to its structure elsewhere, the [[Christianity in Ireland|Church in Ireland]] was centred, not around the bishops of [[diocese]]s and archbishops of [[archdiocese]]s, but rather around [[monastery|monasteries]] headed by powerful abbots who were members of the royal dynasties of the lands in which their monasteries resided. Among the most important monasteries was [[Armagh]], located in the Province of Ulster.\n\nBrian's advisor, [[Maelsuthain O'Carroll]], documented in the '[[Book of Armagh]]' that, in the year 1005, Brian donated 22 ounces of gold to this monastery and declared that Armagh was the religious capital of Ireland, to which all other monasteries should send the funds they collected. This was a clever move, for the supremacy of the monastery of Armagh would last only so long as Brian remained the High King. Therefore, it was in the interest of Armagh to support Brian with all their wealth and power.\n\nBrian is not referred to in the passage from the 'Book of Armagh' as the 'Ard R\u00ed' &mdash;that is, High-King&mdash; but rather he is declared \"''Imperator Scottorum'',\" or \"Emperor of the Gaels\".\n\nThough it is only speculation, it has been suggested that Brian and the Church in Ireland were together seeking to establish a new form of kingship in Ireland, one that was modelled after the kingships of England and France, in which there were no lesser ranks of regional kings &ndash; simply one king who had (or sought to have) power over all in a [[unitary state]]. In any case, whether as High King or Emperor, by 1011 all of the regional rulers in Ireland acknowledged Brian's authority. No sooner had this been achieved than it was lost again.\n\n[[M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda mac Murchada]] of [[Leinster]] had only accepted Brian's authority grudgingly, and in 1012 he rose in rebellion. The ''[[Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh]]'' relates a story in which one of Brian's sons insults M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda, which leads him to declare his independence from Brian's authority. Whatever the actual reason was, M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought allies with which to defy the High-King. He found one in a regional ruler in Ulster who had only recently submitted to Brian. Together they attacked the province of Meath, where the former High King M\u00e1el Sechnaill sought Brian's help to defend his kingdom.\n\nIn 1013 Brian led a force from his own province of Munster and from southern Connacht into Leinster; a detachment under his son Murchad ravaged the southern half of the province of Leinster for three months. The forces under Murchad and Brian were reunited on 9 September outside the walls of Dublin. The city was blockaded, but it was the High King's army that ran out of supplies first, so that Brian was forced to abandon the siege and return to Munster around [[Christmas]].\n\n===Battle of Clontarf===\n{{Main|Battle of Clontarf}}\n[[File:'Battle of Clontarf', oil on canvas painting by Hugh Frazer, 1826.jpg|300px|thumb|Oil painting of Battle of Clontarf by [[Hugh Frazer (artist)|Hugh Frazer]] 1826]]\nM\u00e1el M\u00f3rda was aware that the High King would return to Dublin in 1014 to try once more to defeat him. He may have hoped that by defying Brian, he could enlist the aid of all the other regional rulers. If so, he was sorely disappointed.  The province of Ulster and most of the province of Connacht failed to support either side of the conflict, with the exception of a single ruler in Ulster who sent troops to M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. His inability to obtain troops from any rulers in Ireland, may explain why M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda sought support from rulers outside Ireland. He instructed his subordinate and cousin, Sigtrygg, the ruler of Dublin, to travel overseas to enlist aid.\n\nSigtrygg sailed to [[Orkney]], and on his return stopped at the [[Isle of Man]]. These islands had been occupied by the Vikings long before and the Hiberno-Norse had close ties with Orkney and the Isle of Man. There was even a precedent for employing Norsemen from the isles; they had been used by Sigtrygg's father, [[Amla\u00edb Cuar\u00e1n]], in 980, and by Sigtrygg himself in 990. Their incentive was loot, not land.\n\nContrary to the assertions made in the ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'', this was not an attempt by the Vikings to reconquer Ireland. All of the Norsemen, both the [[Norse-Gaels]] of Dublin and the Norsemen from the Isles, were in the service of M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda. The High King had 'Vikings' in his army as well:  the Hiberno-Norse of Limerick and probably those of Waterford, Wexford, and Cork as well. Some sources include a rival gang of Norse mercenaries from the Isle of Man.  Essentially this conflict was an Irish civil war with minor foreign participation.<ref name=McCullough109>McCullough(2002), p.109</ref>\n\nAlong with whatever troops he obtained from abroad, Brian mustered troops from his home province of Munster, southern Connacht, and the province of Meath, commanded by his old rival M\u00e1el Sechnaill mac Domnaill. Brian's army may have outnumbered M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda's, since Brian felt secure enough to dispatch a mounted detachment under the command of his youngest son, Donnchad, to raid southern Leinster, presumably hoping to force M\u00e1el M\u00f3rda to release his contingents from there to return to defend their homes.\n\nA disagreement with the King of Meath resulted in M\u00e1el Sechnaill withdrawing his support. Brian sent a messenger to find Donnchad and ask him to return with his detachment, but the call for help came too late. To compound Brian's problems, the Norse contingents, led by [[Sigurd Hlodvirsson]], [[Earl of Orkney]] and [[Brodir and Ospak of Man|Brodir]] of the Isle of Man, arrived on [[Palm Sunday]], 18 April. The battle occurred five days later, on [[Good Friday]], 23 April 1014 just north of the city of [[Dublin]], at [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]].<ref name=McCullough111>McCullough(2002), p.111</ref>\n\n[[File:07 Brian on the Morning of Clontarf.jpg|thumb|Brian on the Morning of Clontarf]]\n[[File:St Patrick's (COI) Cathedral, Armagh 087.jpg|thumb|Plaque at Brian Boru's burial place in St. Patrick's Cathedral, (COI), Armagh]]\n\nAll of the accounts state that the [[Battle of Clontarf]] lasted all day.

This work is thought to have been commissioned by Brian's great-grandson [[Muirchertach Ua Briain]] as a means of justifying the Ua Briain claim to the High-Kingship, a title upon which the U\u00ed Neill had had a near-monopoly.

Until the 1970s most scholarly writing concerning the Vikings' activities in Ireland, as well as the career of Brian Boru, accepted the claims of ''Cogadh Gaedhil re Gallaibh'' at face value.\n\nWhile Brian did not free Ireland from a Norse ([[Vikings|Viking]]) occupation, simply because it was never entirely conquered by the Vikings, his rule saw consistent conflict against Vikings and Viking-founded settlements, the latter all having been founded to give raiders easier access to the interior of Ireland. In the last decade of the 8th century, Norse raiders began attacking targets in Ireland and, beginning in the mid-9th century, these raiders established the fortified camps that later grew into Ireland's first cities: [[Dublin]], [[Limerick]], [[Waterford]], [[Wexford]], and [[Cork (city)|Cork]]. Within only a few generations, some Norse had converted to Christianity, intermarried with the Irish, and had often adopted the Irish language, dress and customs, thus becoming what historians refer to as the Hiberno-Norse.<ref name=\"Campbell2013\">{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=Kenneth L.|title=Ireland's History: Prehistory to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EaBOAQAAQBAJ&pg=PT46|date=5 December 2013|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4725-6784-0|pages=46\u201351}}</ref>\n\nSuch Hiberno-Norse cities occupied a tenuous position within Ireland's political scene long before the birth of Brian.

She is said to have been the mother of his sons Murchad, Conchobar and Flann.

Although he predeceased his father, Domnall apparently had at least one surviving child, a son whose name is not recorded.

His version supports the contention that Brian died while praying in his tent.\n\nThe story of Brian Boru's final battle and death is told in [[Frank Delaney]]'s novel ''Ireland'' (2005).\n\nThe second volume of [[Brian Wood (comics)|Brian Wood]]'s [[Vertigo (DC Comics)|Vertigo]] graphic novel series ''[[Northlanders]]'' (2007\u20132012) is set against a backdrop of Viking \"occupation\" of Ireland, including the [[Battle of Clontarf]].\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Listen|filename=Brian Boru's March (U.S. Marine Band).ogg|title=Brian Boru's March|description=''Brian Boru's March'' performed by military band.}}\nHis name is remembered in the title of one of the oldest tunes in Ireland's traditional repertoire: \"[[Brian Boru's March]]\". It is still widely played by traditional Irish musicians.\n\nHe was the subject of at least two operas: ''Brian Boroihme'' (1810) by [[Johann Bernhard Logier]] (1777\u20131846) and ''Brian Boru'' (1896) by [[Julian Edwards]] (1855\u20131910).\n\nHis burial in St Patrick's Cathedral is referenced in the song \"Boys from the County Armagh\" by [[Thomas P. Keenan]] (1866\u20131927).\n\n===Film and television===\n\nIn the Disney film ''[[Darby O'Gill and the Little People]]'' (1959), King Brian Conners of the [[Leprechaun]]s shows Darby the sword Brian Boru used to drive out the [[Danish people|Danes]] ([[Vikings]]).\n\nThe character of [[Miles O'Brien (Star Trek)|Miles O'Brien]] in the science fiction television show ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' (1993\u20131999) says that he is a direct descendant of Brian Boru in the fourth season episode \"[[Bar Association (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Bar Association]]\".\n\nIn an episode of the TV series ''[[Relic Hunter]]'' (1999\u20132002) a search is made for the missing crown of \"the last king of Ireland\", Brian Boru.\n\n===Sports===\n\nTop class racehorse [[Brian Boru (horse)|Brian Boru]] was named in honour of the high king. The horse won two Group 1 races, the [[Racing Post Trophy]] as a two-year old and the [[St Leger]] as a three-year old.\n\nMany [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] clubs have been named after Brian Boru.\n\nProfessional wrestler [[Sheamus]] has referenced Brian several times while cutting promos as part of his character, King Sheamus.\n\n===Other===\n\nThe exhumation of Brian Boru's remains were the subject of a 'learned' article on 1 April 2014 - a well-constructed [[April Fools' Day]] hoax.<ref name=BoruHoax>{{cite web|title=High King in the Cathedral: Body of Brian Boru Uncovered?|url=http://voxhiberionacum.wordpress.com/2014/04/01/brian-boru-uncovered/|publisher=vox hiberionacum|accessdate=19 April 2014}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n*[[Annals of Tigernach]]\n*[[Annals of Ulster]]\n*[[Early Medieval Ireland 800\u20131166]]\n*[[History of Ireland]]\n*[[Irish kings]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Secondary sources===\n*{{Cite book|title=Wars of the Irish Kings: A Thousand Years of Struggle, from the Age of Myth Through the Reign of Queen Elizabeth I |first=David Willis |last=McCullough|publisher= Random House |year= 2002 |ISBN= 978-0-609-80907-5 }}\n*{{Cite encyclopedia |last=Jaski |first=Bart |year=2005 |title=Brian Boru (926[?]\u20131014) |editor=Se\u00e1n Duffy |encyclopedia=Medieval Ireland.

Looking back at Potter's life, the composer and academic [[George Macfarren|Sir George Macfarren]] observed in 1884 that Potter's temporary residence in continental Europe was \"as much for the purpose of study as for the sake of obtaining experience of other musical performances than were to be heard in London.

He was born and died in [[L\u00f6rrach]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>Opac; NDB</ref> \n\nWorking initially in an [[Art Nouveau]] style, he was perhaps the most important figure in the relatively small German contribution to the [[art pottery]] movement, though he was a designer and decorator rather than a hands-on potter.  As an architect he specialized in comfortable private houses, parks and public gardens, mostly in Germany.  He was one of the founders of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in 1907.<ref>NDB; Junghanns, Kurt, ''Der Deutsche Werkbund.

In German sources he is often given his professorial title, in the German way. He travelled to Italy in 1891, and then lived in Paris, where he studied painting at the private [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in 1891\u201392.  Other major travels were to Rome and North Africa in 1905, and Spain, studying Islamic ceramics there, in 1912.<ref>Opac; NDB</ref>\n\nBetween 1937 and 1939 he published a history of art in three volumes.<ref>Opac</ref>\n\n==Pottery==\n[[File:Pot van aardewerk, versierd in reli\u00ebf met gele citroenen en zwarte bladeren op een geelwitte fond, BK-1979-13 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Vase, Karlsruhe, 1921\u201325]]\n{{MedalTop}}\n{{MedalSport | [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]]}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam]] | [[Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Town planning]]}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\nHe first became interested in pottery in 1885, visiting the Mayer pottery in Karlsruhe, and another, Manufakture Tonwerke, in [[Kandern]] in the [[Black Forest]].  He began to have his designs produced in Kandern from 1897, when [[Art Nouveau]] was already the dominant style trend, and continued to use the pottery there until 1914.  By 1898 his pieces were on sale at the Paris shop of [[Siegfried Bing]], \"[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]\" (\"House of New Art\"), which had given the movement its name.  Later his works were sold at the German critic [[Julius Meier-Graefe]]'s competitive gallery in Paris, La Maison Moderne (1897\u20131903).<ref>Opac</ref>\n\nHis works won gold medals at both the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] and the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904.<ref>Opac</ref>  These and smaller events were important for raising the profile of potters, especially those working in backwoods locations.

Perhaps his major commission was for the huge villa [[Het Kareol]], allegedly the largest private house built in the [[Netherlands]] in the 20th century, demolished in 1979, though some fragments survive. He started work there in 1907, and the project was completed in 1911. As well as the house, he designed the tiling which was a prominent feature of both the interior and exterior, and also the large gardens, now a public park.  The Villa K\u00fcchlin in [[Horben]] in the Black Forest was another country house, still rather large, and he designed a number of other houses for the wealthy.<ref>NDB</ref> \n\nThe [[Hamburg Stadtpark]] was a highly prestigous commission, designed to give [[Hamburg]] a large central park along the lines of [[Munich]]'s [[Englischer Garten]], Berlin's [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]], London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Regent's Park]], or New York's [[Central Park]].  A contest was held in 1908 for designs, which became bedevilled by \"conflicts and secret maneuvers\", exposing differing views on park design, as well as personal rivalries.  No first prize was given, but Laeuger's design was one of three second prizes.  After a period of tussling between several figures, including some very underhand dealing by the young [[Leberecht Migge]], a compromise scheme was adopted, which pleased nobody.  Laeuger rather bitterly saw it as his scheme stripped of some of its more architectural and expensive elements.<ref>Haney, 55\u201360</ref> \n\nBetween 1909 and 1912 he worked on the G\u00f6nneranlage estate in [[Baden-Baden]], whose gardens, filled with sculpture and roses, are now a public park.<ref>Herrmann, Barbara, ''Baden-Baden, deine Mystik ist die Eleganz: Ein lebendiger Spaziergang in die Gegenwart mit einem Blick in die Vergangenheit'' (in German), 2016, TWENTYSIX, \n{{ISBN|3740706171}}, 9783740706173, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UXxWCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT48 google books]; NDB</ref>  From 1922\u201325 he worked on the existing Wasserkunstanlage Paradies (\"Paradise water-garden\"), also in Baden-Baden, notably adding a sloping cascade of water in a sinuous Art Nouveau style.  The Max-Laeuger Platz by the entrance is named in his honour.<ref>[http://www.paradies-baden-baden.de/ Park website]</ref>  \n\nIn 1933 he designed a public memorial in [[Mannheim]] for [[Carl Benz]] (1844\u20131929), founder of [[Mercedes-Benz]].  Benz was an alumnus of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] where Laeuger was a professor, and Laeuger also designed the architectural setting for a bust there of the former professor [[Heinrich Hertz]], after whom the electrical unit is named.

He was born and died in [[L\u00f6rrach]], [[Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg]].<ref>Opac; NDB</ref> \n\nWorking initially in an [[Art Nouveau]] style, he was perhaps the most important figure in the relatively small German contribution to the [[art pottery]] movement, though he was a designer and decorator rather than a hands-on potter.  As an architect he specialized in comfortable private houses, parks and public gardens, mostly in Germany.  He was one of the founders of the [[Deutscher Werkbund]] in 1907.<ref>NDB; Junghanns, Kurt, ''Der Deutsche Werkbund. Sein erstes Jahrzehnt.'', p. 140, 1982, Berlin</ref> \n\n==Life==\n[[File:Het Kareol-tempel tile design (cropped).jpg|thumb|Tiles salvaged from his [[Het Kareol]] villa in [[Aerdenhout]], [[Netherlands]], 1911]]\nFrom 1881 to 1884 he studied painting and interior design at the school of decorative arts in [[Karlsruhe]], and was later professor of interior and garden design at the university there (now the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]]) from 1894 until 1933.  In German sources he is often given his professorial title, in the German way. He travelled to Italy in 1891, and then lived in Paris, where he studied painting at the private [[Acad\u00e9mie Julian]] in 1891\u201392.  Other major travels were to Rome and North Africa in 1905, and Spain, studying Islamic ceramics there, in 1912.<ref>Opac; NDB</ref>\n\nBetween 1937 and 1939 he published a history of art in three volumes.<ref>Opac</ref>\n\n==Pottery==\n[[File:Pot van aardewerk, versierd in reli\u00ebf met gele citroenen en zwarte bladeren op een geelwitte fond, BK-1979-13 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Vase, Karlsruhe, 1921\u201325]]\n{{MedalTop}}\n{{MedalSport | [[Art competitions at the Summer Olympics|Art competitions]]}}\n{{MedalBronze| [[1928 Summer Olympics|1928 Amsterdam]] | [[Art competitions at the 1928 Summer Olympics|Town planning]]}}\n{{MedalBottom}}\nHe first became interested in pottery in 1885, visiting the Mayer pottery in Karlsruhe, and another, Manufakture Tonwerke, in [[Kandern]] in the [[Black Forest]].  He began to have his designs produced in Kandern from 1897, when [[Art Nouveau]] was already the dominant style trend, and continued to use the pottery there until 1914.  By 1898 his pieces were on sale at the Paris shop of [[Siegfried Bing]], \"[[Maison de l'Art Nouveau]]\" (\"House of New Art\"), which had given the movement its name.  Later his works were sold at the German critic [[Julius Meier-Graefe]]'s competitive gallery in Paris, La Maison Moderne (1897\u20131903).<ref>Opac</ref>\n\nHis works won gold medals at both the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]] and the [[St. Louis World's Fair]] in 1904.<ref>Opac</ref>  These and smaller events were important for raising the profile of potters, especially those working in backwoods locations.  Much later, in 1928 he won a bronze medal in the art competitions of the [[1928 Summer Olympics|Amsterdam Olympic Games]] for his [[Hamburg Stadtpark]].<ref>[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/athletes/la/max-laeuger-1.html Max Laeuger's profile at Sports Reference.com]</ref>  \n\nIn 1916 he took over the former premises of the {{ill|Staatliche Majolika Manufaktur Karlsruhe|de}} to create his own pottery atelier; this was destroyed by Allied bombing in 1944,<ref>Opac</ref> after which (at the age of 80) he returned to L\u00f6rrach for his remaining years.\n\n<gallery widths=\"150px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Max la\u00fcger per Manufakcture tonwerke, vaso ceramico, kandern 1898-1900 ca..JPG|Vase, Kandern, 1898-1900\nFile:Vaas van aardewerk, versierd in reli\u00ebf met klaver in donkergroen en rood op een lichtgroene fond, BK-1979-11 (cropped).jpg||Vase, Kandern, c. 1900\nFile:Max la\u00fcger per Manufakcture tonwerke, vaso ceramico, kandern 1900.JPG|Vase, Kandern, 1900, for the Paris [[Exposition Universelle (1900)]]\nFile:Vaas met decor van bebladerde bomen in lichtgroen, bruinrood en zwart op groen fond, BK-1973-9 (cropped).jpg|Vase, Kandern, 1910\nFile:Bonifatiuskirche Loerrach Laeugerrelief.jpg|Ceramic ''Crucifixion'' relief for a church in [[L\u00f6rrach]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture and other work==\n[[File:Voorgevel - Aerdenhout - 20004918 - RCE.jpg|thumb|[[Het Kareol]], 1907\u201311, photo the year before it was demolished in 1979]]\nHe designed several large garden and park projects. Perhaps his major commission was for the huge villa [[Het Kareol]], allegedly the largest private house built in the [[Netherlands]] in the 20th century, demolished in 1979, though some fragments survive. He started work there in 1907, and the project was completed in 1911. As well as the house, he designed the tiling which was a prominent feature of both the interior and exterior, and also the large gardens, now a public park.  The Villa K\u00fcchlin in [[Horben]] in the Black Forest was another country house, still rather large, and he designed a number of other houses for the wealthy.<ref>NDB</ref> \n\nThe [[Hamburg Stadtpark]] was a highly prestigous commission, designed to give [[Hamburg]] a large central park along the lines of [[Munich]]'s [[Englischer Garten]], Berlin's [[Tiergarten (park)|Tiergarten]], London's [[Hyde Park, London|Hyde Park]] and [[Regent's Park]], or New York's [[Central Park]].  A contest was held in 1908 for designs, which became bedevilled by \"conflicts and secret maneuvers\", exposing differing views on park design, as well as personal rivalries.  No first prize was given, but Laeuger's design was one of three second prizes.  After a period of tussling between several figures, including some very underhand dealing by the young [[Leberecht Migge]], a compromise scheme was adopted, which pleased nobody.  Laeuger rather bitterly saw it as his scheme stripped of some of its more architectural and expensive elements.<ref>Haney, 55\u201360</ref> \n\nBetween 1909 and 1912 he worked on the G\u00f6nneranlage estate in [[Baden-Baden]], whose gardens, filled with sculpture and roses, are now a public park.<ref>Herrmann, Barbara, ''Baden-Baden, deine Mystik ist die Eleganz: Ein lebendiger Spaziergang in die Gegenwart mit einem Blick in die Vergangenheit'' (in German), 2016, TWENTYSIX, \n{{ISBN|3740706171}}, 9783740706173, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=UXxWCwAAQBAJ&pg=PT48 google books]; NDB</ref>  From 1922\u201325 he worked on the existing Wasserkunstanlage Paradies (\"Paradise water-garden\"), also in Baden-Baden, notably adding a sloping cascade of water in a sinuous Art Nouveau style.  The Max-Laeuger Platz by the entrance is named in his honour.<ref>[http://www.paradies-baden-baden.de/ Park website]</ref>  \n\nIn 1933 he designed a public memorial in [[Mannheim]] for [[Carl Benz]] (1844\u20131929), founder of [[Mercedes-Benz]].  Benz was an alumnus of the [[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]] where Laeuger was a professor, and Laeuger also designed the architectural setting for a bust there of the former professor [[Heinrich Hertz]], after whom the electrical unit is named.  He designed [[stained-glass]] windows for [[St. Paul's Church, Basel]].<ref>{{cite web | url = http://basel.all-about-switzerland.info/basel-pauluschurch-karl-moser.html | title = Paulus Church, Basel, Switzerland | accessdate = 2010-09-04 | publisher = All About Switzerland}}</ref>\n\n\n<gallery widths=\"170px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Eetkamer - Aerdenhout - 20004884 - RCE.jpg|Interior at [[Het Kareol]], with tile panel\nFile:Villa K\u00fcchlin.jpg|Villa K\u00fcchlin, [[Horben]]\nFile:Baden-Baden-Goenneranlage-Josefinenbrunnen-06-gje.jpg|G\u00f6nneranlage gardens\nFile:Wassertreppe Am Paradies - panoramio.jpg|The cascade at Wasserkunstanlage Paradies\nFile:Projekt Villensiedlung Bohrertal in Horben, Bebauungsmodell von Max Laeuger, 1907.png|Drawing for a residential development in [[Horben]], 1907\n</gallery>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*Haney, David, ''When Modern Was Green: Life and Work of Landscape Architect Leberecht Migge'', 2010, Routledge, {{ISBN|0415561388}}, 9780415561389, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=W4axQhd5kNMC&pg=PA55 google books]\n*\"NDB\" * {{NDB|13|405|406|Laeuger, Max|Elisabeth Kessler-Slotta|118725882}}\n*\"Opac\": [http://opac.lesartsdecoratifs.fr/fiche/laeuger \"Max Laeuger\"], Les Arts d\u00e9coratifs, Centre de documentation des mus\u00e9es (in French)\n* [http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=L%C4UGEMAX01 DatabaseOlympics profile]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} <!-- name misspelt -->\n* [http://www.loerrach.de/servlet/PB/menu/1096759/index.html Bio with image]{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Reinald Eckert: ''Zwei Parkanlagen des fr\u00fchen 20.

Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.\n \nIn a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some [[Symfony]] libraries into Drupal core.\n\nCore modules also includes a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] system, which lets developers categorize content or [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] with key words for easier access.<ref name=features>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/features | title=Features | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a detailed [[changelog]] of core feature updates by version.<ref name=changelog>{{Cite web | url= https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39 | title= Drupal 7.39 released | work= drupal.org | accessdate= 2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Core modules===\nDrupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.<ref name=coremodules>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103300/http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archivedate=2008-07-28 | title=Handbook: Core Modules | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:<ref name=coremodules/>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Access statistics and logging\n* Advanced search\n* Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls\n* Caching and feature throttling for improved performance\n* Descriptive URLs\n* Multi-level menu system\n* Multi-site support<ref name=multisite>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/43816 | title=Drupal Multi-site installation recipes }}</ref>\n* Multi-user content creation and editing\n* [[OpenID]] support\n* RSS feed and feed aggregator\n* Security and new release update notification\n* User profiles\n* Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)\n* Workflow tools (triggers and actions)\n}}\n\n===Core themes===\nDrupal includes core themes, which customize the \"look and feel\" of Drupal sites,<ref name=coretheme>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/91964 | title=Garland, the new default core theme | last=Buytaert | first=Dries | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> for example, Garland and Bartik.\n\nThe Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.<ref name=colormodule>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/color | title=Color: Allows the user to change the color scheme of certain themes | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Localization===\n{{As of|2017|01}}, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and [[English language|English]] (the default).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://localize.drupal.org/translate/downloads | title=Drupal core translation downloads | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> Support is included for right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=sixnewfeatures>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0 | title=Drupal 6.0 released | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal localization is built on top of [[gettext]], the GNU [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) library.\n\n===Auto-update notification===\nDrupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.<ref name=sixnewfeatures/> It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.\n\nBefore updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.<ref name=\"sql-injection-vulnerability\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005 |title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.<ref name=\"sql-injection-exploited\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003 |title=Drupal Core - Highly Critical - Public Service announcement - PSA-2014-003 |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like [[drush]] is highly recommended.\n\n===Database abstraction===\nPrior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.\n\nDrupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses [[PHP Data Objects]] to abstract the database. [[Microsoft]] has written a database driver for their [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]. Drupal 7 supports the file-based [[SQLite]] database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.\n\n===Windows development===\nWith Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.\n\nA group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.<ref name=drupal-windows>{{Cite web | url=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-windows | title=Drupal on Windows Group | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Accessibility===\nSince the release of Drupal 7, [[Web accessibility]] has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/about/accessibility | title=Accessibility statement | last=Killesreiter | first=Gerhard | work=drupal.org | date=2013-02-25 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. \n\nDrupal 8 saw many improvements from the [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines]] (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. \n\nThe accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.\n\nDrupal 8 has good semantic support for [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]] through [[WAI-ARIA]]. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:\n* Drag and drop functionality;\n* Improved color contrast and intensity;\n* Adding skip navigation to core themes;\n* Adding labels by default for input forms;\n* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;\n* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and\n* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/accessibility/drupal-8-accessibility-features | title=Drupal 8 Accessibility Features }}</ref> \n\nThe community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/core-gates#accessibility | title=Drupal core gates | last=Scholten | first=Roy | work=drupal.org | date=2012-12-10 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Extending the core==\nDrupal core is [[modular]], defining a system of [[Hooking|hooks]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], which are accessed internally via an [[API]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://api.drupal.org/ | title=API Reference | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> This design allows third-party contributed [[#Modules|modules]] and [[#Themes|themes]] to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.\n\nDrupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes.

A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.\n\nCommunity-contributed themes<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/project/Themes | title=Drupal themes|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> at the Drupal website are released under a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/14208 | title=Adding your theme to Drupal.org|publisher=Drupal.org}}</ref> and the most installed Drupal themes are [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull listed on this page].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dezignmatterz.com/best-responsive-drupal-themes/ | title=10 Best Drupal Themes|publisher=MAAN Softwares | accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Distributions===\nIn the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.\n\nThe distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Top Drupal Distributions| url=http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| publisher=AGLOBALWAY Consulting Services Inc.| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413154924/http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| archivedate=2014-04-13}}</ref> They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a \"brochure\" site rather than a news site or [[online store]].\n\n==Architecture==\nDrupal is based on the [[Presentation Abstraction Control]] architecture, or PAC.\n\nThe [https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!menu.inc/group/menu/7 menu system] acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#HTTP GET|HTTP GET]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).\n\nIt even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/mvc-vs-pac | title=MVC vs. PAC}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nDrupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active [[community]] support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,<ref>[https://maansoftwares.com/blog/drupal/drupal-cms-grew-overnight Drupal - CMS Grew Overnight] By MAAN Softwares, Retrieved, June 8th, 2017</ref> {{As of|2017|01}} more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.<ref name=\"dohome\"/> The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/node/17870|title=drupal.org discussion on DrupalCon event management|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at [[Szeged]] in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.\n\nSmaller events, known as \"Drupal Camps\" or DrupalCamp,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drupal Camps and Cons|url=http://buildamodule.com/drupal-camps-calendar|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> occur throughout the year all over the world.

Drupal core is the stock element of Drupal. Common Drupal-specific libraries, as well as the bootstrap process, are defined as Drupal core; all other functionality is defined as Drupal modules including the system module itself.\n \nIn a Drupal website's default configuration, authors can contribute content as either registered or anonymous users (at the discretion of the administrator). This content is accessible to web visitors through a variety of selectable criteria. As of Drupal 8, Drupal has adopted some [[Symfony]] libraries into Drupal core.\n\nCore modules also includes a hierarchical [[Taxonomy (general)|taxonomy]] system, which lets developers categorize content or [[Tag (metadata)|tagged]] with key words for easier access.<ref name=features>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/features | title=Features | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal maintains a detailed [[changelog]] of core feature updates by version.<ref name=changelog>{{Cite web | url= https://www.drupal.org/drupal-7.39 | title= Drupal 7.39 released | work= drupal.org | accessdate= 2015-09-19}}</ref>\n\n===Core modules===\nDrupal core includes optional modules that can be enabled by the administrator to extend the functionality of the core website.<ref name=coremodules>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080728103300/http://drupal.org/handbook/modules | archivedate=2008-07-28 | title=Handbook: Core Modules | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nThe core Drupal distribution provides a number of features, including:<ref name=coremodules/>\n{{columns-list|colwidth=22em|\n* Access statistics and logging\n* Advanced search\n* Blogs, books, comments, forums, and polls\n* Caching and feature throttling for improved performance\n* Descriptive URLs\n* Multi-level menu system\n* Multi-site support<ref name=multisite>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/43816 | title=Drupal Multi-site installation recipes }}</ref>\n* Multi-user content creation and editing\n* [[OpenID]] support\n* RSS feed and feed aggregator\n* Security and new release update notification\n* User profiles\n* Various access control restrictions (user roles, IP addresses, email)\n* Workflow tools (triggers and actions)\n}}\n\n===Core themes===\nDrupal includes core themes, which customize the \"look and feel\" of Drupal sites,<ref name=coretheme>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/91964 | title=Garland, the new default core theme | last=Buytaert | first=Dries | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> for example, Garland and Bartik.\n\nThe Color Module, introduced in Drupal core 5.0, allows administrators to change the color scheme of certain themes via a browser interface.<ref name=colormodule>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/handbook/modules/color | title=Color: Allows the user to change the color scheme of certain themes | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\n===Localization===\n{{As of|2017|01}}, Drupal had been made available in 100 languages and [[English language|English]] (the default).<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://localize.drupal.org/translate/downloads | title=Drupal core translation downloads | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2017-01-30}}</ref> Support is included for right-to-left languages such as [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].<ref name=sixnewfeatures>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/drupal-6.0 | title=Drupal 6.0 released | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref>\n\nDrupal localization is built on top of [[gettext]], the GNU [[internationalization and localization]] (i18n) library.\n\n===Auto-update notification===\nDrupal can automatically notify the administrator about new versions of modules, themes, or the Drupal core.<ref name=sixnewfeatures/> It's important to update quickly after security updates are released.\n\nBefore updating it is highly recommended to take backup of core, modules, theme, files and database. If there is any error shown after update or if the new update is not compatible with a module, then it can be quickly replaced by backup. There are several backup modules available in Drupal.\n\nOn October 15, 2014, a sql injection vulnerability was announced and update released.<ref name=\"sql-injection-vulnerability\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/SA-CORE-2014-005 |title=SA-CORE-2014-005 - Drupal core - SQL injection |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Two weeks later the Drupal security team released an advisory explaining that everyone should act under the assumption that any site not updated within 7 hours of the announcement are infected.<ref name=\"sql-injection-exploited\">{{cite web |url=https://www.drupal.org/PSA-2014-003 |title=Drupal Core - Highly Critical - Public Service announcement - PSA-2014-003 |newspaper=Https |date=  |accessdate= December 3, 2014}}</ref> Thus, it can be extremely important to apply these updates quickly and usage of a tool to make this process easier like [[drush]] is highly recommended.\n\n===Database abstraction===\nPrior to version 7, Drupal had functions that performed tasks related to databases, such as SQL query cleansing, multi-site table name prefixing, and generating proper SQL queries. In particular, Drupal 6 introduced an abstraction layer that allowed programmers to create SQL queries without writing SQL.\n\nDrupal 9 extends the data abstraction layer so that a programmer no longer needs to write SQL queries as text strings. It uses [[PHP Data Objects]] to abstract the database. [[Microsoft]] has written a database driver for their [[Microsoft SQL Server|SQL Server]]. Drupal 7 supports the file-based [[SQLite]] database engine, which is part of the standard PHP distribution.\n\n===Windows development===\nWith Drupal 9's new database abstraction layer, and ability to run on the Windows web server [[Internet Information Services|IIS]], it is now easier for Windows developers to participate in the Drupal community.\n\nA group on Drupal.org is dedicated to Windows issues.<ref name=drupal-windows>{{Cite web | url=http://groups.drupal.org/drupal-windows | title=Drupal on Windows Group | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2011-02-14}}</ref>\n\n===Accessibility===\nSince the release of Drupal 7, [[Web accessibility]] has been constantly improving in the Drupal community.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/about/accessibility | title=Accessibility statement | last=Killesreiter | first=Gerhard | work=drupal.org | date=2013-02-25 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref> Drupal is a good framework for building sites accessible to people with disabilities, because many of the best practices have been incorporated into Drupal Core. \n\nDrupal 8 saw many improvements from the [[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines]] (ATAG) 2.0 guidelines which support both an accessible authoring environment as well as support for authors to produce more accessible content. \n\nThe accessibility team is carrying on the work of identifying and resolving accessibility barriers and raising awareness within the community.\n\nDrupal 8 has good semantic support for [[Rich Internet application|Rich Internet Applications]] through [[WAI-ARIA]]. There have been many improvements to both the visitor and administrator sides of Drupal, especially:\n* Drag and drop functionality;\n* Improved color contrast and intensity;\n* Adding skip navigation to core themes;\n* Adding labels by default for input forms;\n* Fixing CSS display:none with consistent methods for hiding and exposing text on focus;\n* Adding support for ARIA Live Regions with Drupal.announce(); and\n* Adding a TabbingManager to support better keyboard navigation.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.drupal.org/docs/8/accessibility/drupal-8-accessibility-features | title=Drupal 8 Accessibility Features }}</ref> \n\nThe community also added an accessibility gate for core issues in Drupal 8.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/core-gates#accessibility | title=Drupal core gates | last=Scholten | first=Roy | work=drupal.org | date=2012-12-10 | accessdate=2013-04-16}}</ref>\n\n==Extending the core==\nDrupal core is [[modular]], defining a system of [[Hooking|hooks]] and [[Callback (computer programming)|callbacks]], which are accessed internally via an [[API]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://api.drupal.org/ | title=API Reference | work=drupal.org | accessdate=2009-04-08}}</ref> This design allows third-party contributed [[#Modules|modules]] and [[#Themes|themes]] to extend or override Drupal's default behaviors without changing Drupal core's code.\n\nDrupal isolates core files from contributed modules and themes.

Themes adapt or replace a Drupal site's default look and feel.\n\nDrupal themes use standardized formats that may be generated by common third-party theme design engines.

A popular Drupal contributed module called 'Devel' provides GUI information to developers and themers about the page build.\n\nCommunity-contributed themes<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/project/Themes | title=Drupal themes|publisher=Drupal.org | accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> at the Drupal website are released under a free [[GNU General Public License|GPL]] license,<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://drupal.org/node/14208 | title=Adding your theme to Drupal.org|publisher=Drupal.org}}</ref> and the most installed Drupal themes are [https://www.drupal.org/project/project_theme/?solrsort=iss_project_release_usage%20desc&f%5B3%5D=sm_field_project_type%3Afull listed on this page].<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.dezignmatterz.com/best-responsive-drupal-themes/ | title=10 Best Drupal Themes|publisher=MAAN Softwares | accessdate=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\n===Distributions===\nIn the past, those wanting a fully customized installation of Drupal had to download a pre-tailored version separately from the official Drupal core. Today, however, a distribution defines a packaged version of Drupal that upon installation, provides a website or application built for a specific purpose.\n\nThe distributions offer the benefit of a new Drupal site without having to manually seek out and install third-party contributed modules or adjust configuration settings.<ref>{{Cite web| title=Top Drupal Distributions| url=http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| publisher=AGLOBALWAY Consulting Services Inc.| url-status=dead| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140413154924/http://www.aglobalway.com/content/top-drupal-distributions| archivedate=2014-04-13}}</ref> They are collections of modules, themes, and associated configuration settings that prepare Drupal for custom operation. For example, a distribution could configure Drupal as a \"brochure\" site rather than a news site or [[online store]].\n\n==Architecture==\nDrupal is based on the [[Presentation Abstraction Control]] architecture, or PAC.\n\nThe [https://api.drupal.org/api/drupal/includes!menu.inc/group/menu/7 menu system] acts as the Controller. It accepts input via a single source ([[Hypertext Transfer Protocol#HTTP GET|HTTP GET]] and [[POST (HTTP)|POST]]), routes requests to the appropriate helper functions, pulls data out of the Abstraction (nodes and, from Drupal 5 onwards, forms), and then pushes it through a filter to get a Presentation of it (the theme system).\n\nIt even has multiple, parallel PAC agents in the form of blocks that push data out to a common canvas (page.tpl.php).<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.garfieldtech.com/blog/mvc-vs-pac | title=MVC vs. PAC}}</ref>\n\n==Community==\nDrupal.org has a large community of users and developers who provide active [[community]] support by coming up with new updates to help improve the functionality of Drupal,<ref>[https://maansoftwares.com/blog/drupal/drupal-cms-grew-overnight Drupal - CMS Grew Overnight] By MAAN Softwares, Retrieved, June 8th, 2017</ref> {{As of|2017|01}} more than 105,400 users are actively contributing.<ref name=\"dohome\"/> The semiannual DrupalCon conference alternates between North America, Europe and Asia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://groups.drupal.org/node/17870|title=drupal.org discussion on DrupalCon event management|publisher=Groups.drupal.org|accessdate=2011-08-31}}</ref> Attendance at DrupalCon grew from 500 at [[Szeged]] in August 2008, to over 3,700 people at Austin, Texas in June, 2014.\n\nSmaller events, known as \"Drupal Camps\" or DrupalCamp,<ref>{{cite web|title=Drupal Camps and Cons|url=http://buildamodule.com/drupal-camps-calendar|accessdate=25 January 2013}}</ref> occur throughout the year all over the world.

From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season.

The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in [http://linvenon.com/NPek casinos]==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

Most games have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.\n\n''Payout'' is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.<ref>\n[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ \"Slot Machines: The Big Gamble\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713080253/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ |date=July 13, 2011 }}, (Jan. 10, 2011).

[[Security camera]]s located throughout the casino are the most basic measure.\n\nModern casino security is usually divided between a physical security force and a specialized surveillance department. The physical security force usually patrols the casino and responds to calls for assistance and reports of suspicious or definite criminal activity. A specialized surveillance department operates the casino's [[closed circuit television]] system, known in the industry as the [[Eye in the sky (camera)|eye in the sky]]. Both of these specialized casino security departments work very closely with each other to ensure the safety of both guests and the casino's assets, and have been quite successful in preventing crime.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gamblinginfo.com/6_Casino_Management.htm|title=Casino Management and Operations|publisher=Gambling Info|accessdate=23 June 2011}}</ref> Some casinos also have catwalks in the ceiling above the casino floor, which allow surveillance personnel to look directly down, through one way glass, on the activities at the tables and slot machines.\n\nWhen it opened in 1989, [[The Mirage]] was the first casino to use cameras full-time on all table games.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knightly |first= Arnold M. |date=February 2007 |title=Blink and you'll miss him |journal=Casino City Times|pages=1 |url=http://www.casinocitytimes.com/news/article/casino-business-blink-and-youll-miss-him-164381 |accessdate= 2011-01-30 }}</ref>\n\nIn addition to cameras and other technological measures, casinos also enforce security through rules of conduct and behavior; for example, players at card games are required to keep the cards they are holding in their hands visible at all times.\n\n==Business practices==\nOver the past few decades, casinos have developed many different marketing techniques for attracting and maintaining loyal patrons. Many casinos use a loyalty rewards program used to track players' spending habits and target their patrons more effectively, by sending mailings with free slot play and other promotions.<ref>[http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes \"Tribes to pay Conn. $25m in slot accord\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512043241/http://articles.boston.com/2009-08-27/news/29264771_1_slot-promotions-tribes |date=2012-05-12 }}, (August 27, 2009).

From the Ancient [[Greeks]] and Romans to Napoleon's [[France]] and Elizabethan [[England]], much of history is filled with stories of entertainment based on games of chance.\n\nThe first known European gambling house, not called a casino although meeting the modern definition, was the [[Ridotto]], established in [[Venice]], Italy, in 1638 by the [[Great Council of Venice]] to provide controlled gambling during the carnival season. It was closed in 1774 as the city government felt it was impoverishing the local gentry.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Thomassen|first1=Bj\u00f8rn|title=Liminality and the Modern: Living Through the In-Between|date=2014|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|page=160|url=https://books.google.com/?id=5Sd7BAAAQBAJ&pg=PA160&lpg=PA160&dq=ridotto+1638+casino#v=onepage&q=ridotto%201638%20casino&f=false|accessdate=August 17, 2015|isbn=9781409460800}}</ref>\n\nIn American history, early gambling establishments were known as [[Western saloon|saloons]]. The creation and importance of saloons was greatly influenced by four major cities: [[New Orleans]], [[St. Louis]], [[Chicago]] and [[San Francisco]]. It was in the saloons that travelers could find people to talk to, drink with, and often gamble with. During the early 20th century in America, gambling was outlawed by state legislation. However, in 1931, gambling was legalized throughout the state of [[Nevada]], where America's first legalized casinos were set up. In 1976 [[New Jersey]] allowed gambling in [[Atlantic City]], now America's second largest gambling city.\n\n==Gambling in casinos==\n[[File:Casino slots2.jpg|thumb|[[Slot machine]]s in Atlantic City.

Most games have mathematically determined [[odds]] that ensure the house has at all times an advantage over the players. This can be expressed more precisely by the notion of [[expected value]], which is uniformly negative (from the player's perspective). This advantage is called the ''[[Casino game#House advantage|house edge]]''. In games such as [[poker]] where players play against each other, the house takes a commission called the [[Rake (poker)|rake]]. Casinos sometimes give out complimentary items or [[Comps (casino)|comps]] to gamblers.\n\n''Payout'' is the percentage of funds (\"winnings\") returned to players.\n\nCasinos in the United States say that a player staking money won from the casino is ''playing with the house's money''.\n\nVideo Lottery Machines (slot machines) have become one of the most popular forms of gambling in casinos. {{As of | 2011}} investigative reports have started calling into question whether the modern-day slot-machine is addictive.<ref>\n[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ \"Slot Machines: The Big Gamble\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713080253/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/01/07/60minutes/main7223329.shtml/ |date=July 13, 2011 }}, (Jan. 10, 2011).

The country joined the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] in an effort to defeat [[First French Empire|France]] under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1803 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] had declared war on [[First French Empire|France]], at this time Sweden had remained neutral together with the Nordic countries [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and [[Prussia]]. But after the execution of [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9]] in 1804, the Swedish government broke all diplomatic ties with France and concluded a convention allowing the British to use [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base against France, in exchange for payments. [[Russia]] also promised Sweden that 40,000 men would come to the aid of the country if it was threatened by French forces. So on 9 August 1805 Sweden joined the Third Coalition and declared war on France on 31 October.<ref>Lindqvist, Herman(2004) page 256</ref>\n\n==The war==\n===The offensive against Hanover===\nIn the beginning of November 1805, a combined British, Russian and Swedish force of about 12,000 men were sent from Swedish Pomerania to liberate French-held [[Hanover]]. The offensive against Hanover was repeatedly delayed because of Prussia's partial reluctance that the Swedes and the Russians moved troops through Prussian territory. However, in December 1805, after the battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], the British and the Russian forces started to evacuate Hanover, leaving only a small Swedish force alone to face the French. In April 1806, the Swedes were also forced to retreat back to Swedish Pomerania after an agreement had been concluded between Prussia and France.\n\n===The Fourth Coalition===\nBut during the summer of 1806 Prussia formed the [[Fourth Coalition]] against France, which gave Sweden the right to occupy [[Lauenburg]]. But during the autumn, the French forces advanced rapidly and soon much of the western German regions were occupied, this forced the Swedish troops on a retreat towards [[L\u00fcbeck]]. The plan was that the troops from there could take the sea route to [[Stralsund]] in order to avoid the advancing French forces. The Swedes were still caught by the French on the 6 November while they loaded their ships at L\u00fcbeck, and following the battle of [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] about 1,000 Swedish soldiers had to surrender to the numerically superior French forces.\n\nThe French army began their offensive towards Swedish Pomerania in early 1807 and [[Siege of Stralsund (1807)|besieged Stralsund]] on 15 January. This was the beginning of a seven-month-long siege, and since the French forces also were engaged in warfare elsewhere this increasingly reduced the number of troops stationed around Stralsund. When the Swedes were reinforced on 1 April it was decided that they would attempt to break the siege. This was done with some success since the Swedes managed to take [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]]. But the French chose to counterattack, and a force of 13,000 men attacked the Swedes from [[Stettin]] on 16 April. This forced the left section of the Swedish army to withdraw, and another division in [[Ueckerm\u00fcnde]] was then cut off and later captured. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed on a ceasefire according to which the French were to leave [[Pomerania]]. However, the Swedish government refused to join the [[Continental System]] and denounced the armistice under the influence of British diplomacy on 8 July.\n\nOn 6 August 1807, 50,000 French, Spanish and Dutch troops under Marshal [[Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune]] began an assault on Swedish Pomerania and besieged Stralsund again. On 20 August 1807, the defenders of the city capitulated and the remains of the Swedish army was surrounded at [[R\u00fcgen]].  However, Swedish General [[Johan Christopher Toll]] managed to conclude the convention of Schlatkow with Marshal Brune on favorable terms and his forces withdrew to Sweden with all of their munitions of war on 7 September.<ref>Sundberg, Ulf(2002), page 357-362</ref>\n\n===Franco-Russian treaty===\nThe Franco-Russian [[Treaty of Tilsit]] left Britain and Sweden without other allies in the war against France. On 21 February 1808, Russia joined the war against Sweden by invading [[Finnish War|Finland]] and on 14 March the same year, Denmark-Norway also [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809|declared war]] on Sweden. Danish and French-Spanish troops began preparations for an invasion of [[Sk\u00e5ne]] in Sweden, but the plan was soon aborted, and the war was instead directed to the Norwegian-Swedish border. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]]'s expedition sent by the British government to protect Sweden from possible French-Danish attack arrived on 3 May 1808 and stayed until July when it was redirected to Portugal.\n\nNapoleon's plans to invade Sweden was never realized due to the British activity on the [[Baltic Sea]], the weakness of the Danish military and hesitations of French Marshal [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]. Bernadotte's actions made him popular enough to be elected as a Swedish [[Crown Prince]] after the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in March 1809.  On 30 August 1809, the new Swedish government was to conclude the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] with Russia legitimizing the Russian annexation of Finland and [[\u00c5land]]. A peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark-Norway was signed with no territorial adjustments on 10 December 1809.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn 6 January 1810, Sweden signed a Russian-mediated [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] with France regaining Pomerania, at a cost of joining the [[Continental System]]. On 17 November 1810, Sweden was forced to declare [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war against Britain]] and all British goods in Swedish Pomerania were seized. The government-supported smuggling continued, however, over the [[North Sea]] and the English fleet was informed that it would be a phantom war. The war lasted until 1812 and no military action was taken.\n\n==See also==\n*[[English Wars (Scandinavia)]]\n**[[Gunboat War]]\n**[[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809]]\n*[[Finnish War]]\n*[[Second War against Napoleon]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004032717/http://www.hjle.se/webbsidor/ku_gustav_adolf1805.htm The War against Napoleon: 1805\u20131810]'' on [http://www.hjle.se/ Lennart Hjelm]\n\n===Literature===\n*Lindqvist, Herman(2004) \u2013 ''Napoleon'' (Schibsted forlagene) {{ISBN|978-82-516-2157-1}}\n*Sundberg, Ulf(2002) \u2013 ''Svenska krig, 1521\u20131814'' (Hjalmarson & H\u00f6gberg) {{ISBN|91-89080-14-9}}\n\n{{Napoleonic Wars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:First War Against Napoleon}}\n[[Category:Wars involving Sweden|Napoleon, First War]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sweden]]\n[[Category:France\u2013Sweden relations]]\n[[Category:Wars involving France]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars]]\n", "text_old": "{{More citations needed|date=December 2009}}\n{{infobox military conflict\n| conflict             = The Pomeranian War\n| partof               = the [[Napoleonic Wars]]\n| image                = Swedish Pomerania 1812.png\n| image_size           = 270px\n| caption              = '''Swedish Pomerania''' ''(centre-right)'' in 1812\n| date                 = 31 October 1805 \u2013 6 January 1810 <br> (4 years 11 months & 6 days)\n| place                = [[Swedish Pomerania]] \n| coordinates          = \n| map_type             = \n| latitude             = \n| longitude            = \n| map_size             = \n| map_caption          = \n| map_label            = \n| territory            = \n| result               = French victory, [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]]\n*Sweden regains Swedish Pomerania\n*Sweden integrates the [[Continental System]]\n| status               = \n| combatant1           = {{Flagicon|First French Empire}} [[First French Empire|French Empire]]<br>\n{{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Enlightenment in Spain|Spanish Empire]][b]<br>{{flagicon|Holland}} [[Kingdom of Holland|Holland]]<ref>Sundberg, Ulf(2002), page 357-362</ref>\n| combatant2           = {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Sweden]]<br />{{Flagcountry|United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland}}<br />{{flagcountry|Prussia|1803}}\n| combatant3           = \n| commander1           = {{Flagicon|First French Empire}} [[Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune|Guillaume Brune]]<br /> {{Flagicon|First French Empire}} [[\u00c9douard Adolphe Casimir Joseph Mortier|\u00c9douard Mortier]]<br /> {{flagicon|Spain|1785}} [[Pedro Caro, 3rd Marquis of la Romana]]<br />{{flagicon|Holland}} [[Louis Bonaparte]]<br />{{flagicon|Holland}} [[Jean-Baptiste Dumonceau|Jean Dumonceau]]\n| commander2           = {{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Gustav IV Adolf]]<sup>[a]</sup><br />{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Charles XIII]]<sup>[a]</sup> <br />{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Hans Henric von Essen|Hans von Essen]]<br />{{flagicon|Sweden}} [[Johan Christopher Toll]]\n| commander3           = \n| units1               =\n| units2               =\n| units3               = \n| strength1            = 13,000 men  (in 1805) <br />40,000 men (in 1810) \n| strength2            = 12,125 men  (in 1805) <br />27,000 men (in 1810)\n| strength3            = \n| casualties1          = \n| casualties2          = \n| casualties3          = \n| notes                = \n<small>[a]</small> Gustav IV Adolf was deposed by a [[coup d'etat]] on March 9, 1809, and Charles XIII was appointed king in his place.\n<small>[b]</small> Until 1808\n| campaignbox = {{Campaignbox Napoleonic Wars}}\n}}\nThe '''Franco-Swedish War''' or '''Pomeranian War''' was the first involvement by [[Sweden]] in the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. The country joined the [[War of the Third Coalition|Third Coalition]] in an effort to defeat [[First French Empire|France]] under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1803 [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] had declared war on [[First French Empire|France]], at this time Sweden had remained neutral together with the Nordic countries [[Denmark\u2013Norway]] and [[Prussia]]. But after the execution of [[Louis-Antoine-Henri de Bourbon-Cond\u00e9]] in 1804, the Swedish government broke all diplomatic ties with France and concluded a convention allowing the British to use [[Swedish Pomerania]] as a military base against France, in exchange for payments. [[Russia]] also promised Sweden that 40,000 men would come to the aid of the country if it was threatened by French forces. So on 9 August 1805 Sweden joined the Third Coalition and declared war on France on 31 October.<ref>Lindqvist, Herman(2004) page 256</ref>\n\n==The war==\n===The offensive against Hanover===\nIn the beginning of November 1805, a combined British, Russian and Swedish force of about 12,000 men were sent from Swedish Pomerania to liberate French-held [[Hanover]]. The offensive against Hanover was repeatedly delayed because of Prussia's partial reluctance that the Swedes and the Russians moved troops through Prussian territory. However, in December 1805, after the battle of [[Battle of Austerlitz|Austerlitz]], the British and the Russian forces started to evacuate Hanover, leaving only a small Swedish force alone to face the French. In April 1806, the Swedes were also forced to retreat back to Swedish Pomerania after an agreement had been concluded between Prussia and France.\n\n===The Fourth Coalition===\nBut during the summer of 1806 Prussia formed the [[Fourth Coalition]] against France, which gave Sweden the right to occupy [[Lauenburg]]. But during the autumn, the French forces advanced rapidly and soon much of the western German regions were occupied, this forced the Swedish troops on a retreat towards [[L\u00fcbeck]]. The plan was that the troops from there could take the sea route to [[Stralsund]] in order to avoid the advancing French forces. The Swedes were still caught by the French on the 6 November while they loaded their ships at L\u00fcbeck, and following the battle of [[Battle of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] about 1,000 Swedish soldiers had to surrender to the numerically superior French forces.\n\nThe French army began their offensive towards Swedish Pomerania in early 1807 and [[Siege of Stralsund (1807)|besieged Stralsund]] on 15 January. This was the beginning of a seven-month-long siege, and since the French forces also were engaged in warfare elsewhere this increasingly reduced the number of troops stationed around Stralsund. When the Swedes were reinforced on 1 April it was decided that they would attempt to break the siege. This was done with some success since the Swedes managed to take [[Usedom]] and [[Wolin]]. But the French chose to counterattack, and a force of 13,000 men attacked the Swedes from [[Stettin]] on 16 April. This forced the left section of the Swedish army to withdraw, and another division in [[Ueckerm\u00fcnde]] was then cut off and later captured. On 18 April, France and Sweden agreed on a ceasefire according to which the French were to leave [[Pomerania]]. However, the Swedish government refused to join the [[Continental System]] and denounced the armistice under the influence of British diplomacy on 8 July.\n\nOn 6 August 1807, 50,000 French, Spanish and Dutch troops under Marshal [[Guillaume-Marie-Anne Brune]] began an assault on Swedish Pomerania and besieged Stralsund again. On 20 August 1807, the defenders of the city capitulated and the remains of the Swedish army was surrounded at [[R\u00fcgen]].  However, Swedish General [[Johan Christopher Toll]] managed to conclude the convention of Schlatkow with Marshal Brune on favorable terms and his forces withdrew to Sweden with all of their munitions of war on 7 September.<ref>Sundberg, Ulf(2002), page 357-362</ref>\n\n===Franco-Russian treaty===\nThe Franco-Russian [[Treaty of Tilsit]] left Britain and Sweden without other allies in the war against France. On 21 February 1808, Russia joined the war against Sweden by invading [[Finnish War|Finland]] and on 14 March the same year, Denmark-Norway also [[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809|declared war]] on Sweden. Danish and French-Spanish troops began preparations for an invasion of [[Sk\u00e5ne]] in Sweden, but the plan was soon aborted, and the war was instead directed to the Norwegian-Swedish border. [[John Moore (British Army officer)|Sir John Moore]]'s expedition sent by the British government to protect Sweden from possible French-Danish attack arrived on 3 May 1808 and stayed until July when it was redirected to Portugal.\n\nNapoleon's plans to invade Sweden was never realized due to the British activity on the [[Baltic Sea]], the weakness of the Danish military and hesitations of French Marshal [[Charles XIV John of Sweden|Bernadotte]]. Bernadotte's actions made him popular enough to be elected as a Swedish [[Crown Prince]] after the [[coup d'\u00e9tat]] in March 1809.  On 30 August 1809, the new Swedish government was to conclude the [[Treaty of Fredrikshamn]] with Russia legitimizing the Russian annexation of Finland and [[\u00c5land]]. A peace treaty between Sweden and Denmark-Norway was signed with no territorial adjustments on 10 December 1809.\n\n==Aftermath==\nOn 6 January 1810, Sweden signed a Russian-mediated [[Treaty of Paris (1810)|Treaty of Paris]] with France regaining Pomerania, at a cost of joining the [[Continental System]]. On 17 November 1810, Sweden was forced to declare [[Anglo-Swedish War (1810\u20131812)|war against Britain]] and all British goods in Swedish Pomerania were seized. The government-supported smuggling continued, however, over the [[North Sea]] and the English fleet was informed that it would be a phantom war. The war lasted until 1812 and no military action was taken.\n\n==See also==\n*[[English Wars (Scandinavia)]]\n**[[Gunboat War]]\n**[[Dano-Swedish War of 1808-1809]]\n*[[Finnish War]]\n*[[Second War against Napoleon]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n== References ==\n*''[https://web.archive.org/web/20111004032717/http://www.hjle.se/webbsidor/ku_gustav_adolf1805.htm The War against Napoleon: 1805\u20131810]'' on [http://www.hjle.se/ Lennart Hjelm]\n\n===Literature===\n*Lindqvist, Herman(2004) \u2013 ''Napoleon'' (Schibsted forlagene) {{ISBN|978-82-516-2157-1}}\n*Sundberg, Ulf(2002) \u2013 ''Svenska krig, 1521\u20131814'' (Hjalmarson & H\u00f6gberg) {{ISBN|91-89080-14-9}}\n\n{{Napoleonic Wars}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:First War Against Napoleon}}\n[[Category:Wars involving Sweden|Napoleon, First War]]\n[[Category:19th century in Sweden]]\n[[Category:France\u2013Sweden relations]]\n[[Category:Wars involving France]]\n[[Category:Napoleonic Wars]]\n", "name_user": "EmilHenriksson61", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Franco-Swedish_War"}
