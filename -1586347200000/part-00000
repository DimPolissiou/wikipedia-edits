He later became a semi-regular on ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (from 1989 to 1990) as Neal Tanner. He guest-hosted a special episode of ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Super Sloppy Double Dare]]'' in 1989 where host [[Marc Summers]] and announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] played against each other. The game ended with both Summers and Harvey playing the Obstacle Course and winning all eight prizes for their respective civilian teammates. Stage assistants Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar guest-announced that episode.\n\nAfter ''ALF'' went off the air in 1990, Bullock remained active with [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] work. He briefly hosted a syndicated [[talk show]] with ex-[[televangelist]] [[Tammy Faye Messner]]. The ''Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show'' debuted in 1996, but Messner exited the program a few months later following a cancer diagnosis. Bullock continued with new co-host, Ann Abernathy, and the show became ''The Jim J. and Ann Show'' until it was canceled.\n\nBullock was the voice of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' in the animated series of cartoons of the same name which have appeared on both the [[internet]] and the cable TV network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In 2000, Bullock was a regular panelist on the revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He also performed on the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' as Wilbur Turnblad, a role he took to the Broadway stage starting September 18, 2007. Some of his other noteworthy roles include the pilled-up narcoleptic Prince [[Valium]] in the 1987 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the \"Not-Quite-Out-of-the-Closet\" character in the date montage at the beginning of 2001's ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. From 2004 to 2007, he had a recurring role as Mr. Monroe, a teacher at the fictional James K.

Bullock\") and was a regular guest on [[John Davidson (entertainer)|John Davidson]]'s updated version of ''[[Hollywood Squares]]''; Bullock occasionally substituted for Davidson as host.<ref name=\"av140615\">{{cite news |first1=Marah |last1=Eakin |first2=John |last2=Teti |first3=Erik |last3=Adams |newspaper=[[The A.V.

He later became a semi-regular on ''[[ALF (TV series)|ALF]]'' (from 1989 to 1990) as Neal Tanner. He guest-hosted a special episode of ''[[Double Dare (Nickelodeon game show)|Super Sloppy Double Dare]]'' in 1989 where host [[Marc Summers]] and announcer [[Harvey (announcer)|Harvey]] played against each other. The game ended with both Summers and Harvey playing the Obstacle Course and winning all eight prizes for their respective civilian teammates. Stage assistants Robin Marrella and Dave Shikiar guest-announced that episode.\n\nAfter ''ALF'' went off the air in 1990, Bullock remained active with [[theatre]], [[television]], and [[film]] work. He briefly hosted a syndicated [[talk show]] with ex-[[televangelist]] [[Tammy Faye Messner]]. The ''Jim J. and Tammy Faye Show'' debuted in 1996, but Messner exited the program a few months later following a cancer diagnosis. Bullock continued with new co-host, Ann Abernathy, and the show became ''The Jim J. and Ann Show'' until it was canceled.\n\nBullock was the voice of ''[[Queer Duck]]'' in the animated series of cartoons of the same name which have appeared on both the [[internet]] and the cable TV network [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. In 2000, Bullock was a regular panelist on the revival of ''[[I've Got a Secret]]''. He also performed on the national tour of the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] production ''[[Hairspray (musical)|Hairspray]]'' as Wilbur Turnblad, a role he took to the Broadway stage starting September 18, 2007. Some of his other noteworthy roles include the pilled-up narcoleptic Prince [[Valium]] in the 1987 [[Mel Brooks]] movie ''[[Spaceballs]]'', and the \"Not-Quite-Out-of-the-Closet\" character in the date montage at the beginning of 2001's ''[[Kissing Jessica Stein]]''. From 2004 to 2007, he had a recurring role as Mr. Monroe, a teacher at the fictional James K. Polk Middle School on the [[Nickelodeon]] live action sitcom ''[[Ned's Declassified School Survival Guide]]''.\n\n==Personal life==\nIn 1985, while ''Too Close For Comfort'' was being retooled as ''The Ted Knight Show'', Bullock learned that he was [[HIV]] positive.

Wikimedia Commons itself does not allow fair use or uploads under non-free licenses, including licenses which restrict commercial use of materials or disallow derivative works. For this reason, Wikimedia Commons always hosts freely licensed media and deletes copyright violations. Licenses that are acceptable include the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution and Attribution/ShareAlike licenses,<ref name=\"CCL\" /> other free content and [[free software]] licenses, and the [[public domain]].\n\nThe default language for Commons is English, but registered users can customize their interface to use any other available user interface translations. Many content pages, in particular policy pages and portals, have also been translated into various languages. Files on Wikimedia Commons are categorized using MediaWiki's category system. In addition, they are often collected on individual topical gallery pages. While the project was originally proposed to also contain free text files, these continue to be hosted on a sister project, [[Wikisource]].\n\n== Controversial content ==\nThe site has been criticized for hosting large amounts of amateur pornography, often uploaded by [[exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] who exploit the site for personal gratification, and who are enabled by sympathetic administrators.<ref name=\"Daily Dot Pricasso\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/wikimedia-commons-photos-jimmy-wales-broken/ |title=The Daily Dot \u2013 How Wikimedia Commons became a massive amateur porn hub}}</ref> In 2012, [[BuzzFeed]] described Wikimedia Commons as \"littered with dicks\".<ref name=\"BuzzFeed dicks\">{{cite web| url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jackstuef/inside-the-seedy-world-of-wikipedia-exhibitionism |title=The Epic Battle For Wikipedia's Autofellatio Page}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]] [[Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons|reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI]] for hosting sexualized images of children known as \"lolicon\". After this was reported in the media, [[Jimmy Wales]], founder of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] which hosts Commons, used his administrator status to delete several images without discussion from the Commons community. Wales responded to the backlash from the Commons community by voluntarily relinquishing some site privileges, including the ability to delete files.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20005082-93.html |title=<nowiki>Wikimedia's Wales gives up some top-level controls | Internet & Media - CNET News</nowiki>}}</ref>\n\n== Utilities ==\n\nOver time, additional functionality has been developed to interface Wikimedia Commons with the other Wikimedia projects. Daniel Kinzler wrote applications for finding appropriate categories for uploaded files (\"CommonSense\"), determining the usage of files across the Wikimedia projects (\"CheckUsage\"), locating images with missing copyright information (\"UntaggedImages\"), and relaying information about administrative actions such as deletions to the relevant wikis (\"{{Srlink|Commons:Commons:Tools|CommonsTicker}}\").\n\nSpecialized uploading tools and scripts such as \"[[:commons:Commons:Tools/Commonist|Commonist]]\" have been created to simplify the process of uploading large numbers of files. At one time, in order to review free content photos uploaded to [[Flickr]], users could participate in a now-defunct collaborative external review process (\"{{Srlink|Commons:User:FlickrLickr|FlickrLickr}}\"), which resulted in more than 10,000 uploads to Commons.<ref name=\"Flickr\" />{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2016}}\n<!-- Media on Commons which is tagged with [[Geographic coordinate system|decimal coordinates]] has a [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] on its page there. -->\n\n=== Structured Data ===\nStructured Data on Commons (SDC) is a three-year [[Software development process|software development project]] funded by the [[Sloan Foundation]] to provide the infrastructure for Wikimedia Commons volunteers to organize data about media files in a consistent. This data is structured more, and is made [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]]. The goals of the functionality are to make contributing to Commons easier by providing new ways to edit, curate, and write [[software]] for Commons, and to make general use of Commons easier by expanding capabilities in [[Search engine technology|search]] and reuse.<ref>https://wikimania2017.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Structured_Commons:_what_changes_are_coming%3F</ref><ref>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data</ref>\n\n== Quality ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Featured picture nominations per month in Wikimedia Commons.svg|thumb|Successful featured picture nominations per month (2004-2017)]]\nThe site has three mechanisms for recognizing quality works. One is known as \"[[commons:Commons:Featured pictures|Featured pictures]]\", where works are nominated and other community members vote to accept or reject the nomination. This process began in November 2004. Another process known as \"[[commons:Commons:Quality Images|Quality images]]\" began in June 2006, and has a simpler nomination process comparable to \"Featured pictures\". \"Quality images\" only accepts works created by Wikimedia users, whereas \"Featured pictures\" additionally accepts nominations of works by third parties such as NASA. A third image assessment project, known as \"[[commons:Commons:Valued images|Valued images]]\", began on June 1, 2008 with the purpose of recognizing \"the most valued illustration of its kind\", in contrast to the other two processes which assess images mainly on technical quality.\n\nThe three mentioned processes select a slight part (less than 0.1%) from the total number of files. However, Commons collects files of all quality levels, from the most professional level across simple documental and amateur files up to files of very poor quality. Generally, Commons is not a competition but a collection; a quality of the description and organization of files and their descriptive and informational benefits are often more relevant than technical or artistic perfection of the files. Files with specific defects can be tagged for improvement and warning or even proposed for deletion but there exists no process of systematic rating of all files.\n\nThe site held its inaugural \"Picture of the Year\" competition, for 2006. All images that were made a Featured picture during 2006 were eligible, and voted on by eligible [[Wikimedia movement]] members during two rounds of voting. The winning picture was a picture of the [[Aurora Borealis]] over snowlands, taken by an airman from the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]].

Wikimedia Commons itself does not allow fair use or uploads under non-free licenses, including licenses which restrict commercial use of materials or disallow derivative works. For this reason, Wikimedia Commons always hosts freely licensed media and deletes copyright violations. Licenses that are acceptable include the [[Creative Commons license|Creative Commons]] Attribution and Attribution/ShareAlike licenses,<ref name=\"CCL\" /> other free content and [[free software]] licenses, and the [[public domain]].\n\nThe default language for Commons is English, but registered users can customize their interface to use any other available user interface translations. Many content pages, in particular policy pages and portals, have also been translated into various languages. Files on Wikimedia Commons are categorized using MediaWiki's category system. In addition, they are often collected on individual topical gallery pages. While the project was originally proposed to also contain free text files, these continue to be hosted on a sister project, [[Wikisource]].\n\n== Controversial content ==\nThe site has been criticized for hosting large amounts of amateur pornography, often uploaded by [[exhibitionism|exhibitionists]] who exploit the site for personal gratification, and who are enabled by sympathetic administrators.<ref name=\"Daily Dot Pricasso\">{{cite web |url=http://www.dailydot.com/technology/wikimedia-commons-photos-jimmy-wales-broken/ |title=The Daily Dot \u2013 How Wikimedia Commons became a massive amateur porn hub}}</ref> In 2012, [[BuzzFeed]] described Wikimedia Commons as \"littered with dicks\".<ref name=\"BuzzFeed dicks\">{{cite web| url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/jackstuef/inside-the-seedy-world-of-wikipedia-exhibitionism |title=The Epic Battle For Wikipedia's Autofellatio Page}}</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Wikipedia co-founder [[Larry Sanger]] [[Reporting of child pornography images on Wikimedia Commons|reported Wikimedia Commons to the FBI]] for hosting sexualized images of children known as \"lolicon\". After this was reported in the media, [[Jimmy Wales]], founder of the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] which hosts Commons, used his administrator status to delete several images without discussion from the Commons community. Wales responded to the backlash from the Commons community by voluntarily relinquishing some site privileges, including the ability to delete files.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-1023_3-20005082-93.html |title=<nowiki>Wikimedia's Wales gives up some top-level controls | Internet & Media - CNET News</nowiki>}}</ref>\n\n== Utilities ==\n\nOver time, additional functionality has been developed to interface Wikimedia Commons with the other Wikimedia projects. Daniel Kinzler wrote applications for finding appropriate categories for uploaded files (\"CommonSense\"), determining the usage of files across the Wikimedia projects (\"CheckUsage\"), locating images with missing copyright information (\"UntaggedImages\"), and relaying information about administrative actions such as deletions to the relevant wikis (\"{{Srlink|Commons:Commons:Tools|CommonsTicker}}\").\n\nSpecialized uploading tools and scripts such as \"[[:commons:Commons:Tools/Commonist|Commonist]]\" have been created to simplify the process of uploading large numbers of files. At one time, in order to review free content photos uploaded to [[Flickr]], users could participate in a now-defunct collaborative external review process (\"{{Srlink|Commons:User:FlickrLickr|FlickrLickr}}\"), which resulted in more than 10,000 uploads to Commons.<ref name=\"Flickr\" />{{Failed verification|date=June 2013}}{{Dead link|date=April 2016}}\n<!-- Media on Commons which is tagged with [[Geographic coordinate system|decimal coordinates]] has a [[Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] on its page there. -->\n\n=== Structured Data ===\nStructured Data on Commons (SDC) is a three-year [[Software development process|software development project]] funded by the [[Sloan Foundation]] to provide the infrastructure for Wikimedia Commons volunteers to organize data about media files in a consistent. This data is structured more, and is made [[Machine-readable data|machine-readable]]. The goals of the functionality are to make contributing to Commons easier by providing new ways to edit, curate, and write [[software]] for Commons, and to make general use of Commons easier by expanding capabilities in [[Search engine technology|search]] and reuse.<ref>https://wikimania2017.wikimedia.org/wiki/Submissions/Structured_Commons:_what_changes_are_coming%3F</ref><ref>https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Commons:Structured_data</ref>\n\n== Quality ==\n{{unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}\n[[File:Featured picture nominations per month in Wikimedia Commons.svg|thumb|Successful featured picture nominations per month (2004-2017)]]\nThe site has three mechanisms for recognizing quality works. One is known as \"[[commons:Commons:Featured pictures|Featured pictures]]\", where works are nominated and other community members vote to accept or reject the nomination. This process began in November 2004. Another process known as \"[[commons:Commons:Quality Images|Quality images]]\" began in June 2006, and has a simpler nomination process comparable to \"Featured pictures\". \"Quality images\" only accepts works created by Wikimedia users, whereas \"Featured pictures\" additionally accepts nominations of works by third parties such as NASA. A third image assessment project, known as \"[[commons:Commons:Valued images|Valued images]]\", began on June 1, 2008 with the purpose of recognizing \"the most valued illustration of its kind\", in contrast to the other two processes which assess images mainly on technical quality.\n\nThe three mentioned processes select a slight part (less than 0.1%) from the total number of files. However, Commons collects files of all quality levels, from the most professional level across simple documental and amateur files up to files of very poor quality. Generally, Commons is not a competition but a collection; a quality of the description and organization of files and their descriptive and informational benefits are often more relevant than technical or artistic perfection of the files. Files with specific defects can be tagged for improvement and warning or even proposed for deletion but there exists no process of systematic rating of all files.\n\nThe site held its inaugural \"Picture of the Year\" competition, for 2006. All images that were made a Featured picture during 2006 were eligible, and voted on by eligible [[Wikimedia movement]] members during two rounds of voting. The winning picture was a picture of the [[Aurora Borealis]] over snowlands, taken by an airman from the [[United States Air Force|U.S. Air Force]]. The competition has since become an annual event.\n\n===Wikimedia Commons Pictures of the Year===\nThe [[:c:POTY|Commons Picture of the Year]] is a [[competition]] that was first run in [[2006]].

Its main memory pool is 512&nbsp;MB<ref>1 MB = 1024<sup>2</sup> B</ref> in size.\n\n== Central processing unit ==\n<!-- [[File:IBMxenon.jpg|200px|thumb|Xbox 360 CPU with some thermal paste left on it]] -->\n{{Main|Xenon (processor)}}\n\nThe Xbox 360 took a different approach to hardware compared to its predecessor. The XCPU, named '''[[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]]''' at Microsoft and \"Waternoose\" at IBM, is a custom triple-core 64-bit [[PowerPC]]-based design by [[IBM]]. The CPU emphasized high [[floating point]] performance through multiple [[Floating point unit|FPU]] and [[SIMD]] [[vector processor]]s in each core.\nThe SIMD vector processor (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox to include a [[dot-product instruction]]. The dot-product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions. The VMX128 was also modified by the addition of direct 3D (D3D) compressed data format. This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2&nbsp;[[gigaFLOPS|GFLOPS]], being capable of 9.6 billion [[dot product]]s per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of [[simultaneous multithreading]] and was [[Clock rate|clocked]] at 3.2&nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]]. However, to reduce CPU die size, complexity, cost, and power demands, the processor used [[Out of order execution#In-order processors|in-order execution]] in contrast to the [[Intel]] Coppermine 128-based [[Pentium III]] used in the original Xbox, which used more complex [[out-of-order execution]]. The original chip used a [[90 nanometer|90&nbsp;nm process]], although a newer [[65 nanometer|65&nbsp;nm process]] [[Silicon on insulator|SOI]] revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45&nbsp;nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6&nbsp;GB/s [[front side bus]], aggregated 10.8&nbsp;GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/[[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]]. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] [[Level 2 cache]] on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign|title=Application-customized CPU design: The Microsoft Xbox 360 CPU Story|last=Brown|first=Jeffrey|date=2005-12-06|publisher=[[IBM]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922003151/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign|archive-date=2006-09-22|url-status=dead|accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref> Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of [[aluminum]] fins with a [[copper]] base, and a [[heat pipe]]. Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the heat pipe or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70&nbsp;mm fans at the rear of the console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 S consoles. There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by [[Nidec]], Sunon and Delta Electronics.\n\n== CPU data streaming ==\nDuring read streaming into the CPU, a custom prefetch instruction, extended data cache block touch (xDCBT) prefetches data directly to the L1 data cache of the intended core, which skips putting the data in the L2 cache to avoid [[Thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] the L2 cache. Writes streaming from each core skip the L1 cache, due to its no-write allocation (avoids thrashing of high-bandwidth, transient, write-only data streams on the L1 cache), and goes directly to the L2 cache.\nThe system allows for the GPU to directly read data produced by the CPU without going to main memory. In this specific case of data streaming, called Xbox procedural synthesis (XPS), the CPU is effectively a data decompressor, generating geometry on-the-fly for consumption by the GPU 3D core.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Jeff|last2=Baker|first2=Nick|date=2006-04-26|title=Xbox 360 System Architecture|url=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall08/papers/xbox-system.pdf|url-status=live|journal=[[IEEE Micro]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=25\u201337|doi=10.1109/MM.2006.45|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808222216/https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall08/papers/xbox-system.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-08|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>\n\n== Graphics processing unit ==\n{{Main|Xenos (graphics chip)}}\nWhile the first Xbox's [[graphics processing unit]] was produced by [[Nvidia]], the Xbox 360 had a chip designed by [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] called '''Xenos'''.

It has a theoretical peak of 240 [[GigaFLOPS|GFLOPS]]. Due to the GPU frequently overheating in early motherboard models, Microsoft revised the GPU [[heat sink]] in order to eliminate thermal throttling.\n\n== Memory and system bandwidth ==\n[[File:XBox 360 bandwidth and hardware.png|thumb|Xbox 360 bandwidth and hardware scheme.]]\nThe console features 512&nbsp;MB of [[GDDR3]] [[Random access memory|RAM]] clocked at 700&nbsp;MHz with an [[Double data rate|effective transmission rate]] of 1.4&nbsp;GHz on a [[128-bit]] bus. The memory is shared by the CPU and the GPU via the [[Shared Memory Architecture|unified memory architecture]]. This memory is produced by either [[Samsung]] or [[Qimonda]].\n\nAccording to [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]] of [[Epic Games]], Microsoft had originally planned on using only 256&nbsp;MB of RAM, but the decision to increase it was based on Epic's upcoming ''[[Gears of War]]'' title. Epic had been arguing for Microsoft to increase the memory for some time, and [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] had sent Microsoft screenshots of what ''Gears'' would look like at 256&nbsp;MB, and then at their proposed 512&nbsp;MB. Shortly thereafter, Epic was the first studio told of new 512&nbsp;MB size specification and claimed it cost them a billion dollars but felt it was better for gamers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news241006gears | title = Gears cost MS a billion dollars | first = Tom | last = Bramwell | date = October 24, 2006 | accessdate = February 8, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox 360 has an extensive amount of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] in comparison to its competition;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/20/e3-2005-microsofts-xbox-360-vs-sonys-playstation-3|title=E3 2005: Microsoft's Xbox 360 vs. Sony's PlayStation 3|last=Douglass C.|first=Perry|date=2005-05-20|work=[[IGN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926001904/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/617/617951p1.html|archive-date=2006-09-26|url-status=live|accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref> however, this statistic includes the [[eDRAM]] logic to memory bandwidth, and not internal CPU bandwidths.

The console works with over 256 audio channels and 320 independent decompression channels using [[32-bit]] processing for audio, with support for 48&nbsp;kHz 16-bit sound. Sound files for games are encoded using Microsoft's [[XMA audio format]]. An [[MPEG-2]] decoder is included for DVD video playback. [[VC-1]] or [[Windows Media Video|WMV]] is used for [[streaming video]] and other video is compressed using VC-1 at non-[[High-definition television|HD]] [[NTSC]] and [[PAL]] resolutions or [[WMV HD]]. The Xbox 360 also supports [[H.263]] and [[H.264]] [[MPEG-4]] videos. Unlike the original Xbox, voice communication is handled by the console, not by the game code, allowing for cross-game communication. There is no voice echo to game players on the same console; voice only goes to remote consoles.\n\nInitially there were no digital video outputs such as [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] on the Xbox 360; instead, HD-quality output could only be produced over [[YPbPr|{{YPbPr}}]] [[component video]] (used by both the 3 RCA component cable and the Japanese [[D-terminal]] cable) and later [[VGA]] (via a software update). An HDMI port was introduced to the Xbox 360 by July 2007 with the introduction of the ''Elite'' model. All Xbox 360 [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]]s currently manufactured feature an HDMI port.

This was upgraded to 60&nbsp;GB in September 2008, and the 60&nbsp;GB HDD was also made available at retail. In April 2007, Microsoft released the ''Elite'' console, which included a black 120&nbsp;GB HDD; a grey 120&nbsp;GB drive was also later made available at retail. In November 2009, Microsoft released the \"Super Elite\" console, as a bundle with the highly anticipated game [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]. This console was like the typical black ''Elite'', but with ''Call of Duty'' graphics added and for the first time included a 250&nbsp;GB hard drive (which holds up to 228&nbsp;GB of data after system information is stored).

The initial motherboard version was known as \"Xenon\" and used a 203&nbsp;[[watt]] power supply, and lacked an [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] video port. Later models had an improved GPU heatsink. The \"Zephyr\" revision was a redesigned motherboard adding the HANA{{ref|a}} and HDMI, but used the same 90&nbsp;nm CPU as the Xenon. It did howerver, move to an 80&nbsp;nm GPU and eDRAM, with an improved GPU heatsink. The \"Falcon\" incorporated a newer 65&nbsp;nm CPU, and required less power so it came packaged with a 175&nbsp;watt power supply. \"Jasper\" (released late November 2008) used both a 65&nbsp;nm CPU and GPU, as well as 16, 256 or 512&nbsp;MB of on-board flash memory.

The \"Jasper\" revision required even less power, and so the power supply was also reduced to 150 watts. The \"Kronos\" revision is a minor upgrade of the \"Jasper\", moving to a new \"Kronos1\" GPU with a 65&nbsp;nm eDRAM, and adding a new Ring of Light/RF board called \"XFreedom\". Due to all dies now being at 65&nbsp;nm, the GPU heatsink returned to the original one used on the \"Xenon\".

In August 2014, the \"Winchester\" model was released, with a new XCGPU. This chip removes the heatspreader and integrated the eDRAM into the main die on the XCGPU.

The Xbox 360&nbsp;E has four ports (two on the front, two on the back) and a dedicated Kinect port. These are used for connection of accessories such as wired [[Xbox 360 controller|controllers]], the wireless networking adapter, the [[Xbox Live Vision|Xbox Live Vision camera]] and USB storage devices. Although the number of wired controllers is limited by the number of ports, up to four may be used through the use of a [[USB hub]].\n\nThe Xbox 360 also features wireless connectivity of accessories via a proprietary 2.4&nbsp;GHz radio system. This is mainly used to connect the official wireless controllers, but is also used for other devices such as the wireless racing wheel and [[Xbox 360 Wireless Headset|wireless headsets]]. With the exception of some [[rhythm game]] controllers, and the Fanatec CSR wheel, this wireless connectivity is limited to first-party Microsoft accessories.\n\nThe Xbox 360 can connect to Xbox Live over the Internet through a variety of [[#Networking|networking interfaces]].\n\nOriginal style consoles also have two front-mounted [[memory card]] slots for the system's proprietary Memory Unit. These can be used to transfer profile and game data from one Xbox 360 to another. Memory Units up to 512&nbsp;MB are available from Microsoft. The \"Arcade\" model formerly came with a 256&nbsp;MB Memory Unit, but with the Jasper motherboard revision of September 2008, the \"Arcade\" model began to include 256&nbsp;MB of built-in flash memory. This was later increased to 512&nbsp;MB. The memory card slots were replaced with USB ports on the newer Xbox 360 S models.\n\nThe Universal Media Remote can be used to control several functions of the console, including the [[Windows Media Center]] functions if connected to the network. It communicates with the console via [[infrared]] through a receiver port on the front of the console.\n\nAll standard controllers for the system feature a 2.5&nbsp;mm headset [[TRS connector|jack]] to allow the use of wired headsets for voice chatting. They also feature a custom USB connector, which is currently only used for connection of the chatpad keyboard accessory.\n\nVarious other accessories for the console exist, such as decorative faceplates to change the physical appearance of the console.\n\n== Physical appearance ==\n[[File:Xbox-360-Consoles-Infobox.png|thumb|left|Left: Xbox 360 Elite, Right: Xbox 360 S with new-style controller]]\nThe physical outline of the original style Xbox 360 is {{convert|31|\u00d7|8|\u00d7|26.8|cm|in}}<ref name=\"OfficialTechSpecs\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/Hardware/Specifications/ConsoleSpecifications.aspx|title=Xbox 360 Technical Specifications|publisher=Microsoft|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224042833/http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/Hardware/Specifications/ConsoleSpecifications.aspx|archive-date=2008-12-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> and is similar in [[Comparison of computer form factors|form factor]] to its predecessor.

Its main memory pool is 512&nbsp;MB<ref>1 MB = 1024<sup>2</sup> B</ref> in size.\n\n== Central processing unit ==\n<!-- [[File:IBMxenon.jpg|200px|thumb|Xbox 360 CPU with some thermal paste left on it]] -->\n{{Main|Xenon (processor)}}\n\nThe Xbox 360 took a different approach to hardware compared to its predecessor. The XCPU, named '''[[Xenon (processor)|Xenon]]''' at Microsoft and \"Waternoose\" at IBM, is a custom triple-core 64-bit [[PowerPC]]-based design by [[IBM]]. The CPU emphasized high [[floating point]] performance through multiple [[Floating point unit|FPU]] and [[SIMD]] [[vector processor]]s in each core.\nThe SIMD vector processor (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox to include a [[dot-product instruction]]. The dot-product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions. The VMX128 was also modified by the addition of direct 3D (D3D) compressed data format. This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2&nbsp;[[gigaFLOPS|GFLOPS]], being capable of 9.6 billion [[dot product]]s per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of [[simultaneous multithreading]] and was [[Clock rate|clocked]] at 3.2&nbsp;[[Hertz|GHz]]. However, to reduce CPU die size, complexity, cost, and power demands, the processor used [[Out of order execution#In-order processors|in-order execution]] in contrast to the [[Intel]] Coppermine 128-based [[Pentium III]] used in the original Xbox, which used more complex [[out-of-order execution]]. The original chip used a [[90 nanometer|90&nbsp;nm process]], although a newer [[65 nanometer|65&nbsp;nm process]] [[Silicon on insulator|SOI]] revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45&nbsp;nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6&nbsp;GB/s [[front side bus]], aggregated 10.8&nbsp;GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/[[Northbridge (computing)|northbridge]]. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1&nbsp;[[Megabyte|MB]] [[Level 2 cache]] on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign|title=Application-customized CPU design: The Microsoft Xbox 360 CPU Story|last=Brown|first=Jeffrey|date=2005-12-06|publisher=[[IBM]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060922003151/http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/power/library/pa-fpfxbox/?ca=dgr-lnxw07XBoxDesign|archive-date=2006-09-22|url-status=dead|accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref> Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of [[aluminum]] fins with a [[copper]] base, and a [[heat pipe]]. Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the heat pipe or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70&nbsp;mm fans at the rear of the console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 S consoles. There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by [[Nidec Corporation|Nidec]], Sunon and Delta Electronics.\n\n== CPU data streaming ==\nDuring read streaming into the CPU, a custom prefetch instruction, extended data cache block touch (xDCBT) prefetches data directly to the L1 data cache of the intended core, which skips putting the data in the L2 cache to avoid [[Thrashing (computer science)|thrashing]] the L2 cache. Writes streaming from each core skip the L1 cache, due to its no-write allocation (avoids thrashing of high-bandwidth, transient, write-only data streams on the L1 cache), and goes directly to the L2 cache.\nThe system allows for the GPU to directly read data produced by the CPU without going to main memory. In this specific case of data streaming, called Xbox procedural synthesis (XPS), the CPU is effectively a data decompressor, generating geometry on-the-fly for consumption by the GPU 3D core.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Jeff|last2=Baker|first2=Nick|date=2006-04-26|title=Xbox 360 System Architecture|url=https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall08/papers/xbox-system.pdf|url-status=live|journal=[[IEEE Micro]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=25\u201337|doi=10.1109/MM.2006.45|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170808222216/https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~milom/cis501-Fall08/papers/xbox-system.pdf|archive-date=2017-08-08|accessdate=2013-01-24}}</ref>\n\n== Graphics processing unit ==\n{{Main|Xenos (graphics chip)}}\nWhile the first Xbox's [[graphics processing unit]] was produced by [[Nvidia]], the Xbox 360 had a chip designed by [[ATI Technologies|ATI]] called '''Xenos'''.

This memory is produced by either [[Samsung]] or [[Qimonda]].\n\nAccording to [[Mark Rein (software executive)|Mark Rein]] of [[Epic Games]], Microsoft had originally planned on using only 256&nbsp;MB of RAM, but the decision to increase it was based on Epic's upcoming ''[[Gears of War]]'' title. Epic had been arguing for Microsoft to increase the memory for some time, and [[Tim Sweeney (game developer)|Tim Sweeney]] had sent Microsoft screenshots of what ''Gears'' would look like at 256&nbsp;MB, and then at their proposed 512&nbsp;MB. Shortly thereafter, Epic was the first studio told of new 512&nbsp;MB size specification and claimed it cost them a billion dollars but felt it was better for gamers.<ref>{{cite web | url = https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/news241006gears | title = Gears cost MS a billion dollars | first = Tom | last = Bramwell | date = October 24, 2006 | accessdate = February 8, 2020 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}</ref>\n\nThe Xbox 360 has an extensive amount of [[Bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]] in comparison to its competition;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2005/05/20/e3-2005-microsofts-xbox-360-vs-sonys-playstation-3|title=E3 2005: Microsoft's Xbox 360 vs. Sony's PlayStation 3|last=Douglass C.|first=Perry|date=2005-05-20|work=[[IGN]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926001904/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/617/617951p1.html|archive-date=2006-09-26|url-status=live|accessdate=2006-09-30}}</ref> however, this statistic includes the [[eDRAM]] logic to memory bandwidth, and not internal CPU bandwidths.

The Xbox 360 also supports [[H.263]] and [[H.264]] [[MPEG-4]] videos. Unlike the original Xbox, voice communication is handled by the console, not by the game code, allowing for cross-game communication. There is no voice echo to game players on the same console; voice only goes to remote consoles.\n\nInitially there were no digital video outputs such as [[Digital Visual Interface|DVI]] or [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] on the Xbox 360; instead, HD-quality output could only be produced over [[YPbPr|{{YPbPr}}]] [[component video]] (used by both the 3 RCA component cable and the Japanese [[D-terminal]] cable) and later [[VGA]] (via a software update). An HDMI port was introduced to the Xbox 360 by July 2007 with the introduction of the ''Elite'' model. All Xbox 360 [[Stock-keeping unit|SKU]]s currently manufactured feature an HDMI port.

This was upgraded to 60&nbsp;GB in September 2008, and the 60&nbsp;GB HDD was also made available at retail. In April 2007, Microsoft released the ''Elite'' console, which included a black 120&nbsp;GB HDD; a grey 120&nbsp;GB drive was also later made available at retail. In November 2009, Microsoft released the \"Super Elite\" console, as a bundle with the highly anticipated game [[Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2]]. This console was like the typical black ''Elite'', but with ''Call of Duty'' graphics added and for the first time included a 250&nbsp;GB hard drive (which holds up to 228&nbsp;GB of data after system information is stored). This was followed by various other 250&nbsp;GB special/limited edition bundles. No standard (non-special edition) configuration of the original console ever included a 250&nbsp;GB drive, but they were later made available at retail.\n\nIn June 2010, Microsoft announced a new version of the console, the Xbox 360 S, which used a new form factor for its 250&nbsp;GB hard drives. As such, original style hard drives cannot be used in Xbox 360 S consoles, and vice versa, without modification. In June 2011, Microsoft announced a specially branded \"Gears of War 3 Limited Collector's Edition\" Xbox 360 S console to coincide with the launch of [[Gears of War 3]].

The initial motherboard version was known as \"Xenon\" and used a 203&nbsp;[[watt]] power supply, and lacked an [[High-Definition Multimedia Interface|HDMI]] video port. Later models had an improved GPU heatsink. The \"Zephyr\" revision was a redesigned motherboard adding the HANA{{ref|a}} and HDMI, but used the same 90&nbsp;nm CPU as the Xenon. It did howerver, move to an 80&nbsp;nm GPU and eDRAM, with an improved GPU heatsink. The \"Falcon\" incorporated a newer 65&nbsp;nm CPU, and required less power so it came packaged with a 175&nbsp;watt power supply. \"Jasper\" (released late November 2008) used both a 65&nbsp;nm CPU and GPU, as well as 16, 256 or 512&nbsp;MB of on-board flash memory. (This was to help run a then-recent Dashboard update. Without the addition of this internal memory, a hard disk drive or memory card is required.) The \"Jasper\" revision required even less power, and so the power supply was also reduced to 150 watts. The \"Kronos\" revision is a minor upgrade of the \"Jasper\", moving to a new \"Kronos1\" GPU with a 65&nbsp;nm eDRAM, and adding a new Ring of Light/RF board called \"XFreedom\". Due to all dies now being at 65&nbsp;nm, the GPU heatsink returned to the original one used on the \"Xenon\". Xbox 360 S introduced a new motherboard version called \"Trinity\" with a 45&nbsp;nm integrated [[Xenon (processor)|CPU]], [[Xenos (graphics chip)|GPU]], and [[eDRAM]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2010/03/18/leaked-xbox-360-valhalla-motherboard-analyzed-by-ben-heck/|title=Leaked Xbox 360 'Valhalla' motherboard analyzed by Ben Heck|last=Miller|first=Ross|date=2010-03-18|website=[[Engadget]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180808043106/https://www.engadget.com/2010/03/18/leaked-xbox-360-valhalla-motherboard-analyzed-by-ben-heck/|archive-date=2018-08-08|url-status=live|accessdate=2012-09-19}}</ref> It consisted of 2 dies, one for the XCGPU, and one for the eDRAM. In 2011 a second model of the Xbox 360 S motherboard has been released known as \"Corona\" which integrates the HANA chip into the southbridge chip, and used either the traditional 16MB NAND, or a 4GB \"Phison\" eMMC. \"Corona\" was used in both the Xbox 360 S and Xbox 360 E. In August 2014, the \"Winchester\" model was released, with a new XCGPU. This chip removes the heatspreader and integrated the eDRAM into the main die on the XCGPU.

The Xbox 360&nbsp;E has four ports (two on the front, two on the back) and a dedicated Kinect port. These are used for connection of accessories such as wired [[Xbox 360 controller|controllers]], the wireless networking adapter, the [[Xbox Live Vision|Xbox Live Vision camera]] and USB storage devices. Although the number of wired controllers is limited by the number of ports, up to four may be used through the use of a [[USB hub]].\n\nThe Xbox 360 also features wireless connectivity of accessories via a proprietary 2.4&nbsp;GHz radio system. This is mainly used to connect the official wireless controllers, but is also used for other devices such as the wireless racing wheel and [[Xbox 360 Wireless Headset|wireless headsets]]. With the exception of some [[rhythm game]] controllers, and the Fanatec CSR wheel, this wireless connectivity is limited to first-party Microsoft accessories.\n\nThe Xbox 360 can connect to Xbox Live over the Internet through a variety of [[#Networking|networking interfaces]].\n\nOriginal style consoles also have two front-mounted [[memory card]] slots for the system's proprietary Memory Unit. These can be used to transfer profile and game data from one Xbox 360 to another. Memory Units up to 512&nbsp;MB are available from Microsoft. The \"Arcade\" model formerly came with a 256&nbsp;MB Memory Unit, but with the Jasper motherboard revision of September 2008, the \"Arcade\" model began to include 256&nbsp;MB of built-in flash memory. This was later increased to 512&nbsp;MB. The memory card slots were replaced with USB ports on the newer Xbox 360 S models.\n\nThe Universal Media Remote can be used to control several functions of the console, including the [[Windows Media Center]] functions if connected to the network. It communicates with the console via [[infrared]] through a receiver port on the front of the console.\n\nAll standard controllers for the system feature a 2.5&nbsp;mm headset [[TRS connector|jack]] to allow the use of wired headsets for voice chatting. They also feature a custom USB connector, which is currently only used for connection of the chatpad keyboard accessory.\n\nVarious other accessories for the console exist, such as decorative faceplates to change the physical appearance of the console.\n\n== Physical appearance ==\n[[File:Xbox-360-Consoles-Infobox.png|thumb|left|Left: Xbox 360 Elite, Right: Xbox 360 S with new-style controller]]\nThe physical outline of the original style Xbox 360 is {{convert|31|\u00d7|8|\u00d7|26.8|cm|in}}<ref name=\"OfficialTechSpecs\">{{Cite web|url=http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/Hardware/Specifications/ConsoleSpecifications.aspx|title=Xbox 360 Technical Specifications|publisher=Microsoft|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081224042833/http://support.xbox.com/support/en/us/nxe/Hardware/Specifications/ConsoleSpecifications.aspx|archive-date=2008-12-24|url-status=dead}}</ref> and is similar in [[Comparison of computer form factors|form factor]] to its predecessor.

When the lights turn red, the console has encountered an [[Xbox 360 Technical Problems|error]], with the number of sectors illuminated informing the user what category the error falls into. Since the redesign of the console removed the red LEDs, this error reporting system is no longer used.\n\nThe original Xbox 360 weighs approximately {{convert|3.5|kg|lb}},<ref name=\"OfficialTechSpecs\"/> about 350&nbsp;[[grams]] heavier than the new Xbox.
