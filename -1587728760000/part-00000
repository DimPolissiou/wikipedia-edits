The show also starred Debottam Majumdar, [[Anusuya Majumdar]], Rita Koyral, Sohini Sanyal and Diganta Bagchi in prominent supporting roles.\n\nThe show, that had been penned down by Leena Gangopadhyay, dealt with the heart-touching story of Mohor, a simple village girl having high intellect and a kind heart, who married the modern-day city boy Rohon, and how their relationship worked in the initial phase, and how after many misunderstandings and separation, Rohon realized his love for Mohor. However, Mohor didn't return to him and chose to love Rohon and keep his memory in her mind, but remained separated from him for lifelong. The show also encompassed how Mohor fulfilled her aspirations by becoming a doctor, and served the diseased people with all her effort and dedication, in her humanitarian profession. Later, the series showed how Mohor reunited with her estranged (long-lost) daughter, Lin; completing the heartfelt story of her life-journey.\n\nThroughout its run, ''Binni Dhaner Khoi'' remained one of the leading daily soaps of that time on [[Bengali language|Bengali]]  television, and had been received well widely by the masses.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.telegraphindia.com/1091206/jsp/graphiti/story_11823329.jsp|title=Small screen, big stars|website=telegraphindia.com|date= 6 December 2009}}</ref> Its time slot has varied over the years, first airing at 8:30 PM, then at the 8:45 PM time slot and finally at 9:00 PM IST. The show went off air in mid-2012.\n\n==Premise==\nThis tale encompasses and reflects the images of laughter and tears, joys and sorrows, trials and tribulations that make up the lives of three generations.\n17-year old Mohor is a simple, bubbly and lively village girl. Her elder sister Gini's marriage is fixed with the modern-day, learned, charming city boy Rohon, but Gini loves someone else and elopes with her lover on the day of her marriage. So, Mohor has to take Gini's place as the bride and thus, marries Rohon at such an early age, without even having the knowledge of marriage. Over the course of their relationship, Mohor matures as a person, develops a loving relationship with Rohon's family members, especially with Rohon's mother and his paternal grandmother, Ana. Mohor later on falls in love with Rohon, who too develops a close bond with Mohor but loves Kurchi instead, his colleague at work. Kurchi gets Mohor and Rohon divorced after many plotting and scheming, and herself becomes Rohon's second wife. However, Rohon soon gets to see the true colours of Kurchi and gets irritated with her, and his love for Kurchi vanishes as well. Instead, Rohon seems to realize his feelings for Mohor to be true love, not mere affection. He tries to reunite with Mohor, but Mohor in a fit of rage refuses him, but also acknowledges her own emotional turmoil for Rohon, though she sticks to her decision. Mohor now totally focuses on her medical studies, after she is given the help and assistance by a genuine good-hearted person, whom later Kurchi falls in love with and subsequently marries, after willingly divorcing Rohon. Mohor passes her medical last year exams with flying colours, becoming an [[M.B.B.S.]] doctor. Meanwhile, a new man, Rishi enters Mohor's life and he develops an unrequited love for Mohor, much to Rohon's chagrin. However, Mohor decides to neither reconnect with Rohon nor to accept Rishi's proposal of marriage and build up her individual existence by serving people as a doctor instead.\n\nRohon falls ill and seeks earnestly for Mohor, who now comes to his aid. One night, Rohon and Mohor get intimate, resulting in Mohor's pregnancy. However, Rohon soon dies from his vulnerable disease. Rishi stands by Mohor in this tough time and also requests Mohor to at least let him fulfill his duty as a friend by taking the responsibility of Mohor's baby. After an emotional confrontation, Ron confesses for the first time that she respects Rishi for what he is, how much important he is in her life and the fact that she loves Rishi, only next to Rohon. Rishi for one last time proposes Mohor to be his life partner, but Mohor, getting very emotional, refuses him once again; and they part ways. Few months later, Mohor gives birth to Rohon's daughter (Lin), but she is separated from Mohor at birth, adding more to her woes.\n\n===Parallel tracks===\nApart from showcasing Mohor's journey, the show also followed the story of some secondary characters, most notably Gini (Mohor's elder sister) and Ana (Rohon's grandmother). Like Mohor, Gini too didn't got true love in life and had to lead her life on her own as well, later on, becoming a primary school teacher. Ana's real name is Anwara Bibi and she was revealed to be a Muslim woman, a fact that was hard to accept for her own parents, in-las and family members. But, with Mohor's help, Ana finally obtained love and respect in her family, despite revealing her actual religion and heredity.\n\n===21 years later===\nThe story takes a \"21 years leap\",<ref name=\"Age is no barrier, feels Monami\">{{cite news|title=Age is no barrier, feels Monami|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/bengali/movies/news/Age-is-no-barrier-feels-Monami/articleshow/13253405.cms|date=11 January 2017|accessdate=19 August 2019|newspaper=The Times of India}}</ref> as it introduces some new characters, primarily Lin (Mohor and Rohon's grown-up daughter), who returns from [[US]] for conducting an assignment, but incidentally gets to know her roots and her true background.

Improved transport to the fertile [[Darling Downs]] region situated west of Toowoomba was seen as a priority. As adequate river transport was already established between the capital Brisbane and the then separate settlement of Ipswich, the railway commenced from the latter locality and the initial section, built over relatively flat, easy country opened to Bigge\u2019s Camp, at the eastern base of the Little Liverpool Range, on 31 July 1865. Called the Main Line, the only significant engineering work was the bridge over the Bremer River to North Ipswich.\n\nBuilt by the Queensland government to the unusual (for the time) gauge of {{RailGauge|3ft6in}}, the line largely followed the alignment surveyed by a private company, the Moreton Bay Tramway Company, which had proposed to build a {{Track gauge|impsg|allk=on}} horse-drawn tramway but had been unable to raise funds to do so beyond an initial start on earthworks.\n\nThe adoption of narrow gauge was controversial at the time, and was largely predicated by the government\u2019s desire for the fastest possible construction timeframe at least cost. This resulted in adoption of sharper curves and a lower axle load than was considered possible using standard gauge, and an assessment at the time put the cost of a narrow gauge line from Ipswich to Toowoomba as 25% of the cost of a standard gauge line. In a colony with a non-indigenous population of ~30,000 when the decision was made, it is understandable.\n\n===First tunnels===\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 244062 Engine 281 in the locomotive sheds at Ipswich.jpg|thumb|A14 281 in the locomotive sheds at Ipswich ~1890]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 244078 Goods train at the Toowoomba railway station.jpg|thumb|Goods train at the Toowoomba railway station ~1890]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 105468 Locomotive and carriages near Spring Bluff railway station, 1891.jpg|thumb|Spring Bluff station, located on the Main Line between Ipswich and Toowoomba, 1891]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 71911 Passenger train crossing Swanson's Bridge in the Toowoomba Range, ca. 1912.jpg|thumb|Passenger train crossing Swanson's Bridge on the Main Line, ca. 1912.

The measurement for the bridge is  {{convert|61|chain|m|abbr=on}}.

Two tunnels were required on the section to Laidley, known as \u2018Six Chain\u2019 (either because it is situated on a {{convert|6|chain|m|abbr=on|disp=or}} radius curve, or because it is {{convert|6|chain|m|1|abbr=on|disp=or}} to be exact) long, or both) and [[Victoria Tunnel, Queensland|\u2018Victoria\u2019]] after the English Queen of the day. The latter is {{convert|540|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and both remain in service, being the oldest single track railway tunnels still in use in Australia.\n \nFrom the western portal of the Victoria tunnel the line descends at 1 in 50 to [[Laidley, Queensland|Laidley]] and then over relatively flat (1 in 100 maximum grades) easy country to [[Gatton, Queensland|Gatton]] (opened 1 June 1866) and [[Helidon, Queensland|Helidon]] (opened 30 July 1866). This {{convert|38|km|mi|abbr=on}} section was duplicated in 1913-14, with the section from Laidley to Yarongmulu (just west of the Victoria Tunnel) being built to 1 in 60 for Brisbane bound trains.\n\n===Surmounting the main range===\n\nFrom Helidon the line climbs {{convert|369|m|ft}} in {{convert|26|km|mi|abbr=on}} up the Main Range to the summit at Harlaxton [{{convert|612|m|ft|disp=or}} [[above sea level]] (asl)] at an average grade of 1 in 70. However, as the maximum grade is 1 in 50 uncompensated with {{convert|100|m|chain|abbr=on}} radius curves, the ruling equivalent grade is 1 in 41, and the maximum speed on the entire section is {{convert|30|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}. This section was opened on 30 April 1867. As built the section contained 157 cuttings (up to {{convert|520|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} long and {{convert|16|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} deep), 128 embankments (up to {{convert|360|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} long and {{convert|13|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} high), 47 bridges (total length {{convert|1580|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}, up to {{convert|369|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} long and {{convert|22|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}} high), 175 culverts, 9 tunnels (total length {{convert|886|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}), 49 curves of {{convert|100|m|chain|abbr=on}} radius and a further 77 curves between {{convert|110|m|chain|abbr=on}} and {{convert|400|m|chain|abbr=on}} radius, with a total length of {{convert|17.7|km|mi|abbr=on}}, or 68% of the section.\n\n'''Comment on the design'''\n\nA 1995 report <ref>QR Network Access 'Improving clearances through tunnels: Grandchester to Toowoomba - Options review' June 1995</ref> commissioned by QR to investigate improving the clearance ([[loading gauge]]) through the tunnels so {{convert|2.9|m|ftin|abbr=on}} high ISO [[Intermodal container|containers]] could be accommodated includes a section commenting on the original design.

Improved transport to the fertile [[Darling Downs]] region situated west of Toowoomba was seen as a priority. As adequate river transport was already established between the capital Brisbane and the then separate settlement of Ipswich, the railway commenced from the latter locality and the initial section, built over relatively flat, easy country opened to Bigge\u2019s Camp, at the eastern base of the Little Liverpool Range, on 31 July 1865. Called the Main Line, the only significant engineering work was the bridge over the Bremer River to North Ipswich.\n\nBuilt by the Queensland government to the unusual (for the time) gauge of {{RailGauge|3ft6in}}, the line largely followed the alignment surveyed by a private company, the Moreton Bay Tramway Company, which had proposed to build a {{Track gauge|impsg|allk=on}} horse-drawn tramway but had been unable to raise funds to do so beyond an initial start on earthworks.\n\nThe adoption of narrow gauge was controversial at the time, and was largely predicated by the government\u2019s desire for the fastest possible construction timeframe at least cost. This resulted in adoption of sharper curves and a lower axle load than was considered possible using standard gauge, and an assessment at the time put the cost of a narrow gauge line from Ipswich to Toowoomba as 25% of the cost of a standard gauge line. In a colony with a non-indigenous population of ~30,000 when the decision was made, it is understandable.\n\n===First tunnels===\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 244062 Engine 281 in the locomotive sheds at Ipswich.jpg|thumb|A14 281 in the locomotive sheds at Ipswich ~1890]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 244078 Goods train at the Toowoomba railway station.jpg|thumb|Goods train at the Toowoomba railway station ~1890]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 105468 Locomotive and carriages near Spring Bluff railway station, 1891.jpg|thumb|Spring Bluff station, located on the Main Line between Ipswich and Toowoomba, 1891]]\n[[File:StateLibQld 1 71911 Passenger train crossing Swanson's Bridge in the Toowoomba Range, ca. 1912.jpg|thumb|Passenger train crossing Swanson's Bridge on the Main Line, ca. 1912.

Electrification has subsequently been extended to Rosewood, the limit of Brisbane urban rail services.\n\n==Branch lines==\n[[File:Dia 0222.jpg|thumb|The 2000 class railmotor set operating the Ipswich\u2013Helidon service waits between runs as QR loco 1576 passes on a westbound train at Helidon, 1987.

In 1912 the line was extended 7&nbsp;km to Mt Crosby adjacent to the Brisbane River to facilitate construction of a weir and water treatment plant, and then supply coal. The Mt Crosby section closed in 1932, with the remainder closing in 1965.\n \n'''[[Dugandan railway line|Dugandan]] and [[Mount Edwards railway line|Mt Edwards]]''' (Fassifern Valley lines) The first branch line in Queensland was from near Ipswich (Fassifern Junction) to Harrisville, opened 10 July 1882, and the line was subsequently extended to service a sawmill at Dugandan, just south of Boonah in September 1887. A branch from Kalbar to Mt Edwards opened in October 1922, proposed to be extended to join the [[Maryvale railway line|Warwick\u2013Maryvale]] line to provide a direct line to Warwick, known as the \u2018Via Recta\u2019. That would have involved another crossing of the Main Range through Spicers Gap, involving a spiral loop with uncompensated 1 in 33 grades and 100m radius curves, giving a ruling grade equivalent of 1 in 27. From 1888 until 1930 the Brisbane\u2013Sydney railway connection was via Toowoomba, Warwick and Stanthorpe (the [[Southern railway line|Southern line]]) with a change of gauge at [[Wallangarra railway station|Wallangarra]] on the [[New South Wales|NSW]] border. The Via Recta proposal was intended to bypass Toowoomba, but would have involved very significant construction costs. Once it was agreed to extend a standard gauge line from Casino and Kyogle in NSW to South Brisbane (opened 1930), the rationale for the Via Recta disappeared. Both lines closed in 1964, though the 5&nbsp;km section from Ipswich to Churchill was retained until 1994 to serve several goods sidings.\n\n'''[[Brisbane Valley railway line]]''' from Wulkuraka to Yarraman. Opened between 1886 and 1913, 161&nbsp;km, closed between 1988 and 1993. A proposed extension to connect to Nanango, terminus of the branch line from Mungar Junction near [[Maryborough, Queensland|Maryborough]] was never constructed.\n\n'''Thagoona\u2013Ebenezer''' opened 1990, 5.4&nbsp;km, serves a coal mine that ships export coal via the Port of Brisbane.\n\n'''[[Marburg railway line|Rosewood\u2013Marburg]]''' opened 18 December 1911, 14&nbsp;km, closed in sections between 1964 and 1995.\n\n'''[[Laidley Valley railway line|Laidley\u2013Mulgowie]]''' opened 19 April 1911, 11&nbsp;km, closed 23 January 1955.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Queensland|Railways}}\n*[[Rail transport in Queensland]]\n*[[Travelling post office, Queensland]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.qhatlas.com.au/map/extent-queensland-railway-network-1925/ 1925 map of the Queensland railway system]\n\n{{Railway lines in Queensland |state=expanded}}\n\n[[Category:Railway lines in Queensland]]\n[[Category:Railway lines opened in 1865]]\n[[Category:South East Queensland]]\n[[Category:1865 establishments in Australia]]\n[[Category:Main Line railway, Queensland]]\n", "name_user": "Rangasyd", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eBranch lines:add bulleted points", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Line_railway,_Queensland"}

It is based on a formula giving points for each team's placings at IIHF-sanctioned tournaments over the previous four years. The ranking is used to determine seedings and qualification requirements for future IIHF tournaments. The current leader in rankings is [[Canada]] in men's play and the [[United States]] in women's play.\n\n==Description==\nThe system was approved at the IIHF congress of September 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/news/2003-gn-012-en |title=IIHF Introduces World Ranking and Ranks Canada First in Men's and Women's Hockey |date=30 September 2003 |author=Hockey Canada |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref> According to IIHF President [[Ren\u00e9 Fasel]], the system was designed to be simple to understand and \"reflect the long-term quality of all national hockey programs and their commitment to international hockey\".<ref>{{cite journal |editor=Edvinsson, Jan-Ake |title=News release\u2013Hockey fans are the best in the world |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=November 2003 |volume=7 |issue=5 |format=PDF |url=http://webarchive.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_Vol7No5.pdf |page=7| accessdate=27 May 2019 |work=Ice Times}}</ref>\n\nThe ranking is used to determine the seeding of the teams for the next World Championship and to select the teams which can participate in Winter Olympics without playing in the qualifying round. For example, for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the first nine teams of the Men's World Ranking and the first six of the Women's World Ranking were pre-qualified. Qualification for the men's tournament at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] was structured around the 2012 ranking. Twelve spots were made available for teams. The top nine teams in the World Ranking after the [[2012 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] received automatic berths into the Ice Hockey event. All IIHF teams had an opportunity to [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's qualification|qualify]] for the event. Teams that wished to participate ranked below 29th played a preliminary qualification in September 2012. The winner of the preliminary and teams ranked 19\u201329th were divided in three groups to play in the pre-qualification round in November 2012. The winner of each pre-qualification group and teams ranked 10\u201318 were divided in three groups to play in the final qualification in February 2013. The winner of each group then joined the nine top-ranked teams in the Olympics in 2014.\n\nThe women's tournament uses a similar qualification format. The top six teams in the IIHF Women's World Ranking after the [[2012 IIHF Women's World Championship]] received automatic berths into the ice hockey event. Lower ranked teams had an opportunity to [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's qualification|qualify]] for the event. Teams ranked 19th and below were divided into two groups where they played in a preliminary qualification round in the autumn of 2012. The two winners and teams ranked 13\u201318 were divided into two groups where they played in the pre-qualification round in November 2012. The two group winners from the round advanced to the final qualification round, where the teams ranked seventh through twelfth joined them.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Olympic Winter Games |url=http://webarchive.iihf.com/sk/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics.html |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Formula===\nThe world ranking is based on the final positions of the last four [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Men's]] or [[IIHF World Women's Championships|Women's]] IIHF World Championships and last [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic ice hockey tournament]]. Points are assigned according to a team's final placement in the World Championship or the Olympic tournament. The world champion receives 1200 points and then a 20-point interval is used between teams. However, a 40-point interval is used between gold and silver, silver and bronze, fourth and fifth, and eighth and ninth.

The ice hockey team from the Russian hockey federation played under the banner of the International Olympic Committee as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\", along with other Russian athletes not banned for doping.\n\nThe following table lists the full breakdown of ranking following the [[2019 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships]], and the ranking in progress for the [[2020 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships]]. Scores in ''italics'' represent minimum possible scores for unfinished tournaments. All tournament's points have their full value displayed, while the ranking is calculated by adding the current year's tournament points to the depreciated previous three years' tournament points as explained above. The depreciated percentages are shown in the column headings, first for the current total, then for the new total. The \"Total\" columns are the sums of the current tournament points and the depreciated values for past tournaments. The \"+/\u2013\" columns indicate the increase or decrease in ranking since the last tournament. A dash in a tournament column indicates that the country did not participate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em

as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\", along with other Russian athletes not banned for doping.\n\nThe following table lists the ranking following the [[2019 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships]] and the ranking in progress for the [[2020 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships]]. Scores in ''italics'' represent minimum possible scores for unfinished tournaments. All tournament's points have their full value displayed, while the ranking is calculated by adding the current year's tournament points to the depreciated previous three years' tournament points as explained above. The depreciated percentages are shown in the column headings, first for the current total, then for the new total. The \"Total\" columns are the sums of the current tournament points and the depreciated values for past tournaments. The \"+/\u2013\" columns indicate the increase or decrease in ranking since the last tournament. A dash in a tournament column indicates that the country did not participate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em

member countries of the [[International Ice Hockey Federation]] (IIHF). It is based on a formula giving points for each team's placings at IIHF-sanctioned tournaments over the previous four years. The ranking is used to determine seedings and qualification requirements for future IIHF tournaments. The current leader in rankings is [[Canada]] in men's play and the [[United States]] in women's play.\n\n==Description==\nThe system was approved at the IIHF congress of September 2003.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.hockeycanada.ca/en-ca/news/2003-gn-012-en |title=IIHF Introduces World Ranking and Ranks Canada First in Men's and Women's Hockey |date=30 September 2003 |author=Hockey Canada |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref> According to IIHF President [[Ren\u00e9 Fasel]], the system was designed to be simple to understand and \"reflect the long-term quality of all national hockey programs and their commitment to international hockey\".<ref>{{cite journal |editor=Edvinsson, Jan-Ake |title=News release\u2013Hockey fans are the best in the world |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |date=November 2003 |volume=7 |issue=5 |format=PDF |url=http://webarchive.iihf.com/fileadmin/user_upload/PDF/The_IIHF/IIHF_Vol7No5.pdf |page=7| accessdate=27 May 2019 |work=Ice Times}}</ref>\n\nThe ranking is used to determine the seeding of the teams for the next World Championship and to select the teams which can participate in Winter Olympics without playing in the qualifying round. For example, for the [[2014 Winter Olympics]], the first nine teams of the Men's World Ranking and the first six of the Women's World Ranking were pre-qualified. Qualification for the men's tournament at the [[2014 Winter Olympics]] was structured around the 2012 ranking. Twelve spots were made available for teams. The top nine teams in the World Ranking after the [[2012 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships]] received automatic berths into the Ice Hockey event. All IIHF teams had an opportunity to [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Men's qualification|qualify]] for the event. Teams that wished to participate ranked below 29th played a preliminary qualification in September 2012. The winner of the preliminary and teams ranked 19-29th were divided in three groups to play in the pre-qualification round in November 2012. The winner of each pre-qualification group and teams ranked 10-18 were divided in three groups to play in the final qualification in February 2013. The winner of each group then joined the nine top-ranked teams in the Olympics in 2014.\n\nThe women's tournament uses a similar qualification format. The top six teams in the IIHF Women's World Ranking after the [[2012 IIHF Women's World Championship]] received automatic berths into the ice hockey event. Lower ranked teams had an opportunity to [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's qualification|qualify]] for the event. Teams ranked 19th and below were divided into two groups where they played in a preliminary qualification round in the autumn of 2012. The two winners and teams ranked 13-18 were divided into two groups where they played in the pre-qualification round in November 2012. The two group winners from the round advanced to the final qualification round, where the teams ranked seventh through twelfth joined them.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Olympic Winter Games |url=http://webarchive.iihf.com/sk/home-of-hockey/championships/olympics.html |publisher=International Ice Hockey Federation |accessdate=27 May 2019}}</ref>\n\n===Formula===\nThe world ranking is based on the final positions of the last four [[Ice Hockey World Championships|Men's]] or [[IIHF World Women's Championships|Women's]] IIHF World Championships and last [[Ice hockey at the Olympic Games|Olympic ice hockey tournament]]. Points are assigned according to a team's final placement in the World Championship or the Olympic tournament. The world champion receives 1200 points and then a 20-point interval is used between teams. However, a 40-point interval is used between gold and silver, silver and bronze, fourth and fifth, and eighth and ninth. This is used as a bonus for the teams who reach the quarter-finals, the semi-finals, the final and for winning the gold medal.<ref name=\"WORLD RANKING\">{{cite web|url=http://webarchive.iihf.com/home-of-hockey/championships/world-ranking/ |title=World Ranking |publisher=[[International Ice Hockey Federation]] |date= |accessdate=13 January 2019}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dddddd;\" align=left | '''Place''' || 1 || 2 || 3 || 4 || 5 || 6 || 7 || 8 || 9 || 10 || 11 || 12 || 13 || 14 || 15 || 16 || 17 || 18 || 19 || 20 ||...\n|-\n| style=\"background:#dddddd;\" align=left | '''Points''' || 1200 || 1160 || 1120 || 1100 || 1060 || 1040 || 1020 || 1000 || 960 || 940 || 920 || 900 || 880 || 860 || 840 || 820 || 800 || 780 || 760 || 740 ||...\n|}\n\nPoints awarded in the current year are valued at the full amount.

Under this formula, any year with a World Championship and an Olympics will be counted twice in the tables, for a maximum ranking (gold medal in all five events) of: 4200 points at the completion of an Olympic year, 3900 points at the completion of the following year, 3600 points the next year, and 3300 points in the year before the next Olympics. For example, if after the 2020 Championship a team had won the gold medal in the last four championships and the last Olympic tournament, their score would be 3600:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" cellpadding=\"5\" style=\"text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#dddddd;\" |Competition\n! style=\"background:#dddddd;\" |Valuation<br>coefficient\n! style=\"background:#dddddd;\" |Points\n|-\n| 2020 IIHF World Championship || 100% || 1200\n|-\n| 2019 IIHF World Championship || 75% || 900\n|-\n| 2018 IIHF World Championship || 50% || 600\n|-\n| 2018 Winter Olympics || 50% || 600\n|-\n| 2017 IIHF World Championship || 25% || 300\n|-\n| <s>2016 IIHF World Championship</s> || <s>0%</s> || <s>0</s>\n|-\n!Counts Five Tournaments from Four Latest Years!!!!3600\n|-\n! colspan=\"3\"|<small>Starting April 2014, Women's rankings count Olympics points twice, to be on same formula<br>as Men's rankings, as no Women's top division World Championship is held in Olympic years</small>\n|}<!--- US Women's team had: 4200 in final 2018 rankings w/points from 5 \"events\" = (1200*100% + 1200*100%) + 1200*75% + 1200*50% + 1200*25%; 4100 in April 2014 rankings w/points from 5 \"events\" = (1160*100% + 1160*100%) + 1200*75% + 1160*50% + 1200*25%; 2940 in February 2014 rankings w/points from 4 actual tournaments = 1160*100% + 1200*75% + 1160*50% + 1200*25%; 2940 in final 2013 rankings w/points from 4 actual tournaments = 1200*100% + 1160*75% + 1200*50% + 1160*25% --->\n\n==Men's rankings==\n{{see also|List of IIHF World Rankings}}\nThe Men's 2019 ranking<ref name=\"iihf2019\"/> is based on the performance at the [[Ice Hockey World Championships|World Championships]] of [[2019 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2019]], [[2018 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2018]], [[2017 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2017]], and [[2016 Men's World Ice Hockey Championships|2016]], and at the [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympic]] [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics|Ice Hockey Tournament]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], South Korea.\n\nFor the 2018 Winter Olympics, Russia's Olympic Committee and many of its athletes were banned for [[doping in sport|illegal doping]].<ref name=\"Russia Olympic Ban\"/> The IIHF opposed an outright ban on all Russian players<ref name=\"IIHF Russia\"/>, concerned that the [[Kontinental Hockey League|KHL]] would disallow its players from participating in the tournament, as the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] had done. The ice hockey team from the Russian hockey federation played under the banner of the International Olympic Committee as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\", along with other Russian athletes not banned for doping.\n\nThe following table lists the full breakdown of ranking following the [[2019 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships]], and the ranking in progress for the [[2020 Men's Ice Hockey World Championships]]. Scores in ''italics'' represent minimum possible scores for unfinished tournaments. All tournament's points have their full value displayed, while the ranking is calculated by adding the current year's tournament points to the depreciated previous three years' tournament points as explained above. The depreciated percentages are shown in the column headings, first for the current total, then for the new total. The \"Total\" columns are the sums of the current tournament points and the depreciated values for past tournaments. The \"+/\u2013\" columns indicate the increase or decrease in ranking since the last tournament. A dash in a tournament column indicates that the country did not participate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em

[[2016 IIHF Women's World Championship|2016]], and at the [[2018 Winter Olympics|2018 Olympic]] [[Ice hockey at the 2018 Winter Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|Ice Hockey Tournament]] in [[Pyeongchang County|Pyeongchang]], South Korea. \n\nFor the 2018 Winter Olympics, Russia's Olympic Committee and many of its athletes were banned due to systemic [[doping in sport|illegal doping]].<ref name=\"Russia Olympic Ban\"/> The IIHF opposed an outright ban on all Russian players<ref name=\"IIHF Russia\"/> and the ice hockey team from the Russian hockey federation played under the banner of the International Olympic Committee as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\", along with other Russian athletes not banned for doping.\n\nThe following table lists the ranking following the [[2019 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships]] and the ranking in progress for the [[2020 Women's Ice Hockey World Championships]]. Scores in ''italics'' represent minimum possible scores for unfinished tournaments. All tournament's points have their full value displayed, while the ranking is calculated by adding the current year's tournament points to the depreciated previous three years' tournament points as explained above. The depreciated percentages are shown in the column headings, first for the current total, then for the new total. The \"Total\" columns are the sums of the current tournament points and the depreciated values for past tournaments. The \"+/\u2013\" columns indicate the increase or decrease in ranking since the last tournament. A dash in a tournament column indicates that the country did not participate.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size:90%; text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em
