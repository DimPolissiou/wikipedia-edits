A claim that is likely to be challenged requires a reference to a [[WP:Identifying reliable sources|reliable source]].

Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct |title = Wikipedia:Administrators |accessdate = July 12, 2009 |date = October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |title = Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |accessdate = September 24, 2009 |date = January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829 |title = 3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins |last = Meyer |first = Robinson |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date = July 16, 2012 |accessdate = September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrats]] name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\n\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,<ref group=note>See for example the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard|Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard]] or [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard|Neutral Point of View Noticeboard]], created to address content falling under their respective areas.</ref> or seek outside input through [[Wikipedia:Third opinion|third opinion requests]] or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a [[WP:RfC|\"request for comment\"]].\n\n==== Arbitration Committee ====\n\n{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,<ref name=\"emory disputes handled 1\" /> functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the<!-- The committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may NOT (directly) rule that a certain content is inappropriate. --> content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|biased]]). Its remedies<!-- Although a caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. This could be quoted or changed. --> include cautions and [[WP:Probation|probations,]] (used in 63% of cases) and [[WP:BAN|banning editors from articles]] (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus<!-- This needs to be clarified. Anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as \"edit warring\". --> or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Wikitruth through Wikiorder |ssrn = 1354424 |journal = [[Emory Law Journal]] |volume = 59 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |pages = 151\u2013210 |author = David A.

[...] The root problem: anti-elitism, or lack of respect for expertise. There is a deeper problem [...] which explains both of the above-elaborated problems. Namely, as a community, Wikipedia lacks the habit or tradition of respect for expertise. As a community, far from being elitist, it is anti-elitist (which, in this context, means that expertise is not accorded any special respect, and snubs and disrespect of expertise is tolerated). This is one of my failures: a policy that I attempted to institute in Wikipedia's first year, but for which I did not muster adequate support, was the policy of respecting and deferring politely to experts.

This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to CC\">{{cite web |url = https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update |title = Resolution:License update |year = 2007 |author = Walter Vermeir |publisher = Wikizine |accessdate = December 4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{Srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.) In April 2009, Wikipedia and its sister projects held a community-wide referendum which decided the switch in June 2009.<ref name=\"voteresult\" /><ref name=\"MW licensing QA\">{{cite web |url = http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Questions_and_Answers |title = Licensing update/Questions and Answers |website = Wikimedia Meta |publisher = Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate = February 15, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"MW licensing timeline 1\">{{cite web |url = http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Licensing_update/Timeline |title = Licensing_update/Timeline |website = Wikimedia Meta |publisher = Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate = April 5, 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"WP blog license migration\">{{cite web |url = http://blog.wikimedia.org/2009/05/21/wikimedia-community-approves-license-migration |title = Wikimedia community approves license migration |website = Wikimedia Foundation |accessdate = May 21, 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe handling of media files (e.g. image files) varies across language editions. Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]). Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. [[Creative Commons]]' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation. Wikipedia's accommodation of varying international copyright laws regarding images has led some to observe that its photographic coverage of topics lags behind the quality of the encyclopedic text.<ref name=\"NYT photos on WP\">{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/20/arts/20funny.html |title = Wikipedia May Be a Font of Facts, but It's a Desert for Photos |date = July 19, 2009 |last = Cohen |first = Noam |work = New York Times |accessdate = March 9, 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe Wikimedia Foundation is not a licensor of content, but merely a hosting service for the contributors (and licensors) of the Wikipedia.

The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. [[Everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |title = The next generation of online encyclopedias |last = Frauenfelder |first = Mark |website = CNN.com |date = November 21, 2000 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date = August 14, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g. [[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]]).<ref name=\"gnu.org\">[https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html The Free Encyclopedia Project] gnu.org ( {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64QXgZhy2?url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html |date=January 3, 2012}})</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n\nSubsequent collaborative [[knowledge base|knowledge]] websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]] are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as ''[[Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the online wiki encyclopedias ''[[Scholarpedia]]'' and [[Citizendium]]. The latter was started by Sanger in an attempt to create a reliable alternative to Wikipedia.<ref name=\"Orlowski18\"/><ref name=\"JayLyman\">{{cite news |first = Jay |last = Lyman |url = http://www.crmbuyer.com/story/53137.html |title = Wikipedia Co-Founder Planning New Expert-Authored Site |publisher = LinuxInsider |date = September 20, 2006 |accessdate = June 27, 2007}}</ref>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Internet|Wikipedia}}\n{{Div col|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Conflict-of-interest editing on Wikipedia]]\n* [[Democratization of knowledge]]\n* [[Interpedia]], an early proposal for a collaborative [[Internet]] encyclopedia\n* [[List of online encyclopedias]]\n* [[List of Wikipedia controversies]]\n* [[Network effect]]\n* [[Outline of Wikipedia]]\u2014guide to the subject of ''Wikipedia'' presented as a [[tree structure]]d list of its subtopics; for an outline of the contents of Wikipedia, see [[Portal:Contents/Outlines]]\n* [[Print Wikipedia]] art project to visualize how big Wikipedia is.

Despite the name, administrators are not supposed to enjoy any special privilege in decision-making; instead, their powers are mostly limited to making edits that have project-wide effects and thus are disallowed to ordinary editors, and to implement restrictions intended to prevent certain persons from making disruptive edits (such as vandalism).<ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators#Administrator_conduct |title = Wikipedia:Administrators |accessdate = July 12, 2009 |date = October 3, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url = https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |title = Wikipedia:RfA_Review/Reflect |accessdate = September 24, 2009 |date = January 22, 2017}}</ref>\n\nFewer editors become administrators than in years past, in part because the process of vetting potential Wikipedia administrators has become more rigorous.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/07/3-charts-that-show-how-wikipedia-is-running-out-of-admins/259829 |title = 3 Charts That Show How Wikipedia Is Running Out of Admins |last = Meyer |first = Robinson |website = [[The Atlantic]] |date = July 16, 2012 |accessdate = September 2, 2012}}</ref>\n\n[[Wikipedia:Bureaucrats|Bureaucrats]] name new administrators solely upon the recommendations from the community.\n\n=== Dispute resolution ===\n\nOver time, Wikipedia has developed a semi-formal dispute resolution process to assist in such circumstances. In order to determine community consensus, editors can raise issues at appropriate community forums,<ref group=note>See for example the [[Wikipedia:Biographies of living persons/Noticeboard|Biographies of Living Persons Noticeboard]] or [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view/Noticeboard|Neutral Point of View Noticeboard]], created to address content falling under their respective areas.</ref> or seek outside input through [[Wikipedia:Third opinion|third opinion requests]] or by initiating a more general community discussion known as a [[WP:RfC|\"request for comment\"]].\n\n==== Arbitration Committee ====\n\n{{Main|Arbitration Committee}}\n\nThe Arbitration Committee presides over the ultimate dispute resolution process. Although disputes usually arise from a disagreement between two opposing views on how an article should read, the Arbitration Committee explicitly refuses to directly rule on the specific view that should be adopted. Statistical analyses suggest that the committee ignores the content of disputes and rather focuses on the way disputes are conducted,<ref name=\"emory disputes handled 1\" /> functioning not so much to resolve disputes and make peace between conflicting editors, but to weed out problematic editors while allowing potentially productive editors back in to participate. Therefore, the committee does not dictate the<!-- The committee may (directly) rule that a content change is inappropriate, but may NOT (directly) rule that a certain content is inappropriate. --> content of articles, although it sometimes condemns content changes when it deems the new content violates Wikipedia policies (for example, if the new content is considered [[Wikipedia:Neutral point of view|biased]]). Its remedies<!-- Although a caution is no remedy, this is the language used in the reference. This could be quoted or changed. --> include cautions and [[WP:Probation|probations]] (used in 63% of cases) and [[WP:BAN|banning editors from articles]] (43%), subject matters (23%), or Wikipedia (16%). Complete bans from Wikipedia are generally limited to instances of impersonation and [[anti-social behavior]]. When conduct is not impersonation or anti-social, but rather anti-consensus<!-- This needs to be clarified. Anti-consensus behavior appears to be defined mostly as \"edit warring\". --> or in violation of editing policies, remedies tend to be limited to warnings.<ref>{{cite journal |title = Wikitruth through Wikiorder |ssrn = 1354424 |journal = [[Emory Law Journal]] |volume = 59 |issue = 1 |year = 2009 |pages = 151\u2013210 |author = David A.

Such a \"mutually reverting edit pair\" is defined where one editor reverts the edit of another editor who then, in sequence, returns to revert the first editor in the \"mutually reverting edit pairs\". The results were tabulated for several language versions of Wikipedia. The English Wikipedia's three largest conflict rates belonged to the articles [[George W.

This made it a poor choice for a general reference work: for example, the GFDL requires the reprints of materials from Wikipedia to come with a full copy of the GFDL text. In December 2002, the [[Creative Commons license]] was released: it was specifically designed for creative works in general, not just for software manuals. The license gained popularity among bloggers and others distributing creative works on the Web. The Wikipedia project sought the switch to the Creative Commons.<ref name=\"WPF switch to CC\">{{cite web |url = https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Resolution:License_update |title = Resolution:License update |year = 2007 |author = Walter Vermeir |publisher = Wikizine |accessdate = December 4, 2007}}</ref> Because the two licenses, GFDL and Creative Commons, were incompatible, in November 2008, following the request of the project, the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF) released a new version of the GFDL designed specifically to allow Wikipedia to {{Srlink|Wikipedia:Licensing update|relicense its content to CC BY-SA}} by August 1, 2009. (A new version of the GFDL automatically covers Wikipedia contents.)

Some language editions, such as the English Wikipedia, include non-free image files under [[fair use]] doctrine, while the others have opted not to, in part because of the lack of fair use doctrines in their home countries (e.g. in [[Copyright law of Japan|Japanese copyright law]]). Media files covered by [[free content]] licenses (e.g. [[Creative Commons]]' CC BY-SA) are shared across language editions via [[Wikimedia Commons]] repository, a project operated by the Wikimedia Foundation.

The first of these was the 1986 [[BBC Domesday Project]], which included text (entered on [[BBC Micro]] computers) and photographs from more than a million contributors in the UK, and covered the geography, art, and culture of the UK. This was the first interactive multimedia encyclopedia (and was also the first major multimedia document connected through internal links), with the majority of articles being accessible through an interactive map of the UK. The user interface and part of the content of the Domesday Project were emulated on a website until 2008.<ref name=\"Domesday Project\" />\n\nSeveral free-content, collaborative encyclopedias were created around the same period as Wikipedia (e.g. [[Everything2]]),<ref>{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |title = The next generation of online encyclopedias |last = Frauenfelder |first = Mark |website = CNN.com |date = November 21, 2000 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20040814034109/http://www.cnn.com/2000/TECH/computing/11/21/net.gen.encyclopedias.idg/index.html |archive-date = August 14, 2004 |url-status=dead}}</ref> with many later being merged into the project (e.g. [[GNE (encyclopedia)|GNE]]).<ref name=\"gnu.org\">[https://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html The Free Encyclopedia Project] gnu.org ( {{Webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/64QXgZhy2?url=http://www.gnu.org/encyclopedia/encyclopedia.html |date=January 3, 2012}})</ref> One of the most successful early online encyclopedias incorporating entries by the public was [[h2g2]], which was created by [[Douglas Adams]] in 1999. The h2g2 encyclopedia is relatively lighthearted, focusing on articles which are both witty and informative.\n\nSubsequent collaborative [[knowledge base|knowledge]] websites have drawn inspiration from Wikipedia. Some, such as [[Susning.nu]], [[Enciclopedia Libre Universal en Espa\u00f1ol|Enciclopedia Libre]], [[Hudong]], and [[Baidu Baike]] likewise employ no formal review process, although some like [[Conservapedia]] are not as open. Others use more traditional [[peer review]], such as ''[[Encyclopedia of Life]]'' and the online wiki encyclopedias ''[[Scholarpedia]]'' and [[Citizendium]].

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is larger than the biomass of [[primary producer]]s. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are tiny [[phytoplankton]] which grow and reproduce rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of [[primary production]]. In contrast, terrestrial primary producers, such as [[climax forest|mature forests]], grow and reproduce slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nBecause of this inversion, it is the [[zooplankton]] that make up most of the marine animal [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]]. As [[primary consumer]]s, zooplankton  are the crucial link between the primary producers (mainly phytoplankton) and the rest of the marine food web ([[secondary consumer]]s).<ref>U S Department of Energy (2008) [https://public.ornl.gov/site/gallery/detail.cfm?id=326 ''Carbon Cycling and Biosequestration''] page 81, Workshop report DOE/SC-108, U.S. Department of Energy Office of Science.</ref>\n\nIf phytoplankton dies before it is eaten, it descends through the [[euphotic zone]] as part of the [[marine snow]] and settles into the depths of sea. In this way, phytoplankton sequester about 2 billion tons of carbon dioxide into the ocean each year, causing the ocean to become a sink of carbon dioxide holding about 90% of all sequestered carbon.<ref name=\"EarthTimes\">{{cite web|url=http://www.earthtimes.org/scitech/role-marine-plankton-sequestration-carbon/1062/|title=The role of marine plankton in sequestration of carbon |author=Campbell, Mike |date=22 June 2011 |website=EarthTimes|accessdate=22 August 2014}}</ref> The ocean produces about half of the world's oxygen and stores 50 times more carbon dioxide than the atmosphere.<ref>[https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/why-care-about-ocean.html Why should we care about the ocean?] ''NOAA: National Ocean Service''.

Phytoplankton autotrophically produces biomass by converting [[inorganic compound]]s into [[organic compound|organic]] ones. In this way, phytoplankton functions as the foundation of the marine food web by supporting all other life in the ocean. The second central process in the marine food web is the [[microbial loop]]. This loop degrades [[marine bacteria]] and [[marine archaea|archaea]], [[remineralise]]s organic and inorganic matter, and then recycles the products either within the pelagic food web or by depositing them as sediment on the seafloor.<ref>Heinrichs, M.E., Mori, C. and Dlugosch, L.

Springer. {{doi|10.1007/978-3-030-20389-4_15}}.</ref>\n\n__TOC__\n\n==Trophic levels==\n{{marine food chain}}\n{{main|trophic levels}}\n\n[[Food web]]s are built from [[food chain]]s. All forms of life in the sea have the potential to become food for another life form. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with [[phytoplankton]] and follows a course such as:\n<blockquote>\nphytoplankton \u2192 herbivorous zooplankton \u2192 carnivorous zooplankton \u2192 [[filter feeder]] \u2192 predatory vertebrate\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] don't need other organisms for food, because they have the ability to manufacture their own food directly from inorganic carbon, using sunlight as their energy source. This process is called [[photosynthesis]], and results in the phytoplankton converting naturally occuring carbon dioxide into [[protoplasm]]. For this reason, phytoplankton are said to be the [[primary producer]]s at the bottom or the first level of the marine food chain. Since they are at the first level they are said to have a [[trophic level]] of 1 (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''troph\u0113'' meaning food). Phytoplankton are then consumed at the next trophic level in the food chain by microscopic animals called zooplankton.\n\n[[Zooplankton]] comprise the second trophic level in the food chain, and include microscopic one-celled organisms called [[protozoa]] as well as small [[crustacean]]s, such as [[copepod]]s and [[krill]], and the [[larva]] of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.\n\nIn turn, the smaller herbivorous zooplankton are consumed by larger carnivorous zooplankters, such as larger predatory protozoa and [[krill]], and by [[forage fish]], which are small, [[Shoaling and schooling|schooling]], [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] fish.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=170px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

All forms of life in the sea have the potential to become food for another life form. In the ocean, the food chain typically starts with [[phytoplankton]] and follows a course such as:\n<blockquote>\nphytoplankton \u2192 herbivorous zooplankton \u2192 carnivorous zooplankton \u2192 [[filter feeder]] \u2192 predatory vertebrate\n</blockquote>\n\n[[Phytoplankton]] don't need other organisms for food, because they have the ability to manufacture their own food directly from inorganic carbon, using sunlight as their energy source. This process is called [[photosynthesis]], and results in the phytoplankton converting naturally occuring carbon dioxide into [[protoplasm]]. For this reason, phytoplankton are said to be the [[primary producer]]s at the bottom or the first level of the marine food chain. Since they are at the first level they are said to have a [[trophic level]] of 1 (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''troph\u0113'' meaning food). Phytoplankton are then consumed at the next trophic level in the food chain by microscopic animals called zooplankton.\n\n[[Zooplankton]] comprise the second trophic level in the food chain, and include microscopic one-celled organisms called [[protozoa]] as well as small [[crustacean]]s, such as [[copepod]]s and [[krill]], and the [[larva]] of fish, squid, lobsters and crabs.\n\nIn turn, the smaller herbivorous zooplankton are consumed by larger carnivorous zooplankters, such as larger predatory protozoa and [[krill]], and by [[forage fish]], which are small, schooling, [[filter feeding|filter-feeding]] fish. This makes up the third trophic level in the food chain.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n[[File:Graphical network.png|thumb|upright=1|left| A food web is network of food chains, and as such can be represented graphically and analysed using techniques from [[network theory]].<ref>Dunne, J.A., Williams, R.J. and Martinez, N.D.

Chlorophyll in the water changes the way it reflects and absorbs sunlight, allowing scientists to map the amount and location of phytoplankton.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. Algae ranges from single floating cells to attached [[seaweeds]], while vascular plants are represented in the ocean by groups such as the [[seagrass]]es. Larger producers, such as seagrasses and seaweeds, are mostly confined to the [[littoral]] zone and shallow waters, where they [[holdfast|attach]] to the underlying substrate and are still within the [[photic zone]]. But most of the primary production by algae is performed by the phytoplankton.\n\nThus, in ocean environments, the first bottom trophic level is occupied principally by [[phytoplankton]], microscopic drifting organisms, mostly [[one-celled]] [[algae]], that float in the sea. Most phytoplankton are too small to be seen individually with the [[naked eye|unaided eye]]. They can appear as a green discoloration of the water when they are present in high enough numbers. Since they increase their biomass mostly through photosynthesis they live in the sun-lit surface layer ([[Photic zone|euphotic zone]]) of the sea.\n\nThe most important groups of phytoplankton include the [[diatom]]s and [[dinoflagellate]]s. Diatoms are especially important in oceans, where according to some estimates they contribute up to 45% of the total ocean's primary production.<ref name=mann99>{{cite journal | doi = 10.2216/i0031-8884-38-6-437.1 | last1 = Mann | first1 = D.

Together with the phytoplankton, they form the base of the food pyramid that supports most of the world's great fishing grounds. Zooplankton are tiny animals found with the phytoplankton in [[ocean]]ic [[photic zone|surface waters]], and include tiny [[crustacean]]s, and fish larvae and [[spawn (biology)#Fry|fry]] (recently hatched fish). Most zooplankton are [[filter feeder]]s, and they use appendages to strain the phytoplankton in the water. Some larger zooplankton also feed on smaller zooplankton. Some zooplankton can jump about a bit to avoid predators, but they can't really swim. Like phytoplankton, they float with the currents, tides and winds instead. Zooplanktons can reproduce rapidly, their populations can increase up to thirty percent a day under favourable conditions. Many live short and productive lives and reach maturity quickly.\n\n<gallery mode=packed heights=170px, style=\"float:right;\" caption=\"Zooplankton form a second level in the ocean food chain\">\nFile:Tomopteriskils.jpg|Segmented worm\nFile:Hyperia.jpg|Tiny shrimp-like crustaceans\nFile:Squidu.jpg|Juvenile planktonic squid\n</gallery>\n\nParticularly important groups of zooplankton are the [[copepod]]s and [[krill]]. [[Copepod]]s are a group of small [[crustacean]]s found in ocean and [[fresh water|freshwater]] [[habitat (ecology)|habitats]]. They are the biggest source of protein in the sea,<ref>[http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html Biology of Copepods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101205840/http://www.uni-oldenburg.de/zoomorphology/Biology.html |date=2009-01-01 }} at [[Carl von Ossietzky University of Oldenburg]]</ref> and are important prey for forage fish. [[Krill]] constitute the next biggest source of protein. Krill are particularly large predator zooplankton which feed on smaller zooplankton. This means they really belong to the third trophic level, secondary consumers, along with the forage fish.\n\n[[File:Jellyfish swarm.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15| Jellyfish are easy to capture and digest and may be more important as food sources than was previously thought.<ref name=Hays2018 />]]\n\nTogether, [[phytoplankton]] and [[zooplankton]] make up most of the [[plankton]] in the sea. Plankton is the term applied to any small drifting [[organism]]s that float in the sea ([[Greek language|Greek]] ''planktos'' = wanderer or drifter). By definition, organisms classified as plankton are unable to swim against ocean currents; they cannot resist the ambient current and control their position. In ocean environments, the first two trophic levels are occupied mainly by [[plankton]]. Plankton are divided into producers and consumers. The producers are the phytoplankton (Greek ''phyton'' = plant) and the consumers, who eat the phytoplankton, are the zooplankton (Greek ''zoon'' = animal).\n\nTraditionally [[jellyfish]] have been viewed as trophic dead ends, minor players in the marine food web, gelatinous organisms with a [[body plan]] largely based on water that offers little nutritional value for other organisms apart from a few specialised predators such as the [[ocean sunfish]] and the [[leatherback sea turtle]].<ref name=Hamilton2016>Hamilton, G.

Phytoplankton live in the photic zone of the ocean, where photosynthesis is possible. During photosynthesis, they assimilate carbon dioxide and release oxygen. If solar radiation is too high, phytoplankton may fall victim to photodegradation. For growth, phytoplankton cells depend on nutrients, which enter the ocean by rivers, continental weathering, and glacial ice meltwater on the poles. Phytoplankton release dissolved organic carbon (DOC) into the ocean. Since phytoplankton are the basis of marine food webs, they serve as prey for zooplankton, fish larvae and other heterotrophic organisms. They can also be degraded by bacteria or by viral lysis. Although some phytoplankton cells, such as dinoflagellates, are able to migrate vertically, they are still incapable of actively moving against currents, so they slowly sink and ultimately fertilize the seafloor with dead cells and detritus.<ref>K\u00e4se L, Geuer JK.

Both are found in high concentrations in [[guano]] (seabird feces), which acts as a fertilizer for the surrounding ocean or an adjacent lake. [[Uric acid]] is the dominant nitrogen compound, and during its mineralization different nitrogen forms are produced. In the diagram on the right: (1) ammonification produces NH3 and NH4+, and (2) nitrification produces NO3\u2212 by NH4+ oxidation. Under the alkaline conditions, typical of the seabird feces, the NH3 is rapidly volatised (3) and transformed to NH4+, which is transported out of the colony, and through wet-deposition exported to distant ecosystems, which are eutrophised (4). The phosphorus cycle is simpler and has reduced mobility. This element is found in a number of chemical forms in the seabird fecal material, but the most mobile and bioavailable is [[orthophosphate]], which can be [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by subterranean or superficial waters (5).<ref name=Otero2018 />\n\n\n\n\n\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = left\n | direction = horizontal\n | width     = 550\n | header            = Estuaries\n | header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n | image1    = Food web of the Venice lagoon.png\n | alt1      = \n | caption1  = Example food web from an [[estuary]], the [[Venice Lagoon]], involving 27 nodes or functional groups.

The loss of sea ice can ultimately affect the entire food web, from algae and plankton to fish to mammals. The impact of climate change on a particular species can ripple through a food web and affect a wide range of other organisms... Not only is the decline of sea ice impairing polar bear populations by reducing the extent of their primary habitat, it is also negatively impacting them via food web effects. Declines in the duration and extent of sea ice in the Arctic leads to declines in the abundance of ice algae, which thrive in nutrient-rich pockets in the ice. These algae are eaten by zooplankton, which are in turn eaten by Arctic cod, an important food source for many marine mammals, including seals. Seals are eaten by polar bears. Hence, declines in ice algae can contribute to declines in polar bear populations.<ref>[https://archive.epa.gov/epa/climate-impacts/climate-impacts-ecosystems.html#ref2 Climate Impacts on Ecosystems: Food Web Disruptions] ''EPA''.

Phytoplankton are then consumed by krill and small zooplankton grazers, which in turn are preyed upon by higher trophic levels. Any unconsumed phytoplankton form aggregates, and along with zooplankton faecal pellets, sink rapidly and are exported out of the mixed layer. Krill, zooplankton and microbes intercept phytoplankton in the surface ocean and sinking detrital particles at depth, consuming and respiring this POC to CO2 (dissolved inorganic carbon, DIC), such that only a small proportion of surface-produced carbon sinks to the deep ocean (i.e., depths\u2009>\u20091000\u2009m). As krill and smaller zooplankton feed, they also physically fragment particles into small, slower- or non-sinking pieces (via sloppy feeding, coprorhexy if fragmenting faeces), retarding POC export. This releases dissolved organic carbon (DOC) either directly from cells or indirectly via bacterial solubilisation (yellow circle around DOC). Bacteria can then remineralise the DOC to DIC (CO2, microbial gardening). Diel vertically migrating krill, smaller zooplankton and fish can actively transport carbon to depth by consuming POC in the surface layer at night, and metabolising it at their daytime, mesopelagic residence depths. Depending on species life history, active transport may occur on a seasonal basis as well.<ref>Cavan, E.L., Belcher, A., Atkinson, A., Hill, S.L., Kawaguchi, S., McCormack, S., Meyer, B., Nicol, S., Ratnarajah, L., Schmidt, K. and Steinberg, D.K.

In particular, the biomass of consumers (copepods, krill, shrimp, forage fish) is generally larger than the biomass of primary producers. This happens because the ocean's primary producers are mostly tiny phytoplankton which have [[r-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing rapidly, so a small mass can have a fast rate of primary production. In contrast, many terrestrial primary producers, such as mature forests, have [[K-strategist]] traits of growing and reproducing slowly, so a much larger mass is needed to achieve the same rate of primary production.\n\nExamples: The [[bristlecone pine]] can live for thousands of years, and has a very low production/biomass ratio. The cyanobacterium ''[[Prochlorococcus]]'' lives for about 24 hours, and has a very high production/biomass ratio.\n\n[[File:Misty Forest (227339925).jpeg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Mature forests have a lot of biomass invested in [[secondary growth]] which has low [[Productivity (ecology)|productivity]]}}]]\n[[File:Biomass by life form.jpg|thumb|300px|left| {{center|Ocean or marine biomass, in a reversal of terrestrial biomass, can increase at higher trophic levels.<ref>Bar-On, Y.M., Phillips, R. and Milo, R.

This is a contrast to on land, where most primary production is performed by [[vascular plants]]. \n\nAquatic producers, such as planktonic algae or aquatic plants, lack the large accumulation of [[secondary growth]] that exists in the woody trees of terrestrial ecosystems. However, they are able to reproduce quickly enough to support a larger biomass of grazers. This inverts the pyramid. Primary consumers have longer lifespans and slower growth rates that accumulates more biomass than the producers they consume. Phytoplankton live just a few days, whereas the zooplankton eating the phytoplankton live for several weeks and the fish eating the zooplankton live for several consecutive years.<ref>{{cite book | last= Spellman| first= Frank R.| title= The Science of Water: Concepts and Applications| year= 2008| publisher= CRC Press| page= 167| url= https://books.google.com/?id=Grivqd7tLuAC&pg=PA167&dq=However,+biomass+pyramids+can+sometimes+be+inverted.&cd=1#v=onepage&q=However%2C%20biomass%20pyramids%20can%20sometimes%20be%20inverted.| isbn= 978-1-4200-5544-3}}</ref> Aquatic predators also tend to have a lower death rate than the smaller consumers, which contributes to the inverted pyramidal pattern. Population structure, migration rates, and environmental refuge for prey are other possible causes for pyramids with biomass inverted.

''[[Leidyosuchus]]'' of [[Alberta]] is the earliest known genus. Fossil alligatoroids have been found throughout Eurasia as land bridges across both the North Atlantic and the [[Bering Strait]] have connected North America to Eurasia during the Cretaceous, [[Paleogene]], and [[Neogene]] periods. Alligators and caimans split in North America during the late Cretaceous and the latter reached South America by the Paleogene, before the closure of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] during the Neogene period. The Chinese alligator likely descended from a lineage that crossed [[Beringia|the Bering land bridge]] during the Neogene.

Their name derives from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''el lagarto'', which means \"the lizard\".\n\n== Caimans ==\nIn [[Central America|Central]] and [[South America]], the alligator family is represented by six species of the subfamily [[Caimaninae]], which differ from the alligator by the absence of a bony septum between the nostrils, and having ventral armour composed of overlapping bony [[scute]]s, each of which is formed of two parts united by a suture. Besides the three species in ''[[Caiman (genus)|Caiman]]'', the smooth-fronted caimans in genus ''[[Paleosuchus]]'' and the black caiman in ''[[Melanosuchus]]'' are described.
