Psi Com broke up around 1985 and Farrell met [[Eric Avery]] through mutual friends. The two began jam sessions which would become the initial foundation for Jane's Addiction. It was during this period that Bernstein chose the pseudonym Perry Farrell for himself as a play on the word \"peripheral\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/music/artist/farrell_perry/artist.jhtml|title=Perry Farrell &#124; New Music And Songs|publisher=MTV|date=March 29, 1959|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref>\n\n===Jane's Addiction <small>(1985\u20131991, 1997, 2001\u20132004, 2008\u2013present)</small>===\nJane's Addiction made its name in mid-1980s LA by building up a rabid fan base with legendary, high-energy shows in small LA rock clubs. Jane's Addiction, prior to their first break-up, released three albums ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]''. A B-sides album from the ''Ritual'' sessions, titled ''Live and Rare'' was released in Japan. Late in 1991, Jane's Addiction broke up due to internal tensions over differing ideologies mostly centering on drug use, notably Farrell's severe addiction to heroin. Around this time, as mentioned in the SPIN Magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3) article about their \"Ritual\" tour, a rumor got around that Farrell had contracted HIV. Apparently for amusement, Farrell would tease audiences with \"news\" of his supposed health and would neither confirm nor deny its truth. \nIn 1993 Farrell and his ex-girlfriend Casey Niccoli released a film called ''[[Gift (1993 film)|Gift]]'' that featured Jane's Addiction. Gift was released by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1997, Jane's Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] replacing Avery on bass. The \"Relapse Tour\" was supported with the release of ''[[Kettle Whistle (album)|Kettle Whistle]]'', a rarities album featuring four new songs. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFarrell has sometimes been credited with changing the fortunes of the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicfestivals/p/coachella.htm|title=Coachella Music Festival \u2013 Coachella \u2013 Profile of Coachella Music Festival|publisher=Musicians.about.com|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> Following the festival's disastrous first year in 1999, the event was not held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the festival's organizers, decided to reunite Jane's Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major artist each year.\n\nFarrell again toured with Jane's Addiction in 2001 and 2003.  In 2003, Jane's Addiction released an album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]''. It quickly became one of their best selling records and was certified gold in the USA and silver in UK.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |title=Gold & Platinum Searchable Database \u2013 July 12, 2013 |publisher=RIAA |accessdate=2013-07-13 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070626051113/http://www.riaa.com/goldandplatinumdata.php?table=SEARCH_RESULTS |archivedate=June 26, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090218103035/http://www.bpi.co.uk/platinum/platinumright.asp?rq=search_plat&r_id=31076|date=February 18, 2009}}</ref> They toured extensively in North America and Europe, brought back [[Lollapalooza]] for the first time since 1997, as well as performing at the [[Big Day Out]] festivals in Australia and [[New Zealand]]. Internal struggles saw the band split up again in early 2004. A \"best of\" release following the breakup of this incarnation of the band was released in 2006, titled ''[[Up from the Catacombs - The Best of Jane's Addiction|Up from the Catacombs]]''.\n\nThe four original members of Jane's Addiction played their first show together in 17 years at the first United States edition of the NME Awards on April 23, 2008, and played two small shows in Los Angeles during Winter 2008. The band is the first American band to receive the \"God Like Genius\" Award. The reunited Jane's Addiction re-debuted at [[SXSW]] in 2009 and kicked off a summer tour with [[Nine Inch Nails]].

Psi Com broke up around 1985 and Farrell met [[Eric Avery]] through mutual friends. The two began jam sessions which would become the initial foundation for Jane's Addiction.

Jane's Addiction, prior to their first break-up, released three albums ''[[Jane's Addiction (album)|Jane's Addiction]]'', ''[[Nothing's Shocking]]'' and ''[[Ritual de lo Habitual]]''. A B-sides album from the ''Ritual'' sessions, titled ''Live and Rare'' was released in Japan. Late in 1991, Jane's Addiction broke up due to internal tensions over differing ideologies mostly centering on drug use, notably Farrell's severe addiction to heroin. Around this time, as mentioned in the SPIN Magazine (1991 Vol. 7 Num. 3) article about their \"Ritual\" tour, a rumor got around that Farrell had contracted HIV. Apparently for amusement, Farrell would tease audiences with \"news\" of his supposed health and would neither confirm nor deny its truth. \nIn 1993 Farrell and his ex-girlfriend Casey Niccoli released a film called ''[[Gift (1993 film)|Gift]]'' that featured Jane's Addiction. Gift was released by [[Warner Brothers]]. In 1997, Jane's Addiction reformed for a brief reunion tour with [[Flea (musician)|Flea]] replacing Avery on bass. The \"Relapse Tour\" was supported with the release of ''[[Kettle Whistle (album)|Kettle Whistle]]'', a rarities album featuring four new songs. {{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\nFarrell has sometimes been credited with changing the fortunes of the [[Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://musicians.about.com/od/musicfestivals/p/coachella.htm|title=Coachella Music Festival \u2013 Coachella \u2013 Profile of Coachella Music Festival|publisher=Musicians.about.com|date=June 22, 2013|accessdate=2013-07-13}}</ref> Following the festival's disastrous first year in 1999, the event was not held in 2000. In 2001, a decision was made to organize the festival again, but just a few months before the festival was set to occur, there was still no headlining group. Farrell, who was friends with the festival's organizers, decided to reunite Jane's Addiction for the 2001 event, which helped draw large crowds and allowed the festival to yield a profit (which was not the case in 1999). This began a Coachella tradition of reuniting at least one major artist each year.\n\nFarrell again toured with Jane's Addiction in 2001 and 2003.  In 2003, Jane's Addiction released an album, ''[[Strays (Jane's Addiction album)|Strays]]''.

The company was founded by Chicago [[physician]] Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into [[AbbVie]] in 2013.\n\nAmong its well-known products across the medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition product divisions are [[Pedialyte]], [[Similac]], [[Ensure]], [[Glucerna]], [[ZonePerfect]], FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and [[MitraClip]].\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|Wallace Abbott}}\n[[File:Dr. Wallace C. Abbott.jpg|thumb|Dr. Wallace C. Abbott|left]]\n\n=== Foundation and early history ===\nIn 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857\u20131921), an 1885 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], founded the '''Abbott Alkaloidal Company''' in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a [[Herbalism|medicinal plant]], generally an [[alkaloid]] (e.g., [[morphine]], [[quinine]], [[strychnine]] and [[codeine]]), which he formed into tiny \"dosimetric granules\". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Abbott-Laboratories-Company-History.html |title=Abbott Laboratories Company History |publisher=Funding Universe |accessdate= 17 April 2013}}</ref> In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.\n\n=== International expansion ===\nAbbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in [[Pakistan]] as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently, two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in [[Karachi]] continue to produce pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com.pk/11_Aboutus.htm|title=About Us}}</ref> Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals. In 1964, it merged with Ross Laboratories, making Ross a wholly-owned subsidiary of Abbott, and Richard Ross gained a seat on Abbott's board of directors until his retirement in 1983.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1993-12-11-9312110107-story.html|title=RICHARD MOORE ROSS, 77, ABBOTT LABS EXECUTIVE|first=Chicago|last=Tribune|website=chicagotribune.com}}</ref> The acquisition of Ross brought Similac under the Abbott umbrella.

The company was founded by Chicago [[physician]] Wallace Calvin Abbott in 1888 to formulate known drugs; today, it sells medical devices, diagnostics, branded generic medicines and nutritional products. It split off the research-based pharmaceuticals into [[AbbVie]] in 2013.\n\nAmong its well-known products across the medical devices, diagnostics, and nutrition product divisions are [[Pedialyte]], [[Similac]], [[Ensure]], [[Glucerna]], [[ZonePerfect]], FreeStyle Libre, i-STAT and [[MitraClip]].\n\n==History==\n{{anchor|Wallace Abbott}}\n[[File:Dr. Wallace C. Abbott.jpg|thumb|Dr. Wallace C. Abbott|left]]\n\n=== Foundation and early history ===\nIn 1888 at the age of 30, Wallace Abbott (1857\u20131921), an 1885 graduate of the [[University of Michigan]], founded the '''Abbott Alkaloidal Company''' in Ravenswood, Chicago. At the time, he was a practicing physician and owned a drug store. His innovation was the use of the active part of a [[Herbalism|medicinal plant]], generally an [[alkaloid]] (e.g., [[morphine]], [[quinine]], [[strychnine]] and [[codeine]]), which he formed into tiny \"dosimetric granules\". This approach was successful since it produced more consistent and effective dosages for patients.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/Abbott-Laboratories-Company-History.html |title=Abbott Laboratories Company History |publisher=Funding Universe |accessdate= 17 April 2013}}</ref> In 1922, the company moved from Ravenswood to North Chicago, Illinois.\n\n=== International expansion ===\nAbbott's first international affiliate was in London in 1907, and the company later added an affiliate in Montreal, Canada (Fact 21). Abbott started operations in [[Pakistan]] as a marketing affiliate in 1948; the company has steadily expanded to comprise a work force of over 1500 employees. Currently, two manufacturing facilities located at Landhi and Korangi in [[Karachi]] continue to produce pharmaceutical products.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abbott.com.pk/11_Aboutus.htm|title=About Us}}</ref> Expansion continued in 1962 when Abbott entered into a joint venture with Dainippon Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., of Osaka, Japan, to manufacture radio-pharmaceuticals.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

The oldest of five children growing up in Greek culture, Zenos admired, respected, and was drawn to Greek sculpture. Greek art influenced his aesthetic vision; additional inspiration came from sculptors [[Michelangelo]], [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini|Bernini]], [[Jean-Baptiste Carpeaux|Carpeaux]] and [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]]. The poetry of [[T. S. Eliot|Eliot]], [[Robert Frost|Frost]], [[Theodore Roethke|Roethke]] and [[Robert Graves|Graves]], is important to Zenos, as is philosophy.\n\n\nBorn in 1951 in [[San Francisco]], Frudakis was raised in [[Wheeling, West Virginia]], and [[Gary, Indiana]], where he worked in the steel mills. He began drawing at a very young age, and in 1972 came to Philadelphia to study at the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]]. He studied sculpture with two [[Prix de Rome]] winners: his elder brother, sculptor Evangelos Frudakis, and painter James Hanes. At the [[University of Pennsylvania]], he earned bachelor's and master's degrees in Fine Art.<ref>Sarah Blackman, \"Sculpting a Life\" (feature article on Frudakis), ''The Pennsylvania Gazette'', Class of '82, November/December 2002, p. 3.</ref>\n\n\n==International Sculptures==\n* ''[[Reaching (sculpture)|Reaching]]''.

In the early 1990s other teams followed suit and [[semi-automatic transmission|semi-automatic gearboxes]] and [[traction control system|traction control]] were a natural progression. The FIA, due to complaints that technology was determining the outcome of races more than driver skill, banned many such aids for {{F1|1994}}. This resulted in cars that were previously dependent on electronic aids becoming very \"twitchy\" and difficult to drive (particularly the [[Williams FW16]]).

This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip.

The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\n\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from {{F1|1984}} to {{F1|2008}}.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically. This increased financial burdens, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive, but to stay in business, and forced several teams to withdraw.

Schumacher retired at the end of 2006 after sixteen years in Formula One, but came out of retirement for the 2010 season, racing for the newly formed [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] works team, following the rebrand of [[Brawn GP]].\n\nDuring this period, the championship rules were changed frequently by the FIA with the intention of improving the on-track action and cutting costs.<ref>{{cite web |title=FIA Rules & Regulations Sporting Regulations: 2006 season changes |publisher=Formula One |url=http://www.formula1.com/insight/rulesandregs/13/995.html |accessdate=11 May 2006|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061109185035/http://www.formula1.com/insight/rulesandregs/13/995.html |archivedate = 9 November 2006|url-status=dead}}</ref> [[Team orders]], legal since the championship started during 1950, were banned during 2002, after several incidents, in which teams openly manipulated race results, generating negative publicity, most famously by Ferrari at the [[2002 Austrian Grand Prix]].

A \"tyre war\" between suppliers [[Michelin]] and [[Bridgestone]] saw lap times fall, although at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] at Indianapolis, seven out of ten teams did not race when their Michelin tyres were deemed unsafe for use, leading to Bridgestone becoming the sole tyre supplier to Formula One for the 2007 season.

Starting in 2000, with Ford's creation of the largely unsuccessful [[Jaguar Racing|Jaguar]] team, new manufacturer-owned teams entered Formula One for the first time since the departure of [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] and Renault at the end of 1985. By 2006, the manufacturer teams\u2014Renault, [[BMW Sauber|BMW]], [[Toyota F1|Toyota]], Honda, and Ferrari\u2014dominated the championship, taking five of the first six places in the Constructors' Championship. The sole exception was McLaren, which at the time was part-owned by [[Mercedes-Benz]]. Through the [[Grand Prix Manufacturers Association]] (GPMA), they negotiated a larger share of Formula One's commercial profit and a greater say in the running of the sport.<ref>{{cite book|title=The Rain Drop and Other Shades of Prosetry|first=Mandidi|last=Patrick|date=2010|url=https://books.google.com/?id=q24k0gAFopcC&pg=PA188&lpg=PA188&dq=Through+the+Grand+Prix+Manufacturers+Association+(GPMA),+they+negotiated+a+larger+share+of+Formula+One%27s+commercial+profit+and+a+greater+say+in+the+running+of+the+sport.#v=onepage&q=Through%20the%20Grand%20Prix%20Manufacturers%20Association%20(GPMA)%2C%20they%20negotiated%20a%20larger%20share%20of%20Formula%20One's%20commercial%20profit%20and%20a%20greater%20say%20in%20the%20running%20of%20the%20sport.|publisher=Eloquent Books|isbn=9781609113766}}</ref>\n\n===Manufacturers' decline and return of the privateers===\nIn 2008 and 2009, [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]], [[BMW in Formula One|BMW]], and [[Toyota Racing (Formula One team)|Toyota]] all withdrew from Formula One racing within the space of a year, blaming the [[Great Recession|economic recession]]. This resulted in the end of manufacturer dominance within the sport. The Honda F1 team went through a management buyout to become [[Brawn GP]] with the notable F1 designer [[Ross Brawn]] and [[Nick Fry]] running and owning the majority of the organisation. Brawn GP went through a painful size reduction, laying off hundreds of employees, but eventually won the year's world championships with [[Jenson Button]] and [[Rubens Barrichello]]. BMW F1 was bought out by the original founder of the team, [[Peter Sauber]]. The [[Lotus F1 Team]]<ref>This is not the same team as the [[Team Lotus|1954\u201394]] nor [[Team Lotus (2010\u201311)|2010\u201311]] iterations.</ref> were another, formerly manufacturer-owned team that reverted to \"privateer\" ownership, together with the buy-out of the [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] team by [[Genii Capital]] investors. A link with their previous owners still survived however, with their car continuing to be powered by a [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] Power Unit until 2014.\n\n[[McLaren]] also announced that it was to reacquire the shares in its team from [[Mercedes-Benz]] (McLaren's partnership with Mercedes was reported to have started to sour with the [[McLaren Mercedes SLR]] road car project and tough F1 championships which included McLaren being found guilty of [[2007 Formula One espionage controversy|spying on Ferrari]]). Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after its purchase of [[Brawn GP]], and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team. This left Mercedes-Benz, McLaren, and [[Ferrari]] as the only car manufacturers in the sport, although both McLaren and Ferrari began as racing teams rather than manufacturers.\n\n{{multiple image\n| align = left\n| direction = vertical\n| image1 = Pedro de la Rosa 2012 Malaysia FP2.jpg\n| width1 = 216\n| image2 = Kamui Kobayashi 2014 Singapore FP2.jpg\n| width2 = 216\n| image3 = Esteban Ocon 2016 Malaysia FP2 1.jpg\n| width3 = 216\n| caption3 = The three teams that debuted in 2010 (Hispania Racing F1 Team/HRT Formula 1 Team, Lotus Racing/Team Lotus/Caterham F1 Team, and Virgin Racing/Marussia Virgin Racing/Marussia F1 Team/Manor Marussia F1 Team/Manor Racing MRT) all disappeared within seven years of their debuts\n}}\n\nTo compensate for the loss of manufacturer teams, four new teams were accepted entry into the 2010 season ahead of a much anticipated 'cost-cap' (see below). Entrants included a reborn [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|Team Lotus]] \u2013 which was led by a Malaysian consortium including [[Tony Fernandes]], the boss of [[Air Asia]]; [[HRT F1 Team|Hispania Racing]] \u2013 the first Spanish Formula One team; as well as [[Virgin Racing]] \u2013 [[Richard Branson]]'s entry into the series following a successful partnership with Brawn the year before. They were also joined by the [[US F1 Team]], which planned to run out of the United States as the only non-European based team in the sport. Financial issues befell the squad before they even made the grid. Despite the entry of these new teams, the proposed cost-cap was repealed and these teams \u2013 who did not have the budgets of the midfield and top-order teams \u2013 ran around at the back of the field until they inevitably collapsed; HRT in 2012, Caterham (formerly Lotus) in 2014 and Manor (formerly Virgin then Marussia), having survived falling into administration in 2014, went under at the end of 2016.\n\nA rule shake-up in {{F1|2014}}, meant [[Mercedes-Benz in Formula One|Mercedes]] emerged as the dominant force, with [[Lewis Hamilton]] winning the championship closely followed by his main rival and teammate, [[Nico Rosberg]], with the team winning 16 out of the 19 races that season (all other victories coming from [[Daniel Ricciardo]] of Red Bull). 2014 also saw a financial crisis which resulted in the backmarker [[Marussia F1|Marussia]] and [[Caterham F1|Caterham]] teams being put into [[administration (law)|administration]], alongside the uncertain futures of [[Force India]] and Sauber. Marussia returned under the Manor name in {{F1|2015}}, a season in which Ferrari were the only challenger to Mercedes, with Vettel taking victory in the three Grands Prix Mercedes did not win.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/latest/features/2015/3/everything-to-play-for---2015-season-preview.html |title=Everything to play for \u2013 2015 Season Preview |website=Formula1.com |accessdate=6 March 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn the {{F1|2016}} season, [[Haas F1 Team|Haas]] joined the grid. The season began in dominant fashion for Nico Rosberg, winning the first 4 Grands Prix. His charge was halted by [[Max Verstappen]], who took his maiden win in [[2016 Spanish Grand Prix|Spain]] in his debut race for Red Bull. After that, the reigning champion Lewis Hamilton decreased the point gap between him and Rosberg to only one point, before taking the championship lead heading into the summer break. Following the break, the 1\u20132 positioning remained constant until an engine failure for Hamilton in [[2016 Malaysian Grand Prix|Malaysia]] left Rosberg in a commanding lead that he would not relinquish in the 5 remaining races. Having won the title by a mere 5 points, Rosberg retired from Formula One at season's end, becoming the first driver since [[Alain Prost]] in 1993 to retire after winning the Drivers' Championship. The final team remaining from the 2010 new entries process, [[Manor Racing]], withdrew from the sport following the 2016 season, having lost 10th in the Constructors' Championship to Sauber with one race remaining, leaving the grid at 20 cars as Liberty Media took control of the series in the off-season.\n[[File:Jolyon Palmer - Renault F1 RS16 (29463209074).jpg|thumb|right|Renault returned to the sport in 2016 (pictured with [[Jolyon Palmer|Palmer]])]]\nRecent years have seen an increase in manufacturer presence in the sport. In 2016, Renault came back to the sport after buying back the [[Lotus F1]] team. In 2018, [[Aston Martin]] and [[Alfa Romeo]] became Red Bull and Sauber's title sponsors, respectively, with the latter officially entering the 2019 season as [[Alfa Romeo Racing]] and the former due to enter the 2021 season as [[Aston Martin F1 Team]].\n\n===Political disputes===\n\n====FISA\u2013FOCA war====\n{{Main|FISA\u2013FOCA war}}\n\nThe battle for control of Formula One was contested between the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale du Sport Automobile]] (FISA), at the time an autonomous subcommittee of the [[F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]], and [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]] (the Formula One Constructors' Association).\n\nThe beginnings of the dispute are numerous, and many of the underlying reasons may be lost in history. The teams (excepting [[Scuderia Ferrari|Ferrari]] and the other major manufacturers&nbsp;\u2013 [[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] and [[Alfa Romeo in Formula One|Alfa Romeo]] in particular) were of the opinion that their rights and ability to compete against the larger and better funded teams were being negatively affected by a perceived bias on the part of the controlling organisation (FISA) toward the major manufacturers.\n\nIn addition, the battle revolved around the commercial aspects of the sport (the FOCA teams were unhappy with the disbursement of proceeds from the races) and the technical regulations which, in FOCA's opinion, tended to be malleable according to the nature of the transgressor more than the nature of the transgression.\n\nThe war culminated in a [[Formula One Constructors Association|FOCA]] boycott of the [[1982 San Marino Grand Prix]] months later. In theory, all FOCA teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the [[Formula One regulations|regulations]] and financial compensation (and extreme opposition to the accession of Balestre to the position of FISA president: both Colin Chapman of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] of [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] stated clearly that they would not continue in Formula One with Balestre as its governor).{{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} In practice, several of the FOCA teams backed out of the boycott, citing \"sponsor obligations\". Notable among these were the Tyrrell and Toleman teams.\n\n====FIA\u2013FOTA dispute====\n{{Main|FIA\u2013FOTA dispute}}\nDuring the {{F1|2009}} season of Formula One, the sport was gripped in a governance crisis.

In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in {{f1|1950}} a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.<ref name=ESPN/> In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\n\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]], [[Oulton Park International Gold Cup]] and the [[International Trophy]], were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the [[Syracuse Grand Prix|Syracuse]] and [[Danish Grand Prix|Danish]] Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid.<ref name=LastnonchampF1 /> These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the [[1983 Race of Champions]] at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]] in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American [[Danny Sullivan]].<ref name=LastnonchampF1 />\n\n===South African Formula One championship===\n{{Main|South African Formula One Championship}}\n\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975.

This concept also continued in 2017 and in 2018 but with Pirelli's thicker and wider tyres that were tested extensively last year.\n\nTyre selections are announced over a month before each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select 10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force each driver to stick to the same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the new tyre.\n\nThat means for the opening five races, drivers will have seven of the softest compound, four of the middle compound and two of the hardest compound available. Pirelli has backup compounds for introduction later in the season, if its initial batch proves to be too conservative in terms of performance or leads to greater levels of degradation than expected.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 Grand Prix tyre compound selections|url=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/18451342/2017-grand-prix-tyre-compound-selections|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Qualifying===\n[[File:BAR pitwall.jpg|thumb|left|A typical pitwall control centre, allowing team managers and strategists to communicate with their drivers and engineers]]\n\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on [[pole position]]. Grids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a [[Pre-qualification (Formula One)|pre-qualifying]] session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\n[[File:2011 Brazil GP - Lotus pitstop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Jarno Trulli]] pit-stop, for [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|Lotus]] at the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.<ref name=Qual>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Practice and qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than [[107% rule|107%]] of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.<ref name=Qual />\n\nEach car taking part in Q3 receives an 'extra' set of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1 or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather requires the use of wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed.<ref name=Tyres>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Tyres|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8680/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Tyres_and_Wheels.html|title=Tyres|website=Formula1.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> All of the drivers that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.\n\n===Race===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided they have fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve (Sauber) qualifying at US Grand Prix 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] qualifying at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[Sauber C24]]]]\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the {{F1|2019}} season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |title=F1 race starting regulations |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race.\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The maximum race length was reduced to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1966 and {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current {{convert|305|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1989. However, street races like [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a back marker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag<ref>{{cite web|title=Flags |publisher=Formula One |date=21 June 2003 |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |accessdate=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120809/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |archivedate=2 July 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is said to have retired from the race and is \"Not Classified\" in the results. However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, s/he will be classified.\n\n[[File:Safety Car with Sebastian Vettel 2015 Malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mercedes-AMG GT]] [[safety car]] leading the field around the circuit at reduced speed]]\nThroughout the race, drivers may make [[pit stop]]s to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have [[Formula One tyres#Tyre summary|different colours on their sidewalls]]; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.\n\n; Race director\n: This role involves generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in [[parc ferm\u00e9]] before a race, enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes amongst teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations. Up to 2019, the race director in Formula One was [[Charlie Whiting]], who died in March 2019.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2019|title=Charlie Whiting: F1 race director dies aged 66 on eve of season-opener in Melbourne|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/47564762|author=Andrew Benson|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Safety car\n: In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside [[Motorsport marshal|race marshals]], race officials may choose to deploy the [[safety car]]. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. [[Mercedes-Benz]] supplies [[Mercedes-AMG]] models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. Since 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|title=New safety car driver announced|publisher=GPUpdate.net|date=8 March 2000|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver [[Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder]]. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line, which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n=== Flags ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Flag\n!Meaning\n|-\n!SC Board\n(Safety Car)\n|Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the&nbsp;[[Safety Car]]&nbsp;is on track.

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem\u2014in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. From the 2010 season, refuelling\u2014which was reintroduced in 1994\u2014has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n===Points system===\n{{Main|List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n!9th\n!10th\n!{{tooltip|FL|Fastest lap}}*\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ffffbf\"|25\n|style=\"background-color:#dfdfdf\"|18\n|style=\"background-color:#ffdf9f\"|15\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|12\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|10\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|8\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|6\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|4\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|2\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|1\n|1\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race.

The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. If both cars of a team finish in the points, they both receive Constructors' Championship points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by him count for the Drivers' Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Points|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8681/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA driver must be classified to receive points.

This requirement distinguishes the sport from series such as the [[IndyCar Series]] which allows teams to purchase chassis, and \"[[spec racing|spec series]]\" such as [[GP2 Series|GP2]], which require all cars be kept to an identical specification. It also effectively prohibits [[Privateer (motorsport)|privateers]], which were common even in Formula One well into the 1970s.\n\nThe sport's debut season, {{F1|1950}}, saw eighteen teams compete, but due to high costs many dropped out quickly. In fact, such was the scarcity of competitive cars for much of the first decade of Formula One that Formula Two cars were admitted to fill the grids.  Ferrari is the oldest Formula One team, the only still-active team which competed in 1950.\n\n[[File:Ayrton Senna 1988 Canada.jpg|thumb|left|[[McLaren]] (pictured with [[Ayrton Senna]]) won all but one race in {{F1|1988}} with engine partner [[Honda in Formula One|Honda]]]]\n[[File:Niko Hulkenberg-Test Days 2018 Circuit Barcelona (1).jpg|thumb|left|[[Renault in Formula One|Renault]] (pictured here with [[Nico H\u00fclkenberg]]) has had an active role in Formula One as both constructor and engine supplier since {{F1|1977}}]]\nEarly manufacturer involvement came in the form of a \"factory team\" or \"[[works team#Motorsport|works team]]\" (that is, one owned and staffed by a major car company), such as those of Alfa Romeo, Ferrari, or Renault. After having virtually disappeared by the early 1980s, factory teams made a comeback in the 1990s and 2000s and formed up to half the grid with Ferrari, Jaguar, BMW, Renault, Toyota, and Honda either setting up their own teams or buying out existing ones.  Mercedes-Benz owned 40% of the McLaren team and manufactured the team's engines. Factory teams make up the top competitive teams; in 2008 wholly owned factory teams took four of the top five positions in the Constructors' Championship, and McLaren the other. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen). However, by the end of the 2000s factory teams were once again on the decline with only Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Renault lodging entries to the {{F1|2010}} championship.\n\nCompanies such as [[Coventry Climax|Climax]], [[Repco]], [[Cosworth]], [[Hart Racing Engines|Hart]], [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] and [[Supertec]], which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.  Beginning in 2007, the manufacturers' deep pockets and engineering ability took over, eliminating the last of the independent engine manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosworth return unlikely says Stewart |url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |website=F1-Live.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331163340/http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |archivedate=31 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200&nbsp;million ($125\u2013$225&nbsp;million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Adam|title=Mosley Stands Firm on Engine Freeze|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|publisher=Speed TV|accessdate=1 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105224446/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|archivedate=5 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams.

Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One driver's title in 2008.<ref>Jack Brabham, F1 champion in 1959, 1960 and 1966, won the French Formula Two championship in 1966, but there was no international F2 championship that year.</ref> Drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. [[British F3]] has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including [[Nigel Mansell]], [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] having moved straight from that series to Formula One. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]], who went straight from Formula Renault to F1, as well as [[Max Verstappen]], who made his debut following a single season in [[FIA Formula 3 European Championship|European F3]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Five F1 champions who wouldn't have made their debuts|url=http://www.crash.net/f1/feature/212868/1/five-f1-champions-who-wouldnt-have-made-their-debuts.html|website=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[American open-wheel car racing]] has also contributed to the Formula One grid with mixed results. [[Champ Car|CART]] champions [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] became F1 World Champions, while [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won seven races in F1. Other CART (also known as ChampCar) champions, like [[Michael Andretti]] and [[Alessandro Zanardi]] won no races in F1. Other drivers have taken different paths to F1; Damon Hill raced motorbikes, and Michael Schumacher raced in [[sports car racing|sports cars]], albeit after climbing through the junior single-seater ranks. Former F1 driver [[Paul di Resta]] raced in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] until he was signed with [[Force India]] in 2011. To race, however, the driver must hold an [[FIA Super Licence]]\u2013ensuring that the driver has the requisite skills, and will not therefore be a danger to others. Some drivers have not had the licence when first signed to an F1 team: e.g., R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen received the licence despite having only 23 car races to his credit.\n\n===Beyond F1===\n[[File:Porsche 919 Hybrid 20.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Mans Prototype|LMP1 cars]] have become a popular destination for retired F1 drivers, in this example [[Mark Webber]]]]\n[[File:2015 London ePrix, Di Grassi (12).jpg|thumb|right|Many former F1 drivers regularly compete in [[Formula E]]]]\nMost F1 drivers retire in their mid to late 30s. Some F1 drivers have left to race in the United States\u2014[[Nigel Mansell]] and [[Emerson Fittipaldi]] duelled for the 1993 [[Champ Car|CART]] title, [[Rubens Barrichello]] moved to [[IndyCar]] in 2012, while [[Jacques Villeneuve]], [[Juan Pablo Montoya]], [[Nelson Piquet Jr.]] and [[Scott Speed]] moved to [[NASCAR]].\n\nSome drivers have moved from F1 to racing in disciplines with fewer races during the season. The German touring car championship, the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]], is a popular category involving ex-drivers such as two-time champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and F1 race winners [[Jean Alesi]], [[David Coulthard]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]]. In recent years, it has become common for former F1 drivers to take up factory seats driving [[LMP1]] cars in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], with notable drivers including [[Mark Webber]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Anthony Davidson]], [[Alexander Wurz]], [[Kazuki Nakajima]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Fernando Alonso]].  A series for former Formula One drivers, called [[Grand Prix Masters]], ran briefly in 2005 and 2006.<ref>{{cite news|title=Masters series officially wound up|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/64156|accessdate=4 July 2008|work=[[Autosport]]|date=29 November 2007}}</ref> Other drivers have moved to [[Formula E]] such as Nelson Piquet Jr., S\u00e9bastien Buemi, [[Bruno Senna]], [[Jaime Alguersuari]], [[Nick Heidfeld]], [[Jarno Trulli]], [[Jean-\u00c9ric Vergne]], [[Felipe Massa]], [[Stoffel Vandoorne]], and more. Some drivers, such as [[Vitantonio Liuzzi]], [[Narain Karthikeyan]] and [[Jos Verstappen]] went on to race in the [[A1 Grand Prix]] series. During its existence from 2008 to 2011, [[Superleague Formula]] attracted ex-Formula One drivers like [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]] and [[Giorgio Pantano]].\n\nOther former F1 drivers, like [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Gerhard Berger]], [[Alain Prost]] and [[Niki Lauda]] returned to F1 as team owners or managers while their former competitors have become [[colour commentator]]s for TV coverage such as [[James Hunt]] ([[BBC]]), [[Martin Brundle]] (BBC, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Sky Sports|Sky]]), [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] (NBC), [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] (BBC, [[Nine Network]] and [[Ten Network]]), David Coulthard (BBC and [[Channel 4]]), [[Luciano Burti]] for [[Globo TV|Globo]] (Brazil), and Jean Alesi for Italian national network [[RAI]]. Others, such as [[Damon Hill]] and [[Jackie Stewart]], take active roles in running motorsport in their own countries. [[Carlos Reutemann]] became a politician and served as governor of his native state in Argentina.\n\n==Grands Prix==\n[[File:Formula 1 all over the world.svg|thumb|upright=1.35|World map showing location of Formula 1 Grands Prix: countries marked in green are on the current race schedule, those in dark grey have hosted a Formula One race in the past (''de facto'' status of the territories is shown)]]\n{{See also|List of Formula One Grands Prix}}\nThe number of Grands Prix held in a season has varied over the years. The inaugural {{F1|1950}} world championship season comprised only seven races, while the {{F1|2019}} season contained twenty-one races. Although throughout the first decades of the world championship there were no more than eleven Grands Prix a season, a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of sixteen/seventeen by the late 1970s; simultaneously non-championship events ended by 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 19 races. In {{F1|2016}} the calendar peaked at twenty-one events, the highest number of world championship races in one season.\n\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the [[Indianapolis 500]], which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the [[United States Grand Prix]]. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in {{F1|1953}}, and [[Moroccan Grand Prix|Morocco]] hosted the first African World Championship race in {{F1|1958}}. Asia (Japan in {{F1|1976}}) and Oceania (Australia in {{F1|1985}}) followed, and the first race in the Middle East was held in {{F1|2004}}. The nineteen races of the {{F1|2014}} season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with ten Grands Prix held outside Europe.\n[[File:Formula one.jpg|thumb|Cars wind through the [[infield]] section of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]]]\n\nSome of the Grands Prix, such as the oldest recognised event the [[French Grand Prix]], pre-date the formation of the World Championship and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950. The [[British Grand Prix|British]] and [[Italian Grand Prix|Italian]] Grands Prix are the only events to have been held every Formula One season; other long-running races include the Belgian, German and French Grands Prix. The [[Monaco Grand Prix]], first held in 1929 and run continuously since 1955, is widely considered to be one of the most important and prestigious automobile races in the world.<ref>{{cite web|title=His Serene Highness Prince Rainier of Monte Carlo awarded the first FIA Gold Medal for Motor Sport|website=F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de l'Automobile|date=14 October 2004|url=http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2004/141004-01.html|accessdate=23 April 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071115023910/http://www.fia.com/mediacentre/Press_Releases/FIA_Sport/2004/141004-01.html|archivedate=15 November 2007}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally each nation has hosted a single Grand Prix, which carries the name of the country. If a single country hosts multiple Grands Prix in a year they receive different names. In European countries, the second event has often been titled the [[European Grand Prix]], or named after a neighbouring state without a race. The United States has held six separate Grands Prix, including the Indianapolis 500, with the additional events named after the host city. Grands Prix are not always held at the same circuit each year, and may switch locations due to the suitability of the track or the financial status of the race organisers. The German Grand Prix formerly alternated between the [[N\u00fcrburgring]] and [[Hockenheimring]] circuits, and others such as the American and French races have switched venues throughout their history.\n\nAll Grands Prix have traditionally been run during the day, until the inaugural {{f1 gp|2008|Singapore}} hosted the first Formula One night race,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6063.html |title=Singapore confirms 2008 night race |website=Formula1.com |publisher=Formula One Administration |date=11 May 2007 |accessdate=30 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517074908/http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2007/5/6063.html |archivedate=17 May 2010 |df=dmy }}</ref> which was followed in 2009 by the day\u2013night [[Abu Dhabi Grand Prix]] and then the [[Bahrain Grand Prix]] which converted to a night race in 2014.

The ''[[pit stop|pit lane]]'', where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal. A single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least 5,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |title=Sport : F-1 race at Sohna or Greater Noida |work=The Hindu |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]], [[Albert Park Circuit|Melbourne]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]], [[Sochi International Street Circuit|Sochi]] and [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]] although races in other urban locations come and go ([[Las Vegas]] and [[Detroit]], for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed\u2014most recently [[Grand Prix of America|New Jersey]]. Several circuits have been completely laid out on public roads in the past, such as [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] in Spain, though Monaco is the only one that remains. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks. Three-time World champion [[Nelson Piquet]] famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/2011/05/24/monaco-challenge-remains-unique |title=Monaco challenge remains unique \u2013 Formula 1 |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the new [[Bahrain International Circuit]], added in {{F1|2004}} and designed\u2014like most of F1's new circuits\u2014by [[Hermann Tilke]]. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n\nOld favourites the [[\u00d6sterreichring]] (today the Red Bull Ring) and the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]], returned to the calendar in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Sochi Autodrom]] in [[Sochi]] and the [[Baku City Circuit]] in [[Azerbaijan]] have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, [[Circuit Zandvoort]] will return to the F1 calendar as the [[Dutch Grand Prix]], having last hosted a race in 1985.\n\n==Cars and technology==\n{{Main|Formula One car|Formula One engines|Formula One tyres}}\n[[File:Button Spain 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Jenson Button]] in the [[Brawn BGP 001]]]]\n[[File:Sergio P\u00e9rez-Test Days 2018 Circuit Barcelona (4).jpg|thumb|[[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] driving the [[Force India VJM11]]]]\nModern Formula One cars are [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]], hybrid, open cockpit, [[open wheel car|open wheel]] single-seaters.

This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance and the current generation of cars sport a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\n\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the [[tire|tyres]]. From {{F1|1998}} to {{F1|2008}}, the tyres in Formula One were not \"[[slick tyre|slicks]]\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series.

Ecclestone experimented with a digital television package (known colloquially as [[Bernievision]]) which was launched at the [[1996 German Grand Prix]] in co-operation with German digital television service \"DF1\", 30 years after the first GP colour TV broadcast, the [[1967 German Grand Prix]]. This service offered the viewer several simultaneous feeds (such as super signal, on board, top of field, backfield, highlights, pit lane, timing) which were produced with cameras, technical equipment and staff different from those used for the conventional coverage - i.e.: the \"World Feed\".\n\nTV stations all take what is known as the \"World Feed\", either produced historically by the \"host broadcaster\" or by FOM (Formula One Management). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds - a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents. Where the two feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\n\nThe only station that differed from this set up was \"DF1\" (re-branded to \"Premiere\" then to \"Sky Deutschland\")\u2014a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pitlane channels. This service was obtained by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of 1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much. Prices were too high for viewers, considering they could watch both the qualifying and the races on free TV.\n\nAfter the failure of F1 Digital Plus, \"Premiere\" continued providing an interactive service, however, only the onboard and pit lane (for certain events) channels were available. This interactive service was a complete failure as the host broadcaster's director failed to recognise the onboard channel during the broadcast, leaving viewers frustrated looking at title cards rather than the action. The onboard feed slowly came back to life from 2005 and in 2007 was available for the whole season when F1 went widescreen.\n\nFurthermore, upon the commencement of its coverage for the 2009 season, the [[BBC]] reintroduced complementary features such as the \"red button\" in-car camera angles, multiple soundtracks (broadcast commentary, [[CBBC]] commentary for children, or ambient sound only) and a rolling highlights package. Different combinations of these features are available across the various digital platforms ([[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media#Virgin TV|Virgin Media cable]] and the BBC F1 web site) prior to, during, and after the race weekend. Not all services are available across all the various platforms due to technical constraints. The BBC also broadcasts a post-race programme called \"F1 Forum\" on the digital terrestrial platforms' \"red button\" interactive services.\n\n[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Vettel]] after securing pole position at the [[2011 Malaysian Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAn announcement was made on 12 January 2011, on the official Formula 1 website (Formula1.com), that F1 would adopt the [[high-definition television|HD]] format for the 2011 season offering a world feed at a data rate of 42 Megabits/second (MPEG-2).<ref>{{cite web |title=Formula One Coverage goes HD for 2011 |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/1/11634.html |publisher=Formula1.com |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref> The BBC subsequently announced later that day that their 2011 F1 coverage would be broadcast in HD<ref>{{cite news | title = New role for Eddie Jordan as BBC F1 coverage goes HD | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9359509.stm |work=BBC Sport  |date= 12 January 2011|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref> which has been made immediately possible due to SIS LIVE, the provider of the BBC's F1 outside broadcast coverage, having already upgraded their technical facilities to HD as of the 2010 Belgian Grand Prix.<ref>{{cite web | title = SIS LIVE upgrades OB coverage of Formula 1 for BBC Sport | url = http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | publisher = sislive.tv | accessdate = 12 January 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022718/http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | archivedate = 5 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that [[Sky Sports]] and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 in 2012.

This so-called 'narrow track' era resulted in cars with smaller rear tyres, a narrower track overall, and the introduction of grooved tyres to reduce mechanical grip.

The grooved tyres also had the unfortunate side effect of initially being of a harder compound to be able to hold the grooved tread blocks, which resulted in spectacular accidents in times of aerodynamic grip failure as the harder compound could not grip the track as well.\n\nDrivers from McLaren, Williams, Renault (formerly Benetton), and Ferrari, dubbed the \"Big Four\", won every World Championship from {{F1|1984}} to {{F1|2008}}.

Due to the technological advances of the 1990s, the cost of competing in Formula One increased dramatically. This increased financial burdens, combined with the dominance of four teams (largely funded by big car manufacturers such as Mercedes-Benz), caused the poorer independent teams to struggle not only to remain competitive, but to stay in business, and forced several teams to withdraw.

Hence, during the 2010 season, Mercedes-Benz re-entered the sport as a manufacturer after its purchase of [[Brawn GP]], and split with McLaren after 15 seasons with the team.

In theory, all FOCA teams were supposed to boycott the Grand Prix as a sign of solidarity and complaint at the handling of the [[Formula One regulations|regulations]] and financial compensation (and extreme opposition to the accession of Balestre to the position of FISA president: both Colin Chapman of [[Team Lotus|Lotus]] and [[Frank Williams (Formula One)|Frank Williams]] of [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] stated clearly that they would not continue in Formula One with Balestre as its governor).{{Original research inline|date=June 2010}} In practice, several of the FOCA teams backed out of the boycott, citing \"sponsor obligations\".

These events often took place on circuits that were not always suitable for the World Championship, and featured local cars and drivers as well as those competing in the championship.<ref name=LastnonchampF1 />\n\n===European non-championship racing===\nIn the early years of Formula One, before the world championship was established, there were around twenty races held from late Spring to early Autumn in Europe, although not all of these were considered significant. Most competitive cars came from Italy, particularly Alfa Romeo. After the start of the world championship, these non-championship races continued. In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races which did not count for the World Championship; in {{f1|1950}} a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship.<ref name=ESPN/> In 1952 and 1953, when the world championship was run to Formula Two regulations, non-championship events were the only Formula One races that took place.\n\nSome races, particularly in the UK, including the [[Race of Champions (Brands Hatch)|Race of Champions]], [[Oulton Park International Gold Cup]] and the [[International Trophy]], were attended by the majority of the world championship contenders. Other smaller events were regularly held in locations not part of the championship, such as the [[Syracuse Grand Prix|Syracuse]] and [[Danish Grand Prix|Danish]] Grands Prix, although these only attracted a small amount of the championship teams and relied on private entries and lower Formula cars to make up the grid.<ref name=LastnonchampF1 /> These became less common through the 1970s and 1983 saw the last non-championship Formula One race; the [[1983 Race of Champions]] at Brands Hatch, won by reigning World Champion [[Keke Rosberg]] in a Williams-Cosworth in a close fight with American [[Danny Sullivan]].<ref name=LastnonchampF1 />\n\n===South African Formula One championship===\n{{Main|South African Formula One Championship}}\n\nSouth Africa's flourishing domestic Formula One championship ran from 1960 through to 1975. The frontrunning cars in the series were recently retired from the world championship although there was also a healthy selection of locally built or modified machines. Frontrunning drivers from the series usually contested their local World Championship Grand Prix, as well as occasional European events, although they had little success at that level.{{Citation needed|date=October 2007}}\n\n===British Formula One Championship===\n{{Main|British Formula One Championship}}\n\nThe [[Cosworth DFV|DFV]] helped make the UK domestic Formula One championship possible between 1978 and 1980.

It begins with two free practice sessions on Friday (except in Monaco, where Friday practices are moved to Thursday), and one free practice on Saturday. Additional drivers (commonly known as [[third driver]]s) are allowed to run on Fridays, but only two cars may be used per team, requiring a race driver to give up his seat. A qualifying session is held after the last free practice session. This session determines the starting order for the race on Sunday.<ref name=\"QDetail2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8686/|title=Practice and qualifying|publisher=Formula One|accessdate=21 October 2009}}</ref><ref name=\"DriveChang\">{{cite web|title=Driver changes and additional drivers|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8694/|publisher=[[Formula One Group|Formula One World Championship]]|date=10 June 2011|accessdate=10 June 2011}}</ref>\n\n===Tyre rules===\nThe new rule for F1 tyres that was introduced in 2016 was that Pirelli could select three different tyres for each race, and each team could choose the tyre from those three depending on the strategies. This concept also continued in 2017 and in 2018 but with Pirelli's thicker and wider tyres that were tested extensively last year.\n\nTyre selections are announced over a month before each event, with rules stating Pirelli must announce compounds nine weeks before a European round and 15 weeks before a long-haul event. Drivers ordinarily select 10 of the 13 sets available for a race weekend, though Pirelli's new tyres means the Italian company will force each driver to stick to the same allocations for the first five races as it learns about the new tyre.\n\nThat means for the opening five races, drivers will have seven of the softest compound, four of the middle compound and two of the hardest compound available. Pirelli has backup compounds for introduction later in the season, if its initial batch proves to be too conservative in terms of performance or leads to greater levels of degradation than expected.<ref>{{cite web|title=2017 Grand Prix tyre compound selections|url=http://www.espn.com/f1/story/_/id/18451342/2017-grand-prix-tyre-compound-selections|website=ESPN|publisher=ESPN Internet Ventures|accessdate=21 September 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Qualifying===\n[[File:BAR pitwall.jpg|thumb|left|A typical pitwall control centre, allowing team managers and strategists to communicate with their drivers and engineers]]\n\nFor much of the sport's history, qualifying sessions differed little from practice sessions; drivers would have one or more sessions in which to set their fastest time, with the grid order determined by each driver's best single lap, with the fastest on [[pole position]]. Grids were generally limited to 26 cars \u2013 if the race had more entries, qualification would also decide which drivers would start the race. During the early 1990s, the number of entries was so high that the worst-performing teams had to enter a [[Pre-qualification (Formula One)|pre-qualifying]] session, with the fastest cars allowed through to the main qualifying session. The qualifying format began to change in the early 2000s, with the FIA experimenting with limiting the number of laps, determining the aggregate time over two sessions, and allowing each driver only one qualifying lap.\n\n[[File:2011 Brazil GP - Lotus pitstop.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Jarno Trulli]] pit-stop, for [[Team Lotus (2010-11)|Lotus]] at the [[2011 Brazilian Grand Prix]]]]\nThe current qualifying system was adopted in the 2006 season. Known as \"knock-out\" qualifying, it is split into three periods, known as Q1, Q2, and Q3. In each period, drivers run qualifying laps to attempt to advance to the next period, with the slowest drivers being \"knocked out\" of qualification (but not necessarily the race) at the end of the period and their grid positions set within the rearmost five based on their best lap times. Drivers are allowed as many laps as they wish within each period. After each period, all times are reset, and only a driver's fastest lap in that period (barring infractions) counts. Any timed lap started before the end of that period may be completed, and will count toward that driver's placement. The number of cars eliminated in each period is dependent on the total number of cars entered into the championship.<ref name=Qual>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Practice and qualifying|url=http://www.formula1.com/content/fom-website/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Practice_qualifying_and_race_start_procedure.html|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref> Currently, with 20 cars, Q1 runs for 18 minutes, and eliminates the slowest five drivers. During this period, any driver whose best lap takes longer than [[107% rule|107%]] of the fastest time in Q1 will not be allowed to start the race without permission from the stewards. Otherwise, all drivers proceed to the race albeit in the worst starting positions. This rule does not affect drivers in Q2 or Q3. In Q2, the 15 remaining drivers have 15 minutes to set one of the ten fastest times and proceed to the next period. Finally, Q3 lasts 12 minutes and sees the remaining ten drivers decide the first ten grid positions. At the beginning of the 2016 Formula 1 season, the FIA introduced a new qualifying format, whereby drivers were knocked out every 90 seconds after a certain amount of time had passed in each session. The aim was to mix up grid positions for the race, but due to unpopularity the FIA reverted to the above qualifying format for the Chinese GP, after running the format for only two races.<ref name=Qual />\n\nEach car taking part in Q3 receives an 'extra' set of the softest available tyre. This set has to be handed in after qualifying, drivers knocked out in Q1 or Q2 can use this set for the race. The first ten drivers, i.e. the drivers through to Q3 must start the race on the tyre which set the fastest time in Q2, unless the weather requires the use of wet-weather tyres. In which case all of the rules about the tyres won't be followed.<ref name=Tyres>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Tyres|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8680/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.formula1.com/en/championship/inside-f1/rules-regs/Tyres_and_Wheels.html|title=Tyres|website=Formula1.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}</ref> All of the drivers that did not participate in Q3 have free tyre choice for the start of the race. Any penalties that affect grid position are applied at the end of qualifying. Grid penalties can be applied for driving infractions in the previous or current Grand Prix, or for changing a gearbox or engine component. If a car fails scrutineering, the driver will be excluded from qualifying, but will be allowed to start the race from the back of the grid at the race steward's discretion.\n\n===Race===\nThe race begins with a warm-up lap, after which the cars assemble on the starting grid in the order they qualified. This lap is often referred to as the formation lap, as the cars lap in formation with no overtaking (although a driver who makes a mistake may regain lost ground provided they have fallen to the back of the field). The warm-up lap allows drivers to check the condition of the track and their car, gives the tyres a chance to warm up to increase traction, and also gives the pit crews time to clear themselves and their equipment from the grid.\n[[File:Jacques Villeneuve (Sauber) qualifying at US Grand Prix 2005.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques Villeneuve]] qualifying at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]] in his [[Sauber C24]]]]\n\nOnce all the cars have formed on the grid, after the medical car positions itself behind the pack, a light system above the track indicates the start of the race: five red lights are illuminated at intervals of one second; they are all then extinguished simultaneously after an unspecified time (typically less than 3 seconds) to signal the start of the race. The start procedure may be abandoned if a driver stalls on the grid, signalled by raising his arm. If this happens, the procedure restarts: a new formation lap begins with the offending car removed from the grid. The race may also be restarted in the event of a serious accident or dangerous conditions, with the original start voided. The race may be started from behind the Safety Car if officials feel a racing start would be excessively dangerous, such as extremely heavy rainfall. As of the {{F1|2019}} season, there will always be a standing restart. If due to heavy rainfall a start behind the safety car is necessary, then after the track has dried sufficiently, drivers will form up for a standing start. There is no formation lap when races start behind the Safety Car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8691/ |title=F1 race starting regulations |publisher=Formula One |accessdate=16 October 2010}}</ref>\n\nUnder normal circumstances, the winner of the race is the first driver to cross the finish line having completed a set number of laps. Race officials may end the race early (putting out a red flag) due to unsafe conditions such as extreme rainfall, and it must finish within two hours, although races are only likely to last this long in the case of extreme weather or if the safety car is deployed during the race.\n\nIn the 1950s, race distances varied from {{convert|300|km|mi|abbr=on}} to {{convert|600|km|mi|abbr=on}}. The maximum race length was reduced to {{convert|400|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1966 and {{convert|325|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1971. The race length was standardised to the current {{convert|305|km|mi|abbr=on}} in 1989. However, street races like [[Monaco Grand Prix|Monaco]] have shorter distances, to keep under the two-hour limit.\n\nDrivers may overtake one another for position over the course of the race. If a leader comes across a back marker (slower car) who has completed fewer laps, the back marker is shown a blue flag<ref>{{cite web|title=Flags |publisher=Formula One |date=21 June 2003 |url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |accessdate=3 July 2008 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080702120809/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5282.html |archivedate=2 July 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> telling them that they are obliged to allow the leader to overtake them. The slower car is said to be \"lapped\" and, once the leader finishes the race, is classified as finishing the race \"one lap down\". A driver can be lapped numerous times, by any car in front of them. A driver who fails to finish a race, through mechanical problems, accident, or any other reason is said to have retired from the race and is \"Not Classified\" in the results. However, if the driver has completed more than 90% of the race distance, s/he will be classified.\n\n[[File:Safety Car with Sebastian Vettel 2015 Malaysia.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mercedes-AMG GT]] [[safety car]] leading the field around the circuit at reduced speed]]\nThroughout the race, drivers may make [[pit stop]]s to change tyres and repair damage (from 1994 to 2009 inclusive, they could also refuel). Different teams and drivers employ different pit stop strategies in order to maximise their car's potential. Three dry tyre compounds, with different durability and adhesion characteristics, are available to drivers. Over the course of a race, drivers must use two of the three available compounds. The different compounds have different levels of performance, and choosing when to use which compound is a key tactical decision to make. Different tyres have [[Formula One tyres#Tyre summary|different colours on their sidewalls]]; this allows spectators to understand the strategies. Under wet conditions, drivers may switch to one of two specialised wet weather tyres with additional grooves (one \"intermediate\", for mild wet conditions, such as after recent rain, one \"full wet\", for racing in or immediately after rain). A driver must make at least one stop to use two tyre compounds; up to three stops are typically made, although further stops may be necessary to fix damage or if weather conditions change. If rain tyres are used, drivers are no longer obliged to use both types of dry tyres.\n\n; Race director\n: This role involves generally managing the logistics of each F1 Grand Prix, inspecting cars in [[parc ferm\u00e9]] before a race, enforcing FIA rules and controlling the lights which start each race. As the head of the race officials, the race director also plays a large role in sorting disputes amongst teams and drivers. Penalties, such as drive-through penalties (and stop-and-go penalties), demotions on a pre-race start grid, race disqualifications, and fines can all be handed out should parties break regulations. Up to 2019, the race director in Formula One was [[Charlie Whiting]], who died in March 2019.<ref>{{cite news|work=BBC News|date=14 March 2019|title=Charlie Whiting: F1 race director dies aged 66 on eve of season-opener in Melbourne|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/47564762|author=Andrew Benson|accessdate=14 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n; Safety car\n: In the event of an incident that risks the safety of competitors or trackside [[Motorsport marshal|race marshals]], race officials may choose to deploy the [[safety car]]. This in effect suspends the race, with drivers following the safety car around the track at its speed in race order, with overtaking not permitted. The safety car circulates until the danger is cleared; after it comes in, the race restarts with a \"rolling start\". Pit stops are permitted under the safety car. [[Mercedes-Benz]] supplies [[Mercedes-AMG]] models to Formula One to use as the safety cars. Since 2000,<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.gpupdate.net/en/f1-news/2713/new-safety-car-driver-announced/|title=New safety car driver announced|publisher=GPUpdate.net|date=8 March 2000|accessdate=30 January 2011}}</ref> the main safety car driver has been German ex-racing driver [[Bernd Mayl\u00e4nder]]. On the lap in which the safety car returns to the pits, the leading car takes over the role of the safety car until the first safety car line, which is usually a white line after the pit lane entrance. After crossing this line, drivers are allowed to start racing for track position once more.\n\n=== Flags ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Flag\n!Meaning\n|-\n!SC Board\n(Safety Car)\n|Shown in conjunction with a yellow flag to indicate that the&nbsp;[[Safety Car]]&nbsp;is on track.

The main changes have revolved around what is allowed at pit stops. In the early days of Grand Prix racing, a driver would be allowed to continue a race in his teammate's car should his develop a problem\u2014in the modern era, cars are so carefully fitted to drivers that this has become impossible. In recent years, the emphasis has been on changing refuelling and tyre change regulations. From the 2010 season, refuelling\u2014which was reintroduced in 1994\u2014has not been allowed, to encourage less tactical racing following safety concerns. The rule requiring both compounds of tyre to be used during the race was introduced in 2007, again to encourage racing on the track. The safety car is another relatively recent innovation that reduced the need to deploy the red flag, allowing races to be completed on time for a growing international live television audience.\n\n===Points system===\n{{Main|List of Formula One World Championship points scoring systems}}\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!1st\n!2nd\n!3rd\n!4th\n!5th\n!6th\n!7th\n!8th\n!9th\n!10th\n!{{tooltip|FL|Fastest lap}}*\n|-\n|style=\"background-color:#ffffbf\"|25\n|style=\"background-color:#dfdfdf\"|18\n|style=\"background-color:#ffdf9f\"|15\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|12\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|10\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|8\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|6\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|4\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|2\n|style=\"background-color:#dfffdf\"|1\n|1\n|}\n\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>A driver must finish within the top ten to receive a point for setting the fastest lap of the race.

The current system, in place since 2010, awards the top ten cars points in the Drivers' and Constructors' Championships, with the winner receiving 25 points. If both cars of a team finish in the points, they both receive Constructors' Championship points. All points won at each race are added up, and the driver and constructor with the most points at the end of the season are crowned World Champions. Regardless of whether a driver stays with the same team throughout the season, or switches teams, all points earned by him count for the Drivers' Championship.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sporting regulations: Points|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/rules_and_regulations/sporting_regulations/8681/|website=Formula1.com|publisher=Formula One World Championship|accessdate=12 January 2015}}</ref>\n\nA driver must be classified to receive points.

After having virtually disappeared by the early 1980s, factory teams made a comeback in the 1990s and 2000s and formed up to half the grid with Ferrari, Jaguar, BMW, Renault, Toyota, and Honda either setting up their own teams or buying out existing ones.  Mercedes-Benz owned 40% of the McLaren team and manufactured the team's engines. Factory teams make up the top competitive teams; in 2008 wholly owned factory teams took four of the top five positions in the Constructors' Championship, and McLaren the other. Ferrari holds the record for having won the most Constructors' Championships (sixteen). However, by the end of the 2000s factory teams were once again on the decline with only Ferrari, Mercedes-Benz and Renault lodging entries to the {{F1|2010}} championship.\n\nCompanies such as [[Coventry Climax|Climax]], [[Repco]], [[Cosworth]], [[Hart Racing Engines|Hart]], [[Judd (engine)|Judd]] and [[Supertec]], which had no direct team affiliation, often sold engines to teams that could not afford to manufacture them. In the early years, independently owned Formula One teams sometimes also built their engines, though this became less common with the increased involvement of major car manufacturers such as BMW, Ferrari, Honda, Mercedes-Benz, Renault, and Toyota, whose large budgets rendered privately built engines less competitive. Cosworth was the last independent engine supplier.  Beginning in 2007, the manufacturers' deep pockets and engineering ability took over, eliminating the last of the independent engine manufacturers.<ref>{{cite web|title=Cosworth return unlikely says Stewart |url=http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |website=F1-Live.com |accessdate=1 February 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080331163340/http://en.f1-live.com/f1/en/headlines/news/detail/071108095715.shtml |archivedate=31 March 2008 |url-status=dead |df= }}</ref> It is estimated the major teams spend between \u20ac100 and \u20ac200&nbsp;million ($125\u2013$225&nbsp;million) per year per manufacturer on engines alone.<ref>{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Adam|title=Mosley Stands Firm on Engine Freeze|url=http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|publisher=Speed TV|accessdate=1 February 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105224446/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/formulaone/27851/|archivedate=5 November 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nIn the 2007 season, for the first time since the 1981 rule, two teams used chassis built by other teams.

GP2 started in 2005, replacing [[Formula 3000]], which itself had replaced [[Formula Two]] as the last major stepping-stone into F1. GP2 was rebranded as the [[FIA Formula 2 Championship]] in 2017. Most champions from this level graduate into F1, but 2006 GP2 champion [[Lewis Hamilton]] became the first F2, F3000 or GP2 champion to win the Formula One driver's title in 2008.<ref>Jack Brabham, F1 champion in 1959, 1960 and 1966, won the French Formula Two championship in 1966, but there was no international F2 championship that year.</ref> Drivers are not required to have competed at this level before entering Formula One. [[British F3]] has supplied many F1 drivers, with champions, including [[Nigel Mansell]], [[Ayrton Senna]] and [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] having moved straight from that series to Formula One. More rarely a driver may be picked from an even lower level, as was the case with 2007 World Champion [[Kimi R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen]], who went straight from Formula Renault to F1, as well as [[Max Verstappen]], who made his debut following a single season in [[FIA Formula 3 European Championship|European F3]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Five F1 champions who wouldn't have made their debuts|url=http://www.crash.net/f1/feature/212868/1/five-f1-champions-who-wouldnt-have-made-their-debuts.html|website=crash.net|publisher=Crash Media Group|date=8 January 2015|accessdate=12 October 2015}}</ref>\n\n[[American open-wheel car racing]] has also contributed to the Formula One grid with mixed results. [[Champ Car|CART]] champions [[Mario Andretti]] and [[Jacques Villeneuve]] became F1 World Champions, while [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] won seven races in F1. Other CART (also known as ChampCar) champions, like [[Michael Andretti]] and [[Alessandro Zanardi]] won no races in F1. Other drivers have taken different paths to F1; Damon Hill raced motorbikes, and Michael Schumacher raced in [[sports car racing|sports cars]], albeit after climbing through the junior single-seater ranks. Former F1 driver [[Paul di Resta]] raced in [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]] until he was signed with [[Force India]] in 2011. To race, however, the driver must hold an [[FIA Super Licence]]\u2013ensuring that the driver has the requisite skills, and will not therefore be a danger to others. Some drivers have not had the licence when first signed to an F1 team: e.g., R\u00e4ikk\u00f6nen received the licence despite having only 23 car races to his credit.\n\n===Beyond F1===\n[[File:Porsche 919 Hybrid 20.jpg|thumb|right|[[Le Mans Prototype|LMP1 cars]] have become a popular destination for retired F1 drivers, in this example [[Mark Webber]]]]\n[[File:2015 London ePrix, Di Grassi (12).jpg|thumb|right|Many former F1 drivers regularly compete in [[Formula E]]]]\nMost F1 drivers retire in their mid to late 30s.

The German touring car championship, the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Masters|DTM]], is a popular category involving ex-drivers such as two-time champion [[Mika H\u00e4kkinen]] and F1 race winners [[Jean Alesi]], [[David Coulthard]] and [[Ralf Schumacher]]. In recent years, it has become common for former F1 drivers to take up factory seats driving [[LMP1]] cars in the [[FIA World Endurance Championship]], with notable drivers including [[Mark Webber]], [[Allan McNish]], [[Anthony Davidson]], [[Alexander Wurz]], [[Kazuki Nakajima]], [[S\u00e9bastien Buemi]] and [[Fernando Alonso]].

During its existence from 2008 to 2011, [[Superleague Formula]] attracted ex-Formula One drivers like [[S\u00e9bastien Bourdais]], [[Ant\u00f4nio Pizzonia]] and [[Giorgio Pantano]].\n\nOther former F1 drivers, like [[Jackie Stewart]], [[Gerhard Berger]], [[Alain Prost]] and [[Niki Lauda]] returned to F1 as team owners or managers while their former competitors have become [[colour commentator]]s for TV coverage such as [[James Hunt]] ([[BBC]]), [[Martin Brundle]] (BBC, [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] and [[Sky Sports|Sky]]), [[David Hobbs (racing driver)|David Hobbs]] (NBC), [[Alan Jones (racing driver)|Alan Jones]] (BBC, [[Nine Network]] and [[Ten Network]]), David Coulthard (BBC and [[Channel 4]]), [[Luciano Burti]] for [[Globo TV|Globo]] (Brazil), and Jean Alesi for Italian national network [[RAI]].

Although throughout the first decades of the world championship there were no more than eleven Grands Prix a season, a large number of non-championship Formula One events also took place. The number of Grands Prix increased to an average of sixteen/seventeen by the late 1970s; simultaneously non-championship events ended by 1983. More Grands Prix began to be held in the 2000s, and recent seasons have seen an average of 19 races. In {{F1|2016}} the calendar peaked at twenty-one events, the highest number of world championship races in one season.\n\nSix of the original seven races took place in Europe; the only non-European race that counted towards the World Championship in 1950 was the [[Indianapolis 500]], which was held to different regulations and later replaced by the [[United States Grand Prix]]. The F1 championship gradually expanded to other non-European countries. Argentina hosted the first South American Grand Prix in {{F1|1953}}, and [[Moroccan Grand Prix|Morocco]] hosted the first African World Championship race in {{F1|1958}}. Asia (Japan in {{F1|1976}}) and Oceania (Australia in {{F1|1985}}) followed, and the first race in the Middle East was held in {{F1|2004}}. The nineteen races of the {{F1|2014}} season were spread over every populated continent except for Africa, with ten Grands Prix held outside Europe.\n[[File:Formula one.jpg|thumb|Cars wind through the [[infield]] section of the [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway]] at the [[2003 United States Grand Prix]]]]\n\nSome of the Grands Prix, such as the oldest recognised event the [[French Grand Prix]], pre-date the formation of the World Championship and were incorporated into the championship as Formula One races in 1950.

The United States has held six separate Grands Prix, including the Indianapolis 500, with the additional events named after the host city. Grands Prix are not always held at the same circuit each year, and may switch locations due to the suitability of the track or the financial status of the race organisers.

The ''[[pit stop|pit lane]]'', where the drivers stop for tyres, aerodynamic adjustments and minor repairs (such as changing the car's nose due to front wing damage) during the race, retirements from the race, and where the teams work on the cars before the race, is normally located next to the starting grid. The layout of the rest of the circuit varies widely, although in most cases the circuit runs in a clockwise direction. Those few circuits that run anticlockwise (and therefore have predominantly left-handed corners) can cause drivers neck problems due to the enormous lateral forces generated by F1 cars pulling their heads in the opposite direction to normal. A single race requires hotel rooms to accommodate at least 5,000 visitors.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/09/18/stories/2007091857031900.htm |title=Sport : F-1 race at Sohna or Greater Noida |work=The Hindu |date=18 September 2007 |accessdate=16 October 2010 |location=Chennai, India}}</ref>\n\nMost of the circuits currently in use are specially constructed for competition. The current street circuits are [[Circuit de Monaco|Monaco]], [[Albert Park Circuit|Melbourne]], [[Marina Bay Street Circuit|Singapore]], [[Sochi International Street Circuit|Sochi]] and [[Baku City Circuit|Baku]] although races in other urban locations come and go ([[Las Vegas]] and [[Detroit]], for example) and proposals for such races are often discussed\u2014most recently [[Grand Prix of America|New Jersey]]. Several circuits have been completely laid out on public roads in the past, such as [[Valencia Street Circuit|Valencia]] in Spain, though Monaco is the only one that remains. The glamour and history of the Monaco race are the primary reasons why the circuit is still in use, even though it does not meet the strict safety requirements imposed on other tracks. Three-time World champion [[Nelson Piquet]] famously described racing in Monaco as \"like riding a bicycle around your living room\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.motorsportmagazine.com/2011/05/24/monaco-challenge-remains-unique |title=Monaco challenge remains unique \u2013 Formula 1 |publisher=Motor Sport Magazine |date=24 May 2011 |accessdate=12 October 2013}}</ref>\n\nCircuit design to protect the safety of drivers is becoming increasingly sophisticated, as exemplified by the new [[Bahrain International Circuit]], added in {{F1|2004}} and designed\u2014like most of F1's new circuits\u2014by [[Hermann Tilke]]. Several of the new circuits in F1, especially those designed by Tilke, have been criticised as lacking the \"flow\" of such classics as Spa-Francorchamps and Imola. His redesign of the Hockenheim circuit in Germany for example, while providing more capacity for grandstands and eliminating extremely long and dangerous straights, has been frowned upon by many who argue that part of the character of the Hockenheim circuits was the long and blinding straights into dark forest sections. These newer circuits, however, are generally agreed to meet the safety standards of modern Formula One better than the older ones.\n\nOld favourites the [[\u00d6sterreichring]] (today the Red Bull Ring) and the [[Aut\u00f3dromo Hermanos Rodr\u00edguez]], returned to the calendar in 2014 and 2015 respectively. The [[Circuit of the Americas]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], the [[Sochi Autodrom]] in [[Sochi]] and the [[Baku City Circuit]] in [[Azerbaijan]] have all been introduced as brand new tracks since 2012. In 2020, [[Circuit Zandvoort]] will return to the F1 calendar as the [[Dutch Grand Prix]], having last hosted a race in 1985.\n\n==Cars and technology==\n{{Main|Formula One car|Formula One engines|Formula One tyres}}\n[[File:Button Spain 2009.jpg|thumb|[[Jenson Button]] in the [[Brawn BGP 001]]]]\n[[File:Sergio P\u00e9rez-Test Days 2018 Circuit Barcelona (4).jpg|thumb|[[Sergio P\u00e9rez]] driving the [[Force India VJM11]]]]\nModern Formula One cars are [[mid-engine design|mid-engined]], hybrid, open cockpit, [[open wheel car|open wheel]] single-seaters.

This is provided by \"wings\" mounted at the front and rear of the vehicle, and by [[ground effect in cars|ground effect]] created by low air pressure under the flat bottom of the car. The aerodynamic design of the cars is very heavily constrained to limit performance and the current generation of cars sport a large number of small winglets, \"barge boards\", and turning vanes designed to closely control the flow of the air over, under, and around the car.\n\nThe other major factor controlling the cornering speed of the cars is the design of the [[tire|tyres]]. From {{F1|1998}} to {{F1|2008}}, the tyres in Formula One were not \"[[slick tyre|slicks]]\" (tyres with no tread pattern) as in most other circuit racing series. Instead, each tyre had four large circumferential grooves on its surface designed to limit the cornering speed of the cars.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |title=Tyres |accessdate=4 July 2008 |publisher=Formula One |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218202246/http://www.formula1.com/inside_f1/understanding_the_sport/5283.html |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Slick tyres returned to Formula One in the {{F1|2009}} season.

The cumulative figure, which exceeds the total population of the planet by many times, counts all viewers who watch F1 on any programme at any time during the year.</ref>\n\nDuring the early 1990s, [[Formula One Group]] created a number of trademarks, an official logo, an official TV graphics package and in 2003, an official website for the sport in an attempt to give it a corporate identity. Ecclestone experimented with a digital television package (known colloquially as [[Bernievision]]) which was launched at the [[1996 German Grand Prix]] in co-operation with German digital television service \"DF1\", 30 years after the first GP colour TV broadcast, the [[1967 German Grand Prix]]. This service offered the viewer several simultaneous feeds (such as super signal, on board, top of field, backfield, highlights, pit lane, timing) which were produced with cameras, technical equipment and staff different from those used for the conventional coverage - i.e.: the \"World Feed\".\n\nTV stations all take what is known as the \"World Feed\", either produced historically by the \"host broadcaster\" or by FOM (Formula One Management). The host broadcaster either had one feed for all, or two separate feeds - a feed for local viewers and a feed for international viewers. The one size fits all approach meant that there was bias to a certain team or driver during the event, which led to viewers missing out on more important action and incidents. Where the two feed approach meant that replays (for when returning from an ad break) and local bias action could be overlaid on the local feed while the international feed was left unaffected.\n\nThe only station that differed from this set up was \"DF1\" (re-branded to \"Premiere\" then to \"Sky Deutschland\")\u2014a German channel which offers all sessions live and interactive, with features such as the onboard and pitlane channels. This service was obtained by Bernie Ecclestone at the end of 1996 and became F1 Digital Plus, which was made more widely available around Europe until the end of 2002, when the cost of the digital interactive service was thought too much. Prices were too high for viewers, considering they could watch both the qualifying and the races on free TV.\n\nAfter the failure of F1 Digital Plus, \"Premiere\" continued providing an interactive service, however, only the onboard and pit lane (for certain events) channels were available. This interactive service was a complete failure as the host broadcaster's director failed to recognise the onboard channel during the broadcast, leaving viewers frustrated looking at title cards rather than the action. The onboard feed slowly came back to life from 2005 and in 2007 was available for the whole season when F1 went widescreen.\n\nFurthermore, upon the commencement of its coverage for the 2009 season, the [[BBC]] reintroduced complementary features such as the \"red button\" in-car camera angles, multiple soundtracks (broadcast commentary, [[CBBC]] commentary for children, or ambient sound only) and a rolling highlights package. Different combinations of these features are available across the various digital platforms ([[Freeview (UK)|Freeview]], [[Freesat]], [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]], [[Virgin Media#Virgin TV|Virgin Media cable]] and the BBC F1 web site) prior to, during, and after the race weekend. Not all services are available across all the various platforms due to technical constraints. The BBC also broadcasts a post-race programme called \"F1 Forum\" on the digital terrestrial platforms' \"red button\" interactive services.\n\n[[File:Sebastian Vettel 2011.jpg|thumb|[[Sebastian Vettel]] after securing pole position at the [[2011 Malaysian Grand Prix]]]]\n\nAn announcement was made on 12 January 2011, on the official Formula 1 website (Formula1.com), that F1 would adopt the [[high-definition television|HD]] format for the 2011 season offering a world feed at a data rate of 42 Megabits/second (MPEG-2).<ref>{{cite web |title=Formula One Coverage goes HD for 2011 |url=http://www.formula1.com/news/headlines/2011/1/11634.html |publisher=Formula1.com |date=12 January 2011 |accessdate=16 June 2014}}</ref> The BBC subsequently announced later that day that their 2011 F1 coverage would be broadcast in HD<ref>{{cite news | title = New role for Eddie Jordan as BBC F1 coverage goes HD | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/9359509.stm |work=BBC Sport  |date= 12 January 2011|accessdate=12 January 2011}}</ref> which has been made immediately possible due to SIS LIVE, the provider of the BBC's F1 outside broadcast coverage, having already upgraded their technical facilities to HD as of the 2010 Belgian Grand Prix.<ref>{{cite web | title = SIS LIVE upgrades OB coverage of Formula 1 for BBC Sport | url = http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | publisher = sislive.tv | accessdate = 12 January 2011 | url-status=dead | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111005022718/http://www.sislive.tv/download/press%20releases/100902_SISLIVEF1Flyaways.pdf | archivedate = 5 October 2011 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nIt was announced on 29 July 2011, that [[Sky Sports]] and the BBC would team up to show the races in F1 in 2012.

So give due consideration before changing the section title.-->\nCurrently the terms 'Formula One race' and 'World Championship race' are effectively synonymous; since 1984, every Formula One race has counted towards the World Championship, and every World Championship race has been to Formula One regulations. But the two terms are not interchangeable.\n* The first Formula One race was held in 1947,<ref name=ESPN/> whereas the World Championship did not start until 1950.<ref name=ESPN/>\n* In the 1950s and 1960s, there were many Formula One races that did not count for the World Championship<ref name=silhouet>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/title.html |title=The Formula One Archives |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> (e.g., in 1950, a total of twenty-two Formula One races were held, of which only six counted towards the World Championship).<ref name=ESPN/> The number of non-championship Formula One events decreased throughout the 1970s and 1980s, to the point where the last non-championship Formula One race was the [[1983 Race of Champions]].<ref name=silhouet/>\n* The World Championship was not always exclusively composed of Formula One events:\n** The World Championship was originally established as the \"World Championship for Drivers\", i.e., without the term \"Formula One\" in the title. It only officially became the FIA Formula One World Championship in 1981.\n** From 1950 to 1960, the [[Indianapolis 500]] race counted towards the World Championship.<ref name=silhouet/> This race was run to [[American Automobile Association]] and [[United States Automobile Club]] regulations, rather than to Formula One regulations. Only one of the World Championship regulars, [[Alberto Ascari]] in [[1952 Indianapolis 500|1952]], started at Indianapolis during this period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.historicracing.com/driver_detail.cfm?driverID=1061 |title=Alberto Ascari |website=historicracing.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n** From 1952 to 1953, all races counting towards the World Championship (except the Indianapolis 500) were run to Formula Two regulations.<ref name=silhouet/> Formula One was not changed to Formula Two during this period; the Formula One regulations remained the same, and numerous non-championship Formula One races were staged during this time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1952/1952.html |title=1952 Non-World Championship Grands Prix |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.silhouet.com/motorsport/archive/f1/nc/1953/1953.html |title=1953 Non-World Championship Grands Prix |website=www.silhouet.com |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe distinction is most relevant when considering career summaries and all-time lists. For example, in the [[List of Formula One drivers]], [[Clemente Biondetti]] is shown with a single race against his name. Biondetti actually competed in four Formula One races in 1950,<ref name=Biondetti>{{cite web |url=http://www.chicanef1.com/query.pl?action=Submit&exact=on&driver=Clemente%20Biondetti&nc=nc |title=Clemente Biondetti Formula One race entries |publisher=ChicaneF1 |accessdate=29 May 2016}}</ref> but only one of these counted for the World Championship. Similarly, several [[Indianapolis 500]] winners technically won their first World Championship race, though most record books choose to ignore this and instead only record regular World Championship participants.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==Responsibility towards the environment==\nIn January 2020, FIA and Formula One signed the United Nations \"Sports for Climate Action\" framework and affirmed that they would become carbon neutral by 2030.

The school enrolls students through an admissions process based on [[middle school]] grades, test scores, teacher recommendations, and a written essay.\n\n==History==\nAcademic Magnet High School was established in 1988, and the first class graduated in 1992. The school was originally located as a separate sub-campus of Burke High School in downtown [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].
