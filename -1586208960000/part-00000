On air since September 1998 and devised by Briggs, the show's format sees contestants taking on multiple-choice questions based upon general knowledge, winning a cash prize for each question they answer correctly, with the amount offered increasing as they take on more difficult questions. To assist each contestant who takes part, they are given lifelines to use, may walk away with the money they already have won if they wish not to risk answering a question, and are provided with a safety net that gives them a guaranteed cash prize if they give an incorrect answer, provided they reach a specific milestone in the quiz.\n\nThe original series aired for 30 series and aired a total of 592 episodes, from 4 September 1998 to 11 February 2014, and was presented by [[Chris Tarrant]]. Over the course of its initial run, the show had five contestants achieve the show\u2019s ultimate aim and walk away with the cash prize of \u00a31&nbsp;million. The original format of the programme was tweaked in later years; this included changing the number of questions from fifteen to twelve, altering the payout structure and later incorporating a time limit which included an attainable fourth lifeline. There were several controversies during its run, including an attempt by a contestant to [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|defraud the show of its top prize]].\n\nFour years after the original series ended, ITV announced that the series would be revived, this time produced by [[Stellify Media]], to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the programme. The revival was based closely on the show\u2019s original format. It was hosted by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10 studios]]. The success of the revival series has ensured that subsequent series of the show have been commissioned, and in January 2019 the show reached the milestone of 600 episodes since first appearing on air.\n\nThe game show became one of the most significant shows in British popular culture, ranking 23rd in a list of the [[BFI TV 100|100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled in 2000 by the [[British Film Institute]]. It was the highest quiz programme to appear on the list. Its success led to versions in [[International versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|many other countries]] under an [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|international franchise of the same name]], all of which follow the same general format, though with some versions including unique differences in gameplay and lifelines provided.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width =\n| align = right\n| header = UK presenters of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''\n| image1 = Chris Tarrant Phooto.jpg\n| image2 = Jeremy Clarkson.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| width2 = 135\n| caption1 = [[Chris Tarrant]] (1998\u20132014)\n| caption2 = [[Jeremy Clarkson]] (2018\u2013present)\n| alt1 = Tarrant\n| alt2 = Clarkson\n}}\n\n===Creation===\nThe creation of the game show was led by David Briggs, assisted by Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had helped him before with creating a number of promotional games for Chris Tarrant's [[Capital Breakfast|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio. The basic premise for the show was a twist on the conventional game-show genre of the time, with a focus towards the setup used in radio quizzes, in that the programme would have one contestant taking on the game and answering questions, but with the ability to pull out at any time, to have certain points in the quiz where once passed, they could have a set prize given to them if they should give a wrong answer, and be provided with special forms of assistance during their game. During the design phase, the show was given the [[working title]] of \"Cash Mountain\", before Briggs decided upon using the name of the [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', as the show's finalised title.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After presenting their idea to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the broadcaster gave the green-light for production to begin on a series.\n\nThe set designed for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], who focused the design towards making contestants feel uncomfortable, creating an atmosphere of tension similar to [[Thriller film|movie thriller]].<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{Cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> The design was in stark contrast to the design of sets made for more typical game shows, which are designed to make contestants feel more at ease.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Walmsley's design feature a central stage made primarily with [[Plexiglas]], with a huge dish underneath covered in mirror paper,<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/><ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> onto which two slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs were chosen for use by both the contestant and the host, each having an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each that would be used to display questions and other pertinent information. The rest of the set featured seating spaced out around the main stage in a circle, with breaks in them to allow movement of people on and off the set. The lighting rig used for the set was designed so as to allow only the lights to switch from illuminating the entire set, to focusing on the host and contestant on the main stage when a game was underway, but to include special lighting effects when the contestant reached higher cash prize amounts. His overall conception would eventually prove to be a success, becoming one of the most reproduced scenic designs in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/>\n\nThe music provided for the show was composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. The Strachans' composition for the game show helped with Briggs' tense game design, by providing the necessary drama and tension. Unlike other game show musical scores, the music provided for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was designed to be played throughout the entire episode of the show. The Strachans main theme for the game show was inspired from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. For the main game of the show, the pair designed the music to feature three variations, with the second and third compositions focused on emphasising the increased tension of the game \u2013 as a contestant made progress to higher cash amounts, the pitch of the music was increased by a semitone for each subsequent question.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=21 March 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]]'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Original series===\nWith the show created, ITV assigned [[Chris Tarrant]] as its host, and set its premiere to 4 September 1998. The programme was assigned a timeslot of one hour, to provide room for three commercial breaks, with episodes produced by UK production company [[Celador]]. Originally, the show was broadcast on successive evenings for around ten days, before the network modified its broadcast schedule in autumn 2000<ref name=\"auto\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2001/nov/29/broadcasting3|title=Millionaire ratings slide|first=Jason|last=Deans|date=29 November 2001|via=www.theguardian.com}}</ref> to air it within a primetime slot on Saturday evenings, with occasional broadcasts on Tuesday evenings. ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' proved a ratings hit, pulling in average viewing figures of up to 19 million during its broadcast in 1999 (all-time high was on 7 March 1999, 19.2 million viewers),<ref name=\"auto\"/> though such figures often occurred when the programme was allocated to a half-hour timeslot.

In three cases, the matters could not be proven by the claimants \u2013 in 2002, Mike Bull, a [[Southampton]]-based journalist, was given an out-of-court settlement when he claimed the authorship of lifelines was his work, though with a confidentiality clause attached; in 2003, Sydney resident John J. Leonard made claims in that the show's format was based on one he had made of a similar nature, but without the concept of lifelines;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |title=Millionaire 2nd Edition.qxd |format=PDF |last=Leonard |first=John J. |year=2005 |accessdate=2 June 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120801163453/http://www.xavierax.com/ebook.pdf |archive-date=1 August 2012 |url-status=dead  }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=The show that should have made me a million|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/03/29/1048653901387.html|first=Daniel |last=Dasey|newspaper=The Sydney Sun-Herald|date=30 March 2003}}</ref> in 2004, Alan Melville was given an out-of-court settlement after he claimed that the opening phrase \"Who wants to be a millionaire?\" had been taken from a document he sent to [[Granada Television]], concerning his idea for a game show based on the lottery.\n\nOne of most significant claims Celador received against them was from John Bachini. In 2002, he started legal proceedings against the production company, ITV, and five individuals who had claimed they had created ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', stating that the idea from the show was taken from several elements he had created \u2013 a board game format he conceived in 1981; a two-page TV format, known as ''Millionaire'', made in 1987; and the telephone mechanics for a TV concept he created in 1989, ''BT Lottery''. In his claim, Bachini stated that he submitted documents for his TV concepts to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to [[Claudia Rosencrantz]] of ITV, also in January 1996, accusing both of using roughly 90% of the format for ''Millionaire'' in the pilot for the game show, including the use of twenty questions, lifelines and safety nets, although the lifelines were conceived under different names \u2013 Bachini claimed that he never coined the phrase \"phone-a-friend\" that Briggs designed in his format. In response to this claim, Celador made a counter-claim that the franchise originated from the basic format idea conceived by Briggs. The defendants in the claim took Bachini to a summary hearing but lost their right to have his claim dismissed. Although Bachini won the right to go to trial, he was unable to after the hearing due to serious illness. Celador eventually settled the matter with him out-of-court.<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, Celador began procedures to sell the format of the show and all UK episodes, as part of their first step towards the sale of their formats divisions.

Once an application was made, production staff selected an episode's contestants through a combination of random selection, and a potential contestant's ability to answer a set of test questions based on general knowledge.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\n===Game rules=== \n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; float:right\"\t\n|-\t\n!colspan=4 style=\"background: #58B9E4\"| Payout structure\t\n|-\t\n!rowspan=2| Question<br>number\t\n!colspan=3| Question value\t\n|-\t\n! 1998\u20132007\t\n! 2007\u20132014\t\n! 2018\u2013present\n|-\t\n| 1\t\n| \u00a3100\t\n| \u00a3500\t\n| \u00a3100\t\n|-\t\n| 2\t\n| \u00a3200\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a31,000'''\t\n| \u00a3200\t\n|-\t\n| 3\t\n| \u00a3300\t\n| \u00a32,000\t\n| \u00a3300\t\n|-\t\n| 4\t\n| \u00a3500\t\n| \u00a35,000\t\n| \u00a3500\t\n|-\t\n| 5\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a31,000'''\t\n| \u00a310,000\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a31,000'''\t\n|-\t\n| 6\t\n| \u00a32,000\t\n| \u00a320,000\t\n| \u00a32,000\t\n|-\t\n| 7\t\n| \u00a34,000\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a350,000'''\t\n| \u00a34,000\t\n|-\t\n| 8\t\n| \u00a38,000\t\n| \u00a375,000\t\n| \u00a38,000\t\n|-\t\n| 9\t\n| \u00a316,000\t\n| \u00a3150,000\t\n| \u00a316,000\t\n|-\t\n| 10\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''\u00a332,000'''\t\n| \u00a3250,000\t\n| \u00a332,000\t\n|-\t\n| 11\t\n| \u00a364,000\t\n| \u00a3500,000\t\n| \u00a364,000\t\n|-\t\n| 12\t\n| \u00a3125,000\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''''\u00a31,000,000'''''\t\n| \u00a3125,000\t\n|-\t\n| 13\t\n| \u00a3250,000\t\n| rowspan=3 {{N/A}}\t\n| \u00a3250,000\t\n|-\t\n| 14\t\n| \u00a3500,000\n \t\n| \u00a3500,000\t\n|-\t\n| 15\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''''\u00a31,000,000'''''\t\n| style=\"background: #FFE600\"| '''''\u00a31,000,000'''''\t\n|-\n\t\n|}\n\nOnce contestants auditioned for a part on the programme and filming took place, they undertook a preliminary round entitled \"Fastest Finger First\". Initially, the round required contestants to provide the correct answer to a question, but from series 2 onwards, they were tasked with putting four answers in the correct order stated within the question (i.e. earliest to latest). The contestant who answered the question correctly, and in the fastest time, won the opportunity to play the main game. In the event that no one answered the question correctly, a new question was asked, while if two or more contestants gave the correct answer in the same time, there was a tiebreaker question to determine who proceeded to the main game. The round was primarily used to determine the next contestant for the main game, and was more often than not used more than once in an episode.\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary round, the contestant began the main game, tackling a series of increasingly difficult questions, which offered progressively higher sums of money, up to the top prize of \u00a31,000,000. The stacks of 15 questions were randomly chosen from a list of pre generated questions based on general knowledge. For each question there were four options to choose from, labelled \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019. During the game, contestants were allowed to use a set of 3 lifelines to help them with a question at any time, and two monetary safety nets were provided: if a contestant got a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they left with that amount as their prize. If a contestant was unsure about a question they were facing, they were allowed to leave the game at that point with the cash amount they had already won. While the initial questions were typically generally easy, the subsequent ones after it required the contestant to confirm that their answer/decision is final, at which point it became locked in and could not be reversed. As a rule, host Tarrant was not shown the correct answer on his monitor until a contestant had given their final answer. If an episode had reached the end of its allotted time, an audio cue was triggered to highlight this; contestants who were still playing the main game were left to wait until filming for the next episode began before they could continue, though this was not the case for special editions of the show, such as celebrity episodes.\n\nOver the course of the show's history on British television, the format of the programme has been altered in a number of aspects, mainly towards the setup of questions and the payout structure used in the game show, along with minor tweaks and changes in other aspects:\n* Between September 1998 and July 2007, contestants had to answer 15 questions, with two safety nets placed at \u00a31,000 and \u00a332,000, and they were allowed three standard lifelines.\n* Between August 2007 and February 2014, the number of questions was reduced to 12, with most cash values adjusted. This alteration led to the second safety net being assigned to \u00a350,000.\n* From the start of the 27th series in August 2010, the format was changed to include a clock format, similar to the 2008\u201310 US version, but with some differences. The time limit was 15 seconds for the first two questions, and 30 seconds for the next five questions, but the last five questions had no time limit. The clock would start ticking down as soon as the answers appeared on screen, and the contestant would have to give his/her final answer within the time limit. If they ran out of time it was treated as an incorrect answer. The clock would briefly pause, however, if any lifeline was used. It also added a new, fourth lifeline, Switch, which would be made available after passing question seven. The first episode of this series also saw the discontinuation of 'Fastest Finger First' for the first time since the inception of the show, so the contestants were then pre-selected by the production staff.\n* For the revival in 2018 and subsequent series of the show, the show returned to the 1998\u20132007 format, including the original payout structure and fastest finger process, with minor differences. A new lifeline, \u2018Ask The Host\u2019, was introduced and the placement of the second safety net could be set by the contestant. Upon reaching \u00a31,000, the contestant would be asked before each subsequent question if they would like to set the safety net to the cash value, with it offered up to question 14, \u00a3500,000. The number of contestants for 'Fastest Finger First' were also reduced from ten to six.\n* At the end of the allotted time of each standard episode, a loud sound (one long brass note) indicates the end of the show. The host refers to this noise as the \u2018klaxon\u2019. During the live specials whilst Tarrant was host, the contestant's game would end and any question in play would be null and void unless they gave a final answer before the klaxon sounded. The contestant\u2019s game then carries on at the start of the next episode.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a contestant's game, they may make use of a set of lifelines to provide assistance on a question. Throughout the course of the show's history, these lifelines involve the following:\n* '''50:50''': Two random incorrect answers are eliminated by the computer, leaving the correct answer and the one remaining incorrect answer, thus granting the contestant a 50/50 chance of answering the question correctly.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': The contestant calls one of their friends, and has 30 seconds to read the question and answers to them. The friend uses the leftover time to offer an answer. Since 2011, a member of the production team accompanies the friend to prevent cheating, such as using the Internet or reading books. Since the revival in 2018, host Jeremy Clarkson makes sure this is carried out over each phone a friend phone call by asking the contestant\u2019s phone a friend to confirm that a member of the production office is present to record them and ensure no form of cheating occurs.\n* '''Ask the Audience''': Audience members use keypads to vote on what they believe to be the correct answer to the question they\u2019ve been asked. The percentage of each option selected by the audience is displayed to the contestant after this vote, as well as appearing on TV.\n* '''Switch/Flip''' (2002\u201303, 2010\u201314): The computer replaces one question with another of the same monetary value. Any lifelines already used on the original question are not reinstated. In its original run, Switch was originally called \"Flip\" and could only be used if the contestant chose to trade in one of their unused lifelines for it, using it up to three times. From 2010 to 2014, this lifeline was separated and became available after the contestant answered seven questions correctly.\n* '''Ask the Host''' (2018\u2013present): Host Jeremy Clarkson offers advice or an answer to the question he is asked. This lifeline can also be used just once. He must disclose that he has no contact with outside sources and there is no time limit as to how long he can offer help. On this question, the answer does not reveal itself to the host when the contestant plays; instead, the computer reveals the answer to the host and contestant at the same time.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.itv.com/presscentre/press-releases/who-wants-be-millionaire-returns-itv-saturday-brand-new-twists|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? returns to ITV this Saturday with brand new twists|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n==Series overview==\n===Main series===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n|-\n!Series\n!Start date\n!End date\n!Episodes\n!Presenter\n|-\n|'''1'''\n|4 September 1998\n|25 December 1998\n|10\n| rowspan=\"30\" |[[Chris Tarrant]]\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|1 January 1999\n|13 January 1999\n|13\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|5 March 1999\n|16 March 1999\n|12\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|3 September 1999\n|14 September 1999\n|13\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|5 November 1999\n|25 December 1999\n|18\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|16 January 2000\n|22 January 2000\n|7\n|-\n|'''7'''\n|26 March 2000\n|1 May 2000\n|13\n|-\n|'''8'''\n|7 September 2000\n|6 January 2001\n|55\n|-\n|'''9'''\n|8 January 2001\n|26 April 2001\n|45\n|-\n|'''10'''\n|4 September 2001\n|29 December 2001\n|43\n|-\n|'''11'''\n|5 January 2002\n|9 April 2002\n|55\n|-\n|'''12'''\n|31 August 2002\n|28 December 2002\n|20\n|-\n|'''13'''\n|4 January 2003\n|31 May 2003\n|22\n|-\n|'''14'''\n|30 August 2003\n|27 December 2003\n|22\n|-\n|'''15'''\n|3 January 2004\n|5 June 2004\n|23\n|-\n|'''16'''\n|18 September 2004\n|25 December 2004\n|16\n|-\n|'''17'''\n|1 January 2005\n|11 June 2005\n|25\n|-\n|'''18'''\n|17 September 2005\n|31 December 2005\n|10\n|-\n|'''19'''\n|7 January 2006\n|8 July 2006\n|28\n|-\n|'''20'''\n|9 September 2006\n|6 January 2007\n|13\n|-\n|'''21'''\n|10 March 2007\n|28 July 2007\n|18\n|-\n|'''22'''\n|18 August 2007\n|30 October 2007\n|10\n|-\n|'''23'''\n|1 January 2008\n|3 June 2008\n|20\n|-\n|'''24'''\n|16 August 2008\n|31 January 2009\n|18\n|-\n|'''25'''\n|13 June 2009\n|20 December 2009\n|20\n|-\n|'''26'''\n|13 April 2010\n|8 June 2010\n|8\n|-\n|'''27'''\n|3 August 2010\n|23 December 2010\n|10\n|-\n|'''28'''\n|2 April 2011\n|19 December 2011\n|6\n|-\n|'''29'''\n|3 January 2012\n|20 December 2012\n|10\n|-\n|'''30'''\n|1 January 2013\n|11 February 2014\n|10\n|-\n|'''31'''\n|5 May 2018\n|11 May 2018\n|7\n| rowspan=\"6\" |[[Jeremy Clarkson]]\n|-\n| rowspan=\"2\" | '''32'''\n| 1 January 2019\n| 6 January 2019\n| rowspan=\"2\" |10\n|-\n|4 March 2019\n|8 March 2019\n|-\n|'''33'''\n|24 August 2019 \n|20 October 2019\n|10\n|-\n|'''34'''\n|25 December 2019\n|Spring 2020\n|12\n|}\n\n===Specials===\n*'''''Is that Your Final Answer?''''' \u2013 a one-hour documentary about the show, which aired on ITV on 24 December 1999.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ukchristmastv.weebly.com/itv-1999.html|title=ITV 1999|website=UK Christmas TV|accessdate=5 January 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k9xrMLC3tA0|title=Who Wants To Be A Millionaire \u2013 Is That Your Final Answer Documentary (1999)|first=|last=Coldclough|publisher=|accessdate=5 January 2019|via=YouTube}}</ref> Directed and produced by Robin Lough, it featured rare footage from the unaired pilot version of the programme, which has completely different music and behind the scenes footage from the programmes aired in Series 4 (September 1999). A similar documentary of the same name was also aired in Australia during 2000. A shorter half-hour Russian version was aired on 4 November 2000.

The documentary later aired on 15 February 2004, with subtitles, on [[HRT 2]] in Croatia. A special episode of the French version of ''Millionaire'', entitled \"''L'\u00e9mission interdite''\" (English translation: ''Prohibited episode''), was devoted to the scandal. This was broadcast on 1 July 2003 on [[TF1]].\n*'''''QUIZ''''' \u2013 A drama in three parts, each one hour in length, which is set to air on  13, 14 and 15 April 2020 and is based on the 'cheating scandal' in which Major Charles Ingram cheated. Michael Sheen will be appearing as Chris Tarrant.\n\n== Text game (2004\u20132007) ==\nOn 23 October 2004 the show included a new feature called the \"Walkaway Text Game\". The competition was offered to viewers at home to play the text game where they had to answer the question, if a contestant decided to walk home with the cash prize they have got, by choosing the letters 'A, B, C or D' within 30 seconds to a specific mobile number. The viewer who answered the question won \u00a31,000 by having their entries selected randomly.\n\nOn 9 September 2006, there were some changes. The competition stayed the same but this time, they played it before some commercial breaks.  A question to which the contestant had given their final answer, but the correct answer had not yet been revealed, was offered as a competition to viewers. Entry was via [[SMS]] text message at a cost of \u00a31 per entry, and the competition ran through the commercial break, after which the answer was revealed and the game continued. One viewer who answered the question correctly won \u00a31,000.

On air since September 1998 and devised by Briggs, the show's format sees contestants taking on multiple-choice questions based upon general knowledge, winning a cash prize for each question they answer correctly, with the amount offered increasing as they take on more difficult questions. To assist each contestant who takes part, they are given lifelines to use, may walk away with the money they already have won if they wish not to risk answering a question, and are provided with a safety net that gives them a guaranteed cash prize if they give an incorrect answer, provided they reach a specific milestone in the quiz.\n\nThe original series aired for 30 series and aired a total of 592 episodes, from 4 September 1998 to 11 February 2014, and was presented by [[Chris Tarrant]]. Over the course of its initial run, the show had five contestants achieve the show\u2019s ultimate aim and walk away with the cash prize of \u00a31&nbsp;million. The original format of the programme was tweaked in later years; this included changing the number of questions from fifteen to twelve, altering the payout structure and later incorporating a time limit which included an attainable fourth lifeline. There were several controversies during its run, including an attempt by a contestant to [[R v Ingram, C., Ingram, D. and Whittock, T.|defraud the show of its top prize]].\n\nFour years after the original series ended, ITV announced that the series would be revived, this time produced by [[Stellify Media]], to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the programme. The revival was based closely on the show\u2019s original format. It was hosted by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and filmed at [[Dock10 (television facility)|Dock10 studios]]. The success of the revival series has ensured that subsequent series of the show have been commissioned, and in January 2019 the show reached the milestone of 600 episodes since first appearing on air.\n\nThe game show became one of the most significant shows in British popular culture, ranking 23rd in a list of the [[BFI TV 100|100 Greatest British Television Programmes]] compiled in 2000 by the [[British Film Institute]]. It was the highest quiz programme to appear on the list. Its success led to versions in [[International versions of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|many other countries]] under an [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?|international franchise of the same name]], all of which follow the same general format, though with some versions including unique differences in gameplay and lifelines provided.\n\n==History==\n{{Multiple image\n| direction = horizontal\n| width =\n| align = right\n| header = UK presenters of ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?''\n| image1 = Chris Tarrant Phooto.jpg\n| image2 = Jeremy Clarkson.jpg\n| width1 = 130\n| width2 = 135\n| caption1 = [[Chris Tarrant]] (1998\u20132014)\n| caption2 = [[Jeremy Clarkson]] (2018\u2013present)\n| alt1 = Tarrant\n| alt2 = Clarkson\n}}\n\n===Creation===\nThe creation of the game show was led by David Briggs, assisted by Mike Whitehill and Steven Knight, who had helped him before with creating a number of promotional games for Chris Tarrant's [[Capital Breakfast|morning show]] on [[95.8 Capital FM|Capital FM]] radio. The basic premise for the show was a twist on the conventional game-show genre of the time, with a focus towards the setup used in radio quizzes, in that the programme would have one contestant taking on the game and answering questions, but with the ability to pull out at any time, to have certain points in the quiz where once passed, they could have a set prize given to them if they should give a wrong answer, and be provided with special forms of assistance during their game. During the design phase, the show was given the [[working title]] of \"Cash Mountain\", before Briggs decided upon using the name of the [[Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? (song)|song]] written by [[Cole Porter]] for the 1956 film ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'', as the show's finalised title.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> After presenting their idea to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]], the broadcaster gave the green-light for production to begin on a series.\n\nThe set designed for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was conceived by British [[production designer]] [[Andy Walmsley]], who focused the design towards making contestants feel uncomfortable, creating an atmosphere of tension similar to [[Thriller film|movie thriller]].<ref name=\"Walmsley\">{{Cite web|title=Millionaire|url=http://www.andywalmsley.com/millionaire.php|publisher=Andy Walmsley, Production Designer|accessdate=24 September 2013}}</ref> The design was in stark contrast to the design of sets made for more typical game shows, which are designed to make contestants feel more at ease.<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> Walmsley's design feature a central stage made primarily with [[Plexiglas]], with a huge dish underneath covered in mirror paper,<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/><ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\"/> onto which two slightly-modified, {{convert|3|foot|m}}-high Pietranera Arco All chairs were chosen for use by both the contestant and the host, each having an [[LG Electronics|LG]] computer monitor directly facing each that would be used to display questions and other pertinent information. The rest of the set featured seating spaced out around the main stage in a circle, with breaks in them to allow movement of people on and off the set. The lighting rig used for the set was designed so as to allow only the lights to switch from illuminating the entire set, to focusing on the host and contestant on the main stage when a game was underway, but to include special lighting effects when the contestant reached higher cash prize amounts. His overall conception would eventually prove to be a success, becoming one of the most reproduced scenic designs in television history.<ref name=\"Walmsley\"/>\n\nThe music provided for the show was composed by father-and-son duo [[Keith Strachan|Keith]] and [[Matthew Strachan]]. The Strachans' composition for the game show helped with Briggs' tense game design, by providing the necessary drama and tension. Unlike other game show musical scores, the music provided for ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'' was designed to be played throughout the entire episode of the show. The Strachans main theme for the game show was inspired from the \"Mars\" movement of [[Gustav Holst]]'s ''[[The Planets]]''. For the main game of the show, the pair designed the music to feature three variations, with the second and third compositions focused on emphasising the increased tension of the game \u2013 as a contestant made progress to higher cash amounts, the pitch of the music was increased by a semitone for each subsequent question.<ref name=\"Million Dollar Notes\">{{cite news|title=Million Pound Notes: Keith Strachan|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|newspaper=[[The Stage]]|date=21 March 2005|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612081217/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/6991|archivedate=12 June 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> On [[Game Show Network]]'s ''Gameshow Hall of Fame'' special, the narrator described the Strachan tracks as \"mimicking the sound of a beating heart\", and stated that as the contestant works their way up the money ladder, the music is \"perfectly in tune with their ever-increasing pulse\".<ref name=\"Gameshow Hall of Fame\">{{Cite episode|title=Who Wants to Be a Millionaire|series=Gameshow Hall of Fame|publisher=GSN|date=21 January 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Original series===\nWith the show created, ITV assigned [[Chris Tarrant]] as its host, and set its premiere to 4 September 1998.

In 2002, he started legal proceedings against the production company, ITV, and five individuals who had claimed they had created ''Who Wants to Be a Millionaire?'', stating that the idea from the show was taken from several elements he had created \u2013 a board game format he conceived in 1981; a two-page TV format, known as ''Millionaire'', made in 1987; and the telephone mechanics for a TV concept he created in 1989, ''BT Lottery''. In his claim, Bachini stated that he submitted documents for his TV concepts to Paul Smith, from a sister company of Celador's, in March 1995 and again in January 1996, and to [[Claudia Rosencrantz]] of ITV, also in January 1996, accusing both of using roughly 90% of the format for ''Millionaire'' in the pilot for the game show, including the use of twenty questions, lifelines and safety nets, although the lifelines were conceived under different names \u2013 Bachini claimed that he never coined the phrase \"phone-a-friend\" that Briggs designed in his format. In response to this claim, Celador made a counter-claim that the franchise originated from the basic format idea conceived by Briggs. The defendants in the claim took Bachini to a summary hearing but lost their right to have his claim dismissed. Although Bachini won the right to go to trial, he was unable to after the hearing due to serious illness. Celador eventually settled the matter with him out-of-court.<ref>[http://icbirmingham.icnetwork.co.uk/sundaymercury/news/tm_objectid=15908484&method=full&siteid=50002&headline=who-wants-to-sue-a-millionaire-name_page.html Birmingham Sunday Mercury], 28 August 2005</ref>\n\nIn March 2006, Celador began procedures to sell the format of the show and all UK episodes, as part of their first step towards the sale of their formats divisions.

Initially, the round required contestants to provide the correct answer to a question, but from series 2 onwards, they were tasked with putting four answers in the correct order stated within the question (i.e. earliest to latest). The contestant who answered the question correctly, and in the fastest time, won the opportunity to play the main game. In the event that no one answered the question correctly, a new question was asked, while if two or more contestants gave the correct answer in the same time, there was a tiebreaker question to determine who proceeded to the main game. The round was primarily used to determine the next contestant for the main game, and was more often than not used more than once in an episode.\n\nUpon completion of the preliminary round, the contestant began the main game, tackling a series of increasingly difficult questions, which offered progressively higher sums of money, up to the top prize of \u00a31,000,000. The stacks of 15 questions were randomly chosen from a list of pre generated questions based on general knowledge. For each question there were four options to choose from, labelled \u2018A\u2019, \u2018B\u2019, \u2018C\u2019 and \u2018D\u2019. During the game, contestants were allowed to use a set of 3 lifelines to help them with a question at any time, and two monetary safety nets were provided: if a contestant got a question wrong, but had reached a designated cash value during their game, they left with that amount as their prize. If a contestant was unsure about a question they were facing, they were allowed to leave the game at that point with the cash amount they had already won. While the initial questions were typically generally easy, the subsequent ones after it required the contestant to confirm that their answer/decision is final, at which point it became locked in and could not be reversed. As a rule, host Tarrant was not shown the correct answer on his monitor until a contestant had given their final answer. If an episode had reached the end of its allotted time, an audio cue was triggered to highlight this; contestants who were still playing the main game were left to wait until filming for the next episode began before they could continue, though this was not the case for special editions of the show, such as celebrity episodes.\n\nOver the course of the show's history on British television, the format of the programme has been altered in a number of aspects, mainly towards the setup of questions and the payout structure used in the game show, along with minor tweaks and changes in other aspects:\n* Between September 1998 and July 2007, contestants had to answer 15 questions, with two safety nets placed at \u00a31,000 and \u00a332,000, and they were allowed three standard lifelines.\n* Between August 2007 and February 2014, the number of questions was reduced to 12, with most cash values adjusted. This alteration led to the second safety net being assigned to \u00a350,000.\n* From the start of the 27th series in August 2010, the format was changed to include a clock format, similar to the 2008\u201310 US version, but with some differences. The time limit was 15 seconds for the first two questions, and 30 seconds for the next five questions, but the last five questions had no time limit. The clock would start ticking down as soon as the answers appeared on screen, and the contestant would have to give his/her final answer within the time limit. If they ran out of time it was treated as an incorrect answer. The clock would briefly pause, however, if any lifeline was used. It also added a new, fourth lifeline, Switch, which would be made available after passing question seven. The first episode of this series also saw the discontinuation of 'Fastest Finger First' for the first time since the inception of the show, so the contestants were then pre-selected by the production staff.\n* For the revival in 2018 and subsequent series of the show, the show returned to the 1998\u20132007 format, including the original payout structure and fastest finger process, with minor differences. A new lifeline, \u2018Ask The Host\u2019, was introduced and the placement of the second safety net could be set by the contestant. Upon reaching \u00a31,000, the contestant would be asked before each subsequent question if they would like to set the safety net to the cash value, with it offered up to question 14, \u00a3500,000. The number of contestants for 'Fastest Finger First' were also reduced from ten to six.\n* At the end of the allotted time of each standard episode, a loud sound (one long brass note) indicates the end of the show. The host refers to this noise as the \u2018klaxon\u2019. During the live specials whilst Tarrant was host, the contestant's game would end and any question in play would be null and void unless they gave a final answer before the klaxon sounded. The contestant\u2019s game then carries on at the start of the next episode.\n\n===Lifelines===\nDuring a contestant's game, they may make use of a set of lifelines to provide assistance on a question. Throughout the course of the show's history, these lifelines involve the following:\n* '''50:50''': Two random incorrect answers are eliminated by the computer, leaving the correct answer and the one remaining incorrect answer, thus granting the contestant a 50/50 chance of answering the question correctly.\n* '''Phone a Friend''': The contestant calls one of their friends, and has 30 seconds to read the question and answers to them. The friend uses the leftover time to offer an answer. Since 2011, a member of the production team accompanies the friend to prevent cheating, such as using the Internet or reading books. Since the revival in 2018, host Jeremy Clarkson makes sure this is carried out over each phone a friend phone call by asking the contestant\u2019s phone a friend to confirm that a member of the production office is present to record them and ensure no form of cheating occurs.\n* '''Ask the Audience''': Audience members use keypads to vote on what they believe to be the correct answer to the question they\u2019ve been asked. The percentage of each option selected by the audience is displayed to the contestant after this vote, as well as appearing on TV.\n* '''Switch/Flip''' (2002\u201303, 2010\u201314): The computer replaces one question with another of the same monetary value. Any lifelines already used on the original question are not reinstated. In its original run, Switch was originally called \"Flip\" and could only be used if the contestant chose to trade in one of their unused lifelines for it, using it up to three times.

The viewer who answered the question won \u00a31,000 by having their entries selected randomly.\n\nOn 9 September 2006, there were some changes.

Entry was via [[SMS]] text message at a cost of \u00a31 per entry, and the competition ran through the commercial break, after which the answer was revealed and the game continued.

There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties.{{sfn|Hennessy|2001|pp=39\u201340}} However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s.<ref>Stephen Taylor ODNB</ref> It was used in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as early as 1805,{{sfn|Castlereagh|1805}} and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.{{sfnm|1a1=Eardley-Wilmot|1y=1885|2a1=Macfarlane|2y=1885}} In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]].{{sfn|Marriott|1923|page=83}} Modern historians generally consider [[Sir Robert Walpole]], who led the government of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for over twenty years from 1721,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1999|1p=266|2a1=Hennessy|2y=2001|2pp=39\u201340}} as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]].

There is no specific date for when the office of prime minister first appeared, as the role was not created but rather evolved over a period of time through a merger of duties.{{sfn|Hennessy|2001|pp=39\u201340}} However, the term was regularly if informally used of Walpole by the 1730s.<ref>Stephen Taylor ODNB</ref> It was used in the [[House of Commons of Great Britain|House of Commons]] as early as 1805,{{sfn|Castlereagh|1805}} and it was certainly in parliamentary use by the 1880s.{{sfnm|1a1=Eardley-Wilmot|1y=1885|2a1=Macfarlane|2y=1885}} In 1905 the post of prime minister was officially given recognition in the [[Orders of precedence in the United Kingdom|order of precedence]].{{sfn|Marriott|1923|page=83}} Modern historians generally consider [[Sir Robert Walpole]], who led the government of [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] for over twenty years from 1721,{{sfnm|1a1=Clarke|1y=1999|1p=266|2a1=Hennessy|2y=2001|2pp=39\u201340}} as the first prime minister. Walpole is also the longest-serving British prime minister by this definition.{{sfn|BBC News|1998}} However, [[Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman]] was the first and [[Margaret Thatcher]] the longest-serving prime minister officially referred to as such in the order of precedence.{{sfnm|1a1=Mackay|1y=1987|2a1=Marriott|2y=1923|2p=83}} The first to use the title in an official act was [[Benjamin Disraeli]], who signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] as \"Prime Minister of her Britannic Majesty\" in 1878.{{sfn|Bogdanor|1997}}\n\nStrictly, the first prime minister of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom (of Great Britain and Ireland)]] was [[William Pitt the Younger]].{{sfnm|1a1=Burt|1y=1874|1p=106|2a1=Castlereagh|2y=1805}} The first prime minister of the current United Kingdom, i.e. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, was [[Bonar Law]],{{sfn|Law|1922}} although the country was not renamed officially until 1927, when [[Stanley Baldwin]] was the serving prime minister.{{sfn|Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act|1927}}\n\nDue to the gradual evolution of the post of prime minister, the title is applied to early prime ministers only retrospectively;{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=1}} this has sometimes given rise to academic dispute. [[William Pulteney, 1st Earl of Bath|Lord Bath]] and [[James Waldegrave, 2nd Earl Waldegrave|Lord Waldegrave]] are sometimes listed as prime ministers.{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} Bath was invited to [[Short-lived ministry|form a ministry]] by [[George II of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George II}}]] when [[Henry Pelham]] resigned in 1746,{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=47}} as was Waldegrave in 1757 after the dismissal of [[William Pitt the Elder]],{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} who dominated the affairs of government [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|during the Seven Years' War]]. Neither was able to command sufficient parliamentary support to form a government; Bath stepped down after two days,{{sfn|Carpenter|1992|page=37}} and Waldegrave after three.{{sfn|Leonard|2010|page=65}} Modern academic consensus does not consider either man to have held office as prime minister,{{sfn|''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography''|2011}} and they are therefore listed separately.\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Before 1721== \nPrior to the [[Georgian era]], the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]] of [[Kingdom of England|England]] was led by the [[Lord High Treasurer]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} By the late [[Tudor period]], the Lord High Treasurer was regarded as one of the [[Great Officers of State]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911f}} and was often (though not always) the dominant figure in government: [[Edward Seymour, 1st Duke of Somerset]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1547\u20131549),{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} served as [[Lord Protector]] to his prepubescent nephew [[Edward VI of England|{{nowrap|Edward VI}}]];{{sfn|Pollard|1904}} [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley]] (Lord High Treasurer, 1572\u20131598),{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} was the dominant [[List of ministers to Queen Elizabeth I|minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}}]];{{sfn|Chisholm|1911a}} Burghley's son [[Robert Cecil, 1st Earl of Salisbury]], succeeded his father as chief minister to {{nowrap|Elizabeth I}} (1598\u20131603) and was eventually appointed by [[James VI and I|{{nowrap|James I}}]] as Lord High Treasurer (1608\u20131612).{{sfn|Chisholm|1911c}}\n\nBy the late [[Stuart period]], the Treasury was often run not by a single individual, i.e. Lord High Treasurer, but by a [[wikt:commission#Noun|commission]] of [[Lords of the Treasury]],{{sfn|Chapman|2002}} led by the [[First Lord of the Treasury]]. The last Lords High Treasurer, [[Lord Godolphin]] (1702\u20131710) and [[Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer|Lord Oxford]] (1711\u20131714),{{sfnm|1a1=Fisher Russell Barker|1y=1890|2a1=Stephen|2y=1890}} ran the government of [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]].{{sfn|Morrill|2018}}\n\nAfter the succession of [[George I of Great Britain|{{nowrap|George I}}]] in 1714, the arrangement of a commission of Lords of the Treasury (as opposed to a single Lord High Treasurer) became permanent.{{sfn|Chapman|2002|page=15}} For the next three years, the government was headed by [[Charles Townshend, 2nd Viscount Townshend|Lord Townshend]], who was appointed [[Secretary of State for the Northern Department]].{{sfn|McMullen Rigg|1899}} Subsequently, [[James Stanhope, 1st Earl Stanhope|Lord Stanhope]] and [[Charles Spencer, 3rd Earl of Sunderland|Lord Sunderland]] ran the government jointly,{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} with Stanhope managing foreign affairs and Sunderland domestic.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Stanhope died in February 1721 and Sunderland resigned two months later;{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911d|2a1=Chisholm|2y=1911e}} Townshend and [[Robert Walpole]] were then invited to form the next government.{{sfnm|1a1=Chisholm|1y=1911b|2a1=McMullen Rigg|2y=1899}} From that point, the holder of the {{em|office}} of First Lord also usually (albeit unofficially) held the status of prime minister.

After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]'' (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]] before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]. Foucault subsequently published ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform. Foucault later published ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' (1975) and ''[[The History of Sexuality]]'' (1976), in which he developed archaeological and genealogical methods which emphasized the role that power plays in society.\n\nFoucault died in Paris of [[HIV/AIDS]]; he became the first public figure in France to die from the disease. His partner [[Daniel Defert]] founded the [[AIDES]] charity in his memory.\n\n{{toc limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n\n===Early Years: 1926\u20131938===\nPaul-Michel Foucault was born on {{Date|15 October 1926|DMY}} in the city of [[Poitiers]], west-central [[France]], as the second of three children in a prosperous, [[social conservatism|socially-conservative]], [[Upper middle class|upper-middle-class]] family.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=3|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Family tradition prescribed naming him after his father, Paul Foucault (1893\u20131959), but his mother insisted on the addition of \"Michel;\" referred to as \"Paul\" at school, he would express a preference for \"Michel\" throughout his life.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=4\u20135|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=39}}\n\nHis father, a successful local surgeon born in [[Fontainebleau]], moved to Poitiers, where he set up his own practice.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=1\u20132}} He would marry Anne Malapert, the daughter of prosperous surgeon Dr. Prosper Malapert, who owned a private practice and taught anatomy at the [[University of Poitiers]]' School of Medicine.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=1}} Paul Foucault eventually took over his father-in-law's medical practice, while Anne took charge of their large mid-19th-century house, Le Piroir, in the village of [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=2}} Together the couple had three children\u2014a girl named Francine and two boys, Paul-Michel and Denys\u2014who all shared the same fair hair and bright blue eyes.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=3}} The children were raised to be nominal [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], attending mass at the Church of Saint-Porchair, and while Michel briefly became an [[altar boy]], none of the family was devout.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=5|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=4}}\n\nIn later life, Foucault revealed very little about his childhood.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=4|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=39}} Describing himself as a \"juvenile delinquent,\" he claimed his father was a \"bully\" who sternly punished him.{{sfn|Miller|1993|p=39}} In 1930, two years early, Foucault began his schooling at the local [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV|Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV]]. There he would undertake two years of elementary education before entering the main ''[[lyc\u00e9e]]'', where he stayed until 1936. Afterwards, he would take his first four years of secondary education at the same establishment, excelling in French, Greek, Latin, and history, though doing poorly at mathematics, including [[arithmetic]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|pp=8\u20139}} \n\n=== Teens to Young Adulthood: 1939\u20131945 ===\nIn 1939, the [[Second World War]] would break out, followed by [[Nazi Germany]]'s occupation of France in 1940. Foucault's parents opposed the occupation and the [[Vichy France|Vichy regime]], but did not join the [[French Resistance|Resistance]].{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=7}} That year, Foucault's mother would enroll him in the Coll\u00e8ge Saint-Stanislas, a strict Roman Catholic institution run by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuits]]. Though going on to describing his years there as an \"ordeal,\" Foucault would excel academically, particularly in philosophy, history, and literature.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=6\u20137|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=10|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=39\u201340|4a1=Smart|4y=2002|4p=19}} In 1942 he entered his final year, the ''terminale'', where he focused on the study of philosophy, earning his ''[[baccalaur\u00e9at]]'' in 1943.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=10}}\n\nReturning to the local Lyc\u00e9e Henry-IV, he studied history and philosophy for a year,{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=13}} aided by a personal tutor, the philosopher {{ill|Louis Girard (philosopher)|lt=Louis Girard|fr|Louis Girard}}.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=9|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=11}} Rejecting his father's wishes that he become a surgeon, in 1945 Foucault went to [[Paris]], where he enrolled in one of the country's most prestigious secondary schools, which was also known as the [[Lyc\u00e9e Henri-IV]]. Here he studied under the philosopher [[Jean Hyppolite]], an [[existentialism|existentialist]] and expert on the work of 19th-century German philosopher [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hyppolite had devoted himself to uniting existentialist theories with the [[dialectics|dialectical theories]] of Hegel and [[Karl Marx]]. These ideas influenced Foucault, who adopted Hyppolite's conviction that philosophy must develop through a study of history.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=11, 14\u201321|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=15\u201317|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=40\u201341}}\n\n===\u00c9cole Normale Sup\u00e9rieure and University of Paris: 1946\u20131951===\n{{rquote|right|''I wasn't always smart, I was actually very stupid in school ...

Of the hundred students entering the ENS, Foucault ranked fourth based on his entry results, and encountered the highly competitive nature of the institution. Like most of his classmates, he lived in the school's communal dormitories on the Parisian Rue d'Ulm.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=24\u201325|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=17\u201322|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=45}}\nHe remained largely unpopular, spending much time alone, reading voraciously.  His fellow students noted his love of violence and the macabre; he decorated his bedroom with images of torture and war drawn during the [[Napoleonic Wars]] by Spanish artist [[Francisco Goya]], and on one occasion chased a classmate with a dagger.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=26|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=45}} Prone to [[self-harm]], in 1948 Foucault allegedly [[suicide attempt|attempted suicide]]; his father sent him to see the psychiatrist [[Jean Delay]] at the [[Sainte-Anne Hospital Center]].

A [[Marxism|Marxist]], he influenced both Foucault and a number of other students, encouraging them to join the [[French Communist Party]] (''Parti communiste fran\u00e7ais'', PCF). Foucault did so in 1950, but never became particularly active in its activities, and never adopted an [[Orthodox Marxism|orthodox Marxist]] viewpoint, refuting core Marxist tenets such as [[class struggle]].{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=32\u201336, 51\u201355|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=23\u201326, 37\u201340|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=57}} He soon became dissatisfied with the bigotry that he experienced within the party's ranks; he personally faced [[homophobia]] and was appalled by the [[anti-semitism]] exhibited during the 1952-1953 \"[[Doctors' plot]]\" in the [[Soviet Union]].

Together, they tried to produce their greatest work, heavily used recreational drugs and engaged in [[sado-masochism|sado-masochistic]] sexual activity.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=65\u201368|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50\u201353|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=66, 79\u201382, 89\u201391}} In August 1953, Foucault and Barraqu\u00e9 holidayed in Italy, where the philosopher immersed himself in ''[[Untimely Meditations]]'' (1873\u201376), a set of four essays by the philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]. Later describing Nietzsche's work as \"a revelation\", he felt that reading the book deeply affected him, being a watershed moment in his life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=52|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=50|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=64\u201367}} Foucault subsequently experienced another groundbreaking self-revelation when watching a Parisian performance of [[Samuel Beckett]]'s new play, ''[[Waiting for Godot]]'', in 1953.{{sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=41|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2pp=64\u201365}}\n\nInterested in literature, Foucault was an avid reader of the philosopher [[Maurice Blanchot]]'s book reviews published in ''[[Nouvelle Revue Fran\u00e7aise]]''. Enamoured of Blanchot's literary style and critical theories, in later works he adopted Blanchot's technique of \"interviewing\" himself.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=58|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=55|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=82\u201384}} Foucault also came across [[Hermann Broch]]'s 1945 novel ''[[The Death of Virgil]]'', a work that obsessed both him and Barraqu\u00e9. While the latter attempted to convert the work into an [[epic opera]], Foucault admired Broch's text for its portrayal of death as an affirmation of life.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=66|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=53|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=84\u201385}} The couple took a mutual interest in the work of such authors as the [[Marquis de Sade]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Franz Kafka]] and [[Jean Genet]], all of whose works explored the themes of sex and violence.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=31|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=51\u201352}}\n\n{{rquote|right|''I belong to that generation who, as students, had before their eyes, and were limited by, a horizon consisting of Marxism, phenomenology and existentialism.

Foucault was particularly interested in Binswanger's studies of [[Ellen West]] who, like himself, had a deep obsession with suicide, eventually killing herself.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=44\u201345|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=59\u201361|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=73\u201375}} In 1954, Foucault authored an introduction to Binswanger's paper \"Dream and Existence\", in which he argued that dreams constituted \"the birth of the world\" or \"the heart laid bare,\" expressing the mind's deepest desires.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=45\u201346|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=67\u201369|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3pp=76\u201377}} That same year, Foucault published his first book, ''Maladie mentale et personalit\u00e9'' (\"Mental Illness and Personality\"), in which he exhibited his influence from both Marxist and Heideggerian thought, covering a wide range of subject matter from the reflex psychology of Pavlov to the classic psychoanalysis of Freud. Referencing the work of [[Sociology|sociologists]] and anthropologists such as [[\u00c9mile Durkheim]] and [[Margaret Mead]], he presented his theory that illness was culturally relative.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=68\u201370|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=63\u201366|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=63}} Biographer [[James Miller (academic)|James Miller]] noted that while the book exhibited \"erudition and evident intelligence,\" it lacked the \"kind of fire and flair\" which Foucault exhibited in subsequent works.{{Sfn|Miller|1993|pp=63}} It was largely critically ignored, receiving only one review at the time.{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=67}} Foucault grew to despise it, unsuccessfully attempting to prevent its republication and translation into English.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=70}}\n\n===Sweden, Poland, and West Germany: 1955\u20131960===\nFoucault spent the next five years abroad, first in [[Sweden]], working as cultural diplomat at the [[University of Uppsala]], a job obtained through his acquaintance with historian of religion [[Georges Dum\u00e9zil]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=73\u201374|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=70\u201371}} At [[Uppsala]] he was appointed a Reader in French language and literature, while simultaneously working as director of the Maison de France, thus opening the possibility of a cultural-diplomatic career.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=76\u201378|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=73, 76}} Although finding it difficult to adjust to the \"Nordic gloom\" and long winters, he developed close friendships with two Frenchmen, biochemist Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Miquel and physicist Jacques Papet-L\u00e9pine, and entered into romantic and sexual relationships with various men. In Uppsala, he became known for his heavy alcohol consumption and reckless driving in his new [[Jaguar Cars|Jaguar car]].{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=74\u201377|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=74\u201375}} In spring 1956, Barraqu\u00e9 broke from his relationship with Foucault, announcing that he wanted to leave the \"vertigo of madness\".{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=68|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=81|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} In Uppsala, Foucault spent much of his spare time in the university's ''[[Carolina Rediviva]]'' library, making use of their Bibliotheca Walleriana collection of texts on the history of medicine for his ongoing research.{{sfn|Macey|1993|p=78}} Finishing his doctoral thesis, Foucault hoped it would be accepted by Uppsala University, but [[Sten Lindroth]], a [[positivism|positivistic]] historian of science there, was unimpressed, asserting that it was full of speculative generalisations and was a poor work of history; he refused to allow Foucault to be awarded a doctorate at Uppsala. In part because of this rejection, Foucault left Sweden.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=83\u201386|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=79\u201380}} Later, Foucault admitted that the work was a first draft with certain lack of quality.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190}}\n\nAgain at Dum\u00e9zil's recognition, in October 1958 Foucault arrived in the capital of [[Polish People's Republic]], [[Warsaw]] and was placed in charge of the [[University of Warsaw]]'s Centre Fran\u00e7ais.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=87|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=84|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=91}} Foucault found life in Poland difficult due to the lack of material goods and services following the destruction of the Second World War. Witnessing the aftermath of the [[Polish October]] in which students had protested against the governing communist [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he felt that most Poles despised their government as a [[puppet regime]] of the [[Soviet Union]], and thought that the system ran \"badly\".{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=194|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=84\u201385}} Considering the university a liberal enclave, he traveled the country giving lectures; proving popular, he adopted the position of ''de facto'' cultural attach\u00e9.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=88|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=85\u201386}} As in France and Sweden, homosexual activity was legal but socially frowned upon in Poland, and he undertook relationships with a number of men; one was a Polish security agent who hoped to trap Foucault in an embarrassing situation, which would therefore reflect badly on the French embassy. Wracked in diplomatic scandal, he was ordered to leave Poland for a new destination.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=89|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=86\u201387}} Various positions were available in [[West Germany]], and so Foucault relocated to the {{Interlanguage link multi|Institut fran\u00e7ais Hamburg|de}} (where he was director in 1958\u201360), teaching the same courses he had given in Uppsala and Warsaw.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=89\u201390|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=87\u201388}}<ref name=\"21st Century\">Binkley Sam, and Jorge Capetillo, eds. 2009.

His erudition derives from years pondering, to cite [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], '[[The Raven|over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore]]', and his learning is not always worn lightly.''|Foucault biographer [[David Macey]], 1993{{Sfn|Macey|1993|p=96}}}}\n\nIn West Germany, Foucault completed in 1960 his primary thesis (''th\u00e8se principale'') for his [[State doctorate]], entitled ''[[Madness and Civilization|Folie et d\u00e9raison: Histoire de la folie \u00e0 l'\u00e2ge classique]]'' (trans. \"Madness and Insanity: History of Madness in the Classical Age\"), a philosophical work based upon his studies into the [[history of medicine]]. The book discussed how West European society had dealt with [[Insanity|madness]], arguing that it was a social construct distinct from [[mental illness]]. Foucault traces the evolution of the concept of madness through three phases: the [[Renaissance]], the later 17th and 18th centuries, and the modern experience. The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.{{Sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=102|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=96}}\n\n''Histoire de la folie'' was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} Foucault submitted it at the [[University of Paris]], although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=90\u201392|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=88\u201389}} Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process.

Although it was critically acclaimed by [[Maurice Blanchot]], [[Michel Serres]], [[Roland Barthes]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], and [[Fernand Braudel]], it was largely ignored by the leftist press, much to Foucault's disappointment.{{Sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=116|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=113\u201319|3a1=Miller|3y=1993|3p=118}} It was notably criticised for advocating [[metaphysics]] by young philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] in a March 1963 lecture at the [[University of Paris]].

Most prominent of these was the [[Paris VIII|Centre Exp\u00e9rimental de Vincennes]] in [[Vincennes]] on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the Centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=201\u201302}} Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain \"the best in French philosophy today\" for his department, employing [[Michel Serres]], [[Judith Miller (philosopher)|Judith Miller]], [[Alain Badiou]], [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Regnault]], [[Henri Weber]], [[\u00c9tienne Balibar]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e2telet]]; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=203\u201305}}\n\nLectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=205}} In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Latin Quarter of the Mutualit\u00e9.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=206}} Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left,{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=201}} undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a [[Maoism|Maoist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=209}} Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, \"The end of Metaphysics\", and \"The Discourse of Sexuality\", which were highly popular and over-subscribed.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=207}} While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education [[Olivier Guichard]] was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner.

The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: '''sovereign''' power, '''disciplinary''' power, and '''biopower'''.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\">Lynch, R. A. (2011) Foucault's theory of power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 13-26). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault is generally critical to \"theories\" that try to give absolute answers to \"everything.\" Therefore, he considered his own \"theory\" of power to be closer to a method than a typical \"theory.\" According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\n* A group of institutions and/or mechanisms whose aim it is for a citizen to obey and yield to the state (a typical [[liberalism|liberal]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n* Yielding to rules (a typical [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" /> or\n* A general and oppressing system where one societal class or group oppresses another (a typical [[feminism|feminist]] or [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxist]] definition of power).<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\nFoucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as \"power\", but rather so that these theories of power cannot completely describe ''all'' forms of power. Foucault also claims that liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's own theory of power begins on micro-level, with singular \"force relations\". [[Richard A. Lynch]] defines Foucault's concept of \"force relation\" as \"whatever in one's social interactions that pushes, urges or compels one to do something.\"<ref>Lynch (2011), p. 19</ref> According to Foucault, force relations are an effect of difference, inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships (such as sexual or economic). Force, and power, is however not something that a person or group \"holds\" (such as in the sovereign definition of power), but rather so is power a complex group of forces that comes from \"everything\" and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality, difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms: tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level, which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand, is power on macro-level, which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time, power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox, according to Lynch, since \"someone\" has to exert power, while at the same time there can be no \"someone\" exerting this power.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/> According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations:\n* By looking at power as something which reaches further than the influence of single people or groups. Even if individuals and groups try to influence fashion, for example, their actions will often get unexpected consequences.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n* Even if individuals and groups have a free choice, they are also affected and limited by their context/situation.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, force relations are constantly changing, constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken, strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance, which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch, the purpose of Foucault's theory of power is to increase peoples' awareness of how power has shaped their way of being, thinking and acting, and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being, thinking and acting.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\n==== Sovereign power ====\nWith \"sovereign power\" Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the \"normal\" (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereigns orders. A typical example of sovereign power is [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nIn historical absolute monarchies, crimes has been considered as a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereigns power. This was however both expensive and ineffective \u2013 it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques in order to \"remold\" the criminal into a \"law abiding citizen\".<ref name=\"May2011\">May, T.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chlo\u00eb Taylor]], a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract \u2013 to take life, to enslave life, etc. \u2013 but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor, the form of power that the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] is concerned about, is sovereign power. According to Hobbes, people are \"free\" so long they are not literally placed in chains.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\">Taylor, C. (2011) Biopower. In Taylor, D. (red.)

The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies' skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has \"individuals\" as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, \"individual\" is however a construct created by disciplinary power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> The disciplinary power's techniques creates a \"rational self-control\",<ref name=\"Vintges2011\">Vintges, K. (2011) Freedom and spirituality. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 99-110). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn't continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn't oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior in order to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\">Oksala, J. (2011) Freedom and bodies. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 85-97). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> The activities follows certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, in order to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and exams.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> By hierarchical observation, the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer, but rather so a \"hierarchy\" of observers. An example of this is [[mental asylum]]s during the 19th century, when the psychiatrist was not the only observer, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses, a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist, this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement: (1) all deviations, even small ones, from correct behavior is punished, (2) repeated rule violations are punished extra, (3) exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment, (4) rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behavior/people, (5) rank/grades/etc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectivity and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual, track their development and compare their results to the norm.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the \"formula\" for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s plan for the \"optimal prison\": the [[panopticon]]. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows \u2013 one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (''as if'' they were constantly being watched). Foucault says this construction (1) creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room, (2) since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment, they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched, (3) the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions, such as mental asylums in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n===== F. W. Taylor's ''The Principles of Scientific Management''=====\n{{see also|Taylorism}}\n[[Marcelo Hoffman]] posits that an example of disciplinary power can be seen in [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]s book ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]''. Taylor's purpose was to increase the efficacy of workers by having their behavior controlled by the company's management. He mentions as an example an attempt to increase the amount of [[pig iron]] carried by each worker during a day from 12,5 tonnes to 47 tonnes, without causing the workers to strike. Here, Hoffman says, is a clear example of how the disciplinary power tries to make the body more obedient the more useful it becomes. Taylor describes that he started out with observing his 75 workers to pick out the most skilled workers. He had studied the workers history, character, habits and ambitions. Here is an example of how the disciplinary power creates an individuality. One of the selected workers, \"Schmidt\", was according to Taylor a man with high ambitions that valued a high salary. Schmidt accepted the terms given: He would earn 61% more if he agreed to obey without protest the orders given to him by an appointed instructor. Schmidt was thereafter observed and controlled in every detail of his working day \u2013 he was told when and how to work, when to rest, etc. According to Taylor, Schmidt never failed to obey during the three years during which he was subjected to this detailed control and higher workload.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAnother example mentioned by Taylor is taken from a different industry, where Taylor had calculated the \"optimal\" workload for each worker. There Taylor had developed a system where every worker was not only continuously observed, but also punished if they had failed to reach up to the daily quota the previous workday. Every day the workers received a yellow or white note at the end of each shift, where yellow notes were given to those who had not reached the daily quota. Those who were given yellow notes were then threatened with redeployment to a \"working role better fit for their productive capacities\", which according to Taylor effectively led the workers to work harder. According to Taylor, the workers who were given yellow notes were not immediately redeployed. Instead, Taylor writes that a \"skilled teacher\" were sent to teach the workers how to do the work properly. The teachers job was however not only to \"teach\" the workers how to work more effectively, but also to observe them and their working capacity. Besides this teacher, Taylor also describes that the workers were observed by others, such as administrators, managers, etc.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n==== Biopower ====\n{{Further|Biopower}}\nWith \"biopower\" Foucault refers to power over ''bios'' (life) \u2013 power over [[population]]s. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nBiopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and try to adjust, control or eliminate these norm-deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution in order to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Another example is the French-Canadian province [[Qu\u00e9bec]], which has had a high interest in sustaining the French language in the region. To accomplish this, economic incentives has been created for French-speaking people to move to Qu\u00e9bec, and non-French-speaking children have had French taught as a compulsory subject in school. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population-growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as \"perversion\", \"frigidity\" and \"sexual dysfunction\". On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disability) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nIn the era of biopower, death has become a scandal and a catastrophe, but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power, the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom, but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to \"protect life itself\". Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example, Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews, the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were \"a threat to the German health\", and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled would be better spent on \"viable Germans\". Chlo\u00eb Taylor also mentions the [[Iraq War]] was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to [[Al-Qaeda]]. However, when the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush-]] and [[Blair ministry|Blair]]-administrations didn't find any evidence to support either of these theories, the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation, the cause of the war was said to be that [[Saddam Hussein]] had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times, war has to be \"concealed\" under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid, despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th-century, slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality, illness, alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas, and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as \"unmoral\" and \"lazy\". The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would \"take over\" because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of [[eugenics]], whose founder [[Francis Galton]] had been inspired by [[Charles Darwin]] and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton, society was preventing natural selection by helping \"the weak\", thus causing a spread of the \"negative qualities\" into the rest of the population.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\n=== Theory of the Body and Sexuality ===\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not something objective that stands outside of history and culture. Instead, Foucault argues, the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history \u2013 by work, diet, body ideals, exercise, medical interventions, etc. Foucault presents no \"theory\" of the body, but does write about it in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as well as in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''. Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality, madness and criminality. Further, Foucault argues, that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nIn ''Discipline and Punish'', Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together, for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power, by manipulating bodies/behavior, also manipulates people's minds. Foucault turns the common saying \"the body is the prison of the soul\" and instead posits that \"the soul is the prison of the body.\"<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nAccording to Foucault, [[sexology]] has tried to exert itself as a \"science\" by referring to the material (the body). In contrast to this, Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience, and that \"sex\" is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural, biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples' [[gender identity]], sexual identity and sexual behavior, power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate, pathologize and \"correct\" peoples' sexual and gendered behavior, by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed \"normal\" behavior. For Foucault, a \"normal sexuality\" is as much of a construct as a \"natural sexuality\". Therefore, Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, the popular discourse argued for a \"liberation\" of sexuality from a cultural, moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault, however, argues that peoples' opinions about and experiences of sexuality are ''always'' a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To \"liberate\" sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes it place. This, however, does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power, and that there is simply no \"natural\" sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance, and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks, it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not only a \"obedient and passive object\" that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the \"seed\" to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant, and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words, and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to [[Johanna Oksala]], Foucault's influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists has with the help of Foucault's ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault's historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as [[Judith Butler]], who used Foucault's theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no \"true\" gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault. She argues Foucault \"naively\" presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power, without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as [[Susan Bordo]] and [[Kate Soper]].<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nJohanna Oksala argues that Foucault, by saying that sex/sexuality are constructs, doesn't deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression, but rather so question and deny the identities that are posited as \"natural\" and \"essential\" by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\n=== Theory of Subjectivity ===\nFoucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history has been made into \"subjects.\"<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\">Taylor, D.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Foucault, \"the subject\" has, by western philosophers, usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary, Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> Foucault talks of \"assujettissement\", which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault \"social norms\" are standards that people are encouraged to follow, that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of \"assujettissement\", Foucault mentions \"homosexual\", a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that [[sodomy]] was previously considered a serious sexual deviation, but a temporary one. Homosexuality, however, became a \"species\", a past, a childhood and a type of life. \"Homosexuals\" has by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against, due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the \"normal\" sexuality. However, Foucault argues, the creation of a subjectivity such as \"homosexuality\" does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised \u2013 the subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the [[pride parade]].<ref name=\"Heyes2011\">Heyes, C. J. (2011) Subjectivity and power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 159-172). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Foucault, scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system, by classifying and categorizing people, observing their behavior and \"treating\" them when their behavior has been considered \"abnormal\". Sciences such as psychiatry, biology, medicine, economy, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc. By doing so, they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms,<ref name=\"Vintges2011\"/> which are then internalized by people as \"truths\". People have then adapted their behavior in order to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as \"normal\".<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> For example, Foucault claims that psychological observation/surveillance and psychological discourses has created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity, which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also, according to Foucault, been a way for society to resist criticism \u2013 criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Obesity as a form of subjectivity ====\n[[Cressida J. Heyes]] argues that a modern example of subjectivity is obesity. Subjects are created in two levels: by biopower and by disciplinary power. Biopower has during the 21th-century considered obesity as a \"corruption in the body politics\" and a \"public health catastrophe\". Heyes argues that during the 21th century there has been an anti-obesity discourse that has been enabled by population statistics and public health campaigns. These expressions of bio power, however, relies on disciplinary power, for example by health care institutions gathering information about individuals weight, length, age, etc. that is then used by biopower. The biopower tries to reduce the ''populations\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm, and disciplinary power tries to reduce the ''individuals\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm. Biopower and disciplinary power thus create various forms of subjectivity: obesity, underweight, normal weight, and so on. To be obese is not simply a question of where the individual lies in relation to the weight-norm, but it is also considered a marker for the individuals incapacity to regulate their own weight and behavior. This becomes the case not only through the disciplinary institutions (such as health care institutions) exertion of power, but also by a \"confession discourse\" where people are encouraged and expected to \"confess\" their consumption habits, weight, fat percentage, exercising habits, etc. Heyes argues that a modern-day example of this can be seen in online forums centered around weight and weight-loss. These forums contain, according to Heyes, profiles where every individual describes their starting weight, current weight and goal weight. Another example of this that Heyes mentions is video-blogs where people create a \"biography\" centered around their \"weight-loss-journey\". In these ways people also constitute their own subjectivity. However, as with other forms of subjectivity, Heyes argues that these people also experience benefits from constituting themselves as \"obese people\". According to Heyes, these people can feel better, learn new things (about nutrition, for example) and acquire new skills. At the same time, Heyes argues, by accepting this subjectivity people are dragged deeper into a disciplinary power system.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\"/>\n\n==== Subjectivity constituted by individuals in relation to themselves ====\nAccording to Foucault, subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally \u2013 it is also something that is established in a person's relation to themselves.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\"/> This can, for example, happen when a person is trying to \"find themselves\" or \"be themselves\", something [[Edward McGushin]] describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the \"true self\", the self is established in two levels: as a passive object (the \"true self\" that is searched for) and as an active \"searcher\". The ancient [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] and the 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] posited that the \"true self\" can only be found by going through great hardship and/or danger. The ancient [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and 17th-century philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], however, argued that the \"self\" can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is [[Socrates]], who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others, where the debaters question each other's foundational views and opinions. Foucault, however, argued that \"subjectivity\" is a process, rather than a state of being. As such, Foucault argued that there is no \"true self\" to be found. Rather so, the \"self\" is constituted/created in activities such as the ones employed to \"find\" the \"self\". In other words, exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not \"reveal\" the \"true self\", according to Foucault, but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However, according to Foucault the \"form\" for the subject is in great part already constituted by power, before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools, workplaces, households, government institutions, entertainment media and the healthcare sector all, through disciplinary power, contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.<ref name=\"McGushin2011\">McGushin, E.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of Freedom ===\nTodd May defines Foucault's concept of freedom as: that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this, according to Foucault, is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been created/affected (and is still being affected) by power. According to May, two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples\u2032 way of being, thinking and acting is described in the books where Foucault describes disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However, May argues, there will always be aspects of peoples\u2032 formation that will be unknown to them, hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\nFoucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limits their freedom.<ref name=\"May2011\"/> Freedom is thus not a state of being, but a practice \u2013 a way of being in relation to oneself, to others and to the world.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\">Mendieta, E. (2011) The practice of freedom. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 111-124). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Todd May Foucault's concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality \u2013 histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached from such investigations, people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of \"experimentation\" with different \"transformations\". Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely, May argues they may lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus, May argues, it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Practice of Critique ====\nFoucault's \"alternative\" to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as \"critique.\" For Foucault there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of subjectivity, since they are all a result of power relations.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\" /> In the same way, Foucault argues there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore, Foucault argues, it is always crucial to continue with the practice of \"critique\".<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" /> Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being \u2013 a questioning of who we \"are\" and how this \"we\" came to be. Such a \"critical [[ontology]] of the present\" shows that peoples\u2032 current \"being\" is in fact a historically contingent, unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity, it is also possible to change it.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions, finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom, resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations, but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" />\n\n====''Epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self\" ====\nAs an alternative to the modern \"search\" for the \"true self\",<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> and as a part of \"the work of freedom\",<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Foucault discusses the antique Greek term ''epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self.\" According to Foucault, among the ancient Greek philosophers, self-awareness was not a goal in itself, but rather something that was sought after in order to \"care for oneself\". Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls \"the art of living\" or \"technologies of the self.\"<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> The goal of these techniques was, according to Foucault, to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this, Foucault mentions [[meditation]],<ref name=\"Vintges2011\" /> the [[stoicism|stoic]] activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with ones values and goals, and \"contemplation of nature.\" Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity, that consists of reflecting on how \"small\" one's existence is when compared to the greater [[cosmos]].<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" />\n\n=== Theory of Knowledge ===\n{{Main|Power-knowledge}}\nFoucault is described by [[Mary Beth Mader]] as an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] and [[historicism|historicist]].<ref name=\"Mader2014\">Mader, M. B. (2014) Knowledge. Ur Lawlor, L. (red.) & Nale, J. (red.) ''The Cambridge Foucault Lexicon'' (s. 226-236). Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-11921-4}}</ref> Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach \"absolute\" knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault's works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we \"always begin anew\" when it comes to knowledge.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking \"spirituality\". With \"spirituality\" Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being, and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy, where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the \"cartesian moment\", the moment when [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] reached the \"insight\" that self-awareness was something given ([[Cogito ergo sum]], \"I think, therefore I am\"), and from this \"insight\" Descartes drew conclusions about God, the world, and knowledge. According to Foucault, since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge.<ref>Stone, B. E. (2011) Subjectivity and truth. Ur Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (s. 143-157). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaicance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge is created is \"savoir\".<ref name=\"Mader2014\"/> A similar term in Foucaults corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from [[Jeremy Bentham]]s idea that [[panopticon]]s wouldn't only be prisons, but would be used for experiments where the criminals\u2032 behaviour would be studied. Power/knowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals, measures differences, establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized (by \"institutionalized\" Foucault refers to when the norm is omnipresent). Because then, when the norm is internalized and institutionalized, it has effectively become a part of peoples' \"common sense\" \u2013 the \"obvious\", the \"given\", the \"natural\". When this has happened, this \"common sense\" also affects the explicit knowledge (scientific knowledge), Foucault argues. [[Ellen K. Feder]] mean that the premise \"the world consists of women and men\" is an example of this. This premise, Feder argues, has been considered \"common sense\", and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis [[gender identity disorder]] (GID). For example, during the 1970s, children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of power/knowledge since psychiatry, from the \"common sense\" premise \"the world consists of women and men\" (a premise which is upheld in this status by power), created a new diagnosis, a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.<ref name=\"Feder2011\">Fader, E.

Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive\u2014even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] to describe Foucault's thinking as  \"crypto-normativist\", covertly reliant on the very [[age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles he attempts to argue against.<ref>Ashenden, S., & Owen, D. (Eds.). (1999). Foucault contra Habermas: Recasting the dialogue between genealogy and critical theory. Sage.</ref> A similar critique has been advanced by [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]], and by [[Nancy Fraser]] who argues that \"Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.\"<ref>Taylor, D. (2010). Michel Foucault: key concepts. Acumen. pp. 2\u20133</ref> Likewise, scholar [[Nancy Pearcey]] points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: \"[when someone] states that it is impossible to attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Finding Truth|last=Pearcey|first=Nancy|year=2015|isbn=978-0781413084|location=|page=208}}</ref>\n\n====Genealogy as historical method====\nThe philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that Foucault's \"archaeology of knowledge\" is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any \"new\" theory of knowledge ''per se''. Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:\n\n{{quote|As far as I can see, all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past, supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying: \"do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity, of any segment of culture, as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past\".<ref>Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.</ref>}}\n\nFoucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses.<ref>Mills, S. (2003). Michel Foucault: Routledge Critical Thinkers. Chicago p. 23</ref> For example, [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] harshly criticized Foucault in 1998.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', pp. 45\u201395. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 81. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's \"francocentrism\" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like [[Max Weber]] and [[Norbert Elias]]. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is \"because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism\".<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 91. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref>\n\n====Feminist critiques====\nThough American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\">Downing, Lisa. \"The Cambridge Introduction to Michel Foucault.\" (2008). Cambridge University Press. pp. 104-117</ref>\n\n====Sexuality====\nThe philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] argues in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in ''The History of Sexuality'', that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Scruton|publisher=Phoenix Books|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85799-100-0|location=London|pages=34, 362}}</ref>\n\nFoucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in [[queer theory]]. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of \"object choice\", stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\"/>\n\n====Social constructionism and human nature====\nFoucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of [[social constructionism]], which some see as an affront to the concept of [[truth]]. In Foucault's 1971 [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice.<ref>Wilkin, P. (1999). Chomsky and Foucault on human nature and politics: an essential difference?. Social Theory and Practice, pp. 177\u2013210.</ref> Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating \"He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something.\"<ref>James Miller, Jim Miller. 1993.  The Passion of Michel Foucault. Harvard University Press, pp. 201\u201303</ref>\n\n====Education and authority====\nPeruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.<ref>Vargas Llosa, Mario (2010).

After several years as a cultural diplomat abroad, he returned to France and published his first major book, ''[[Madness and Civilization|The History of Madness]]'' (1961). After obtaining work between 1960 and 1966 at the [[Blaise Pascal University|University of Clermont-Ferrand]], he produced ''[[The Birth of the Clinic]]'' (1963) and ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), publications which displayed his increasing involvement with [[structuralism]], from which he later distanced himself. These first three histories exemplified a [[historiography|historiographical]] technique Foucault was developing called \"archaeology.\"\n\nFrom 1966 to 1968, Foucault lectured at the [[University of Tunis]] before returning to France, where he became head of the philosophy department at the new experimental university of [[Paris VIII]]. Foucault subsequently published ''[[The Archaeology of Knowledge]]'' (1969). In 1970, Foucault was admitted to the [[Coll\u00e8ge de France]], a membership he retained until his death. He also became active in a number of [[left-wing]] groups involved in campaigns against racism and human rights abuses and for penal reform.

The work alludes to the work of French poet and playwright [[Antonin Artaud]], who exerted a strong influence over Foucault's thought at the time.{{Sfnm|1a1=Macey|1y=1993|1p=102|2a1=Miller|2y=1993|2p=96}}\n\n''Histoire de la folie'' was an expansive work, consisting of 943 pages of text, followed by appendices and a bibliography.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=101}} Foucault submitted it at the [[University of Paris]], although the university's regulations for awarding a State doctorate required the submission of both his main thesis and a shorter complementary thesis.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1pp=90\u201392|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2pp=88\u201389}} Obtaining a doctorate in France at the period was a multi-step process.

Although initially accepting this description, Foucault soon vehemently rejected it.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pages=1605\u2013162, 167}} Foucault and Sartre regularly criticised one another in the press.

His decision to do so was largely because his lover, Defert, had been posted to the country as part of his [[national service]]. Foucault moved a few kilometres from [[Tunis]], to the village of [[Sidi Bou Sa\u00efd]], where fellow academic G\u00e9rard Deledalle lived with his wife.

Although many young students were enthusiastic about his teaching, they were critical of what they believed to be his right-wing political views, viewing him as a \"representative of Gaullist technocracy\", even though he considered himself a [[Left-wing politics|leftist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=188\u201389}}\n\nFoucault was in Tunis during the anti-government and pro-Palestinian riots that rocked the city in June 1967, and which continued for a year. Although highly critical of the violent, ultra-nationalistic and anti-semitic nature of many protesters, he used his status to try to prevent some of his militant leftist students from being arrested and tortured for their role in the agitation. He hid their printing press in his garden, and tried to testify on their behalf at their trials, but was prevented when the trials became closed-door events.{{Sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=192\u201393}} While in Tunis, Foucault continued to write. Inspired by a correspondence with the surrealist artist [[Ren\u00e9 Magritte]], Foucault started to write a book about the [[impressionism|impressionist]] artist [[\u00c9douard Manet]], but never completed it.{{sfnm|1a1=Eribon|1y=1991|1p=190|2a1=Macey|2y=1993|2p=173}}\n\nIn 1968, Foucault returned to Paris, moving into an apartment on the Rue de Vaugirard.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=198}} After the May 1968 student protests, Minister of Education [[Edgar Faure]] responded by founding new universities with greater autonomy. Most prominent of these was the [[Paris VIII|Centre Exp\u00e9rimental de Vincennes]] in [[Vincennes]] on the outskirts of Paris. A group of prominent academics were asked to select teachers to run the Centre's departments, and Canguilheim recommended Foucault as head of the Philosophy Department.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=201\u201302}} Becoming a tenured professor of Vincennes, Foucault's desire was to obtain \"the best in French philosophy today\" for his department, employing [[Michel Serres]], [[Judith Miller (philosopher)|Judith Miller]], [[Alain Badiou]], [[Jacques Ranci\u00e8re]], [[Fran\u00e7ois Regnault]], [[Henri Weber]], [[\u00c9tienne Balibar]], and [[Fran\u00e7ois Ch\u00e2telet]]; most of them were Marxists or ultra-left activists.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=203\u201305}}\n\nLectures began at the university in January 1969, and straight away its students and staff, including Foucault, were involved in occupations and clashes with police, resulting in arrests.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=205}} In February, Foucault gave a speech denouncing police provocation to protesters at the Latin Quarter of the Mutualit\u00e9.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=206}} Such actions marked Foucault's embrace of the ultra-left,{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=201}} undoubtedly influenced by Defert, who had gained a job at Vincennes' sociology department and who had become a [[Maoism|Maoist]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=209}} Most of the courses at Foucault's philosophy department were [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninist]] oriented, although Foucault himself gave courses on Nietzsche, \"The end of Metaphysics\", and \"The Discourse of Sexuality\", which were highly popular and over-subscribed.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=207}} While the right-wing press was heavily critical of this new institution, new Minister of Education [[Olivier Guichard]] was angered by its ideological bent and the lack of exams, with students being awarded degrees in a haphazard manner.

It was his idea to travel to [[Madrid]] with 6 others to give their press conference there; they were subsequently arrested and deported back to Paris.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=263\u201366}} In 1977, he protested the extradition of [[Klaus Croissant]] to West Germany, and his rib was fractured during clashes with riot police.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=280}} In July that year, he organised an assembly of [[Eastern Bloc]] dissidents to mark the visit of Soviet Premier [[Leonid Brezhnev]] to Paris.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=278}} In 1979, he campaigned for Vietnamese political dissidents to be granted asylum in France.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=278\u201379}}\n\nIn 1977, Italian newspaper ''[[Corriere della sera]]'' asked Foucault to write a column for them. In doing so, in 1978 he travelled to [[Tehran]] in [[Iran]], days after the [[Black Friday (1978)|Black Friday]] massacre. Documenting the developing [[Iranian Revolution]], he met with opposition leaders such as [[Mohammad Kazem Shariatmadari]] and [[Mehdi Bazargan]], and discovered the popular support for [[Islamism]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=281\u201385}} Returning to France, he was one of the journalists who visited the [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], before visiting Tehran. His articles expressed awe of Khomeini's Islamist movement, for which he was widely criticised in the French press, including by Iranian expatriates. Foucault's response was that Islamism was to become a major political force in the region, and that the West must treat it with respect rather than hostility.{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=285\u201388}} In April 1978, Foucault traveled to Japan, where he studied [[Zen Buddhism]] under [[Omori Sogen]] at the [[Seionji temple]] in [[Uenohara]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|p=310}}\n\n[[File:Graves of Michel Foucault, his mother and his father in Vendeuvre du Poitou.jpg|thumb|right|Graves of Michel Foucault, his mother (right) and his father (left) in [[Vendeuvre-du-Poitou]]]]\n\n===Final years: 1980\u20131984===\nAlthough remaining critical of power relations, Foucault expressed cautious support for the [[French Socialist Party|Socialist Party]] government of [[Fran\u00e7ois Mitterrand]] following its [[1981 French presidential election|electoral victory in 1981]].{{sfn|Eribon|1991|pp=296\u201397}} But his support soon deteriorated when that party refused to condemn the Polish government's crackdown on the [[1982 demonstrations in Poland]] orchestrated by the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] trade union.

After spending some time working in Poland, governed at the time as a [[socialist state]] by the [[Polish United Workers' Party]], he became further disillusioned with communist ideology.

The empirical analyses concern themselves with historical (and modern) forms of power and how these emerged from previous forms of power. Foucault describes three types of power in his empirical analyses: '''sovereign''' power, '''disciplinary''' power, and '''biopower'''.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\">Lynch, R. A. (2011) Foucault's theory of power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 13-26). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault is generally critical to \"theories\" that try to give absolute answers to \"everything.\" Therefore, he considered his own \"theory\" of power to be closer to a method than a typical \"theory.\" According to Foucault, most people misunderstand power. For this reason, he makes clear that power cannot be completely described as:<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\n* A group of institutions and/or mechanisms whose aim it is for a citizen to obey and yield to the state (a typical [[liberalism|liberal]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n* Yielding to rules (a typical [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytical]] definition of power);<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" /> or\n* A general and oppressing system where one societal class or group oppresses another (a typical [[feminism|feminist]] or [[Orthodox Marxism|Orthodox Marxist]] definition of power).<ref name=\"Lynch2011\" />\n\nFoucault is not critical of considering these phenomena as \"power\", but rather so that these theories of power cannot completely describe ''all'' forms of power. Foucault also claims that liberal definition of power has effectively hidden other forms of power to the extent that people have uncritically accepted them.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's own theory of power begins on micro-level, with singular \"force relations\". [[Richard A. Lynch]] defines Foucault's concept of \"force relation\" as \"whatever in one's social interactions that pushes, urges or compels one to do something.\"<ref>Lynch (2011), p. 19</ref> According to Foucault, force relations are an effect of difference, inequality or unbalance that exists in other forms of relationships (such as sexual or economic). Force, and power, is however not something that a person or group \"holds\" (such as in the sovereign definition of power), but rather so is power a complex group of forces that comes from \"everything\" and therefore exists everywhere. That relations of power always result from inequality, difference or unbalance also means that power always has a goal or purpose. Power comes in two forms: tactics and strategies. Tactics is power on the micro-level, which can for example be how a person chooses to express themselves through their clothes. Strategies on the other hand, is power on macro-level, which can be the state of fashion at any moment. Strategies consist of a combination of tactics. At the same time, power is non-subjective according to Foucault. This posits a paradox, according to Lynch, since \"someone\" has to exert power, while at the same time there can be no \"someone\" exerting this power.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/> According to Lynch this paradox can be solved with two observations:\n* By looking at power as something which reaches further than the influence of single people or groups. Even if individuals and groups try to influence fashion, for example, their actions will often get unexpected consequences.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n* Even if individuals and groups have a free choice, they are also affected and limited by their context/situation.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, force relations are constantly changing, constantly interacting with other force relations which may weaken, strengthen or change one another. Foucault writes that power always includes resistance, which means there is always a possibility that power and force relations will change in some way. According to Richard A. Lynch, the purpose of Foucault's theory of power is to increase peoples' awareness of how power has shaped their way of being, thinking and acting, and by increasing this awareness making it possible for them to change their way of being, thinking and acting.<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\n==== Sovereign power ====\nWith \"sovereign power\" Foucault alludes to a power structure that is similar to a pyramid, where one person or a group of people (at the top of the pyramid) holds the power, while the \"normal\" (and oppressed) people are at the bottom of the pyramid. In the middle parts of the pyramid are the people who enforce the sovereigns orders. A typical example of sovereign power is [[absolute monarchy]].<ref name=\"Lynch2011\"/>\n\nIn historical absolute monarchies, crimes has been considered as a personal offense against the sovereign and his/her power. The punishment was often public and spectacular, partly to deter others from committing crimes, but also to reinstate the sovereigns power. This was however both expensive and ineffective \u2013 it led far too often to people sympathizing with the criminal. In modern times, when disciplinary power is dominant, criminals are instead subjected to various disciplinary techniques in order to \"remold\" the criminal into a \"law abiding citizen\".<ref name=\"May2011\">May, T.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to [[Chlo\u00eb Taylor]], a characteristic for sovereign power is that the sovereign has the right to take life, wealth, services, labor and products. The sovereign has a right to subtract \u2013 to take life, to enslave life, etc. \u2013 but not the right to control life in the way that later happens in disciplinary systems of power. According to Taylor, the form of power that the philosopher [[Thomas Hobbes]] is concerned about, is sovereign power.

The purpose of this is not only to use the bodies' skills, but also prevent these skills from being used to revolt against the power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has \"individuals\" as its object, target and instrument. According to Foucault, \"individual\" is however a construct created by disciplinary power.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> The disciplinary power's techniques creates a \"rational self-control\",<ref name=\"Vintges2011\">Vintges, K. (2011) Freedom and spirituality. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 99-110). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> which in practice means that the disciplinary power is internalized and therefore doesn't continuously need external force. Foucault says that disciplinary power is primarily not an oppressing form of power, but rather so a productive form of power. Disciplinary power doesn't oppress interests or desires, but instead subjects bodies to reconstructed patterns of behavior in order to reconstruct their thoughts, desires and interests. According to Foucault this happens in factories, schools, hospitals and prisons.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\">Oksala, J. (2011) Freedom and bodies. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 85-97). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> Disciplinary power creates a certain type of individual by producing new movements, habits and skills. It focuses on details, single movements, their timing and speed. It organizes bodies in time and space, and controls every movement for maximal effect. It uses rules, surveillance, exams and controls.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> The activities follows certain plans, whose purpose it is to lead the bodies to certain pre-determined goals. The bodies are also combined with each other, in order to reach a productivity that is greater than the sum of all bodies activities.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nDisciplinary power has according to Foucault been especially successful due to its usage of three technologies: hierarchical observation, normalizing judgement and exams.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/> By hierarchical observation, the bodies become constantly visible to the power. The observation is hierarchical since there is not a single observer, but rather so a \"hierarchy\" of observers. An example of this is [[mental asylum]]s during the 19th century, when the psychiatrist was not the only observer, but also nurses and auxiliary staff. From these observations and scientific discourses, a norm is established and used to judge the observed bodies. For the disciplinary power to continue to exist, this judgement has to be normalized. Foucault mentions several characteristics of this judgement: (1) all deviations, even small ones, from correct behavior is punished, (2) repeated rule violations are punished extra, (3) exercises are used as a behavior correcting technique and punishment, (4) rewards are used together with punishment to establish a hierarchy of good and bad behavior/people, (5) rank/grades/etc. are used as punishment and reward. Examinations combine the hierarchical observation with judgement. Exams objectivity and individualize the observed bodies by creating extensive documentation about every observed body. The purpose of the exams is therefore to gather further information about each individual, track their development and compare their results to the norm.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the \"formula\" for disciplinary power can be seen in philosopher [[Jeremy Bentham]]'s plan for the \"optimal prison\": the [[panopticon]]. Such a prison consists of a circle-formed building where every cell is inhabited by only one prisoner. In every cell there are two windows \u2013 one to let in light from outside and one pointing to the middle of the circle-formed building. In this middle there is a tower where a guard can be placed to observe the prisoners. Since the prisoners will never be able to know whether they are being watched or not at a given moment, they will internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior (''as if'' they were constantly being watched). Foucault says this construction (1) creates an individuality by separating prisoners from each other in the physical room, (2) since the prisoners cannot know if they are being watched at any given moment, they internalize the disciplinary power and regulate their own behavior as if they were always watched, (3) the surveillance makes it possible to create extensive documentation about each prisoner and their behavior. According to Foucault the panopticon has been used as a model also for other disciplinary institutions, such as mental asylums in the 19th century.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n===== F. W. Taylor's ''The Principles of Scientific Management''=====\n{{see also|Taylorism}}\n[[Marcelo Hoffman]] posits that an example of disciplinary power can be seen in [[Frederick Winslow Taylor]]s book ''[[The Principles of Scientific Management]]''. Taylor's purpose was to increase the efficacy of workers by having their behavior controlled by the company's management. He mentions as an example an attempt to increase the amount of [[pig iron]] carried by each worker during a day from 12,5 tonnes to 47 tonnes, without causing the workers to strike. Here, Hoffman says, is a clear example of how the disciplinary power tries to make the body more obedient the more useful it becomes. Taylor describes that he started out with observing his 75 workers to pick out the most skilled workers. He had studied the workers history, character, habits and ambitions. Here is an example of how the disciplinary power creates an individuality. One of the selected workers, \"Schmidt\", was according to Taylor a man with high ambitions that valued a high salary. Schmidt accepted the terms given: He would earn 61% more if he agreed to obey without protest the orders given to him by an appointed instructor. Schmidt was thereafter observed and controlled in every detail of his working day \u2013 he was told when and how to work, when to rest, etc. According to Taylor, Schmidt never failed to obey during the three years during which he was subjected to this detailed control and higher workload.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\nAnother example mentioned by Taylor is taken from a different industry, where Taylor had calculated the \"optimal\" workload for each worker. There Taylor had developed a system where every worker was not only continuously observed, but also punished if they had failed to reach up to the daily quota the previous workday. Every day the workers received a yellow or white note at the end of each shift, where yellow notes were given to those who had not reached the daily quota. Those who were given yellow notes were then threatened with redeployment to a \"working role better fit for their productive capacities\", which according to Taylor effectively led the workers to work harder. According to Taylor, the workers who were given yellow notes were not immediately redeployed. Instead, Taylor writes that a \"skilled teacher\" were sent to teach the workers how to do the work properly. The teachers job was however not only to \"teach\" the workers how to work more effectively, but also to observe them and their working capacity. Besides this teacher, Taylor also describes that the workers were observed by others, such as administrators, managers, etc.<ref name=\"Hoffman2011\"/>\n\n==== Biopower ====\n{{Further|Biopower}}\nWith \"biopower\" Foucault refers to power over ''bios'' (life) \u2013 power over [[population]]s. Biopower primarily rests on norms which are internalized by people, rather than external force. It encourages, strengthens, controls, observes, optimizes and organize the forces below it. Foucault has sometimes described biopower as separate from disciplinary power, but at other times he has described disciplinary power as an expression of biopower. Biopower can use disciplinary techniques, but in contrast to disciplinary power its target is populations rather than individuals.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nBiopower studies populations regarding (for example) number of births, life expectancy, public health, housing, migration, crime, which social groups are over-represented in deviations from the norm (regarding health, crime, etc.) and try to adjust, control or eliminate these norm-deviations. One example is the age distribution in a population. Biopower is interested in age distribution in order to compensate for future (or current) lacks of labor power, retirement homes, etc. Another example is the French-Canadian province [[Qu\u00e9bec]], which has had a high interest in sustaining the French language in the region. To accomplish this, economic incentives has been created for French-speaking people to move to Qu\u00e9bec, and non-French-speaking children have had French taught as a compulsory subject in school. Yet another example is sex: because sex is connected to population-growth, sex and sexuality have been of great interest to biopower. On a disciplinary level, people who engaged in non-reproductive sexual acts have been treated for psychiatric diagnoses such as \"perversion\", \"frigidity\" and \"sexual dysfunction\". On a biopower-level, the usage of contraceptives has been studied, some social groups have (by various means) been encouraged to have children, while others (such as poor, sick, unmarried women, criminals or people with disability) have been discouraged or prevented from having children.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nIn the era of biopower, death has become a scandal and a catastrophe, but despite this biopower has according to Foucault killed more people than any other form of power has ever done before it. Under sovereign power, the sovereign king could kill people to exert his power or start wars simply to extend his kingdom, but during the era of biopower wars have instead been motivated by an ambition to \"protect life itself\". Similar motivations has also been used for genocide. For example, Nazi Germany motivated its attempt to eradicate Jews, the mentally ill and disabled with the motivation that Jews were \"a threat to the German health\", and that the money spent on healthcare for mentally ill and disabled would be better spent on \"viable Germans\". Chlo\u00eb Taylor also mentions the [[Iraq War]] was motivated by similar tenets. The motivation was at first that Iraq was thought to have weapons of mass destruction and connections to [[Al-Qaeda]]. However, when the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush-]] and [[Blair ministry|Blair]]-administrations didn't find any evidence to support either of these theories, the motivation for the war was changed. In the new motivation, the cause of the war was said to be that [[Saddam Hussein]] had committed crimes against his own population. Taylor means that in modern times, war has to be \"concealed\" under a rhetoric of humanitarian aid, despite the fact that these wars often cause humanitarian crises.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\nDuring the 19th-century, slums were increasing in number and size across the western world. Criminality, illness, alcoholism and prostitution was common in these areas, and the middle class considered the people who lived in these slums as \"unmoral\" and \"lazy\". The middle class also feared that this underclass sooner or later would \"take over\" because the population growth was greater in these slums than it was in the middle class. This fear gave rise to the scientific study of [[eugenics]], whose founder [[Francis Galton]] had been inspired by [[Charles Darwin]] and his theory of natural selection. According to Galton, society was preventing natural selection by helping \"the weak\", thus causing a spread of the \"negative qualities\" into the rest of the population.<ref name=\"Taylor2011bio\"/>\n\n=== Theory of the Body and Sexuality ===\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not something objective that stands outside of history and culture. Instead, Foucault argues, the body has been and is continuously shaped by society and history \u2013 by work, diet, body ideals, exercise, medical interventions, etc. Foucault presents no \"theory\" of the body, but does write about it in ''[[Discipline and Punish]]'' as well as in ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''. Foucault was critical of all purely biological explanations of phenomena such as sexuality, madness and criminality. Further, Foucault argues, that the body is not sufficient as a basis for self-understanding and understanding of others.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nIn ''Discipline and Punish'', Foucault shows how power and the body are tied together, for example by the disciplinary power primarily focusing on individual bodies and their behavior. Foucault argues that power, by manipulating bodies/behavior, also manipulates people's minds. Foucault turns the common saying \"the body is the prison of the soul\" and instead posits that \"the soul is the prison of the body.\"<ref name=\"Oksala2011\" />\n\nAccording to Foucault, [[sexology]] has tried to exert itself as a \"science\" by referring to the material (the body). In contrast to this, Foucault argues that sexology is a pseudoscience, and that \"sex\" is a pseudo-scientific idea. For Foucault the idea of a natural, biologically grounded and fundamental sexuality is a normative historical construct that has also been used as an instrument of power. By describing sex as the biological and fundamental cause to peoples' [[gender identity]], sexual identity and sexual behavior, power has effectively been able to normalize sexual and gendered behavior. This has made it possible to evaluate, pathologize and \"correct\" peoples' sexual and gendered behavior, by comparing bodies behaviors to the constructed \"normal\" behavior. For Foucault, a \"normal sexuality\" is as much of a construct as a \"natural sexuality\". Therefore, Foucault was also critical of the popular discourse that dominated the debate over sexuality during the 1960s and 1970s. During this time, the popular discourse argued for a \"liberation\" of sexuality from a cultural, moral and capitalistic oppression. Foucault, however, argues that peoples' opinions about and experiences of sexuality are ''always'' a result of cultural and power mechanisms. To \"liberate\" sexuality from one group of norms only means that another group of norms takes it place. This, however, does not mean that Foucault considers resistance to be futile. What Foucault argues for is rather that it is impossible to become completely free from power, and that there is simply no \"natural\" sexuality. Power always involves a dimension of resistance, and therefore also a possibility for change. Although Foucault considers it impossible to step outside of power-networks, it is always possible to change these networks or navigate them differently.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nAccording to Foucault, the body is not only a \"obedient and passive object\" that is dominated by discourses and power. The body is also the \"seed\" to resistance against dominant discourses and power techniques. The body is never fully compliant, and experiences can never fully be reduced to linguistic descriptions. There is always a possibility to experience something that is not possible to describe with words, and in this discrepancy there is also a possibility for resistance against dominant discourses.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nFoucault's view of the historical construction of the body has influenced many feminist and queer-theorists. According to [[Johanna Oksala]], Foucault's influence on queer theory has been so great than he can be considered one of the founders of queer theory. The fundamental idea behind queer theory is that there is no natural fundament that lies behind identities such as gay, lesbian, heterosexual, etc. Instead these identities are considered cultural constructions that have been constructed through normative discourses and relations of power. Feminists has with the help of Foucault's ideas studied different ways that women form their bodies: through plastic surgery, diet, eating disorders, etc. Foucault's historization of sex has also affected feminist theorists such as [[Judith Butler]], who used Foucault's theories about the relation between subject, power and sex to question gendered subjects. Butler follows Foucault by saying that there is no \"true\" gender behind gender identity that constitutes its biological and objective fundament. However, Butler is critical of Foucault. She argues Foucault \"naively\" presents bodies and pleasures as a ground for resistance against power, without extending his historization of sexuality to gendered subjects/bodies. Foucault has received criticism from other feminists, such as [[Susan Bordo]] and [[Kate Soper]].<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\nJohanna Oksala argues that Foucault, by saying that sex/sexuality are constructs, doesn't deny the existence of sexuality. Oksala also argues that the goal of critical theories such as Foucault is not to liberate the body and sexuality from oppression, but rather so question and deny the identities that are posited as \"natural\" and \"essential\" by showing how these identities are historical and cultural constructions.<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/>\n\n=== Theory of Subjectivity ===\nFoucault considered his primary project to be the investigation of how people through history has been made into \"subjects.\"<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\">Taylor, D.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Foucault, \"the subject\" has, by western philosophers, usually been considered as something given; natural and objective. On the contrary, Foucault considers subjectivity to be a construction created by power.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> Foucault talks of \"assujettissement\", which is a French term that for Foucault refers to a process where power creates subjects while also oppressing them using social norms. For Foucault \"social norms\" are standards that people are encouraged to follow, that are also used to compare and define people. As an example of \"assujettissement\", Foucault mentions \"homosexual\", a historically contingent type of subjectivity that was created by sexology. Foucault writes that [[sodomy]] was previously considered a serious sexual deviation, but a temporary one. Homosexuality, however, became a \"species\", a past, a childhood and a type of life. \"Homosexuals\" has by the same power that created this subjectivity been discriminated against, due to homosexuality being considered as a deviation from the \"normal\" sexuality. However, Foucault argues, the creation of a subjectivity such as \"homosexuality\" does not only have negative consequences for the people who are subjectivised \u2013 the subjectivity of homosexuality has also led to the creation of gay bars and the [[pride parade]].<ref name=\"Heyes2011\">Heyes, C. J. (2011) Subjectivity and power. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 159-172). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Foucault, scientific discourses have played an important role in the disciplinary power system, by classifying and categorizing people, observing their behavior and \"treating\" them when their behavior has been considered \"abnormal\". Sciences such as psychiatry, biology, medicine, economy, psychoanalysis, psychology, sociology, ethnology, pedagogy and criminology have all categorized behaviors as rational, irrational, normal, abnormal, human, inhuman, etc. By doing so, they have all created various types of subjectivity and norms,<ref name=\"Vintges2011\"/> which are then internalized by people as \"truths\". People have then adapted their behavior in order to get closer to what these sciences has labeled as \"normal\".<ref name=\"Oksala2011\"/> For example, Foucault claims that psychological observation/surveillance and psychological discourses has created a type of psychology-centered subjectivity, which has led to people considering unhappiness a fault in their psychology rather than in society. This has also, according to Foucault, been a way for society to resist criticism \u2013 criticism against society has been turned against the individual and their psychological health.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Obesity as a form of subjectivity ====\n[[Cressida J. Heyes]] argues that a modern example of subjectivity is obesity. Subjects are created in two levels: by biopower and by disciplinary power. Biopower has during the 21th-century considered obesity as a \"corruption in the body politics\" and a \"public health catastrophe\". Heyes argues that during the 21th century there has been an anti-obesity discourse that has been enabled by population statistics and public health campaigns. These expressions of bio power, however, relies on disciplinary power, for example by health care institutions gathering information about individuals weight, length, age, etc. that is then used by biopower. The biopower tries to reduce the ''populations\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm, and disciplinary power tries to reduce the ''individuals\u2032'' deviance from the weight-norm. Biopower and disciplinary power thus create various forms of subjectivity: obesity, underweight, normal weight, and so on. To be obese is not simply a question of where the individual lies in relation to the weight-norm, but it is also considered a marker for the individuals incapacity to regulate their own weight and behavior. This becomes the case not only through the disciplinary institutions (such as health care institutions) exertion of power, but also by a \"confession discourse\" where people are encouraged and expected to \"confess\" their consumption habits, weight, fat percentage, exercising habits, etc. Heyes argues that a modern-day example of this can be seen in online forums centered around weight and weight-loss. These forums contain, according to Heyes, profiles where every individual describes their starting weight, current weight and goal weight. Another example of this that Heyes mentions is video-blogs where people create a \"biography\" centered around their \"weight-loss-journey\". In these ways people also constitute their own subjectivity. However, as with other forms of subjectivity, Heyes argues that these people also experience benefits from constituting themselves as \"obese people\". According to Heyes, these people can feel better, learn new things (about nutrition, for example) and acquire new skills. At the same time, Heyes argues, by accepting this subjectivity people are dragged deeper into a disciplinary power system.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\"/>\n\n==== Subjectivity constituted by individuals in relation to themselves ====\nAccording to Foucault, subjectivity is not necessarily something that is forced upon people externally \u2013 it is also something that is established in a person's relation to themselves.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\"/> This can, for example, happen when a person is trying to \"find themselves\" or \"be themselves\", something [[Edward McGushin]] describes as a typical modern activity. In this quest for the \"true self\", the self is established in two levels: as a passive object (the \"true self\" that is searched for) and as an active \"searcher\". The ancient [[Cynicism (philosophy)|Cynics]] and the 19th-century philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] posited that the \"true self\" can only be found by going through great hardship and/or danger. The ancient [[Stoicism|Stoics]] and 17th-century philosopher [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]], however, argued that the \"self\" can be found by quiet and solitary introspection. Yet another example is [[Socrates]], who argued that self-awareness can only be found by having debates with others, where the debaters question each other's foundational views and opinions. Foucault, however, argued that \"subjectivity\" is a process, rather than a state of being. As such, Foucault argued that there is no \"true self\" to be found. Rather so, the \"self\" is constituted/created in activities such as the ones employed to \"find\" the \"self\". In other words, exposing oneself to hardships and danger does not \"reveal\" the \"true self\", according to Foucault, but rather creates a particular type of self and subjectivity. However, according to Foucault the \"form\" for the subject is in great part already constituted by power, before these self-constituting practices are employed. Schools, workplaces, households, government institutions, entertainment media and the healthcare sector all, through disciplinary power, contribute to forming people into being particular types of subjects.<ref name=\"McGushin2011\">McGushin, E.

Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\n=== Theory of Freedom ===\nTodd May defines Foucault's concept of freedom as: that which we can do of ourselves within our specific historical context. A condition for this, according to Foucault, is that we are aware of our situation and how it has been created/affected (and is still being affected) by power. According to May, two of the aspects of how power has shaped peoples\u2032 way of being, thinking and acting is described in the books where Foucault describes disciplinary power and the history of sexuality. However, May argues, there will always be aspects of peoples\u2032 formation that will be unknown to them, hence the constant necessity for the type of analyses that Foucault did.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\nFoucault argues that the forces that have affected people can be changed; people always have the capacity to change the factors that limits their freedom.<ref name=\"May2011\"/> Freedom is thus not a state of being, but a practice \u2013 a way of being in relation to oneself, to others and to the world.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\">Mendieta, E. (2011) The practice of freedom. In Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (pp. 111-124). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref> According to Todd May Foucault's concept of freedom also includes constructing histories like the ones Foucault did about the history of disciplinary power and sexuality \u2013 histories that investigate and describe the forces that have influenced people into becoming who they are. From the knowledge that is reached from such investigations, people can thereafter decide which forces they believe are acceptable and which they consider to be intolerable and has to be changed. Freedom is for Foucault a type of \"experimentation\" with different \"transformations\". Since these experiments cannot be controlled completely, May argues they may lead to the reconstruction of intolerable power relations or the creation of new ones. Thus, May argues, it is always necessary to continue with such experimentation and Foucauldian analyses.<ref name=\"May2011\"/>\n\n==== Practice of Critique ====\nFoucault's \"alternative\" to the modern subjectivity is described by Cressida Heyes as \"critique.\" For Foucault there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" forms of subjectivity, since they are all a result of power relations.<ref name=\"Heyes2011\" /> In the same way, Foucault argues there are no \"good\" and \"bad\" norms. All norms and institutions are at the same time enabling as they are oppressing. Therefore, Foucault argues, it is always crucial to continue with the practice of \"critique\".<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" /> Critique is for Foucault a practice that searches for the processes and events that led to our way of being \u2013 a questioning of who we \"are\" and how this \"we\" came to be. Such a \"critical [[ontology]] of the present\" shows that peoples\u2032 current \"being\" is in fact a historically contingent, unstable and changeable construction. Foucault emphasizes that since the current way of being is not a necessity, it is also possible to change it.<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Critique also includes investigating how and when people are being enabled and when they are being oppressed by the current norms and institutions, finding ways to reduce limitations on freedom, resist normalization and develop new and different way of relating to oneself and others. Foucault argues that it is impossible to go beyond power relations, but that it is always possible to navigate power relations in a different way.<ref name=\"Taylor2011practices\" />\n\n====''Epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self\" ====\nAs an alternative to the modern \"search\" for the \"true self\",<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> and as a part of \"the work of freedom\",<ref name=\"Mendieta2011\" /> Foucault discusses the antique Greek term ''epimeleia heautou'', \"care for the self.\" According to Foucault, among the ancient Greek philosophers, self-awareness was not a goal in itself, but rather something that was sought after in order to \"care for oneself\". Care for the self consists of what Foucault calls \"the art of living\" or \"technologies of the self.\"<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" /> The goal of these techniques was, according to Foucault, to transform oneself into a more ethical person. As an example of this, Foucault mentions [[meditation]],<ref name=\"Vintges2011\" /> the [[stoicism|stoic]] activity of contemplating past and future actions and evaluating if these actions are in line with ones values and goals, and \"contemplation of nature.\" Contemplation of nature is another stoic activity, that consists of reflecting on how \"small\" one's existence is when compared to the greater [[cosmos]].<ref name=\"McGushin2011\" />\n\n=== Theory of Knowledge ===\n{{Main|Power-knowledge}}\nFoucault is described by [[Mary Beth Mader]] as an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] and [[historicism|historicist]].<ref name=\"Mader2014\">Mader, M. B. (2014) Knowledge. Ur Lawlor, L. (red.) & Nale, J. (red.) ''The Cambridge Foucault Lexicon'' (s. 226-236). Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-11921-4}}</ref> Foucault is critical of the idea that humans can reach \"absolute\" knowledge about the world. A fundamental goal in many of Foucault's works is to show how that which has traditionally been considered as absolute, universal and true in fact are historically contingent. To Foucault, even the idea of absolute knowledge is a historically contingent idea. This does however not lead to epistemological nihilism; rather, Foucault argues that we \"always begin anew\" when it comes to knowledge.<ref name=\"Taylor2011intro\" /> At the same time Foucault is critical of modern western philosophy for lacking \"spirituality\". With \"spirituality\" Foucault refers to a certain type of ethical being, and the processes that lead to this state of being. Foucault argues that such a spirituality was a natural part of the ancient Greek philosophy, where knowledge was considered as something that was only accessible to those that had an ethical character. According to Foucault this changed in the \"cartesian moment\", the moment when [[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] reached the \"insight\" that self-awareness was something given ([[Cogito ergo sum]], \"I think, therefore I am\"), and from this \"insight\" Descartes drew conclusions about God, the world, and knowledge. According to Foucault, since Descartes knowledge has been something separate from ethics. In modern times, Foucault argues, anyone can reach \"knowledge\", as long as they are rational beings, educated, willing to participate in the scientific community and use a scientific method. Foucault is critical of this \"modern\" view of knowledge.<ref>Stone, B. E. (2011) Subjectivity and truth. Ur Taylor, D. (red.) ''Michel Foucault: Key Concepts'' (s. 143-157). Acumen Publishing Ltd., {{ISBN|978-1-84465-234-1}}</ref>\n\nFoucault describes two types of \"knowledge\": \"savoir\" and \"connaissance\", two French terms that both can be translated as \"knowledge\" but with separate meanings for Foucault. By \"savoir\" Foucault is referring to a process where subjects are created, while at the same time these subjects also become objects for knowledge. An example of this can be seen in criminology and psychiatry. In these sciences, subjects such as \"the rational person\", \"the mentally ill person\", \"the law abiding person\", \"the criminal\", etc. are created, and these sciences center their attention and knowledge on these subjects. The knowledge about these subjects is \"connaicance\", while the process in which subjects and knowledge is created is \"savoir\".<ref name=\"Mader2014\"/> A similar term in Foucaults corpus is \"pouvoir/savoir\" (power/knowledge). With this term Foucault is referring to a type of knowledge that is considered \"common sense\", but that is created and withheld in that position (as \"common sense\") by power. The term power/knowledge comes from [[Jeremy Bentham]]s idea that [[panopticon]]s wouldn't only be prisons, but would be used for experiments where the criminals\u2032 behaviour would be studied. Power/knowledge thus refers to forms of power where the power compares individuals, measures differences, establishes a norm and then forces this norm unto the subjects. This is especially successful when the established norm is internalized and institutionalized (by \"institutionalized\" Foucault refers to when the norm is omnipresent). Because then, when the norm is internalized and institutionalized, it has effectively become a part of peoples' \"common sense\" \u2013 the \"obvious\", the \"given\", the \"natural\". When this has happened, this \"common sense\" also affects the explicit knowledge (scientific knowledge), Foucault argues. [[Ellen K. Feder]] mean that the premise \"the world consists of women and men\" is an example of this. This premise, Feder argues, has been considered \"common sense\", and has led to the creation of the psychiatric diagnosis [[gender identity disorder]] (GID). For example, during the 1970s, children with behavior that was not considered appropriate for their gender was diagnosed with GID. The treatment then consisted of trying to make the child adapt to the prevailing gender norms. Feder argues that this is an example of power/knowledge since psychiatry, from the \"common sense\" premise \"the world consists of women and men\" (a premise which is upheld in this status by power), created a new diagnosis, a new type of subject and a whole body of knowledge surrounding this new subject.<ref name=\"Feder2011\">Fader, E.

They claim that through [[discourse analysis]], hierarchies may be uncovered and questioned by way of analyzing the corresponding fields of knowledge through which they are legitimated. This is one of the ways that Foucault's work is linked to critical theory.<ref>{{cite book  | last = Van Loon | first = Borin  | title = Introducing Critical Theory | publisher=Icon Books Ltd. | location = Thriplow | year = 2001}}</ref> His work 'Discipline and Punish' influenced his friend and contemporary [[Gilles Deleuze]], who published the paper \"Postscript on the Societies of Control\", praising Foucault's work but arguing that contemporary western society has in fact developed from a 'disciplinary society' into a 'society of control'.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Deleuze|first=Gilles|date=1992|title=Postscript on the Societies of Control|journal=October|volume=59|pages=3\u20137|issn=0162-2870|jstor=778828}}</ref> Deleuze went on to publish a book dedicated to Foucault's thought in 1988 under the title ''[[Foucault (Deleuze book)|Foucault]]''.\n\nFoucault's discussions of the relationship between power and knowledge has influenced postcolonial critiques in explaining the discursive formation of [[colonialism]], particularly in [[Edward Said]]'s work ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]].''<ref>{{cite book | last = Said | first = Edward | title = Orientalism | publisher=Vintage Books | location = New York | year = 1979}}</ref> Foucault's work has been compared to that of [[Erving Goffman]] by the sociologist [[Michael Hviid Jacobsen]] and Soren Kristiansen, who list Goffman as an influence on Foucault.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Social Thought of Erving Goffman|last1=Jacobsen|first1=Michael Hviid|last2=Kristiansen|first2=Soren|publisher=SAGE Publications|year=2014|isbn=978-1412998031|location=London|pages=5, 86}}</ref> Foucault's writings, particularly ''The History of Sexuality'', have also been very influential in [[feminist philosophy]] and [[queer theory]], particularly the work of the major Feminist scholar [[Judith Butler]] due to his theories regarding the genealogy of maleness and femaleness, power, sexuality, and bodies.<ref name=\"gutting1\" />\n\n===Critiques and engagements===\n\n====Crypto-normativity====\n{{main|Foucault\u2013Habermas debate}}\nA prominent critique of Foucault's thought concerns his refusal to propose positive solutions to the social and political issues that he critiques. Since no human relation is devoid of power, freedom becomes elusive\u2014even as an ideal. This stance which critiques normativity as socially constructed and contingent, but which relies on an implicit norm in order to mount the critique led philosopher [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] to describe Foucault's thinking as  \"crypto-normativist\", covertly reliant on the very [[age of enlightenment|Enlightenment]] principles he attempts to argue against.<ref>Ashenden, S., & Owen, D. (Eds.). (1999). Foucault contra Habermas: Recasting the dialogue between genealogy and critical theory. Sage.</ref> A similar critique has been advanced by [[Diana Taylor (professor)|Diana Taylor]], and by [[Nancy Fraser]] who argues that \"Foucault's critique encompasses traditional moral systems, he denies himself recourse to concepts such as 'freedom' and 'justice', and therefore lacks the ability to generate positive alternatives.\"<ref>Taylor, D. (2010). Michel Foucault: key concepts. Acumen. pp. 2\u20133</ref> Likewise, scholar [[Nancy Pearcey]] points out Foucault's paradoxical stance: \"[when someone] states that it is impossible to attain objectivity, is that an objective statement? The theory undercuts its own claims.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Finding Truth|last=Pearcey|first=Nancy|year=2015|isbn=978-0781413084|location=|page=208}}</ref>\n\n====Genealogy as historical method====\nThe philosopher [[Richard Rorty]] has argued that Foucault's \"archaeology of knowledge\" is fundamentally negative, and thus fails to adequately establish any \"new\" theory of knowledge ''per se''. Rather, Foucault simply provides a few valuable maxims regarding the reading of history. Rorty writes:\n\n{{quote|As far as I can see, all he has to offer are brilliant redescriptions of the past, supplemented by helpful hints on how to avoid being trapped by old historiographical assumptions. These hints consist largely of saying: \"do not look for progress or meaning in history; do not see the history of a given activity, of any segment of culture, as the development of rationality or of freedom; do not use any philosophical vocabulary to characterize the essence of such activity or the goal it serves; do not assume that the way this activity is presently conducted gives any clue to the goals it served in the past\".<ref>Richard Rorty. ''Foucault and Epistemology'' in Hoy, D (eds) 'Foucault: A critical reader' Basil Blackwell. Oxford, 1986.</ref>}}\n\nFoucault has frequently been criticized by historians for what they consider to be a lack of rigor in his analyses.<ref>Mills, S. (2003). Michel Foucault: Routledge Critical Thinkers. Chicago p. 23</ref> For example, [[Hans-Ulrich Wehler]] harshly criticized Foucault in 1998.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', pp. 45\u201395. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> Wehler regards Foucault as a bad philosopher who wrongfully received a good response by the humanities and by social sciences. According to Wehler, Foucault's works are not only insufficient in their empiric historical aspects, but also often contradictory and lacking in clarity. For example, Foucault's concept of power is \"desperatingly undifferentiated\", and Foucault's thesis of a \"disciplinary society\" is, according to Wehler, only possible because Foucault does not properly differentiate between authority, force, power, violence and legitimacy.<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 81. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref> In addition, his thesis is based on a one-sided choice of sources (prisons and psychiatric institutions) and neglects other types of organizations as e.g. factories. Also, Wehler criticizes Foucault's \"francocentrism\" because he did not take into consideration major German-speaking theorists of social sciences like [[Max Weber]] and [[Norbert Elias]]. In all, Wehler concludes that Foucault is \"because of the endless series of flaws in his so-called empirical studies ... an intellectually dishonest, empirically absolutely unreliable, crypto-normativist seducer of Postmodernism\".<ref>Wehler, Hans-Ulrich (1998): ''Die Herausforderung der Kulturgeschichte'', p. 91. {{ISBN|3-406-42076-1}}</ref>\n\n====Feminist critiques====\nThough American feminists have built on Foucault's critiques of the historical construction of gender roles and sexuality, some feminists note the limitations of the masculinist subjectivity and ethical orientation that he describes.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\">Downing, Lisa. \"The Cambridge Introduction to Michel Foucault.\" (2008). Cambridge University Press. pp. 104-117</ref>\n\n====Sexuality====\nThe philosopher [[Roger Scruton]] argues in ''[[Sexual Desire (book)|Sexual Desire]]'' (1986) that Foucault was incorrect to claim, in ''The History of Sexuality'', that sexual morality is culturally relative. He criticizes Foucault for assuming that there could be societies in which a \"problematisation\" of the sexual did not occur, concluding that, \"No history of thought could show the 'problematisation' of sexual experience to be peculiar to certain specific social formations: it is characteristic of personal experience generally, and therefore of every genuine social order.\"<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sexual Desire: A Philosophical Investigation|last1=Scruton|first1=Roger|author-link=Roger Scruton|publisher=Phoenix Books|year=1994|isbn=978-1-85799-100-0|location=London|pages=34, 362}}</ref>\n\nFoucault's approach to sexuality, which he sees as socially constructed, has become influential in [[queer theory]]. Foucault's resistance to identity politics, and his rejection of the psychoanalytic concept of \"object choice\", stands at odds with some theories of queer identity.<ref name=\"Downing, Lisa 2008\"/>\n\n====Social constructionism and human nature====\nFoucault is sometimes criticized for his prominent formulation of principles of [[social constructionism]], which some see as an affront to the concept of [[truth]]. In Foucault's 1971 [[Chomsky-Foucault Debate|televised debate]] with [[Noam Chomsky]], Foucault argued against the possibility of any fixed human nature, as posited by Chomsky's concept of innate human faculties. Chomsky argued that concepts of justice were rooted in human reason, whereas Foucault rejected the universal basis for a concept of justice.<ref>Wilkin, P. (1999). Chomsky and Foucault on human nature and politics: an essential difference?. Social Theory and Practice, pp. 177\u2013210.</ref> Following the debate, Chomsky was stricken with Foucault's total rejection of the possibility of a universal morality, stating \"He struck me as completely amoral, I'd never met anyone who was so totally amoral [...] I mean, I liked him personally, it's just that I couldn't make sense of him. It's as if he was from a different species, or something.\"<ref>James Miller, Jim Miller. 1993.  The Passion of Michel Foucault. Harvard University Press, pp. 201\u201303</ref>\n\n====Education and authority====\nPeruvian writer [[Mario Vargas Llosa]], while acknowledging that Foucault contributed to give a right of citizenship in cultural life to certain marginal and eccentric experiences (of sexuality, of cultural repression, of madness), asserts that his radical critique of authority was detrimental to education.<ref>Vargas Llosa, Mario (2010).
