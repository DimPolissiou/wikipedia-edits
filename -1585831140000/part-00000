He likened the environment to a university laboratory and called it \"the AM3 way\".  Oguchi also addressed AM3's lack of a genre of game in which they specialized, stating that his department's primary objective was to create games that \"look interesting\", which also meant a focus on arcade games that one would not find on a [[video game console]]. AM3 had a fondness for using the [[List of Sega arcade system boards|Model 2]] [[arcade system board]], which was used on ''Last Bronx'' and ''Top Skater'' even though the former  released just a few weeks before [[Sega AM2|AM2]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter 3]]'' on the Model 3.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''Top Skater'' was released afterward with a deliberate selection of the Model 2.{{Sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=230}} Of the newer hardware, Oguchi stated that AM3 would work with it, and that he anticipated it would eventually lower in cost much as the Model 2 had already. ''Next Generation'' praised ''Last Bronx'' despite comparing it to ''Virtua Fighter 3'', stating it showed how AM3 had a \"refusal to take a back seat to AM2 or any other R&D department.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  \n\nIn 1999, AM3 released ''Top Skater'' developer Kenji Kanno's ''[[Crazy Taxi (video game)|Crazy Taxi]]'' for the NAOMI system board.{{Sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=240-242}} It quickly became a staple game at a number of arcades and received a [[Dreamcast]] port, which sold over one million copies.

He likened the environment to a university laboratory and called it \"the AM3 way\".  Oguchi also addressed AM3's lack of a genre of game in which they specialized, stating that his department's primary objective was to create games that \"look interesting\", which also meant a focus on arcade games that one would not find on a [[video game console]]. AM3 had a fondness for using the [[List of Sega arcade system boards|Model 2]] [[arcade system board]], which was used on ''Last Bronx'' and ''Top Skater'' even though the former  released just a few weeks before [[Sega AM2|AM2]]'s ''[[Virtua Fighter 3]]'' on the Model 3.<ref name=\":1\" /> ''Top Skater'' was released afterward with a deliberate selection of the Model 2.{{Sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=230}} Of the newer hardware, Oguchi stated that AM3 would work with it, and that he anticipated it would eventually lower in cost much as the Model 2 had already. ''Next Generation'' praised ''Last Bronx'' despite comparing it to ''Virtua Fighter 3'', stating it showed how AM3 had a \"refusal to take a back seat to AM2 or any other R&D department.\"<ref name=\":1\" />  \n\nIn 1999, AM3 released ''Top Skater'' developer Kenji Kanno's ''[[Crazy Taxi (video game)|Crazy Taxi]]'' for the NAOMI system board.{{Sfn|Horowitz|2018|p=240-242}} It quickly became a staple game at a number of arcades and received a [[Dreamcast]] port, which sold over one million copies.

Operational missions launched numerous satellites, interplanetary probes, and the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST); conducted science experiments in orbit; and participated in construction and servicing of the [[International Space Station]].

The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding.

The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

The Kennedy Space Center was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for equatorial orbits (the only orbit profile actually used in the program), the U.S. Air Force at the [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] was responsible for launch, landing and turnaround operations for polar orbits (though this was never used), the [[Johnson Space Center]] (JSC) served as the central point for all Shuttle operations, the MSFC was responsible for the main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters, the [[John C. Stennis Space Center]] handled main engine testing, and the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] managed the global tracking network.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/technology/sts-newsref/centers.html |title=NASA Centers And Responsibilities |publisher=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|last=Dumoulin|first=Jim |date=August 31, 2000 |accessdate=March 22, 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Orbiter===\n{{main|Space Shuttle orbiter}}\n[[File:Shuttle profiles.jpg|center|thumb|upright=2.65|Shuttle launch profiles. From left: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]''.]]\n\nThe orbiter had design elements and capabilities of both a rocket and an aircraft to allow it to launch vertically and then land as a glider. Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Shuttle fleet's total mission time was 1322 days, 19 hours, 21 minutes and 23 seconds.<ref name=\"ShuttleByNumbers\">{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/12376-nasa-space-shuttle-program-facts-statistics.html |title=NASA's Space Shuttle By the Numbers: 30 Years of a Spaceflight Icon |publisher=Space.com |date=July 21, 2011 |accessdate=June 18, 2014 |author=Malik, Tarik}}</ref>\n\nShuttle components include the [[Space Shuttle orbiter|Orbiter Vehicle]] (OV) with three clustered [[Rocketdyne RS-25]] main engines, a pair of recoverable [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket boosters]] (SRBs), and the expendable [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] (ET) containing [[liquid hydrogen]] and [[liquid oxygen]]. The Space Shuttle was [[VTHL|launched vertically]], like a conventional rocket, with the two SRBs operating in parallel with the OV's three [[Space Shuttle main engine|main engines]], which were fueled from the ET. The SRBs were jettisoned before the vehicle reached orbit, and the ET was jettisoned just before [[orbit insertion]], which used the orbiter's two [[Space Shuttle Orbital Maneuvering System|Orbital Maneuvering System]] (OMS) engines. At the conclusion of the mission, the orbiter fired its OMS to deorbit and [[Atmospheric reentry|reenter the atmosphere]]. The orbiter then [[rocket glider|glided]] as a [[spaceplane]] to a runway landing, usually to the [[Shuttle Landing Facility]] at KSC, Florida or [[Rogers Dry Lake]] in [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California. After landing at Edwards, the orbiter was flown back to the KSC on the [[Shuttle Carrier Aircraft]], a specially modified [[Boeing 747]].\n\nThe first orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Enterprise|Enterprise]]'', was built in 1976, used in [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and has no orbital capability. Four fully operational orbiters were initially built: ''[[Space Shuttle Columbia|Columbia]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Challenger|Challenger]]'', ''[[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]]'', and ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]''. Of these, two were lost in mission accidents: [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|''Challenger'' in 1986]] and [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|''Columbia'' in 2003]], with a total of fourteen astronauts killed. A fifth operational (and sixth in total) orbiter, ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour|Endeavour]]'', was built in 1991 to replace ''Challenger''. The Space Shuttle was retired from service upon the conclusion of ''Atlantis''{{'}}s final flight on July 21, 2011. The U.S. has since relied on the Russian [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] to transport astronauts to the International Space Station, pending the [[Commercial Crew Development]] and [[Space Launch System]] programs with flights to begin in the 2020s.\n\n==Design and development==\n===Historical background===\n[[File:LiftingBodies.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], and [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]] lifting bodies]]\n\nDuring the 1950s, the United States Air Force proposed using a reusable piloted glider to perform military operations such as reconnaissance, satellite attack, and employing air-to-ground weapons. In the late-1950s, the Air Force began developing the partially reusable [[Boeing X-20 Dyna-Soar|X-20 Dyna-Soar]]. The Air Force collaborated with NASA on the Dyna-Soar, and began training six pilots in June 1961. The rising costs of development and the prioritization of [[Project Gemini]] led to the cancellation of the Dyna-Soar program in December 1963. In addition to the Dyna-Soar, the Air Force had conducted a study in 1957 to test the feasibility of reusable boosters. This became the basis for the [[aerospaceplane]], a fully reusable spacecraft that was never developed beyond the initial design phase in 1962\u20131963.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\">{{cite book |last= Williamson |first= Ray |title= Exploring the Unknown: Selected Documents in the History of the U.S. Civil Space Program, Volume IV: Accessing Space |chapter= Developing the Space Shuttle |publisher= National Aeronautics and Space Administration |date= 1999 |location= Washington, D.C. |chapter-url= https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4407/vol4/cover.pdf}}</ref>{{rp|162\u2013163}}\n\nBeginning in the early 1950s, NASA and the Air Force collaborated on developing [[lifting bodies]] to test aircraft that primarily generated lift from their fuselages instead of wings, and tested the [[NASA M2-F1|M2-F1]], [[Northrop M2-F2|M2-F2]], [[Northrop M2-F3|M2-F3]], [[Northrop HL-10|HL-10]], [[Martin-Marietta X-24|X-24A]], and the [[Martin Marietta X-24#X-24B 2|X-24B]].

NASA issued a [[request for proposal]] (RFP) for designs of the Integrated Launch and Re-entry Vehicle (ILRV), which would later become the Space Shuttle. Rather than award a contract based upon initial proposals, NASA announced a phased approach for the Space Shuttle contracting and development; Phase A was a request for studies completed by competing aerospace companies, Phase B was a competition between two contractors for a specific contract, Phase C involved designing the details of the spacecraft components, and Phase D was the production of the spacecraft.<ref name=lindroos>{{cite web |url=http://www.pmview.com/spaceodysseytwo/spacelvs/index.htm |title=Introduction to Future Launch Vehicle Plans [1963\u20132001]|last=Lindroos|first=Marcus|publisher=Pmview.com |date=June 15, 2001 |accessdate=April 25, 2019}}</ref><ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|19\u201322}}\n\nIn December 1968, NASA created the Space Shuttle Task Group to determine the optimal design for a reusable spacecraft, and issued study contracts to [[General Dynamics]], [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]], [[McDonnell Douglas]], and [[North American Rockwell]]. In July 1969, the Space Shuttle Task Group issued a report that determined the Shuttle would support a space station, launch, service, and retrieve satellites, and support short-duration crewed missions. The report also created three classes of a future reusable shuttle: Class I would have a reusable orbiter mounted on expendable boosters, Class II would use multiple expendable rocket engines and a single propellant tank (stage-and-a-half), and Class III would have both a reusable orbiter and a reusable booster. In September 1969, the Space Task Group, under leadership of Vice President [[Spiro Agnew]], issued a report calling for the development of a space shuttle to bring people and cargo to low Earth orbit (LEO), as well as a space tug for transfers between orbits and the Moon, and a reusable nuclear stage for deep space travel.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|163\u2013166}}<ref name=space_task_group_1969 />\n\nAfter the release of the Space Shuttle Task Group report, many aerospace engineers favored the Class III, fully reusable design because of perceived savings in hardware costs. [[Max Faget]], a NASA engineer who had worked to design the [[Project Mercury|Mercury]] capsule, patented a design for a two-stage fully recoverable system with a straight-winged orbiter mounted on a larger straight-winged booster.<ref name=\"faget_bio\">{{cite web |last= Allen |first= Bob |title= Maxime A.

Additionally, the Air Force required a larger payload capacity than Faget's design allowed. In January 1971, NASA and Air Force leadership decided that a reusable delta-wing orbiter mounted on an expendable propellant tank would be the optimal design for the Space Shuttle.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|166}}\n\nAfter establishing the need for a reusable, heavy-lift spacecraft, NASA and the Air Force began determining the design requirements of their respective services. The Air Force expected to use the Space Shuttle to launch large satellites, and required it to be capable of lifting {{convert|65000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} to an easterly low Earth orbit or {{convert|40000|lbs|kg|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} into polar orbit into a [[polar orbit]]. The satellite designs also required that the Space Shuttle have a {{convert|15|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} by {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} foot payload bay. NASA evaluated the [[Rocketdyne F-1|F-1]] and [[Rocketdyne J-2|J-2]] engines from the [[Saturn (rocket family)|Saturn rockets]], and determined that they were insufficient for the requirements of the Space Shuttle, and in July 1971, it issued a contract to [[Rocketdyne]] to begin development on the [[RS-25]] engine.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|165\u2013170}}\n\nNASA reviewed 29 potential designs for the Space Shuttle. NASA determined that a design with two side boosters should be used, and the boosters should be reusable to reduce costs. NASA and the Air Force elected to use [[solid-propellant rocket|solid-propellant boosters]] because of the lower costs and the ease of refurbishing them for reuse after they landed in the ocean. In January 1972, President [[Richard Nixon]] approved the Shuttle, and NASA decided on its final design in March. In August 1972, NASA awarded the contract to build the orbiter to North American Rockwell, the solid-rocket booster contract to [[Morton Thiokol]], and the external tank contract to [[Martin Marietta]].<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|167, 170\u2013173}}\n\n===Development===\n[[File:566175main columbia-opf.jpg|thumb|right|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] undergoing installation of its ceramic tiles]]\n\nOn June 4, 1974, Rockwell began construction on the first shuttle, Orbiter Vehicle (OV)-101, which would later be named [[Space Shuttle Enterprise|''Enterprise'']]. ''Enterprise'' was designed as a test vehicle, and did not include engines or heat shielding. Construction was completed on September 17, 1976, and ''Enterprise'' was moved to [[Edwards AFB]] to begin testing.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173}}<ref name=\"enterprise_overview\">{{cite web |last= Howell |first= Elizabeth |title= Enterprise: The Test Shuttle |publisher= Space.com |date= October 9, 2012 |url= https://www.space.com/17983-space-shuttle-enterprise.html |accessdate= April 24, 2019}}</ref> Rockwell constructed the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA)-098, which was a structural truss mounted to the ET with three RS-25 engines attached. It was tested at the [[Stennis Space Center|National Space Technology Laboratory (NSTL)]] to ensure that the engines could safely run through the launch profile.<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|II-163}} Rockwell conducted mechanical and thermal stress tests on Structural Test Article (STA)-099 to determine the effects of aerodynamic and thermal stresses during launch and reentry.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|38\u201339}}<ref name=jenkins2016 />{{rp|I-415}}\n\nThe beginning of the development of the RS-25 Space Shuttle Main Engine was delayed for nine months while [[Pratt & Whitney]] challenged the contract that had been issued to Rocketdyne. The first engine was completed in March 1975, after issues with developing the first throttlable, reusable engine. During engine testing, the RS-25 experienced multiple nozzle failures, as well as broken turbine blades. Despite the problems during testing, NASA ordered the nine RS-25 engines needed for its three orbiters under construction in May 1978.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|174\u2013175}}\n\nNASA experienced significant delays in the development of the Space Shuttle's [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]]. Previous NASA spacecraft had used [[Atmospheric entry#Ablative|ablative]] heat shields, but those could not be reused. NASA chose to use ceramic tiles for thermal protection, as the shuttle could then be constructed of lightweight [[aluminum]], and the tiles could be individually replaced as needed. Construction began on [[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] on March 27, 1975, and it was delivered to the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) on March 25, 1979. At the time of its arrival at the KSC, ''Columbia'' still had 6,000 of its 30,000 tiles remaining to be installed. However, many of the tiles that had been originally installed had to be replaced, requiring two years of installation before ''Columbia'' could fly.<ref name=dev_space_shuttle />{{rp|175\u2013177}}<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|46\u201348}}\n\nOn January 5, 1979, NASA commissioned a second orbiter. Later that month, Rockwell began converting STA-099 to OV-099, later named [[Space Shuttle Challenger|''Challenger'']]. On January 29, 1979, NASA ordered two additional orbiters, OV-103 and OV-104, which were named [[Space Shuttle Discovery|''Discovery'']] and [[Space Shuttle Atlantis|''Atlantis'']]. Construction of OV-105, later named [[Space Shuttle Endeavour|''Endeavour'']], began in February 1982, but NASA decided to limit the Space Shuttle fleet to four orbiters in 1983. After the [[Space Shuttle Challenger disaster|loss of ''Challenger'']], NASA resumed production of ''Endeavour'' in September 1987.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|52\u201353}}\n\n===Testing===\n[[File:OV-101 first flight.jpg|thumb|''Enterprise'' during the [[Approach and Landing Tests]]]]\n[[File:Space Shuttle Columbia launching cropped 2.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Space Shuttle Columbia|''Columbia'']] launching on [[STS-1]]{{refn|group=note|[[STS-1]] and [[STS-2]] were the only Space Shuttle missions that used a white fire-retardant coating on the external tank.

In February 1977, ''Enterprise'' began the [[Approach and Landing Tests]] and underwent captive flights, where it remained attached to the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft for the duration of the flight. On August 12, 1977, ''Enterprise'' conducted its first glide test, where it detached from the Shuttle Carrier Aircraft and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|173\u2013174}} After four additional flights, ''Enterprise'' was moved to the [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) on March 13, 1978. ''Enterprise'' underwent shake tests in the Mated Vertical Ground Vibration Test, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and underwent vibrations to simulate the stresses of launch. In April 1979, ''Enterprise'' was taken to the Kennedy Space Center, where it was attached to an external tank and solid rocket boosters, and moved to [[Kennedy Space Center Launch Complex 39|LC-39]]. Once installed at the launch pad, the Space Shuttle was used to verify the proper positioning of launch complex hardware. ''Enterprise'' was taken back to California in August 1979, and later served in the development of the [[Vandenberg AFB Space Launch Complex 6|SLC-6]] at [[Vandenberg AFB]] in 1984.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|40\u201341}}\n\nOn November 26, 1980, ''Columbia'' was mated with its external tank and solid-rocket boosters, and was moved to LC-39 on December 29, 1980. The first Space Shuttle mission, [[STS-1]], would be the first time NASA performed a crewed first-flight of a spacecraft. On April 12, 1981, the Space Shuttle launched for the first time, and was piloted by [[John Young (astronaut)|John Young]] and [[Robert Crippen]]. During the two-day mission, Young and Crippen tested equipment on board the shuttle, and found several of the ceramic tiles had fallen off the top side of the ''Columbia''. NASA coordinated with the Air Force to use satellites to image the underside of ''Columbia'', and determined there was no damage. ''Columbia'' reentered the atmosphere on April 14, and landed at Edwards AFB.<ref name=shuttle_manual />{{rp|48\u201352}}<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|177\u2013178}}\n\nNASA conducted three additional test flights with ''Columbia'' in 1981 and 1982. On July 4, 1982, [[STS-4]], flown by [[Ken Mattingly]] and [[Henry Hartsfield]], landed at Edwards AFB. President [[Ronald Reagan]] and his wife [[Nancy Reagan|Nancy]] met the crew, and delivered a speech. After STS-4, NASA declared the Space Shuttle operational.<ref name=\"dev_space_shuttle\" />{{rp|178\u2013179}}\n\n==Description==\nThe Space Shuttle was the first operational orbital spacecraft designed for [[Reusable launch system|reuse]].

Its three-part fuselage provided support for the crew compartment, cargo bay, flight surfaces, and engines. The rear of the orbiter contained the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSME), which provided thrust during launch, as well as the Orbital Maneuvering System (OMS), which allowed the orbiter to achieve, alter, and exit its orbit once in space. Its double-[[delta wing]]s were {{convert|60|ft|m|sigfig=2|sp=us|order=flip|adj=on}} long, and were swept 81\u00b0 at the inner leading edge and 45\u00b0 at the outer leading edge. Each wing had an inboard and outboard [[elevon]] to provide flight control during reentry, along with a flap located between the wings, below the engines to control [[Aircraft principal axes#Transverse axis (pitch)|pitch]]. The orbiter's [[vertical stabilizer]] was swept backwards at 45\u00b0, and contained a [[Rudder#Aircraft rudders|rudder]] that could split to act as a [[Air brake (aeronautics)|speed brake]]. The vertical stabilizer also contained a two-part [[drogue parachute|drag parachute]] system to slow the orbiter after landing. The orbiter used [[Landing gear#Retractable gear|retractable landing gear]] with a nose landing gear and two main landing gear, each containing two tires. The main landing gear contained two brake assemblies each, and the nose landing gear contained an electro-hydraulic steering mechanism.<ref name=shuttle_manual/>{{rp|64\u201368, 100, 124}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365, 382\u2013389, 408\u2013411}}\n\n====Crew compartment====\nThe crew compartment comprised three decks, and was the pressurized, habitable area on all Space Shuttle missions. The cockpit consisted of two seats for the commander and pilot, as well as an additional two to four seats for crew members. The mid-deck is located below the cockpit, and is where the galley and crew bunks were set up, as well as three or four crew member seats. The mid-deck contained the airlock, which could support two astronauts on an [[extravehicular activity]] (EVA), as well as access to pressurized research modules. An equipment bay was below the mid-deck, which stored environmental control and waste management systems.<ref name= shuttle_manual />{{rp|60\u201362}}<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|365\u2013369}}\n\nOn the first four Shuttle missions, astronauts wore modified U.S. Air Force high-altitude full-pressure suits, which included a full-pressure helmet during ascent and descent. From the fifth flight, [[STS-5]], until the loss of ''Challenger'', the crew wore one-piece light blue [[nomex]] flight suits and partial-pressure helmets. After the ''Challenger'' disaster, the crew members wore the Launch Entry Suit (LES), a partial-pressure version of the high-altitude pressure suits with a helmet. In 1994, the LES was replaced by the full-pressure [[Advanced Crew Escape Suit]] (ACES), which improved the safety of the astronauts in an emergency situation. ''Columbia'' originally had modified [[SR-71]] [[zero-zero ejection seat]]s installed for the ALT and first four missions, but these were disabled after STS-4 and removed after [[STS-9]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|370\u2013371}}\n[[File:STSCPanel.jpg|thumb|right|''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'' was the first Shuttle to fly with a [[glass cockpit]], on [[STS-101]].]]\n\nThe flight deck was the top level of the crew compartment, and contained the flight controls for the orbiter. The commander sat in the front left seat, and the pilot sat in the front right seat, with two to four additional seats set up for additional crew members. The instrument panels contained over 2,100 displays and controls, and the commander and pilot were both equipped with a [[heads-up display]] (HUD) and a [[Joystick#Electronic joysticks|Rotational Hand Controller]] (RHC) to [[gimbal]] the engines during powered flight and fly the orbiter during unpowered flight. Both seats also had [[rudder]] controls, to allow rudder movement in flight and nose-wheel steering on the ground. The orbiter vehicles were originally installed with the Multifunction [[Cathode-ray tube|CRT]] Display System (MCDS) to display and control flight information. The MCDS displayed the flight information at the commander and pilot seats, as well as at the after seating location, and also controlled the data on the HUD. In 1998, ''Atlantis'' was upgraded with the Multifunction Electronic Display System (MEDS), which was a [[glass cockpit]] upgrade to the flight instruments that replaced the eight MCDS display units with 11 multifunction colored digital screens. MEDS was flown for the first time in May 2000 on [[STS-98]], and the other orbiter vehicles were upgraded to it. The aft section of the flight decked contained windows looking into the payload bay, as well as an RHC to control the [[Remote Manipulator System]] during cargo operations. Additionally, the aft flight deck had monitors for a [[closed-circuit television]] to view the cargo bay.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|369\u2013376}}\n\nThe mid-deck was located underneath the flight deck. It contained the crew equipment storage, as well as the sleeping and hygiene stations for the crew. The mid-deck contained seats for three crewmembers (''Columbia'''s mid-deck could seat four) during launch and landing procedures. The crew typically slept on the mid-deck, which also housed the galley, medical equipment, bathroom, and exercise equipment. The mid-deck contained modular lockers to store equipment that could be scaled depending on the needs of the crew, as well as permanently installed floor compartments. The mid-deck contained a port-side hatch that crew used for entry and exit while on Earth. Additionally, each orbiter was originally installed with an internal airlock in the mid-deck. The internal airlock was replaced with an external airlock in the payload bay on ''Discovery'', ''Atlantis'', and ''Endeavour'' to improve docking with [[Mir]] and the [[ISS]], along with the [[Orbiter Docking System]].<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|377\u2013381}}<ref name=\"jenkins2016\">{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first= Dennis R. |title= Space Shuttle: Developing an Icon - 1972-2013 |publisher= Specialty Press |date= 2016}}</ref>{{rp|II\u201326\u201333}}\n\n====Flight systems====\nThe orbiter was equipped with an [[avionics]] system to provide information and control during atmospheric flight. Its avionics suite contained three [[microwave scanning beam landing system]]s, three [[gyroscope]]s, three [[Tactical air navigation system|TACAN]]s, three [[accelerometer]]s, two [[radar altimeter]]s, two [[barometric altimeter]]s, three [[attitude indicator]]s, two [[Machmeter|Mach indicator]]s, and two [[Aviation transponder interrogation modes|Mode C]] [[Transponder (aeronautics)|transponders]]. During reentry, the crew deployed two [[Air data boom|air data probes]] once they were travelling slower than Mach 5. The orbiter had three [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measuring units]] (IMU) that it used for guidance and navigation during all phases of flight. The orbiter contains two [[star tracker]]s to align the IMUs while in orbit. The star trackers are deployed while in orbit, and can automatically or manually align on a star. In 1991, NASA began upgrading the inertial measurement units with an [[inertial navigation system]] (INS), which provided more accurate location information. In 1993, NASA flew a [[GPS]] receiver for the first time aboard [[STS-51]]. In 1997, Honeywell began developing an integrated GPS/INS to replace the IMU, INS, and TACAN systems, which first flew on [[STS-118]] in August 2007<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|402\u2013403}}<ref name=\"shuttle_gps_dev\">{{cite web |last= Goodman |first= John L. |title= Space Shuttle Navigation in the GPS Era |work= ION National Technical Meeting |publisher= [[United Launch Alliance]] |date= 2000 |url= https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100039589.pdf |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref><ref name=\"sts188_gps\">{{cite web |last= Harwood |first= William |title= Mission preview: A flight for education and the station |publisher= Spaceflight Now |date= August 6, 2007 |url= https://spaceflightnow.com/shuttle/sts118/070806preview/ |accessdate= July 8, 2019}}</ref>\n\nWhile in orbit, the crew primarily communicated using one of four [[S-band]] radios, which provided both voice and data communications. Two of the S band radios were [[phase modulation]] [[transceiver]]s, and could transmit and receive information. The other two S band radios were [[frequency modulation]] [[transmitter]]s, and were used to transmit data to NASA. As S band radios can operate only within their [[Line-of-sight propagation|line of sight]], NASA used the [[Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System]] and the [[Spacecraft Tracking and Data Acquisition Network]] ground stations to communicate with the orbiter throughout its orbit. Additionally, the orbiter deployed a high-bandwidth [[Ku band|K<sub>u</sub>-band]] radio out of the cargo bay, which could also utilized as a rendezvous radar. The orbiter was also equipped with two [[UHF]] radios for communications with [[air traffic control]] and astronauts conducting EVA.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|403\u2013404}}\n[[File:Space Shuttle General Purpose Computer.jpg|thumb|right|AP-101S (left) and AP-101B general purpose computers]]\n\nAlthough the orbiter could not be flown without a crew, its [[fly-by-wire]] control system was entirely reliant on its main computer, the Data Processing System (DPS). The DPS controlled the flight controls and thrusters on the orbiter vehicle, as well as the ET and SRBs during launch. The DPS consisted of five general purpose computers (GPC), two magnetic tape mass memory units (MMUs), and the associated sensors to monitors the Space Shuttle components. The original GPC used was the IBM [[IBM System/4 Pi#AP-101|AP-101B]], which used a separate [[central processing unit]] (CPU) and inputer/output processor (IOP), and [[non-volatile memory|non-volatile]] [[Solid-state drive|solid-state memory]]. From 1991 to 1993, the orbiter vehicles were upgraded to the AP-101S, which improved the memory and processing capabilities, and reduced the volume and weight of the computers by combining the CPU and IOP into a single unit. Four of the GPCs were loaded with the Primary Avionics Software System (PASS), which was Space Shuttle-specific software that provided control through all phases of flight. During ascent, maneuvring, reentry, and landing, the four PASS GPCs functioned identically to produce quadruple redundancy, and would error check their results. In case of a software error that would cause erroneous reports from the four PASS GPCs, a fifth GPC ran the Backup Flight System, which used a different program and could control the Space Shuttle through ascent, orbit, and reentry, but could not support an entire mission. The five GPCs were separated in three separate bays within the mid-deck to provide redundancy in the event of a cooling fan failure. After achieving orbit, the crew would switch some of the GPCs functions from guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) to systems management (SM) and payload (PL) to support the operational mission.<ref name=jenkins />{{rp|232\u2013233, 403\u2013408}}<ref name=\"LogicD\">{{cite web |publisher=NASA Office of Logic Design |url=http://www.klabs.org/mapld06/abstracts/139_ferguson_a.html |title=Implementing Space Shuttle Data Processing System Concepts in Programmable Logic Devices |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |author=Ferguson, Roscoe C. |author2=Robert Tate |author3=Hiram C.

The Shuttle was originally conceived of and presented to the public as a \"Space Truck\", which would, among other things, be used to build a United States space station in [[low Earth orbit]] in the early 1990s. When the U.S. space station evolved into the International Space Station project, which suffered from long delays and design changes before it could be completed, the retirement of the Space Shuttle was delayed several times until 2011, serving at least 15 years longer than originally planned.

At the [[University of Glasgow]] he did important work in the [[mathematical analysis]] of electricity and formulation of the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]], and did much to unify the emerging discipline of [[physics]] in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor [[Hugh Blackburn]] in his work. He also had a career as an [[electric telegraph]] engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1866 by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the [[mariner's compass]], which previously had limited reliability.\n\nAbsolute temperatures are stated in units of [[kelvin]] in his honour. While the existence of a lower limit to temperature ([[absolute zero]]) was known prior to his work, Kelvin is known for determining its correct value as approximately \u2212273.15 degree [[Celsius]] or \u2212459.67 degree [[Fahrenheit]].\n\nHe was [[ennobled]] in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]],<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/158/1/011001 Kelvin and Ireland] Raymond Flood, Mark McCartney and Andrew Whitaker (2009) ''J.

He was the first British scientist to be elevated to the [[House of Lords]]. The title refers to the [[River Kelvin]], which flows near his laboratory at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His home was the red sandstone mansion Netherhall, in Largs. Despite offers of elevated posts from several world-renowned universities, Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining professor of [[Physics|Natural Philosophy]] for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement from that post. The [[Hunterian Museum]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] has a permanent exhibition on the work of Kelvin including many of his original papers, instruments, and other artifacts, such as his smoking pipe.\n\nActive in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by [[George Eastman]] to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman [[Kodak]].<ref> {{cite journal | last1 = Trainer | first1 = Matthew | year = 2008 | title = Lord Kelvin, Recipient of The John Fritz Medal in 1905 | url = https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00016-007-0344-4 | journal = Physics in Perspective | volume = 10 | issue = | pages = 212\u2013223 | doi = 10.1007/s00016-007-0344-4 }}</ref>\n\n==Early life and work==\n===Family===\n[[File:Thomson family lineage.png|330px|right|thumb|Thomson family tree: [[James Thomson (mathematician)]], [[James Thomson (engineer)]], and William Thomson, were all professors at [[Glasgow University]]; the later two, through their association with [[William Rankine]], another Glasgow professor, worked to form one of the founding schools of [[thermodynamics]].]]\nWilliam Thomson's father, [[James Thomson (mathematician)|James Thomson]], was a teacher of mathematics and engineering at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] and the son of a farmer. James Thomson married Margaret Gardner in 1817 and, of their children, four boys and two girls survived infancy. Margaret Thomson died in 1830 when William was six years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Thomson_James.html |title=Biography of William Thomson's father |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWilliam and his elder brother [[James Thomson (engineer)|James]] were tutored at home by their father while the younger boys were tutored by their elder sisters. James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father's encouragement, affection and financial support and was prepared for a career in engineering.\n\nIn 1832, his father was appointed professor of mathematics at Glasgow and the family moved there in October 1833. The Thomson children were introduced to a broader cosmopolitan experience than their father's rural upbringing, spending mid-1839 in London and the boys were tutored in French in Paris. Much of Thomson's life during the mid-1840's was spent in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Language study was given a high priority.\n\nHis sister, Anna Thomson, was the mother of [[James Thomson Bottomley]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (1845-1926).<ref>[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1783\u20132002]</ref>\n\n===Youth===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}<!--first 3 paragraphs are not cited-->\nThomson had heart problems and nearly died when he was 9 years old. He attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]], where his father was a professor in the university department, before beginning study at Glasgow University in 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any precociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age.\n\nIn school, Thomson showed a keen interest in the classics along with his natural interest in the sciences. At the age of 12 he won a prize for translating [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''Dialogues of the Gods'' from [[Latin]] to English.\n\nIn the academic year 1839/1840, Thomson won the class prize in [[astronomy]] for his ''Essay on the figure of the Earth'' which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity. His physics tutor at this time was his namesake, [[David Thomson (physicist)|David Thomson]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/npmuseum/article/Profs/ThomsonUni.shtml |title = David Thomson Aberdeen University}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategy during times of personal [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. On the title page of this essay Thomson wrote the following lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Essay on Man]]''. These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:\n\n{{quote|\nGo, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides; <br />\nGo measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; <br />\nInstruct the planets in what orbs to run, <br />\nCorrect old Time, and regulate the sun;  }}\n\nThomson became intrigued with [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier's]] ''Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur'' and committed himself to study the \"Continental\" mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Unsurprisingly, Fourier's work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, [[Philip Kelland]] authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published [[scientific paper]]<ref>{{cite journal | author=P.Q.R. | year = 1841 | title = On Fourier's expansions of functions in trigonometric series | url = | journal = Cambridge Mathematical Journal | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 258\u2013262 }}</ref> under the pseudonym ''P.Q.R.'', defending Fourier, and submitted to the ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' by his father.

While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and [[sculling]], winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbcf.org/history/timeline.php |title=Peterhouse Boat Club Fund \u2013 Timeline |publisher=Pbcf.org |accessdate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004103813/http://www.pbcf.org/history/timeline.php |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of [[mathematics]], physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination. In 1845 Thomson graduated as [[Second Wrangler]].<ref>{{acad|id=THN841W|name=Thomson, William}}</ref> He also won the First [[Smith's Prize]],\nwhich, unlike the [[tripos]], is a test of original research. [[Robert Leslie Ellis]], one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner \"You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.\"<ref>Thompson (1910) vol. 1, p. 98</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of [[Michael Faraday]]'s idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or \"dielectric\", and not by some incomprehensible \"action at a distance\". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the [[Faraday effect]], which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related.\n\nHe was elected a fellow of St. Peter's (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845.<ref name=\"physicsworld\">{{cite news|first=Mark|last=McCartney|title=William Thomson: king of Victorian physics|work=[[Physics World]]|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/16484|date=1 December 2002|accessdate=16 July 2008}}</ref> On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated [[Henri Victor Regnault]], at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the [[Professor of Natural Philosophy, Glasgow|chair of natural philosophy]] in the [[University of Glasgow]]. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student a few years before.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nBy 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] annual meeting in [[Oxford]]. At that meeting, he heard [[James Prescott Joule]] making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the [[caloric theory]] of heat and the theory of the [[heat engine]] built upon it by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[\u00c9mile Clapeyron]]. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and [[mechanical work]] and for their mechanical equivalence.\n\nThomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron school. He predicted that the [[melting point]] of ice must fall with [[pressure]], otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a ''[[perpetual motion|perpetuum mobile]]''. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.\n\nIn 1848, he extended the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the [[gas thermometer]] provided only an [[operational definition]] of temperature. He proposed an ''[[absolute temperature]] scale''<ref>Chang (2004), Ch.4</ref> in which ''a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature ''T''\u00b0 of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (''T''\u22121)\u00b0, would give out the same mechanical effect ''[work]'', whatever be the number'' T''.'' Such a scale would be ''quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.''<ref>Thomson, W. (1848) \"On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol. 1, ''pp'' 100\u2013106</ref> By employing such a \"waterfall\", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of ''[[absolute zero]]'' about which [[Guillaume Amontons]] had speculated in 1702. \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat\", published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used \u2212267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature. Thomson used data published by Regnault to [[calibration|calibrate]] his scale against established measurements.\n\nIn his publication, Thomson wrote:\n\n{{Quotation|... The conversion of heat (or ''caloric'') into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered}}\n\n\u2014 But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's ''very remarkable discoveries''. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views.\n\nThomson returned to critique Carnot's original publication and read his analysis to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in January 1849,<ref>\u2014 (1949) \"An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat; with Numerical Results deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.1, ''pp'' 113\u2013155</ref> still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. He was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In Carnot's theory, lost heat was ''absolutely lost'' but Thomson contended that it was \"''lost to man'' irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world\". Moreover, his [[theology|theological]] beliefs led to speculation about the [[heat death of the universe]].\n\n{{Quotation|I believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on \u2013 I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing ''[[vis viva]]'' which is converted into heat; and that although some ''vis viva'' may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be ''precisely'' compensated and I think it probable that it is under-compensated.<ref name=\"Sharlin 1979\">Sharlin (1979), ''p.''112</ref>}}\n\nCompensation would require ''a creative act or an act possessing similar power''.<ref name=\"Sharlin 1979\"/>\n\nIn final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared \"the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.\"<ref>Thomson, W. (1851) \"On the dynamical theory of heat; with numerical results deduced from Mr. Joule's equivalent of a thermal unit and M.

(1851) ''p.''183</ref>\n\nAs soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]], sometimes called the Kelvin\u2013Joule effect, and the published results<ref>Thomson, W. (1856) \"On the thermal effects of fluids in motion\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.1, ''pp'' 333\u2013455</ref> did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].\n\nThomson published more than 650 scientific papers<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314541/William-Thomson-Baron-Kelvin |title=William Thomson, Baron Kelvin (Scottish engineer, mathematician, and physicist) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=1907-12-17 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref> and applied for 70 patents (not all were issued). Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following:\n\n{{Quotation|In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it.  I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of ''science'', whatever the matter may be.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=W.|title=Popular Lectures and Addresses, Vol. I|year=1891|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|page=80|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JcMKAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>  }}\n\n==Transatlantic cable==\n===Calculations on data rate===\n{{hatnote|To understand the technical issues in which Thomson became involved, see [[Submarine communications cable#Bandwidth problems|Submarine communications cable: Bandwidth problems]].}}\nThough now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of [[Walter Crum]];<ref>{{ODNBweb|id=36507|title=Thomson, William|first=Crosbie|last=Smith}}</ref> but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, [[George Gabriel Stokes]] wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of [[Michael Faraday]] on the proposed [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].\n\nFaraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent \u2013 in modern terms, the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month.<ref>Thomson, W. (1854) \"On the theory of the electric telegraph\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''61</ref> He expressed his results in terms of the [[data signalling rate|data rate]] that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential [[revenue]] of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis,<ref>Thomson, W. (1855) \"On the peristaltic induction of electric currents in submarine telegraph wires\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''87</ref> Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its [[profit (accounting)|profit]]ability.\n\nThomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by [[Wildman Whitehouse]], the [[electrician]] of the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]]. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible\".\n\nThomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' magazine,<ref>Thomson, W. (1855) \"Letters on telegraph to America\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''92</ref> pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger [[conductor (material)|conductor]] with a larger [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of [[Electrical insulation|insulation]]. He thought Whitehouse no fool, and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had attracted the attention of the project's undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.\n\n===Scientist to engineer===\nThomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir [[Charles Tilston Bright]] as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the [[specification]], supported by Faraday and [[Samuel F. B. Morse]].\n\n[[File:Sir William Thomson's telegraphic syphon recorder.jpg|thumb|upright|William Thomson's telegraphic syphon recorder, on display at Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, in January 2019.]]\n\nThomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship {{HMS|Agamemnon|1852|6}} in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after {{convert|380|mi|km}} when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the ''Engineer'' the whole theory of the [[stress (physics)|stress]]es involved in the laying of a submarine [[Submarine communications cable|cable]], and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.<ref>Thomson, W. (1857) ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''154</ref>\n\nThomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a [[character (computing)|character]] every 3.5&nbsp;seconds. He patented the key elements of his system, the [[mirror galvanometer]] and the [[siphon recorder]], in 1858.\n\nWhitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson's many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.<ref>Sharlin (1979) ''p.''141</ref>\n\nThe board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the ''Agamemnon'' had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, [[Cyrus West Field]] and [[Curtis M. Lampson]] argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work. A cable was completed on 5 August.\n\n===Disaster and triumph===\nThomson's fears were realized when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000&nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigor.<ref>Sharlin (1979) ''p.''144</ref>\n\nA joint committee of inquiry was established by the [[Board of Trade]] and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse.<ref>\"Board of Trade Committee to Inquire into \u2026 Submarine Telegraph Cables\u2019, Parl. papers (1860), 52.591, no. 2744</ref> The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.<ref>\"Report of the Scientific Committee Appointed to Consider the Best Form of Cable for Submersion Between Europe and America\" (1863)</ref>\n\nIn July 1865, Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the {{SS|Great Eastern}} but the voyage was dogged by technical problems. The cable was lost after {{convert|1200|mi|km}} had been laid and the project was abandoned. A further attempt in 1866 laid a new cable in two weeks , and then recovered and completed the 1865 cable. The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was [[knighted]] on 10 November 1866.\n\nTo exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson now entered into a partnership with [[C.F. Varley]] and [[Fleeming Jenkin]]. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an [[automatic curb sender]], a kind of [[telegraph key]] for sending messages on a cable.\n\n===Later expeditions===\nThomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic [[submarine communications cable]] of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student [[James Alfred Ewing]]. He was present at the laying of the [[Bel\u00e9m|Par\u00e1]] to [[Pernambuco]] section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873.\n\nThomson's wife died on 17 June 1870, and he resolved to make changes in his life. Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126&nbsp;ton [[schooner]], the ''Lalla Rookh''<ref>{{cite book |author=Alan Gurney |date=17 August 2005 |chapter=Chapter 19: Thomson's Compass and Binnacle |title=Compass: A Story of Exploration and Innovation |publisher=W.

His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the board of enquiry into the sinking of {{HMS|Captain|1869|6}}.\n\nIn June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the ''Hooper'', bound for [[Lisbon]] with {{convert|2500|mi|km|-1}} of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in [[Madeira]] followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the ''Lalla Rookh''. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence \"Will you marry me?\" and Fanny signalled back \"Yes\". Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on 24 June 1874.\n\n==Other contributions==\n===Thomson and Tait: ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy''===\n{{Main|Treatise on Natural Philosophy}}\nOver the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on a [[text book]] that founded the study of [[mechanics]] first on the mathematics of [[kinematics]], the description of motion without regard to [[force]]. The text developed [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] in various areas but with constant attention to [[energy]] as a unifying principle.\n\nA second edition appeared in 1879, expanded to two separately bound parts. The textbook set a standard for early education in [[mathematical physics]].\n\n===Kelvin's vortex theory of the atom===\n{{main|Vortex theory of the atom}}\n\nBetween 1870 and 1890 the vortex atom theory, which purported that an [[atom]] was a [[vortex]] in the [[luminiferous aether|aether]], was popular among British physicists and mathematicians. Thomson pioneered the theory, which was distinct from the seventeenth century vortex theory of [[Descartes]] in that Thomson was thinking in terms of a unitary continuum theory, whereas Descartes was thinking in terms of three different types of matter, each relating respectively to emission, transmission, and reflection of light.<ref name=\"Kragh\">{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=Helge |title=The Vortex Atom: A Victorian Theory of Everything |journal=Centaurus |date=2002 |volume=44 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=32\u2013114 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4084776 |accessdate=9 March 2019 |language=en |issn=0008-8994|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0498.2002.440102.x }}</ref> About 60 scientific papers were written by approximately 25 scientists.

The wire glides so easily to the bottom that \"flying soundings\" can be taken while the ship is at full speed. A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson.\n\nAbout the same time he revived the [[Sumner method]] of finding a ship's position, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application. In 1876, he constructed a harmonic analyzer, in which an assembly of disks were used to sum trigonometric series and thus to [[Tide-predicting machine|predict tides]]. Kelvin mentioned that a similar device could be built to solve differential equations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1107 1107]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1107}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable [[compass]] to correct errors arising from [[magnetic deviation]] owing to the increased use of iron in [[naval architecture]]. Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction. The deviation due to the ship's magnetism was corrected by movable iron masses at the [[binnacle]]. Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles identified by [[George Biddell Airy]] and others, but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by [[The Admiralty]].\n\n[[File:Sir Lord Kelvin Mariner's Compass with Sun Dial.jpg|thumb|right|Kelvin Mariner's Compass]]\n\n{{quotation | Scientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind. Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other hand, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors'.\n<br>\nThe truth, inevitably, seems to lie somewhere between the two extremes.<ref>Lindley (2004), ''p.''259</ref> }}\n\n[[Charles Babbage]] had been among the first to suggest that a [[lighthouse]] might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light, but Thomson pointed out the merits of the [[Morse code]] for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes.\n\n===Electrical standards===\nThomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of [[William Snow Harris]] were in accordance with the laws of [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]]. In the ''Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences'' for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring [[electrometer]], based on the old electroscope of [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]] and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the [[current balance]], also known as the ''Kelvin balance'' or ''Ampere balance'' (''SiC''), for the [[accuracy and precision|precise]] specification of the [[ampere]], the [[standardisation|standard]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[electric current]]. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer [[Magnus Maclean]] [[FRSE]] in his electrical experiments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maclean, Magnus, 1857-1937, electrical engineer |url=http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/maclean-magnus-1857-1937-electrical-engineer |website=University of Strathclyde Archives |accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the [[Niagara Falls]] [[power station]]. Despite his belief in the superiority of [[direct current]] [[electric power transmission]], he endorsed Westinghouse's [[alternating current]] system which had been demonstrated at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of that year. Even after Niagara Falls Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system.<ref>David Lindley, ''Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy'', page 293</ref>\n\nAcknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] elected Thomson as its first President at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26\u201327 June 1906. \"On the proposal of the President [Mr Alexander Siemens, Great Britain], secounded [sic] by Mr Mailloux [US Institute of Electrical Engineers] the Right Honorable Lord Kelvin, [[G.C.V.O.]], [[Order of Merit|O.M.]], was unanimously elected first President of the Commission\", minutes of the Preliminary Meeting Report read.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/pdf/IEC_Founding_Meeting_Report_1906.pdf | title=1906 Preliminary Meeting Report, pp 46-48 | website=The minutes from our first meeting | author=IEC | accessdate=21 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Age of the Earth: geology===\n[[File:Lord Kelvin Vanity Fair 1897-04-29.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Kelvin caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1897]]\n\nKelvin estimated of the [[age of the Earth]]. Given his youthful work on the figure of the Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate the Earth's cooling and to make historical inferences of the Earth's age from his calculations. Thomson was a [[creationism|creationist]] in a broad sense, but he was not a '[[flood geology|flood geologist]]'<ref>Sharlin (1979) ''p.''169</ref> (a view that had [[Flood geology#Criticisms and retractions: the downfall of Diluvialism|lost mainstream scientific support]] by the 1840s{{sfn|Imbrie|Imbrie|1986|p=40}}{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=99}}). He contended that the [[laws of thermodynamics]] operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] and other structures, followed by a gradual \"heat death\". He developed the view that the Earth had once been too hot to support life and contrasted this view with that of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past.

The study group included Michelson and Morley who subsequently performed the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] that undercut the aether theory. Thomson did not provide a text but [[A. S. Hathaway]] took notes and duplicated them with a [[Mimeograph#Papyrograph|Papyrograph]]. As the subject matter was under active development, Thomson amended that text and in 1904 it was typeset and published. Thomson's attempts to provide mechanical models ultimately failed in the electromagnetic regime.\n\nOn 27 April 1900 he gave a widely reported lecture titled ''Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light'' to the [[Royal Institution]].<ref>\"Lord Kelvin, Nineteenth Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light\", reproduced in ''Notices of the Proceedings at the Meetings of the Members of the Royal Institution of Great Britain with Abstracts of the Discourses'', Volume 16, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvoAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA363 p. 363\u2013397]</ref><ref>''[[w:Philosophical Magazine|The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science]]'', Series 6, volume 2, pages 1\u201340 (1901)</ref> The two \"dark clouds\" he was alluding to were confusion surrounding how matter moves through the aether (including the puzzling results of the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]) and indications that the [[equipartition theorem|Law of Equipartition]] in statistical mechanics might break down. Two major physical theories were developed during the twentieth century starting from these issues: for the former, the [[theory of relativity]]; for the second, [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Albert Einstein]], in 1905, published the so-called \"[[Annus Mirabilis papers]]\", one of which explained the [[photoelectric effect]], based on Max Planck's discovery of energy quanta which was the foundation of quantum mechanics, another of which described [[special relativity]], and the last of which explained [[Brownian motion]] in terms of [[statistical mechanics]], providing a strong argument for the existence of atoms.\n\n===Pronouncements later proven to be false===<!--do not change this to \"proved\" because that breaks the link in many articles and because it's old-fashioned prescriptivism and an [[MOS:ENGVAR]] issue - see also https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prove-->\nLike many scientists, Thomson made some mistakes in predicting the future of technology.\n\nHis biographer Silvanus P. Thompson writes that \"When [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen]]'s discovery of the X-rays was announced at the end of 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax.

I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made\"<ref>''The life of William Thomson, baron Kelvin of Largs'', [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwillthom02thomrich/lifeofwillthom02thomrich_djvu.txt vol2], \"Views and Opinions\"</ref> He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896.<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=6002 The Royal Society, London]</ref> (See also [[N rays]].)\n\nHis forecast for practical [[aviation]] (i.e., heavier-than-air [[aircraft]]) was negative.

At the [[University of Glasgow]] he did important work in the [[mathematical analysis]] of electricity and formulation of the first and second [[laws of thermodynamics]], and did much to unify the emerging discipline of [[physics]] in its modern form. He worked closely with mathematics professor [[Hugh Blackburn]] in his work. He also had a career as an [[electric telegraph]] engineer and inventor, which propelled him into the public eye and ensured his wealth, fame and honour. For his work on the transatlantic telegraph project he was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in 1866 by [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]], becoming Sir William Thomson. He had extensive maritime interests and was most noted for his work on the [[mariner's compass]], which previously had limited reliability.\n\nAbsolute temperatures are stated in units of [[kelvin]] in his honour. While the existence of a lower limit to temperature ([[absolute zero]]) was known prior to his work, Kelvin is known for determining its correct value as approximately \u2212273.15 degree [[Celsius]] or \u2212459.67 degree [[Fahrenheit]].\n\nHe was [[ennobled]] in 1892 in recognition of his achievements in thermodynamics, and of his opposition to [[Irish Home Rule movement|Irish Home Rule]],<ref>[http://iopscience.iop.org/1742-6596/158/1/011001 Kelvin and Ireland] Raymond Flood, Mark McCartney and Andrew Whitaker (2009) ''J.

He was the first British scientist to be elevated to the [[House of Lords]]. The title refers to the [[River Kelvin]], which flows near his laboratory at the [[University of Glasgow]]. His home was the red sandstone mansion Netherhall, in Largs. Despite offers of elevated posts from several world-renowned universities, Kelvin refused to leave Glasgow, remaining professor of [[Physics|Natural Philosophy]] for over 50 years, until his eventual retirement from that post. The [[Hunterian Museum]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] has a permanent exhibition on the work of Kelvin including many of his original papers, instruments, and other artifacts, such as his smoking pipe.\n\nActive in industrial research and development, he was recruited around 1899 by [[George Eastman]] to serve as vice-chairman of the board of the British company Kodak Limited, affiliated with Eastman [[Kodak]].<ref>[https://doi.org/10.1007%2Fs00016-007-0344-4 Lord Kelvin, Recipient of The John Fritz Medal in 1905] Matthew Trainer, ''Physics in Perspective'', (2008) 10, 212\u2013223</ref>\n\n==Early life and work==\n===Family===\n[[File:Thomson family lineage.png|330px|right|thumb|Thomson family tree: [[James Thomson (mathematician)]], [[James Thomson (engineer)]], and William Thomson, were all professors at [[Glasgow University]]; the later two, through their association with [[William Rankine]], another Glasgow professor, worked to form one of the founding schools of [[thermodynamics]].]]\nWilliam Thomson's father, [[James Thomson (mathematician)|James Thomson]], was a teacher of mathematics and engineering at the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]] and the son of a farmer. James Thomson married Margaret Gardner in 1817 and, of their children, four boys and two girls survived infancy. Margaret Thomson died in 1830 when William was six years old.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/~history/Biographies/Thomson_James.html |title=Biography of William Thomson's father |publisher=Groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk |accessdate=29 October 2011}}</ref>\n\nWilliam and his elder brother [[James Thomson (engineer)|James]] were tutored at home by their father while the younger boys were tutored by their elder sisters. James was intended to benefit from the major share of his father's encouragement, affection and financial support and was prepared for a career in engineering.\n\nIn 1832, his father was appointed professor of mathematics at Glasgow and the family moved there in October 1833. The Thomson children were introduced to a broader cosmopolitan experience than their father's rural upbringing, spending mid-1839 in London and the boys were tutored in French in Paris. Much of Thomson's life during the mid-1840's was spent in [[Germany]] and the [[Netherlands]]. Language study was given a high priority.\n\nHis sister, Anna Thomson, was the mother of [[James Thomson Bottomley]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (1845-1926).<ref>[http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf Former Fellows of The Royal Society of Edinburgh, 1783\u20132002]</ref>\n\n===Youth===\n{{more citations needed|section|date=December 2017}}<!--first 3 paragraphs are not cited-->\nThomson had heart problems and nearly died when he was 9 years old. He attended the [[Royal Belfast Academical Institution]], where his father was a professor in the university department, before beginning study at Glasgow University in 1834 at the age of 10, not out of any precociousness; the University provided many of the facilities of an elementary school for able pupils, and this was a typical starting age.\n\nIn school, Thomson showed a keen interest in the classics along with his natural interest in the sciences. At the age of 12 he won a prize for translating [[Lucian of Samosata]]'s ''Dialogues of the Gods'' from [[Latin]] to English.\n\nIn the academic year 1839/1840, Thomson won the class prize in [[astronomy]] for his ''Essay on the figure of the Earth'' which showed an early facility for mathematical analysis and creativity. His physics tutor at this time was his namesake, [[David Thomson (physicist)|David Thomson]].<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://homepages.abdn.ac.uk/npmuseum/article/Profs/ThomsonUni.shtml |title = David Thomson Aberdeen University}}</ref>\n\nThroughout his life, he would work on the problems raised in the essay as a [[coping (psychology)|coping]] strategy during times of personal [[stress (medicine)|stress]]. On the title page of this essay Thomson wrote the following lines from [[Alexander Pope]]'s ''[[Essay on Man]]''. These lines inspired Thomson to understand the natural world using the power and method of science:\n\n{{quote|\nGo, wondrous creature! mount where Science guides; <br />\nGo measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides; <br />\nInstruct the planets in what orbs to run, <br />\nCorrect old Time, and regulate the sun;  }}\n\nThomson became intrigued with [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier's]] ''Th\u00e9orie analytique de la chaleur'' and committed himself to study the \"Continental\" mathematics resisted by a British establishment still working in the shadow of Sir [[Isaac Newton]]. Unsurprisingly, Fourier's work had been attacked by domestic mathematicians, [[Philip Kelland]] authoring a critical book. The book motivated Thomson to write his first published [[scientific paper]]<ref>P.Q.R (1841) \"On Fourier's expansions of functions in trigonometric series\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' '''2''', 258\u2013262</ref> under the pseudonym ''P.Q.R.'', defending Fourier, and submitted to the ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' by his father. A second P.Q.R. paper followed almost immediately.<ref>P.Q.R (1841) \"Note on a passage in Fourier's 'Heat'\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' '''3''', 25\u201327</ref>\n\nWhile on holiday with his family in [[Lamlash]] in 1841, he wrote a third, more substantial, P.Q.R. paper ''On the uniform motion of heat in homogeneous solid bodies, and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity''.<ref>P.Q.R (1842) \"On the uniform motion of heat and its connection with the mathematical theory of electricity\" ''Cambridge Mathematical Journal'' '''3''', 71\u201384</ref> In the paper he made remarkable connections between the mathematical theories of [[heat conduction]] and [[electrostatics]], an [[analogy]] that [[James Clerk Maxwell]] was ultimately to describe as one of the most valuable ''science-forming ideas.''<ref>{{cite book| author=Niven, W.D.

While at Cambridge, Thomson was active in sports, athletics and [[sculling]], winning the Colquhoun Sculls in 1843.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pbcf.org/history/timeline.php |title=Peterhouse Boat Club Fund \u2013 Timeline |publisher=Pbcf.org |accessdate=29 October 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111004103813/http://www.pbcf.org/history/timeline.php |archivedate=4 October 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He also took a lively interest in the classics, music, and literature; but the real love of his intellectual life was the pursuit of science. The study of [[mathematics]], physics, and in particular, of electricity, had captivated his imagination. In 1845 Thomson graduated as [[Second Wrangler]].<ref>{{acad|id=THN841W|name=Thomson, William}}</ref> He also won the First [[Smith's Prize]],\nwhich, unlike the [[tripos]], is a test of original research. [[Robert Leslie Ellis]], one of the examiners, is said to have declared to another examiner \"You and I are just about fit to mend his pens.\"<ref>Thompson (1910) vol. 1, p. 98</ref>\n\nIn 1845, he gave the first mathematical development of [[Michael Faraday]]'s idea that electric induction takes place through an intervening medium, or \"dielectric\", and not by some incomprehensible \"action at a distance\". He also devised the mathematical technique of electrical images, which became a powerful agent in solving problems of electrostatics, the science which deals with the forces between electrically charged bodies at rest. It was partly in response to his encouragement that Faraday undertook the research in September 1845 that led to the discovery of the [[Faraday effect]], which established that light and magnetic (and thus electric) phenomena were related.\n\nHe was elected a fellow of St. Peter's (as Peterhouse was often called at the time) in June 1845.<ref name=\"physicsworld\">{{cite news|first=Mark|last=McCartney|title=William Thomson: king of Victorian physics|work=[[Physics World]]|url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/print/16484|date=1 December 2002|accessdate=16 July 2008}}</ref> On gaining the fellowship, he spent some time in the laboratory of the celebrated [[Henri Victor Regnault]], at Paris; but in 1846 he was appointed to the [[Professor of Natural Philosophy, Glasgow|chair of natural philosophy]] in the [[University of Glasgow]]. At twenty-two he found himself wearing the gown of a professor in one of the oldest Universities in the country, and lecturing to the class of which he was a first year student a few years before.\n\n===Thermodynamics===\nBy 1847, Thomson had already gained a reputation as a precocious and maverick scientist when he attended the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]] annual meeting in [[Oxford]]. At that meeting, he heard [[James Prescott Joule]] making yet another of his, so far, ineffective attempts to discredit the [[caloric theory]] of heat and the theory of the [[heat engine]] built upon it by [[Nicolas L\u00e9onard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[\u00c9mile Clapeyron]]. Joule argued for the mutual convertibility of heat and [[mechanical work]] and for their mechanical equivalence.\n\nThomson was intrigued but sceptical. Though he felt that Joule's results demanded theoretical explanation, he retreated into an even deeper commitment to the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron school. He predicted that the [[melting point]] of ice must fall with [[pressure]], otherwise its expansion on freezing could be exploited in a ''[[perpetual motion|perpetuum mobile]]''. Experimental confirmation in his laboratory did much to bolster his beliefs.\n\nIn 1848, he extended the Carnot\u2013Clapeyron theory further through his dissatisfaction that the [[gas thermometer]] provided only an [[operational definition]] of temperature. He proposed an ''[[absolute temperature]] scale''<ref>Chang (2004), Ch.4</ref> in which ''a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature ''T''\u00b0 of this scale, to a body B at the temperature (''T''\u22121)\u00b0, would give out the same mechanical effect ''[work]'', whatever be the number'' T''.'' Such a scale would be ''quite independent of the physical properties of any specific substance.''<ref>Thomson, W. (1848) \"On an Absolute Thermometric Scale founded on Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat, and calculated from Regnault's observations\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol. 1, ''pp'' 100\u2013106</ref> By employing such a \"waterfall\", Thomson postulated that a point would be reached at which no further heat (caloric) could be transferred, the point of ''[[absolute zero]]'' about which [[Guillaume Amontons]] had speculated in 1702. \"Reflections on the Motive Power of Heat\", published by Carnot in French in 1824, the year of Lord Kelvin's birth, used \u2212267 as an estimate of the absolute zero temperature. Thomson used data published by Regnault to [[calibration|calibrate]] his scale against established measurements.\n\nIn his publication, Thomson wrote:\n\n{{Quotation|... The conversion of heat (or ''caloric'') into mechanical effect is probably impossible, certainly undiscovered}}\n\n\u2014 But a footnote signalled his first doubts about the caloric theory, referring to Joule's ''very remarkable discoveries''. Surprisingly, Thomson did not send Joule a copy of his paper, but when Joule eventually read it he wrote to Thomson on 6 October, claiming that his studies had demonstrated conversion of heat into work but that he was planning further experiments. Thomson replied on 27 October, revealing that he was planning his own experiments and hoping for a reconciliation of their two views.\n\nThomson returned to critique Carnot's original publication and read his analysis to the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in January 1849,<ref>\u2014 (1949) \"An Account of Carnot's Theory of the Motive Power of Heat; with Numerical Results deduced from Regnault's Experiments on Steam\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.1, ''pp'' 113\u2013155</ref> still convinced that the theory was fundamentally sound. However, though Thomson conducted no new experiments, over the next two years he became increasingly dissatisfied with Carnot's theory and convinced of Joule's. In February 1851 he sat down to articulate his new thinking. He was uncertain of how to frame his theory and the paper went through several drafts before he settled on an attempt to reconcile Carnot and Joule. During his rewriting, he seems to have considered ideas that would subsequently give rise to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]. In Carnot's theory, lost heat was ''absolutely lost'' but Thomson contended that it was \"''lost to man'' irrecoverably; but not lost in the material world\". Moreover, his [[theology|theological]] beliefs led to speculation about the [[heat death of the universe]].\n\n{{Quotation|I believe the tendency in the material world is for motion to become diffused, and that as a whole the reverse of concentration is gradually going on \u2013 I believe that no physical action can ever restore the heat emitted from the Sun, and that this source is not inexhaustible; also that the motions of the Earth and other planets are losing ''[[vis viva]]'' which is converted into heat; and that although some ''vis viva'' may be restored for instance to the earth by heat received from the sun, or by other means, that the loss cannot be ''precisely'' compensated and I think it probable that it is under-compensated.<ref name=\"Sharlin 1979\">Sharlin (1979), ''p.''112</ref>}}\n\nCompensation would require ''a creative act or an act possessing similar power''.<ref name=\"Sharlin 1979\"/>\n\nIn final publication, Thomson retreated from a radical departure and declared \"the whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on ... two ... propositions, due respectively to Joule, and to Carnot and Clausius.\"<ref>Thomson, W.

(1851) ''p.''183</ref>\n\nAs soon as Joule read the paper he wrote to Thomson with his comments and questions. Thus began a fruitful, though largely epistolary, collaboration between the two men, Joule conducting experiments, Thomson analysing the results and suggesting further experiments. The collaboration lasted from 1852 to 1856, its discoveries including the [[Joule\u2013Thomson effect]], sometimes called the Kelvin\u2013Joule effect, and the published results<ref>Thomson, W. (1856) \"On the thermal effects of fluids in motion\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.1, ''pp'' 333\u2013455</ref> did much to bring about general acceptance of Joule's work and the [[kinetic theory of gases|kinetic theory]].\n\nThomson published more than 650 scientific papers<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/314541/William-Thomson-Baron-Kelvin |title=William Thomson, Baron Kelvin (Scottish engineer, mathematician, and physicist) - Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |encyclopedia=Britannica.com |date=1907-12-17 |accessdate=2013-09-04}}</ref> and applied for 70 patents (not all were issued). Regarding science, Thomson wrote the following:\n\n{{Quotation|In physical science a first essential step in the direction of learning any subject is to find principles of numerical reckoning and practicable methods for measuring some quality connected with it.  I often say that when you can measure what you are speaking about and express it in numbers you know something about it; but when you cannot measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge is of a meagre and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the stage of ''science'', whatever the matter may be.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thomson|first=W.|title=Popular Lectures and Addresses, Vol. I|year=1891|publisher=MacMillan|location=London|page=80|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=JcMKAAAAIAAJ&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>  }}\n\n==Transatlantic cable==\n===Calculations on data rate===\n{{hatnote|To understand the technical issues in which Thomson became involved, see [[Submarine communications cable#Bandwidth problems|Submarine communications cable: Bandwidth problems]].}}\nThough now eminent in the academic field, Thomson was obscure to the general public. In September 1852, he married childhood sweetheart Margaret Crum, daughter of [[Walter Crum]];<ref>{{ODNBweb|id=36507|title=Thomson, William|first=Crosbie|last=Smith}}</ref> but her health broke down on their honeymoon, and over the next seventeen years, Thomson was distracted by her suffering. On 16 October 1854, [[George Gabriel Stokes]] wrote to Thomson to try to re-interest him in work by asking his opinion on some experiments of [[Michael Faraday]] on the proposed [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].\n\nFaraday had demonstrated how the construction of a cable would limit the rate at which messages could be sent \u2013 in modern terms, the [[bandwidth (computing)|bandwidth]]. Thomson jumped at the problem and published his response that month.<ref>Thomson, W. (1854) \"On the theory of the electric telegraph\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''61</ref> He expressed his results in terms of the [[data signalling rate|data rate]] that could be achieved and the economic consequences in terms of the potential [[revenue]] of the transatlantic undertaking. In a further 1855 analysis,<ref>Thomson, W. (1855) \"On the peristaltic induction of electric currents in submarine telegraph wires\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''87</ref> Thomson stressed the impact that the design of the cable would have on its [[profit (accounting)|profit]]ability.\n\nThomson contended that the signalling speed through a given cable was inversely proportional to the [[square (algebra)|square]] of the length of the cable. Thomson's results were disputed at a meeting of the British Association in 1856 by [[Wildman Whitehouse]], the [[electrician]] of the [[Atlantic Telegraph Company]]. Whitehouse had possibly misinterpreted the results of his own experiments but was doubtless feeling financial pressure as plans for the cable were already well under way. He believed that Thomson's calculations implied that the cable must be \"abandoned as being practically and commercially impossible\".\n\nThomson attacked Whitehouse's contention in a letter to the popular ''[[Athenaeum (British magazine)|Athenaeum]]'' magazine,<ref>Thomson, W. (1855) \"Letters on telegraph to America\" ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''92</ref> pitching himself into the public eye. Thomson recommended a larger [[conductor (material)|conductor]] with a larger [[cross section (geometry)|cross section]] of [[Electrical insulation|insulation]]. He thought Whitehouse no fool, and suspected that he might have the practical skill to make the existing design work. Thomson's work had attracted the attention of the project's undertakers. In December 1856, he was elected to the board of directors of the Atlantic Telegraph Company.\n\n===Scientist to engineer===\nThomson became scientific adviser to a team with Whitehouse as chief electrician and Sir [[Charles Tilston Bright]] as chief engineer but Whitehouse had his way with the [[specification]], supported by Faraday and [[Samuel F. B. Morse]].\n\n[[File:Sir William Thomson's telegraphic syphon recorder.jpg|thumb|upright|William Thomson's telegraphic syphon recorder, on display at Porthcurno Telegraph Museum, in January 2019.]]\n\nThomson sailed on board the cable-laying ship {{HMS|Agamemnon|1852|6}} in August 1857, with Whitehouse confined to land owing to illness, but the voyage ended after {{convert|380|mi|km}} when the cable parted. Thomson contributed to the effort by publishing in the ''Engineer'' the whole theory of the [[stress (physics)|stress]]es involved in the laying of a submarine [[Submarine communications cable|cable]], and showed that when the line is running out of the ship, at a constant speed, in a uniform depth of water, it sinks in a slant or straight incline from the point where it enters the water to that where it touches the bottom.<ref>Thomson, W. (1857) ''Math. and Phys. Papers'' vol.2, ''p.''154</ref>\n\nThomson developed a complete system for operating a submarine telegraph that was capable of sending a [[character (computing)|character]] every 3.5&nbsp;seconds. He patented the key elements of his system, the [[mirror galvanometer]] and the [[siphon recorder]], in 1858.\n\nWhitehouse still felt able to ignore Thomson's many suggestions and proposals. It was not until Thomson convinced the board that using purer copper for replacing the lost section of cable would improve data capacity, that he first made a difference to the execution of the project.<ref>Sharlin (1979) ''p.''141</ref>\n\nThe board insisted that Thomson join the 1858 cable-laying expedition, without any financial compensation, and take an active part in the project. In return, Thomson secured a trial for his mirror galvanometer, which the board had been unenthusiastic about, alongside Whitehouse's equipment. Thomson found the access he was given unsatisfactory and the ''Agamemnon'' had to return home following the disastrous storm of June 1858. In London, the board was about to abandon the project and mitigate their losses by selling the cable. Thomson, [[Cyrus West Field]] and [[Curtis M. Lampson]] argued for another attempt and prevailed, Thomson insisting that the technical problems were tractable. Though employed in an advisory capacity, Thomson had, during the voyages, developed a real engineer's instincts and skill at practical problem-solving under pressure, often taking the lead in dealing with emergencies and being unafraid to assist in manual work. A cable was completed on 5 August.\n\n===Disaster and triumph===\nThomson's fears were realized when Whitehouse's apparatus proved insufficiently sensitive and had to be replaced by Thomson's mirror galvanometer. Whitehouse continued to maintain that it was his equipment that was providing the service and started to engage in desperate measures to remedy some of the problems. He succeeded in fatally damaging the cable by applying 2,000&nbsp;[[Volt|V]]. When the cable failed completely Whitehouse was dismissed, though Thomson objected and was reprimanded by the board for his interference. Thomson subsequently regretted that he had acquiesced too readily to many of Whitehouse's proposals and had not challenged him with sufficient vigor.<ref>Sharlin (1979) ''p.''144</ref>\n\nA joint committee of inquiry was established by the [[Board of Trade]] and the Atlantic Telegraph Company. Most of the blame for the cable's failure was found to rest with Whitehouse.<ref>\"Board of Trade Committee to Inquire into \u2026 Submarine Telegraph Cables\u2019, Parl. papers (1860), 52.591, no. 2744</ref> The committee found that, though underwater cables were notorious in their lack of [[Reliability engineering|reliability]], most of the problems arose from known and avoidable causes. Thomson was appointed one of a five-member committee to recommend a specification for a new cable. The committee reported in October 1863.<ref>\"Report of the Scientific Committee Appointed to Consider the Best Form of Cable for Submersion Between Europe and America\" (1863)</ref>\n\nIn July 1865, Thomson sailed on the cable-laying expedition of the {{SS|Great Eastern}} but the voyage was dogged by technical problems. The cable was lost after {{convert|1200|mi|km}} had been laid and the project was abandoned. A further attempt in 1866 laid a new cable in two weeks , and then recovered and completed the 1865 cable. The enterprise was now feted as a triumph by the public and Thomson enjoyed a large share of the adulation. Thomson, along with the other principals of the project, was [[knighted]] on 10 November 1866.\n\nTo exploit his inventions for signalling on long submarine cables, Thomson now entered into a partnership with [[C.F. Varley]] and [[Fleeming Jenkin]]. In conjunction with the latter, he also devised an [[automatic curb sender]], a kind of [[telegraph key]] for sending messages on a cable.\n\n===Later expeditions===\nThomson took part in the laying of the French Atlantic [[submarine communications cable]] of 1869, and with Jenkin was engineer of the Western and Brazilian and Platino-Brazilian cables, assisted by vacation student [[James Alfred Ewing]]. He was present at the laying of the [[Bel\u00e9m|Par\u00e1]] to [[Pernambuco]] section of the Brazilian coast cables in 1873.\n\nThomson's wife died on 17 June 1870, and he resolved to make changes in his life. Already addicted to seafaring, in September he purchased a 126&nbsp;ton [[schooner]], the ''Lalla Rookh''<ref>{{cite book |author=Alan Gurney |date=17 August 2005 |chapter=Chapter 19: Thomson's Compass and Binnacle |title=Compass: A Story of Exploration and Innovation |publisher=W.

His maritime interests continued in 1871 when he was appointed to the board of enquiry into the sinking of {{HMS|Captain|1869|6}}.\n\nIn June 1873, Thomson and Jenkin were on board the ''Hooper'', bound for [[Lisbon]] with {{convert|2500|mi|km|-1}} of cable when the cable developed a fault. An unscheduled 16-day stop-over in [[Madeira]] followed and Thomson became good friends with Charles R. Blandy and his three daughters. On 2 May 1874 he set sail for Madeira on the ''Lalla Rookh''. As he approached the harbour, he signalled to the Blandy residence \"Will you marry me?\" and Fanny signalled back \"Yes\". Thomson married Fanny, 13 years his junior, on 24 June 1874.\n\n==Other contributions==\n===Thomson and Tait: ''Treatise on Natural Philosophy''===\n{{Main|Treatise on Natural Philosophy}}\nOver the period 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] on a [[text book]] that founded the study of [[mechanics]] first on the mathematics of [[kinematics]], the description of motion without regard to [[force]]. The text developed [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]] in various areas but with constant attention to [[energy]] as a unifying principle.\n\nA second edition appeared in 1879, expanded to two separately bound parts. The textbook set a standard for early education in [[mathematical physics]].\n\n===Kelvin's vortex theory of the atom===\n{{main|Vortex theory of the atom}}\n\nBetween 1870 and 1890 the vortex atom theory, which purported that an [[atom]] was a [[vortex]] in the [[luminiferous aether|aether]], was popular among British physicists and mathematicians. Thomson pioneered the theory, which was distinct from the seventeenth century vortex theory of [[Descartes]] in that Thomson was thinking in terms of a unitary continuum theory, whereas Descartes was thinking in terms of three different types of matter, each relating respectively to emission, transmission, and reflection of light.<ref name=\"Kragh\">{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=Helge |title=The Vortex Atom: A Victorian Theory of Everything |journal=Centaurus |date=2002 |volume=44 |issue=1\u20132 |pages=32\u2013114 |url=https://www.academia.edu/4084776 |accessdate=9 March 2019 |language=en |issn=0008-8994|doi=10.1034/j.1600-0498.2002.440102.x }}</ref> About 60 scientific papers were written by approximately 25 scientists.

The wire glides so easily to the bottom that \"flying soundings\" can be taken while the ship is at full speed. A pressure gauge to register the depth of the sinker was added by Thomson.\n\nAbout the same time he revived the [[Sumner method]] of finding a ship's position, and calculated a set of tables for its ready application. In 1876, he constructed a harmonic analyzer, in which an assembly of disks were used to sum trigonometric series and thus to [[Tide-predicting machine|predict tides]]. Kelvin mentioned that a similar device could be built to solve differential equations.<ref>{{cite book|last=Wolfram|first=Stephen|title=A New Kind of Science|publisher=Wolfram Media, Inc.|year=2002|page=[https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1107 1107]|isbn=978-1-57955-008-0|url=https://archive.org/details/newkindofscience00wolf/page/1107}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 1880s, Thomson worked to perfect the adjustable [[compass]] to correct errors arising from [[magnetic deviation]] owing to the increased use of iron in [[naval architecture]]. Thomson's design was a great improvement on the older instruments, being steadier and less hampered by friction. The deviation due to the ship's magnetism was corrected by movable iron masses at the [[binnacle]]. Thomson's innovations involved much detailed work to develop principles identified by [[George Biddell Airy]] and others, but contributed little in terms of novel physical thinking. Thomson's energetic lobbying and networking proved effective in gaining acceptance of his instrument by [[The Admiralty]].\n\n[[File:Sir Lord Kelvin Mariner's Compass with Sun Dial.jpg|thumb|right|Kelvin Mariner's Compass]]\n\n{{quotation | Scientific biographers of Thomson, if they have paid any attention at all to his compass innovations, have generally taken the matter to be a sorry saga of dim-witted naval administrators resisting marvellous innovations from a superlative scientific mind. Writers sympathetic to the Navy, on the other hand, portray Thomson as a man of undoubted talent and enthusiasm, with some genuine knowledge of the sea, who managed to parlay a handful of modest ideas in compass design into a commercial monopoly for his own manufacturing concern, using his reputation as a bludgeon in the law courts to beat down even small claims of originality from others, and persuading the Admiralty and the law to overlook both the deficiencies of his own design and the virtues of his competitors'.\n<br>\nThe truth, inevitably, seems to lie somewhere between the two extremes.<ref>Lindley (2004), ''p.''259</ref> }}\n\n[[Charles Babbage]] had been among the first to suggest that a [[lighthouse]] might be made to signal a distinctive number by occultations of its light, but Thomson pointed out the merits of the [[Morse code]] for the purpose, and urged that the signals should consist of short and long flashes of the light to represent the dots and dashes.\n\n===Electrical standards===\nThomson did more than any other electrician up to his time in introducing accurate methods and apparatus for measuring electricity. As early as 1845 he pointed out that the experimental results of [[William Snow Harris]] were in accordance with the laws of [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Coulomb]]. In the ''Memoirs of the Roman Academy of Sciences'' for 1857 he published a description of his new divided ring [[electrometer]], based on the old electroscope of [[Johann Gottlieb Friedrich von Bohnenberger]] and he introduced a chain or series of effective instruments, including the quadrant electrometer, which cover the entire field of electrostatic measurement. He invented the [[current balance]], also known as the ''Kelvin balance'' or ''Ampere balance'' (''SiC''), for the [[accuracy and precision|precise]] specification of the [[ampere]], the [[standardisation|standard]] [[Units of measurement|unit]] of [[electric current]]. From around 1880 he was aided by the electrical engineer [[Magnus Maclean]] [[FRSE]] in his electrical experiments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maclean, Magnus, 1857-1937, electrical engineer |url=http://strathclyde.ica-atom.org/maclean-magnus-1857-1937-electrical-engineer |website=University of Strathclyde Archives |accessdate=2018-01-19}}</ref>\n\nIn 1893, Thomson headed an international commission to decide on the design of the [[Niagara Falls]] [[power station]]. Despite his belief in the superiority of [[direct current]] [[electric power transmission]], he endorsed Westinghouse's [[alternating current]] system which had been demonstrated at the [[World's Columbian Exposition|Chicago World's Fair]] of that year. Even after Niagara Falls Thomson still held to his belief that direct current was the superior system.<ref>David Lindley, ''Degrees Kelvin: A Tale of Genius, Invention, and Tragedy'', page 293</ref>\n\nAcknowledging his contribution to electrical standardisation, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] elected Thomson as its first President at its preliminary meeting, held in London on 26\u201327 June 1906. \"On the proposal of the President [Mr Alexander Siemens, Great Britain], secounded [sic] by Mr Mailloux [US Institute of Electrical Engineers] the Right Honorable Lord Kelvin, [[G.C.V.O.]], [[Order of Merit|O.M.]], was unanimously elected first President of the Commission\", minutes of the Preliminary Meeting Report read.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.iec.ch/about/history/documents/pdf/IEC_Founding_Meeting_Report_1906.pdf | title=1906 Preliminary Meeting Report, pp 46-48 | website=The minutes from our first meeting | author=IEC | accessdate=21 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n===Age of the Earth: geology===\n[[File:Lord Kelvin Vanity Fair 1897-04-29.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Kelvin caricatured by [[Leslie Ward|Spy]] for ''[[Vanity Fair (British magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', 1897]]\n\nKelvin estimated of the [[age of the Earth]]. Given his youthful work on the figure of the Earth and his interest in heat conduction, it is no surprise that he chose to investigate the Earth's cooling and to make historical inferences of the Earth's age from his calculations. Thomson was a [[creationism|creationist]] in a broad sense, but he was not a '[[flood geology|flood geologist]]'<ref>Sharlin (1979) ''p.''169</ref> (a view that had [[Flood geology#Criticisms and retractions: the downfall of Diluvialism|lost mainstream scientific support]] by the 1840s{{sfn|Imbrie|Imbrie|1986|p=40}}{{sfn|Young|Stearley|2008|p=99}}). He contended that the [[laws of thermodynamics]] operated from the birth of the universe and envisaged a dynamic process that saw the organisation and evolution of the [[Solar System]] and other structures, followed by a gradual \"heat death\". He developed the view that the Earth had once been too hot to support life and contrasted this view with that of [[uniformitarianism (science)|uniformitarianism]], that conditions had remained constant since the indefinite past.

The discovery in 1903 that [[radioactive decay]] releases heat led to Kelvin's estimate being challenged, and [[Ernest Rutherford]] famously made the argument in a lecture attended by Kelvin that this provided the unknown energy source Kelvin had suggested, but the estimate was not overturned until the development in 1907 of [[radiometric dating]] of rocks.<ref name=\"England et al 2007\"/>\n\nIt was widely believed that the discovery of radioactivity had invalidated Thomson's estimate of the age of the Earth. Thomson himself never publicly acknowledged this because he thought he had a much stronger argument restricting the age of the Sun to no more than 20 million years. Without sunlight, there could be no explanation for the sediment record on the Earth's surface. At the time, the only known source for the solar power output was [[gravitational collapse]]. It was only when [[thermonuclear fusion]] was recognised in the 1930s that Thomson's age paradox was truly resolved.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Stacey|first1=Frank D.|journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]]|volume=105|pages=13155\u201313158|year=2000|issue=B6|doi=10.1029/2000JB900028|title=Kelvin's age of the Earth paradox revisited|bibcode = 2000JGR...10513155S }}</ref>\n\n==Later life and death==\n\n[[File:Lord Kelvin, Botanic park Belfast.jpg|thumb|upright|Statue of Kelvin; [[Belfast Botanic Gardens]]]]\n[[File:The Thomson family grave and memorial, Glasgow Necropolis.jpg|thumb|upright|The grave of the Thomson family, [[Glasgow Necropolis]]]]\nIn the winter of 1860\u20131861 Kelvin slipped on some ice and fractured his leg, causing him to limp thereafter.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Philips|first=Thompson S|title=The Life of William Thomson, Baron Kelvin of Largs}}</ref> He remained something of a celebrity on both sides of the Atlantic until his death.\n\nThomson remained a devout believer in Christianity throughout his life; attendance at chapel was part of his daily routine.<ref>McCartney & Whitaker (2002), reproduced on [http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/15/12/6 Institute of Physics website]</ref> He saw his Christian faith as supporting and informing his scientific work, as is evident from his address to the annual meeting of the [[Christian Evidence Society]],<ref>Thomson, W.

The study group included Michelson and Morley who subsequently performed the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]] that undercut the aether theory. Thomson did not provide a text but [[A. S. Hathaway]] took notes and duplicated them with a [[Mimeograph#Papyrograph|Papyrograph]]. As the subject matter was under active development, Thomson amended that text and in 1904 it was typeset and published. Thomson's attempts to provide mechanical models ultimately failed in the electromagnetic regime.\n\nOn 27 April 1900 he gave a widely reported lecture titled ''Nineteenth-Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light'' to the [[Royal Institution]].<ref>\"Lord Kelvin, Nineteenth Century Clouds over the Dynamical Theory of Heat and Light\", reproduced in ''Notices of the Proceedings at the Meetings of the Members of the Royal Institution of Great Britain with Abstracts of the Discourses'', Volume 16, [https://books.google.com/books?id=YvoAAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA363 p. 363\u2013397]</ref><ref>''[[w:Philosophical Magazine|The London, Edinburgh, and Dublin Philosophical Magazine and Journal of Science]]'', Series 6, volume 2, pages 1\u201340 (1901)</ref> The two \"dark clouds\" he was alluding to were confusion surrounding how matter moves through the aether (including the puzzling results of the [[Michelson\u2013Morley experiment]]) and indications that the [[equipartition theorem|Law of Equipartition]] in statistical mechanics might break down. Two major physical theories were developed during the twentieth century starting from these issues: for the former, the [[theory of relativity]]; for the second, [[quantum mechanics]]. [[Albert Einstein]], in 1905, published the so-called \"[[Annus Mirabilis papers]]\", one of which explained the [[photoelectric effect]], based on Max Planck's discovery of energy quanta which was the foundation of quantum mechanics, another of which described [[special relativity]], and the last of which explained [[Brownian motion]] in terms of [[statistical mechanics]], providing a strong argument for the existence of atoms.\n\n===Pronouncements later proven to be false===<!--do not change this to \"proved\" because that breaks the link in many articles and because it's old-fashioned prescriptivism and an [[MOS:ENGVAR]] issue - see also https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/prove-->\nLike many scientists, Thomson made some mistakes in predicting the future of technology.\n\nHis biographer Silvanus P. Thompson writes that \"When [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen]]'s discovery of the X-rays was announced at the end of 1895, Lord Kelvin was entirely skeptical, and regarded the announcement as a hoax. The papers had been full of the wonders of R\u00f6ntgen's rays, about which Lord Kelvin was intensely skeptical until R\u00f6ntgen himself sent him a copy of his Memoir\"; on 17 January 1896, having read the paper and seen the photographs, he wrote R\u00f6ntgen a letter saying that \"I need not tell you that when I read the paper I was very much astonished and delighted. I can say no more now than to congratulate you warmly on the great discovery you have made\"<ref>''The life of William Thomson, baron Kelvin of Largs'', [https://archive.org/stream/lifeofwillthom02thomrich/lifeofwillthom02thomrich_djvu.txt vol2], \"Views and Opinions\"</ref> He would have his own hand X-rayed in May 1896.<ref>[http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=6002 The Royal Society, London]</ref> (See also [[N rays]].)\n\nHis forecast for practical [[aviation]] (i.e., heavier-than-air [[aircraft]]) was negative. In 1896 he refused an invitation to join the Aeronautical Society, writing that \"I have not the smallest molecule of faith in aerial navigation other than ballooning or of expectation of good results from any of the trials we hear of.\"<ref>[http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/letters.html#baden-powell Letter from Lord Kelvin to Baden Powell] 8 December 1896</ref> And in a 1902 newspaper interview he predicted that \"No balloon and no aeroplane will ever be practically successful.\"<ref>[http://zapatopi.net/kelvin/papers/interview_aeronautics_and_wireless.html Interview] in the ''Newark Advocate'' 26 April 1902</ref>\n\nThe statement \"There is nothing new to be discovered in physics now.
