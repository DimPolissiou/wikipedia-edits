A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as a [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia State Senator]] from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th [[List of governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]] from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in co-founding the [[Carter Center]].\n\nRaised in [[Plains, Georgia]], Carter graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and joined the [[United States Navy]], where he served on [[submarine]]s. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters' peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and support the growing [[civil rights movement]]. He became an activist within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the [[Georgia State Senate]], and in [[1970 Georgia gubernatorial election|1970]], he was elected as [[Governor of Georgia]], defeating former Governor [[Carl Sanders]] in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating [[affirmative action]] for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a [[Dark horse|dark-horse candidate]] who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic presidential nomination]]. In the [[1976 United States presidential election|general election]], Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]]. \n\nOn his second day in office, Carter [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]] all the Vietnam War [[Draft evasion|draft evaders]]. During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], were established. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and the return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent [[stagflation]], a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979\u20131981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the [[Cold War]] when he ended [[d\u00e9tente]], imposed [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|a grain embargo against the Soviets]], enunciated the [[Carter Doctrine]], and led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. Carter lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|general election]] to Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in an electoral landslide. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Polls of historians and political scientists]] usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.\n\nIn 1982, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] charity. He has written [[Bibliography of Jimmy Carter|over 30 books]] ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. The earliest-serving of the five [[Living presidents of the United States|living U.S. presidents]], Carter is the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]], the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|Carter (around age 13) with his dog, Bozo, in 1937]]\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium (now the [[Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]], a hospital where his mother was employed as a registered nurse. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" /> He was the eldest son of [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian]] ({{nee|Gordy}}) and [[James Earl Carter Sr.]] Carter is a descendant of [[English people|English]] immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in [[Virginia]] in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Carter is also a descendant of [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]], an ancestor of [[Cornell University]]'s founder, and is distantly related to [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Bill Gates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html|title=Ancestry of Sen.

They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro-[[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" />\n\n===Education===\nCarter attended the Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Jimmy was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a [[hot rod]]. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian anyway.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\">Bourne, pp. 33\u201343.</ref> Carter's teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\" />\n\n==Naval career==\nCarter had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. The following year, he transferred to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, and he achieved admission to the Naval Academy in 1943. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, the friend of his sister Ruth. The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.<ref>Bourne, pp. 44\u201355.</ref> He was a [[sprint football]] player for the [[Navy Midshipmen]].<ref name=\"hingston20160424\">{{cite news |url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/04/24/princeton-sprint-football-team/ | title=Why This Princeton Football Team Won't Be Suiting Up Next Season |work=Philadelphia | date=April 24, 2016 | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=Hingston, Sandy}}</ref> Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref name=\"annualRegister19461947\">Annual Register of the United States Naval Academy (v. 1946\u20131947), p. 33</ref> From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his deployments in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].<ref name=\"zelizer-11\">Zelizer, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> In 1948, he began officers' training for submarine duty and served aboard {{USS|Pomfret|SS-391|6}}.

However, Carter's father died two months before construction of ''Seawolf'' began, and Carter sought and obtained a release from active duty to enable him to take over the family peanut business. Deciding to leave Schenectady proved difficult. Settling after moving so much, Rosalynn had grown comfortable with their life. Returning to small-town life in Plains seemed \"a monumental step backward,\" she said later. On the other hand, Carter felt restricted by the rigidity of the military and yearned to assume a path more like his father's.

However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in [[public housing]] in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in subsidized housing before he took office. Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult because his first-year harvest failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.

Callaway had just switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1964, and was a very strong candidate, despite being the first Republican to run for Governor of Georgia since 1876.  State Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Carter decided to run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran against the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative segregationist [[Lester Maddox]]. In a press conference he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road.&nbsp;... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"<ref>Bourne, pp. 149\u2013153.</ref> He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a [[two-round system|runoff election]] with Maddox. Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall to the Democratic Party nomination. In the general election, Callaway went on to win a plurality of the vote, but short of a 50 percent majority, state rules empowered the Georgia House of Representatives, which had a Democratic Party majority, to elect Maddox as governor.<ref name=\"bourne-153\" /> The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt.

This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], he declared himself [[Born again]], a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child [[Amy Carter|Amy]] was born during this time, on October 19, 1967.<ref>Bourne, pp. 165\u2013179.</ref><ref>Hayward, pp. 39\u201346.</ref>\n\n[[File:GACountiesGovernor1970.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A map of Georgia counties, almost all of which are medium to dark blue with a small handful of red counties in the north|Results of the 1970 gubernatorial election in Georgia, with blue counties supporting Carter and red ones voting for [[Hal Suit]]: the relative darkness of the shade shows greater support for a candidate.]]\n\nGovernor Maddox was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term as governor, and thus the liberal former governor, [[Carl Sanders]], became Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than before. He positioned himself as a [[populism|populist]], quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him \"Cufflinks Carl\") and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.<ref name=\"bourne-180\">Bourne, pp. 180\u2013199.</ref><ref name=\"hayward-46\">Hayward, pp. 46\u201351.</ref> Throughout the campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the \"Wallace vote,\" after the prominent segregationist [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools, depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.<ref name=\"bourne-180\" /><ref name=\"hayward-46\" />\n\nThat September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff.

Once he was elected, Carter changed his tone, and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics.

Looking toward a potential presidential run, Carter engaged himself in national politics and public appearances. He was named to several southern planning commissions and was a delegate to the [[1972 Democratic National Convention]], where the liberal U.S. Senator [[George McGovern]] was the likely presidential nominee. Carter tried to ingratiate himself with the conservative, anti-McGovern voters, so that the convention would consider him for McGovern's running mate on a compromise ticket. He endorsed Senator [[Henry M. Jackson|Henry \"Scoop\" Jackson]], in part to distance himself from George Wallace. Carter was still fairly obscure at the time, and his attempt at triangulation failed; the [[1972 United States presidential election|1972 Democratic ticket]] went to McGovern and Senator [[Thomas Eagleton]].<ref>Bourne, pp. 221\u2013230.</ref>{{refn|Eagleton was later replaced on the ticket by [[Sargent Shriver]].|group=note}} On August 3, Carter met with Wallace in [[Birmingham, Alabama]] to discuss preventing the Democratic Party from losing in a landslide during the November elections.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=BJbdYPG6LGMC&dat=19720804&printsec=frontpage|title=Carter, Wallace hold election conference|date=August 4, 1972|newspaper=Rome News-Tribune}}</ref>\n\nAfter McGovern's loss in November 1972, Carter began meeting regularly with his fledgling campaign staff.

On [[David Rockefeller]]'s endorsement he was named to the [[Trilateral Commission]] in April 1973.

He used a two-prong strategy: in the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's [[George Wallace]], Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there. He had traveled over {{convert|50000|mi|km|abbr=off|sp=us}}, visited 37 states, and delivered over 200 speeches before any other candidate entered the race.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/carter/player/#v276 |title=Jimmy Carter |series=The American Experience |publisher=Public Broadcasting System}}</ref> Initially dismissed as a regional candidate,<ref>{{cite news |last1=Broder |first1=David |authorlink1=David Broder |title=Early Evaluation Impossible on Presidential Candidates |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=yMgwAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LQIEAAAAIBAJ&pg=7214%2C2087680|accessdate=January 3, 2016 |work=[[Toledo Blade]] |date=December 18, 1974 |page=16}}</ref> Carter proved to be the Democrat with the most effective national strategy, and he clinched the nomination.{{Citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n[[File:Carter and Ford in a debate, September 23, 1976.jpg|thumb|Carter and President [[Gerald Ford]] debating at the [[Walnut Street Theatre]] in [[Philadelphia]]]]\n\nThe national news media discovered and promoted Carter, as Lawrence Shoup noted in his 1980 book ''The Carter Presidency and Beyond'':\n\n{{quote|What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media.

For example, U.S. intelligence closely followed Soviet exercises for an invasion of Iran throughout 1980, while an earlier warning from Carter's national security adviser [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] that \"if the Soviets came to dominate Afghanistan, they could promote a separate [[Baluchistan]]&nbsp;...

The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official [[Robert Gates]], \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\" thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"<ref name=\"Riedel\"/><ref name=\"Gates\">{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Bob |title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007 |isbn=9781416543367 |pp=145\u2013147 |language=en}} When asked whether he expected that the revelations in his memoir (combined with an apocryphal quote attributed to Brzezinski) would inspire \"a mind-bending number of conspiracy theories which adamantly\u2014and wrongly\u2014accuse the Carter Administration of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan,\" Gates replied: \"No, because there was no basis in fact for an allegation the administration tried to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan militarily.\" See Gates, email communication with John Bernell White Jr., October 15, 2011, as cited in {{cite thesis |last=White |first=John Bernell |url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |title=The Strategic Mind Of Zbigniew Brzezinski: How A Native Pole Used Afghanistan To Protect His Homeland |date=May 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |pp=45\u201346, 82 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022857/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |language=en}} cf. {{cite book |authorlink=Steve Coll |last=Coll |first=Steve |title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |year=2004 |isbn=9781594200076 |p=[https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll/page/581 581] |quote=Contemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail.&nbsp;...

This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: \"an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them.\" ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action \"the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=October 21, 2000 |title=Carter Sadly Turns Back On National Baptist Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment.

farmer who served as the 39th [[president of the United States]] from 1977 to 1981. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he previously served as a [[Georgia State Senate|Georgia State Senator]] from 1963 to 1967 and as the 76th [[List of governors of Georgia|governor of Georgia]] from 1971 to 1975. Since leaving the presidency, Carter has remained active in the private sector; in 2002, he was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] for his work in co-founding the [[Carter Center]].\n\nRaised in [[Plains, Georgia]], Carter graduated from the [[United States Naval Academy]] in 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and joined the [[United States Navy]], where he served on [[submarine]]s. After the death of his father in 1953, Carter left his naval career and returned home to Georgia to take up the reins of his family's peanut-growing business. Carter inherited comparatively little due to his father's forgiveness of debts and the division of the estate among the children. Nevertheless, his ambition to expand and grow the Carters' peanut business was fulfilled. During this period, Carter was motivated to oppose the political climate of [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]] and support the growing [[civil rights movement]]. He became an activist within the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. From 1963 to 1967, Carter served in the [[Georgia State Senate]], and in [[1970 Georgia gubernatorial election|1970]], he was elected as [[Governor of Georgia]], defeating former Governor [[Carl Sanders]] in the Democratic primary on an anti-segregation platform advocating [[affirmative action]] for ethnic minorities. Carter remained as governor until 1975. Despite being a [[Dark horse|dark-horse candidate]] who was little known outside of Georgia at the start of the campaign, Carter won the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1976|1976 Democratic presidential nomination]]. In the [[1976 United States presidential election|general election]], Carter ran as an outsider and narrowly defeated incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] President [[Gerald Ford]]. \n\nOn his second day in office, Carter [[Federal pardons in the United States|pardoned]] all the [[Draft evasion|Vietnam War draft evaders]]. During Carter's term as president, two new cabinet-level departments, the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Department of Education|Department of Education]], were established. He established a [[Energy policy of the United States|national energy policy]] that included conservation, price control, and new technology. In foreign affairs, Carter pursued the [[Camp David Accords]], the [[Panama Canal Treaties]], the second round of [[Strategic Arms Limitation Talks]] (SALT II), and the return of the [[Panama Canal Zone]] to Panama. On the economic front, he confronted persistent [[stagflation]], a combination of high inflation, high unemployment and slow growth. The end of his presidential tenure was marked by the 1979\u20131981 [[Iran hostage crisis]], the [[1979 energy crisis]], the [[Three Mile Island nuclear accident]], and the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. In response to the invasion, Carter escalated the [[Cold War]] when he ended [[d\u00e9tente]], imposed [[United States grain embargo against the Soviet Union|a grain embargo against the Soviets]], enunciated the [[Carter Doctrine]], and led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott]] in Moscow. In 1980, Carter faced a challenge from Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] in the primaries, but he won re-nomination at the [[1980 Democratic National Convention]]. Carter lost the [[1980 United States presidential election|general election]] to Republican nominee [[Ronald Reagan]] in an electoral landslide. [[Historical rankings of presidents of the United States|Polls of historians and political scientists]] usually rank Carter as an average president; he often receives more positive evaluations for his post-presidential work.\n\nIn 1982, Carter established the Carter Center to promote and expand human rights. He has traveled extensively to conduct peace negotiations, monitor elections, and advance disease prevention and [[Eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] in developing nations. Carter is considered a key figure in the [[Habitat for Humanity]] charity. He has written [[Bibliography of Jimmy Carter|over 30 books]] ranging from political memoirs to poetry while continuing to actively comment on ongoing American and global affairs, such as the [[Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. The earliest-serving of the five [[Living presidents of the United States|living U.S. presidents]], Carter is the [[List of presidents of the United States by age|longest-lived president]], the longest-retired president, the first to live forty years after their inauguration, and the first to reach the age of 95. \n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Jimmy Carter with his dog Bozo 1937.gif|upright|thumb|Carter (around age 13) with his dog, Bozo, in 1937]]\nJames Earl Carter Jr. was born on October 1, 1924, at the Wise Sanitarium (now the [[Lillian G. Carter Nursing Center]]) in [[Plains, Georgia]], a hospital where his mother was employed as a registered nurse. Carter was the first U.S. president to be born in a hospital.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" /> He was the eldest son of [[Lillian Gordy Carter|Bessie Lillian]] ({{nee|Gordy}}) and [[James Earl Carter Sr.]] Carter is a descendant of [[English people|English]] immigrant Thomas Carter, who settled in [[Virginia]] in 1635. Numerous generations of Carters lived as cotton farmers in Georgia. Carter is also a descendant of [[Thomas Cornell (settler)|Thomas Cornell]], an ancestor of [[Cornell University]]'s founder, and is distantly related to [[Richard Nixon]] and [[Bill Gates]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wargs.com/political/kerry.html|title=Ancestry of Sen.

Carter's father was a successful local businessman, who ran a [[general store]], and was an investor in farmland.<ref name=\"bourne-114\">Bourne, p. 114.</ref> He previously served as a reserve second lieutenant in the U.S. Army's [[Quartermaster Corps (United States Army)|Quartermaster Corps]] during [[World War I]].<ref name=\"bourne-114\">Bourne, p. 114.</ref>\n\nThe family moved several times during Carter Jr.'s infancy.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\">Bourne, pp. 11\u201332.</ref> The Carters settled on a dirt road in nearby [[Archery, Georgia|Archery]], which was almost entirely populated by impoverished [[African American]] families. They eventually had three more children: [[Gloria Carter Spann|Gloria]], [[Ruth Carter Stapleton|Ruth]], and [[Billy Carter|Billy]]. Carter got along well with his parents, although his mother worked long hours and was often absent in his childhood. Although Earl was staunchly pro-[[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]], he allowed his son to befriend the black farmhands' children. Carter was an enterprising teenager who was given his own acre of Earl's farmland where he grew, packaged, and sold peanuts. He also rented out a section of tenant housing that he had purchased.<ref name=\"bourne-11-32\" />\n\n===Education===\nCarter attended the Plains High School from 1937 to 1941. By that time, Archery and Plains had been impoverished by the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], but the family benefited from [[New Deal]] farming subsidies, and Earl took a position as a community leader. Young Jimmy was a diligent student with a fondness for reading. A popular anecdote holds that he was passed over for [[valedictorian]] after he and his friends skipped school to venture downtown in a [[hot rod]]. Carter's truancy was mentioned in a local newspaper, although it is not clear he would have been valedictorian anyway.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\">Bourne, pp. 33\u201343.</ref> Carter's teacher, Julia Coleman, was an especially strong influence. As an adolescent, Carter played on the Plains High School basketball team; he also joined the [[National FFA Organization|Future Farmers of America]] and developed a lifelong interest in woodworking.<ref name=\"bourne-33-43\" />\n\n==Naval career==\nCarter had long dreamed of attending the [[United States Naval Academy|U.S. Naval Academy]]. In 1941, he started undergraduate coursework in engineering at [[Georgia Southwestern College]] in nearby [[Americus, Georgia|Americus]]. The following year, he transferred to the [[Georgia Institute of Technology]] in Atlanta, and he achieved admission to the Naval Academy in 1943. He was a good student but was seen as reserved and quiet, in contrast to the academy's culture of aggressive hazing of freshmen. While at the academy, Carter fell in love with Rosalynn Smith, the friend of his sister Ruth. The two married shortly after his graduation in 1946.<ref>Bourne, pp. 44\u201355.</ref> He was a [[sprint football]] player for the [[Navy Midshipmen]].<ref name=\"hingston20160424\">{{cite news |url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2016/04/24/princeton-sprint-football-team/ | title=Why This Princeton Football Team Won't Be Suiting Up Next Season |work=Philadelphia | date=April 24, 2016 | accessdate=November 5, 2016 | author=Hingston, Sandy}}</ref> Carter graduated 60th out of 820 midshipmen in the class of 1946 with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and was commissioned as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign]].<ref name=\"annualRegister19461947\">Annual Register of the United States Naval Academy (v. 1946\u20131947), p. 33</ref> From 1946 to 1953, Carter and Rosalynn lived in Virginia, Hawaii, Connecticut, New York and California, during his deployments in the [[US Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic]] and [[US Pacific Fleet|Pacific fleets]].<ref name=\"zelizer-11\">Zelizer, pp. 11\u201312.</ref> In 1948, he began officers' training for submarine duty and served aboard {{USS|Pomfret|SS-391|6}}.

However, between his forgiveness of debts and the division of his wealth among heirs, his son Jimmy inherited comparatively little. For a year, Jimmy, Rosalynn, and their three sons lived in [[public housing]] in Plains; Carter is the only U.S. president to have lived in subsidized housing before he took office. Carter was knowledgeable in scientific and technological subjects, and he set out to expand the family's peanut-growing business. The transition from Navy to agribusinessman was difficult because his first-year harvest failed due to drought; Carter was compelled to open several bank lines of credit to keep the farm afloat. Meanwhile, he also took classes and read up on agriculture while Rosalynn learned accounting to manage the business's books.

Callaway had just switched from the Democratic Party to the Republican Party in 1964, and was a very strong candidate, despite being the first Republican to run for Governor of Georgia since 1876.  State Democrats panicked over the prospect of losing the governorship they had held since [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]]. Carter decided to run for governor himself. In the Democratic primary he ran against the liberal former governor [[Ellis Arnall]] and the conservative segregationist [[Lester Maddox]]. In a press conference he described his ideology as \"Conservative, moderate, liberal and middle-of-the-road.&nbsp;... I believe I am a more complicated person than that.\"<ref>Bourne, pp. 149\u2013153.</ref> He lost the Democratic primary, but drew enough votes as a third-place candidate to force Arnall into a [[two-round system|runoff election]] with Maddox. Maddox narrowly won the runoff ballot over Arnall to the Democratic Party nomination. In the general election, Callaway went on to win a plurality of the vote, but short of a 50 percent majority, state rules empowered the Georgia House of Representatives, which had a Democratic Party majority, to elect Maddox as governor.<ref name=\"bourne-153\" /> The result was a sharp blow to Carter, who was left deeply in debt. His attempt to rescue the race from Callaway had resulted in the unlikely election of the segregationist Maddox, which he considered an even worse outcome.<ref name=\"bourne-153\">Bourne, pp. 153\u2013165.</ref>\n\nCarter returned to his agriculture business and, during the next four years, carefully planned his next campaign for governor in 1970. This period was a spiritual turning point for Carter; he grew increasingly evangelical, undertaking several religious missions in other states. Inspired by his sister Ruth and [[modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] theologians such as [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], he declared himself [[Born again]], a growing movement in 1960s America. His last child [[Amy Carter|Amy]] was born during this time, on October 19, 1967.<ref>Bourne, pp. 165\u2013179.</ref><ref>Hayward, pp. 39\u201346.</ref>\n\n[[File:GACountiesGovernor1970.svg|thumb|upright=1.0|alt=A map of Georgia counties, almost all of which are medium to dark blue with a small handful of red counties in the north|Results of the 1970 gubernatorial election in Georgia, with blue counties supporting Carter and red ones voting for [[Hal Suit]]: the relative darkness of the shade shows greater support for a candidate.]]\n\nGovernor Maddox was constitutionally prohibited from seeking a second consecutive term as governor, and thus the liberal former governor, [[Carl Sanders]], became Carter's main opponent in the 1970 Democratic primary. Carter ran a more modern campaign this time around, employing printed graphics and statistical analysis. Responding to poll data, Carter leaned more [[conservatism in the United States|conservative]] than before. He positioned himself as a [[populism|populist]], quickly going negative against Sanders for his wealth (labeling him \"Cufflinks Carl\") and associating him with the national Democratic Party. He accused Sanders of corruption, but when pressed by the media, could come up with no evidence.<ref name=\"bourne-180\">Bourne, pp. 180\u2013199.</ref><ref name=\"hayward-46\">Hayward, pp. 46\u201351.</ref> Throughout the campaign, Carter sought both the black vote and the \"Wallace vote,\" after the prominent segregationist [[George Wallace]] of Alabama. While he met with black figures such as [[Martin Luther King Sr.]] and [[Andrew Young]], and visited many black-owned businesses, he also praised Wallace and promised to invite him to give a speech in Georgia. He implied support or dislike of private schools, depending on the audience. The appeal to racism became more blatant over time; Carter's senior campaign aides handed out a photograph of his opponent Sanders celebrating with black basketball players.<ref name=\"bourne-180\" /><ref name=\"hayward-46\" />\n\nThat September, Carter came ahead of Sanders in the first ballot by 49 to 38 percent, leading to a runoff. The subsequent campaign grew even more bitter; despite his early support for civil rights, Carter's campaign criticized Sanders for supporting [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] Carter won the runoff election with 60 percent of the vote\u2014winning 7 percent of the black vote\u2014and went on to win the general election easily over the Republican [[Hal Suit]], a local news anchor. Once he was elected, Carter changed his tone, and began to speak against Georgia's racist politics.

He used a two-prong strategy: in the South, which most had tacitly conceded to Alabama's [[George Wallace]], Carter ran as a moderate favorite son. When Wallace proved to be a spent force, Carter swept the region. In the North, Carter appealed largely to conservative Christian and rural voters; he had little chance of winning a majority in most states. He won several Northern states by building the largest single bloc. Carter's strategy involved reaching a region before another candidate could extend influence there.

The modest scope of this early collaboration was likely influenced by the understanding, later recounted by CIA official [[Robert Gates]], \"that a substantial U.S. covert aid program\" might have \"raise[d] the stakes\" thereby causing \"the Soviets to intervene more directly and vigorously than otherwise intended.\"<ref name=\"Riedel\"/><ref name=\"Gates\">{{cite book |last=Gates |first=Bob |title=From the Shadows: The Ultimate Insider's Story of Five Presidents and How They Won the Cold War |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2007 |isbn=9781416543367 |pp=145\u2013147 |language=en}} When asked whether he expected that the revelations in his memoir (combined with an apocryphal quote attributed to Brzezinski) would inspire \"a mind-bending number of conspiracy theories which adamantly\u2014and wrongly\u2014accuse the Carter Administration of luring the Soviets into Afghanistan,\" Gates replied: \"No, because there was no basis in fact for an allegation the administration tried to draw the Soviets into Afghanistan militarily.\" See Gates, email communication with John Bernell White Jr., October 15, 2011, as cited in {{cite thesis |last=White |first=John Bernell |url=http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |title=The Strategic Mind Of Zbigniew Brzezinski: How A Native Pole Used Afghanistan To Protect His Homeland |date=May 2012 |accessdate=September 11, 2016 |pp=45\u201346, 82 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304022857/http://etd.lsu.edu/docs/available/etd-04252012-175722/unrestricted/WHITE_THESIS.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |language=en}} cf. {{cite book |authorlink=Steve Coll |last=Coll |first=Steve |title=Ghost Wars: The Secret History of the CIA, Afghanistan, and Bin Laden, from the Soviet Invasion to September 10, 2001 |url=https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll |url-access=registration |publisher=Penguin |year=2004 |isbn=9781594200076 |p=[https://archive.org/details/ghostwarssecreth00coll/page/581 581] |quote=Contemporary memos\u2014particularly those written in the first days after the Soviet invasion\u2014make clear that while Brzezinski was determined to confront the Soviets in Afghanistan through covert action, he was also very worried the Soviets would prevail.&nbsp;...

U.S. support for the mujahideen accelerated under Carter's successor, [[Ronald Reagan]], at a final cost to U.S. taxpayers of some $3 billion.

I've signed a public letter calling for the Democratic Party at the next convention to espouse my position on abortion which is to minimize the need, requirement for abortion and limit it only to women whose life {{sic}} are in danger or who are pregnant as a result of rape or incest.

This statement followed a position of the Convention two years previously advocating the submission of wives to their husbands. Carter described the reason for his decision as due to: \"an increasing inclination on the part of Southern Baptist Convention leaders to be more rigid on what is a Southern Baptist and exclusionary of accommodating those who differ from them.\" ''The New York Times'' called Carter's action \"the highest-profile defection yet from the Southern Baptist Convention.\"<ref>{{cite news |last=Sengupta |first=Somini |date=October 21, 2000 |title=Carter Sadly Turns Back On National Baptist Body |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/10/21/us/carter-sadly-turns-back-on-national-baptist-body.html |newspaper=The New York Times |accessdate=December 17, 2014}}</ref>\n\nOn July 15, 2009, Carter wrote an opinion piece about equality for women in which he stated that he chooses equality for women over the dictates of the leadership of what has been a lifetime religious commitment.

In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators. Auckland won 45-9 with Iles scoring a try in the corner \u201cafter a cross-field run\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland Defeats Canterbury/Forty-Five Points to Nine\n| page =3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16956\n| date = 1918-09-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180916.2.15.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-10}}</ref>.\n\nOnce again in [[1919 Auckland Rugby League season|1919]] Iles was a prolific try scorer for Newton notching 10 tries in total including tries in the Roope Rooster semi final against [[Ponsonby Ponies|Ponsonby United]], and the semi final replay against the same opponents when the first match was abandoned near the end after Ponsonby fans encroached on the field and refused to move.

His next appearance was against the Returned Soldiers team as part of the Peace Day celebration program. It was held at the Auckland Domain on July 20 and featured athletics, rugby union, rugby league, football, and hockey matches.

The first after receiving a pass from [[Bert Laing]] and \u201ccutting in neatly and scoring\u201d, while his second saw him picking up the ball in the open \u201coutpacing the opposition and swerving past McCarthy [to score] a good try\u201d<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Representative Match/Auckland V Hawke\u2019s Bay\n| page =9\n| publisher =New Zealand Herald, Volume LVI, Issue 17235\n| date = 1911-08-11\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19190811.2.111.1\n| accessdate = 2019-08-18}}</ref>.\n\nIles was to make his [[New Zealand national rugby league team|New Zealand]] debut two weeks later. He played all of his 4 matches for New Zealand in 4 consecutive weekends.

Iles had played in a trial on May 14 to make the tour but was not selected.\n\nOn August 23 he played his first test for New Zealand at the [[Basin Reserve]] in [[Wellington]] and went down 21-44 in front of 8,000 spectators<ref>{{cite news\n| title = League Football/Australia V New Zealand\n| page = 7\n| publisher = Dominion, Volume 12, Issue 282\n| date = 1919-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/DOM19190825.2.88\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Iles had a happier time of it in the second test which New Zealand won at Sydenham Park in [[Christchurch]]. Iles scored a try which was described \u201cfollowing an exchange of kicks between the two full-backs the New Zealanders swept down in a line and Iles got over\u201d, this made the score 21-2 to New Zealand.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. They made efforts to organise a game with the newly formed Rotorua league team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8079\n| date = 1922-09-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220902.2.4\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He was still playing rugby union through this period and played for Tauranga in a drawn match with Rangataua in June\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rugby Union's Cup Matches Continued/Tauranga and Rangataua Play a Draw\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8007\n| date = 1922-06-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220612.2.5\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nA game against the touring [[New South Wales rugby league team|New South Wales]] was also arranged which was a remarkable achievement in itself given that rugby league was not even played in the area until a month earlier. The match was between New South Wales and Bay of Plenty. George Iles naturally played and the team also featured future Kiwi [[George Gardiner (rugby league)|George Gardiner]] while the visiting NSW team featured the likes of [[Frank Burge]] and [[Reg Latta]]. New South Wales won the match 29 points to 5 with Borell scoring a try and Joseph Rogers kicking a goal for the local team\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Kangaroos 29 Bay of Plenty 5\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8101\n| date = 1922-09-28\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220928.2.33\n| accessdate = 2020-04-11}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. These effort to grow the game in the area ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

He played his club rugby league for the [[Grafton Athletic]] and [[Newton Rangers]] teams in the [[Auckland Rugby League]] competition. He later moved to [[Tauranga]] and played for Tauranga and [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] at rugby union including against the touring [[Springbok national rugby union team|Springbok]] team in 1921. In 1922 he made an effort to establish Rugby League in the Tauranga area which failed however he did play matches for Tauranga and a Bay of Plenty league team who played against Auckland.\n\n==Early Life==\nGeorge Iles grew up in [[Christchurch]]. He was the son of Harriet and Albert Iles, whose parents had come to New Zealand in one of the first \u201cfour ships\u201d which brought settlers to [[Canterbury, New Zealand|Canterbury]]<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Obituary/Mr Albert Iles\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LV, Issue 9359\n| date = 1926-12-09\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19261209.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-09}}</ref>.\nAlbert was a successful sportsman in his own right captaining the Sydenham Football Club in the 1880s and representing [[Canterbury Rugby Football Union|Canterbury]] and [[Rugby Southland|Southland]] for several years. He was also a champion runner. In 1912 the family moved to [[Auckland]] where they lived until 1919 and it was during these years that George made a name for himself as a rugby league player.\n\n==Rugby League and Rugby Union Playing Career==\n===Auckland and New Zealand Rugby League Days===\nGeorge Iles began his playing career for [[Grafton Athletic]] with his name first appearing in a team list for their second grade team in 1914 along with his brother Arthur Iles <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Under League Rules/Fixtures and Teams/Grafton Club\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LI, Issue 15621\n| date = 1914-05-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19140529.2.132.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. The following season he debuted for the Grafton senior team and played in the [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|Auckland first grade competition]]. He was fortunate to play alongside the likes of New Zealand rugby league legends [[Karl Ifwersen]] and [[Dougie McGregor]], the later having already played for the [[New Zealand national rugby union team|All Blacks]] rugby team<ref>{{cite news\n| title = The League Game Notes and Comments\n| page = 10\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LII, Issue 15915\n| date = 1915-05-12\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19150512.2.124.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. Grafton were to win the Auckland title [[1915 Auckland Rugby League season|this season]].\n\nBoth George and Arthur were to transfer to the [[Newton Rangers]] team for the [[1916 Auckland Rugby League season|1916 season]]. Newton struggled and finished last however Iles did score 7 out of Newton\u2019s 20 tries making him the second highest try scorer for the entire competition. The following year he went even better scoring 12 tries and leading the try scorer lists in the [[1917 Auckland Rugby League season|1917 competition]].\n\nIn 1918 Iles scored 4 tries for Newton and was also elected secretary of the club at their annual meeting<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Newton Rangers Club\n| page = 7\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LV, Issue 16814\n| date = 1918-04-03\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19180403.2.60\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. He gained his first representative jersey when he was selected for the [[Auckland rugby league team|Auckland]] team for, at that time, a very rare representative fixture. During the war years the [[Auckland Rugby League]] had deliberately played almost no representative matches. The match was against [[Canterbury rugby league team|Canterbury]] and played at the [[Auckland Domain]] in front of 10,000 spectators.

Iles was listed to play in the reserves a week later for the Auckland team to play Australia but he did not take the field in an 8-32 loss.\n\n===Move to Tauranga and Switch to Rugby Union===\nIn 1920 George Iles moved to Tauranga with his family. There because rugby league was barely played he largely played rugby union over the following decade for Tauranga and the [[Bay of Plenty Steamers|Bay of Plenty]] representative team. In July 1920 he played for Tauranga against Grammar Old Boys. It was said \u201cof the Tauranga team the Isles [sic] brothers, three quarters, played well, and if supported by other members of the back division, would have made things a bit more awkward for the visitors. They both handled the ball well\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Grammar Old Boys v Tauranga\n| page = 8\n| publisher = Observer, Volume XL, Issue 45\n| date = 1920-07-10\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/TO19200710.2.13.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. In a bizarre situation Iles played for Auckland against his own Bay of Plenty union in a match on 31 July when an Auckland back was unable to make the trip to Tauranga and Iles was asked to take his place. Bay of Plenty won 17-10 but Iles played brilliantly and comment was made that he shouldn't have been left out of the Bay team in the first place\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Bay of Plenty Footballers Defeat Auckland Representatives\n| page =3\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7464, 2 August 1920, Page 3\n| date = 1920-08-02\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200802.2.9\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

His debut season in the code continued to be an impressive one. In a match for Tauranga against Te Puke in the Kusab Cup he ran in 3 tries in a 9-6 win\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Keen Football Contest in Te Puke on Saturday for the Kusab Cup\n| page =2\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume XLVIII, Issue 7474, 16 August 1920, Page 2\n| date = 1920-08-16\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19200816.2.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

The match was played at [[Rotorua]] with 5,000 spectators present to witness the Springboks win by 17 points to 9. Iles helped set up the first try to David Werahiko Borell after he initiated a \u201cnice attack\u201d and he did the same for their second and final try when Montgomery \u201csent the ball across to Iles who opened up splendidly, and the ball came across to Borell, who scored near the corner\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Springboks Beat Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume 49, Issue 7781\n| date = 1921-08-25\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19210825.2.13\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\n===Effort to Introduce Rugby League to Tauranga===\nDespite these fine rugby achievements it appears that Iles had not forgotten his rugby league background. He was part of an effort to establish rugby league in the [[Tauranga]] area in 1922. The Tauranga Rugby League was started and they looked to play rugby league teams from other areas. The league was officially formed in March, 1922 <ref>{{cite news| title = Under League Rules/Decisions of Executive\n| page = 3\n| publisher = New Zealand Herald, Volume LIX, Issue 18053, 30 March 1922, Page 3\n| date = 1922-03-30\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/NZH19220330.2.16.8\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.

On April 12 he wrote a letter to the [[Bay of Plenty Times]] about the strength of the rugby league code in various places and was writing in response to a query about why rugby league had been started in the area by Mr. Phelan, a past member of the Tauranga rugby selection committee. Iles responded in a lengthy letter \u201cthe answer is the same as that to why the League game was first commenced \u2013 that is dissatisfaction with Rugby management\u201d, he went on to say \u201ctouching on the standard of play in League, as one who has played both codes I give it as my opinion that League is played on a far higher standard in [[Australia]] and [[Auckland]] than Rugby\u201d <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Public Opinion/Rival Codes\n| page = 4\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 7961\n| date = 1922-04-13\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220413.2.27\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.

On August 28 he wrote another letter suggesting a match between those players who had been selected for the Tauranga rugby union team and those who had not as there had evidently been some controversy over selections<ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Challenge\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume L, Issue 8075\n| date = 1922-08-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220829.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>.\n\nOn the 16th of September history was made in Tauranga with the first ever game of rugby keague played there. Tauranga took on the Rotorua team on the Tauranga Domain. As well as George Iles playing, David Borell and Arthur Iles also played in the match. Rotorua won a high scoring match 29-28 with both Iles and Borell scoring tries\n<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Rotorua Wins by One Point\n| page =4\n| publisher =Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8092\n| date = 1922-09-18\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220918.2.24\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>.\n\nOn September 30 Tauranga again made history by playing in the first ever rugby league game in [[Te Puke]] <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Local and General\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.3\n| accessdate = 2020-04-10}}</ref>. Efforts were then made to arrange a match with an Auckland team and this eventuated with Auckland sending a very strong team down to play in Tauranga on October 7. It wasn\u2019t a Tauranga side who took on Auckland rather a Bay of Plenty team with players from throughout the district. George Iles captained the Bay of Plenty side and they performed well only going down 27-33 to an Auckland team which featured a large number of New Zealand international players such as [[Clarrie Polson]], [[Wally Somers]], and future Kiwi\u2019s [[Lou Brown (rugby league)|Lou Brown]], [[Neville St George]], and [[James Lawrence O\u2019Brien|Jim Brown]].<ref>{{cite news\n| title =Auckland League Team in Tauranga/Match Against Bay of Plenty\n| page = 3\n| work = Bay of Plenty Times| volume=LI| issue=8109\n| date = 1922-10-07\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19221007.2.15\n| accessdate = 2020-03-11}}</ref>. Iles scored a try against his former team.\n\nIn September Iles went on the attack again, this time in response to the suggestion by rugby supporters that league players were being paid. He was writing as a member of Tauranga Rugby League and challenged \u201cany member of the Rugby Union to produce evidence of proof of any monetary benefits received by players or officers of the Tauranga Rugby League. If this can be done I will donate \u00a350 to any charity benefit. <ref>{{cite news\n| title = Football Matters\n| page = 2\n| publisher = Bay of Plenty Times, Volume LI, Issue 8102\n| date = 1922-09-29\n| url =https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/BOPT19220929.2.5.1\n| accessdate = 2020-04-08}}</ref>. These effort to grow the game in the area ultimately proved futile and Iles returned to the rugby union field the following season.\n\n===Back to Rugby Union===\nIn 1923 he played for Tauranga rugby team against Te Puke in Te Puke and then again in the return match in Tauranga.

Most of the romantic interest centers on the host's daughter, Hypatia Tarleton, a typical Shaw [[hero]]ine who exemplifies his lifelong theory that in [[courtship]], women are the relentless pursuers and men the apprehensively pursued.\n\nHypatia is the daughter of newly-wealthy John Tarleton who made his fortune in the unglamorous but lucrative underwear business.  She is fed up with the stuffy conventions that surround her and with the hyperactive talk of the men in her life.  Hypatia is engaged to Bentley Summerhays, an intellectually bright but physically and emotionally underdeveloped [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].\n\nHypatia is restless with her engagement as the play starts, even as it is revealed she has also had a proposal of engagement from her betrothed's father, Lord Summerhays.   She has no desire to be a [[nurse]] to the [[elderly]] and is in no hurry to be made a [[widow]].  She longs for some adventure to drop out of the sky, and it does ... an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] crashes through the roof of the conservatory to close the end of the first [[Act (theater)|act]].\n\nAt the beginning of Act II, it is revealed that the aircraft brings two unexpected guests. The pilot, Joey Percival, is a handsome young man who immediately arouses Hypatia's hunting instinct. The passenger, Lina Szczepanowska, is a female dare-devil of a [[circus]] [[acrobatics|acrobat]] whose vitality and directness inflame all the other men at the house-party.\n\nAn additional uninvited guest arrives in the form of Gunner.  He is a [[cashier]] who is very unhappy with his lot in life.  He blames the wealthy class in particular for the plight of the ordinary worker, and he blames John Tarleton in particular for a romantic dalliance that he once had with Gunner's mother.   Gunner arrives with intent to kill Tarleton but hides inside a piece of furniture.  From this position, he becomes wise to Hypatia's pursuit of Percival.  His character comes to introduce the themes of socialism to the play, as well as serving to question the conventional views on marriage and social order.\n\nAll together there are eight marriage [[Proposal of marriage|proposals]] offered for consideration in the course of one summer afternoon. The question of whether any one of these combinations of marriage might be an auspicious alliance, or a misalliance, prompts one of the prospective husbands to utter the famous Shavian speculation: \n:\"If marriages were made by putting all the men's names into one sack and the women's names into another, and having them taken out by a blind-folded child like lottery numbers, there would be just as high a percentage of happy marriages as we have now.\"\n\t\nPart of Shaw's premise is in the irony that men spend so much energy courting a woman who will be obedient and subservient to them, when what they really desire is a strong woman who will be their equal. Shaw's idea of such an \"ideal woman\", one present throughout his works, is embodied in this case by the character of Lina Szczepanowska. She is a death-defying Polish acrobat who accompanies Percival on his flight and subsequently becomes the object of affection for Summerhays, Tarleton, Bentley and Johnny. The affirmation of her role as Shaw's archetypical ideal woman is her  speech (the longest by far in the work) in which she rejects Johnny's offer of marriage in favor of retaining her independence...financially, intellectually and physically. She takes Bentley, who finds a shaky new courage, up into the air with her at the conclusion of the play.\n\n==Audio adaptations==\nThe [[L.A.

Hypatia is engaged to Bentley Summerhays, an intellectually bright but physically and emotionally underdeveloped [[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]].\n\nHypatia is restless with her engagement as the play starts, even as it is revealed she has also had a proposal of engagement from her betrothed's father, Lord Summerhays.   She has no desire to be a [[nurse]] to the [[elderly]] and is in no hurry to be made a [[widow]].  She longs for some adventure to drop out of the sky, and it does ... an [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] crashes through the roof of the conservatory to close the end of the first [[Act (theater)|act]].\n\nAt the beginning of Act II, it is revealed that the aircraft brings two unexpected guests. The pilot, Joey Percival, is a handsome young man who immediately arouses Hypatia's hunting instinct. The passenger, Lina Szczepanowska, is a female dare-devil of a [[circus]] [[acrobatics|acrobat]] whose vitality and directness inflame all the other men at the house-party.\n\nAn additional uninvited guest arrives in the form of Gunner.  He is a [[cashier]] who is very unhappy with his lot in life.  He blames the wealthy class in particular for the plight of the ordinary worker, and he blames John Tarleton in particular for a romantic dalliance that he once had with Gunner's mother.   Gunner arrives with intent to kill Tarleton but hides inside a piece of furniture.  From this position, he becomes wise to Hypatia's pursuit of Percival.  His character comes to introduce the themes of socialism to the play, as well as serving to question the conventional views on marriage and social order.\n\nAll together there are eight marriage [[Proposal of marriage|proposals]] offered for consideration in the course of one summer afternoon. The question of whether any one of these combinations of marriage might be an auspicious alliance, or a misalliance, prompts one of the prospective husbands to utter the famous Shavian speculation: \n:\"If marriages were made by putting all the men's names into one sack and the women's names into another, and having them taken out by a blind-folded child like lottery numbers, there would be just as high a percentage of happy marriages as we have now.\"\n\t\nPart of Shaw's premise is in the irony that men spend so much energy courting a woman who will be obedient and subservient to them, when what they really desire is a strong woman who will be their equal. Shaw's idea of such an \"ideal woman\", one present throughout his works, is embodied in this case by the character of Lina Szczepanowska. She is a death-defying Polish acrobat who accompanies Percival on his flight and subsequently becomes the object of affection for Summerhays, Tarleton, Bentley and Johnny. The affirmation of her role as Shaw's archetypical ideal woman is her  speech (the longest by far in the work) in which she rejects Johnny's offer of marriage in favor of retaining her independence...financially, intellectually and physically. She takes Bentley, who finds a shaky new courage, up into the air with her at the conclusion of the play.\n\n==Audio adaptations==\nThe [[L.A. Theatre Works]] released an audio adaptation in 2004 ({{ISBN|978-158081-275-7}}) with [[Roger Rees]] as Lord Summerhays, [[Eric Stoltz]] as Johnny Tarleton, [[Victoria Tennant]] as Mrs. Tarleton, [[W. Morgan Sheppard]] as Mr. Tarleton, Joy Gregory as Hypatia, [[Tom Beyer]] as Bentley Summerhays, [[Tegan West]] as Joey Percival, [[Douglas Weston]] as Gunner/Julius Baker and [[Serena Scott Thomas]] as Lina Szczepanowska.\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons category|Misalliance}}\n{{Wikisource}}\n*[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/943 Download ''Misalliance'' from Project Gutenberg]\n* {{librivox book | title=Misalliance | author=George Bernard Shaw}}\n* {{ibdb show|6120}}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20130512064903/http://www.bard.org/education/studyguides/Misalliance/misalliance.html#.UY0AKcrT7KA ''Misalliance'' and Shaw]\n*[http://home.pon.net/kashimba/misalliance.html Shaw compared to Shakespeare]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20050227084338/http://trentdawson.com/theater_misalliance4.htm Review of ''Misalliance'']\n\n{{George Bernard Shaw}}\n\n{{Italic title}}\n\n[[Category:1910 plays]]\n[[Category:Plays by George Bernard Shaw]]\n", "name_user": "G\u00fcnniX", "label": "safe", "comment": "Reflist", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misalliance"}

He became interested in a range of music: [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Slowdive]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Chapterhouse]], and early bleep and [[breakbeat]] tracks. There was not much opportunity to see his musical influences in Kiel, so he moved to [[Berlin]] in 1996.\n\nSchnauss' musical output began under the pseudonyms of View to the Future and Ethereal 77. These electronica and drum-driven pieces were noticed by [[Berlin]] electronica label CCO (City Centre Offices), to which Schnauss sent CD's on a regular basis. Schnauss developed these submissions to CCO into his first album under his own name, ''[[Far Away Trains Passing By]]'', released in Europe in 2001, and in the United States in 2005.\n\n[[Image:UlrichSchnauss.JPG|thumb|left|Performing at [[Bestival]] (2008)]]\n\nHis next album, 2003's ''[[A Strangely Isolated Place]]'', showed the influence of My Bloody Valentine's [[Kevin Shields]] and [[Cocteau Twins]]' [[Robin Guthrie]]. Schnauss has said of this album, \"When you've worked with [[computers]] and [[Keyboard synthesizer|keyboards]] for a number of years, they become not so fascinating of themselves anymore. I gained confidence after people began to discover ''Far Away Trains Passing By'', and it hasn't really stopped since then. This time I decided not to compromise on what I wanted to do, with what I thought people might want me to do.\"<ref>Ulrich Schnauss, [http://www.ulrich-schnauss.com Website biography]. Accessed 28 July 2007.</ref>\n\nSince the release of both albums Schnauss has been asked to work with and remix with artists, including [[Port-royal (band)|port-royal]], [[Mojave 3]], [[Airiel]], [[A Shoreline Dream]], [[Asobi Seksu]], [[Televise]], [[Longview (British band)|Longview]], [[Johannes Schmoelling]], [[The Zephyrs]], Lunz ([[Hans Joachim Roedelius|Roedelius]]), and others.\n\nHe also plays keyboards for UK indie band Longview, whose singer [[Rob McVey]] was featured on Schnauss' next album, ''Goodbye''. In an interview, he said: \"I have always loved music that has both elements: [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] and sadness as a description of the current situation you are in, but at the same time a hopeful, utopian element that reminds you of the possibility of a different life.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Moayeri |first=Lily |url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/ulrich_schnauss_interview_072007/ |title=Ulrich Schnauss &#124; Under the Radar \u2013 Music Magazine |publisher=Undertheradarmag.com |date= |accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nHis third album, ''[[Goodbye (Ulrich Schnauss album)|Goodbye]]'', was completed in early 2007. It was released in Europe by Independiente Records on 25 June 2007. The United States release followed on 10 July under Domino Records. Regarding this album, he said: \"The overall idea was pretty much the same. I just wanted to merge the indie songwriting elements and electronic instrumentation. After the previous album I still had a feeling like there was more room to take these ideas to an extreme level when it comes to layering and laying down as many tracks as possible.\"{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn 12 June 2007, Schnauss released an EP, ''Quicksand Memory'', which contains two remixes by Robin Guthrie of previous releases, a mix by Rob McVey of a previously unreleased track, and an edit of a track appearing on his latest album.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Schnauss remixed two tracks by the Manchester-based [[shoegaze]] band Daniel Land and the Modern Painters. On 27 October 2008, the two tracks, \"Within the Boundaries\" and \"Benjamin's Room\", were released as a double A-side 7\" single by the independent record label Sonic Cathedral, the label's 11th release.\n\nIn July 2008, the ''Stars'' EP was released to support his June/July US tour. A co-produced/co-written track with [[A Shoreline Dream]], titled \"neverChanger\", was released on an EP of the same name. Schnauss traveled out for a short tour with the band in Texas and Colorado to promote this effort, and performed this track with A Shoreline Dream during his performances.\n\nIn October 2009, Schnauss' record labels, [[Independiente Records|Independiente]] and [[Domino Recording Company|Domino]], sued [[Guns N' Roses]], alleging that the band had committed [[copyright infringement]] by using portions of Schnauss' compositions in the track \"Riad 'n the Bedouins\" on the album ''[[Chinese Democracy]]''.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267184/guns-n-roses-sued-for-copying-songs Guns 'N Roses Sued for Copying Songs]. ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', 6 October 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Schnauss was involved in the mixing of [[Exit Calm]]'s self-titled debut album.\n\nSchnauss also provided keyboards and backing vocals on [[Engineers (band)|Engineers]]' third album, ''In Praise of More''. Schnauss also played as a headlining act for the \"Phrase One\" festival held in the small Irish town of [[Carrick-on-Shannon]] on 19 April 2013.\n\nSchnauss has been a member of [[Tangerine Dream]] [[Tangerine dream#Lineups|since 2014]]. His first release with the group was the [[mini-album]] ''[[Mala Kunia (Tangerine Dream album)|Mala Kunia]]'' (2014) which launched \"The Quantum Years\"-era of the group influenced by [[quantum physics]].\n\n==In other media==\n[[Image:Ulrich Schnauss-AC30.jpg|thumb|right|Live in London]]\n\n* \"Monday Paracetamol\", from ''A Strangely Isolated Place'', was used as one of the [[Background music#Anime, video game and blog music|BGMs]] for the 2007 version of popular global EA Sports video game franchise ''Tiger Woods PGA tour''.\n* Later in 2007, \"On My Own\", from ''A Strangely Isolated Place'', was used by Pontiac in its \"Cars\" TV commercial.\n* [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]'s [[Super Bowl commercial]] in 2008 (\"Mountain Top\") featured \"Blumenwiese Neben Autobahn\", from ''Far Away Trains Passing By''.\n* \"A Million Miles Away\" was featured in the [[PAL]] territory version of the PlayStation 2 video game ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''.\n* \"...Passing By\", from ''[[Far Away Trains Passing By]]'', was featured in the 2005 movie ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' and its accompanying [[Elizabethtown (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]\n* In the ''CSI: Miami'' Season 3 episode \"Under the Influence\", the song \"On My Own\" can be heard playing in the background as the newest addition to Horatio Caine's team, [[Ryan Wolfe]] (played by [[Jonathan Togo]]), is busy searching through Kenwall \"Duke\" Duquesne's car for evidence.\n* \"On My Own\", from ''A Strangely Isolated Place'', was featured in the Spring Summer 2012 collection for Emanuel Ungaro.\n* \"Look at the Sky\" was selected as the [[Tom Hiddleston]] song of the day on 1 November 2011.\n* \"Stars\" was used as the backing track in a 2014 Cadillac CTS Sedan TV commercial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nudd |first=Tim |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/lance-jensen-talks-cadillac-and-where-its-taking-american-luxury-154408 |title=Lance Jensen Talks Cadillac and Where It's Taking American Luxury |publisher=Adweek |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n* \"Gone Forever\" is used in the closing scene and during the beginning of the end credits in the 2014 film ''[[White Bird in a Blizzard]]'', featuring [[Shailene Woodley]].\n\n==Pseudonyms and groups==\n* Ulrich Schnauss\n* Ethereal 77\n* View to the Future\n* The Extremist\n* Hexaquart\n* Police in Cars With Headphones\n* Hair (with Alex Krueger)\n* [[Longview (British band)|Long-view]] (keyboardist)\n* [[Engineers (band)|Engineers]] (keyboardist)\n\n==Discography==\n===Releases===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |\n!

He became interested in a range of music: [[My Bloody Valentine (band)|My Bloody Valentine]], [[Slowdive]], [[Tangerine Dream]], [[Chapterhouse]], and early bleep and [[breakbeat]] tracks. There was not much opportunity to see his musical influences in Kiel, so he moved to [[Berlin]] in 1996.\n\nSchnauss' musical output began under the pseudonyms of View to the Future and Ethereal 77. These electronica and drum-driven pieces were noticed by [[Berlin]] electronica label CCO (City Centre Offices), to which Schnauss sent CD's on a regular basis. Schnauss developed these submissions to CCO into his first album under his own name, ''[[Far Away Trains Passing By]]'', released in Europe in 2001, and in the United States in 2005.\n\n[[Image:UlrichSchnauss.JPG|thumb|left|Performing at [[Bestival]] (2008)]]\n\nHis next album, 2003's ''[[A Strangely Isolated Place]]'', showed the influence of My Bloody Valentine's [[Kevin Shields]] and [[Cocteau Twins]]' [[Robin Guthrie]]. Schnauss has said of this album, \"When you've worked with [[computers]] and [[Keyboard synthesizer|keyboards]] for a number of years, they become not so fascinating of themselves anymore. I gained confidence after people began to discover ''Far Away Trains Passing By'', and it hasn't really stopped since then. This time I decided not to compromise on what I wanted to do, with what I thought people might want me to do.\"<ref>Ulrich Schnauss, [http://www.ulrich-schnauss.com Website biography]. Accessed 28 July 2007.</ref>\n\nSince the release of both albums Schnauss has been asked to work with and remix with artists, including [[Port-royal (band)|port-royal]], [[Mojave 3]], [[Airiel]], [[A Shoreline Dream]], [[Asobi Seksu]], [[Televise]], [[Longview (British band)|Longview]], [[Johannes Schmoelling]], [[The Zephyrs]], Lunz ([[Hans Joachim Roedelius|Roedelius]]), and others.\n\nHe also plays keyboards for UK indie band Longview, whose singer [[Rob McVey]] was featured on Schnauss' next album, ''Goodbye''. In an interview, he said: \"I have always loved music that has both elements: [[Depression (mood)|melancholy]] and sadness as a description of the current situation you are in, but at the same time a hopeful, utopian element that reminds you of the possibility of a different life.\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Moayeri |first=Lily |url=http://www.undertheradarmag.com/interviews/ulrich_schnauss_interview_072007/ |title=Ulrich Schnauss &#124; Under the Radar \u2013 Music Magazine |publisher=Undertheradarmag.com |date= |accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n\nHis third album, ''[[Goodbye (Ulrich Schnauss album)|Goodbye]]'', was completed in early 2007. It was released in Europe by Independiente Records on 25 June 2007. The United States release followed on 10 July under Domino Records. Regarding this album, he said: \"The overall idea was pretty much the same. I just wanted to merge the indie songwriting elements and electronic instrumentation. After the previous album I still had a feeling like there was more room to take these ideas to an extreme level when it comes to layering and laying down as many tracks as possible.\"{{cn|date=March 2017}}\n\nOn 12 June 2007, Schnauss released an EP, ''Quicksand Memory'', which contains two remixes by Robin Guthrie of previous releases, a mix by Rob McVey of a previously unreleased track, and an edit of a track appearing on his latest album.\n\nIn the spring of 2008, Schnauss remixed two tracks by the Manchester-based [[shoegaze]] band Daniel Land and the Modern Painters. On 27 October 2008, the two tracks, \"Within the Boundaries\" and \"Benjamin's Room\", were released as a double A-side 7\" single by the independent record label Sonic Cathedral, the label's 11th release.\n\nIn July 2008, the ''Stars'' EP was released to support his June/July US tour. A co-produced/co-written track with [[A Shoreline Dream]], titled \"neverChanger\", was released on an EP of the same name. Schnauss traveled out for a short tour with the band in Texas and Colorado to promote this effort, and performed this track with A Shoreline Dream during his performances.\n\nIn October 2009, Schnauss' record labels, [[Independiente Records|Independiente]] and [[Domino Recording Company|Domino]], sued [[Guns N' Roses]], alleging that the band had committed [[copyright infringement]] by using portions of Schnauss' compositions in the track \"Riad 'n the Bedouins\" on the album ''[[Chinese Democracy]]''.<ref>[http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/267184/guns-n-roses-sued-for-copying-songs Guns 'N Roses Sued for Copying Songs]. ''[[Billboard magazine|Billboard]]'', 6 October 2009.</ref>\n\nIn 2010, Schnauss was involved in the mixing of [[Exit Calm]]'s self-titled debut album.\n\nSchnauss also provided keyboards and backing vocals on [[Engineers (band)|Engineers]]' third album, ''In Praise of More''. Schnauss also played as a headlining act for the \"Phrase One\" festival held in the small Irish town of [[Carrick-on-Shannon]] on 19 April 2013.\n\nSchnauss has been a member of [[Tangerine Dream]] [[Tangerine dream#Lineups|since 2014]]. His first release with the group was the [[mini-ablum]] ''[[Mala Kunia (Tangerine Dream album)|Mala Kunia]]'' (2014) which launched \"The Quantum Years\"-era of the group influenced by [[quantum physics]].\n\n==In other media==\n[[Image:Ulrich Schnauss-AC30.jpg|thumb|right|Live in London]]\n\n* \"Monday Paracetamol\", from ''A Strangely Isolated Place'', was used as one of the [[Background music#Anime, video game and blog music|BGMs]] for the 2007 version of popular global EA Sports video game franchise ''Tiger Woods PGA tour''.\n* Later in 2007, \"On My Own\", from ''A Strangely Isolated Place'', was used by Pontiac in its \"Cars\" TV commercial.\n* [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]]'s [[Super Bowl commercial]] in 2008 (\"Mountain Top\") featured \"Blumenwiese Neben Autobahn\", from ''Far Away Trains Passing By''.\n* \"A Million Miles Away\" was featured in the [[PAL]] territory version of the PlayStation 2 video game ''[[Gran Turismo 4]]''.\n* \"...Passing By\", from ''[[Far Away Trains Passing By]]'', was featured in the 2005 movie ''[[Elizabethtown (film)|Elizabethtown]]'' and its accompanying [[Elizabethtown (soundtrack)|soundtrack]]\n* In the ''CSI: Miami'' Season 3 episode \"Under the Influence\", the song \"On My Own\" can be heard playing in the background as the newest addition to Horatio Caine's team, [[Ryan Wolfe]] (played by [[Jonathan Togo]]), is busy searching through Kenwall \"Duke\" Duquesne's car for evidence.\n* \"On My Own\", from ''A Strangely Isolated Place'', was featured in the Spring Summer 2012 collection for Emanuel Ungaro.\n* \"Look at the Sky\" was selected as the [[Tom Hiddleston]] song of the day on 1 November 2011.\n* \"Stars\" was used as the backing track in a 2014 Cadillac CTS Sedan TV commercial.<ref>{{cite web|last=Nudd |first=Tim |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/lance-jensen-talks-cadillac-and-where-its-taking-american-luxury-154408 |title=Lance Jensen Talks Cadillac and Where It's Taking American Luxury |publisher=Adweek |date=10 December 2013 |accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>\n* \"Gone Forever\" is used in the closing scene and during the beginning of the end credits in the 2014 film ''[[White Bird in a Blizzard]]'', featuring [[Shailene Woodley]].\n\n==Pseudonyms and groups==\n* Ulrich Schnauss\n* Ethereal 77\n* View to the Future\n* The Extremist\n* Hexaquart\n* Police in Cars With Headphones\n* Hair (with Alex Krueger)\n* [[Longview (British band)|Long-view]] (keyboardist)\n* [[Engineers (band)|Engineers]] (keyboardist)\n\n==Discography==\n===Releases===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" |\n!

These have been held at the Red Bull Gaming Sphere and Capcom UK's London office.\n\n==Career==\nLogan embarked on his radio career on local [[Essex]] pirate station Plush FM hosting several cover shows playing underground garage in 2002. Towards the end of 2002 he was recruited to London then-pirate station [[Rinse FM]] where his show became a popular place to hear the newest music and regularly featured the biggest MCs performing live. His last Rinse show was captured on video and featured [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Skepta]], [[Trim (rapper)|Trim]], [[Ruff Sqwad]], [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]], [[Newham Generals]] and many others.\n\nHe moved to London's Kiss 100 in the spring of 2005 and began a late night specialist [[Grime (music genre)|Grime]] show running from 2{{nbsp}}am to 4{{nbsp}}am on Thursday night/Friday morning. The popularity of this show soon saw it move to Monday night 11{{nbsp}}pm{{snd}}1{{nbsp}}am where it became the leading show amongst young people within [[London]] at that time, capturing over 61,000 listeners in the Greater London area as certified by [[RAJAR]]. His exposure of live mix sets and first played new tracks has led to him becoming the leading figure in radio for Grime music. His shows are now also captured on video and streamed as [[YouTube]] clips which have proved very popular.\n\nThe show broadcast at 1{{nbsp}}am on Monday and has become very popular on social networking site Twitter using the hashtag #KissGrime which has trended nationally with great frequency. New additions to the show the 'Versus Sessions' where an artist picks their favourite current beat and performs live as well as the 'After Hours' classic Grime sets are also made available via his YouTube channel 'KeepinItGrimy' founded in 2008.\n\nLogan won multiple 'Grime Awards', public voted awards that were given to the best grime acts in different categories by GrimeForum. He currently holds the record for most awards won by a single act with 7 separate wins.\n\nLogan left Kiss FM in 2014, along with [[DJ EZ]] and [[Hannah Wants]] following changes that saw many specialist DJs moved to the digital only [[KissFresh]] channel, and immediately took up a residency on the new SixtyMinutes rotating, regular guest mix feature on [[MistaJam]]'s [[BBC Radio 1xtra]] show.\nFrom November 2015 he re-joined [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] covering for Sian Anderson (till February 2016) on Tuesdays 10{{nbsp}}pm, covering the best of Grime. In 2016 he was brought on to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Residency line up.\n\nAfter being announced as taking up a new regular weekly show on Friday nights on 1xtra, on 7 November the BBC released a statement that Logan would no longer be hosting the show. A statement from Logan referenced a number of publicly visible tweets made between 2011-2015 that perpetuated negative stereotypes offensive to women, specifically of mixed black heritage, that were brought to the attention of the BBC who made the decision he would be unsuitable to join the network.

These have been held at the Red Bull Gaming Sphere and Capcom UK's London office.\n\n==Career==\nLogan embarked on his radio career on local [[Essex]] pirate station Plush FM hosting several cover shows playing underground garage in 2002. Towards the end of 2002 he was recruited to London then-pirate station [[Rinse FM]] where his show became a popular place to hear the newest music and regularly featured the biggest MCs performing live. His last Rinse show was captured on video and featured [[Wiley (rapper)|Wiley]], [[Skepta]], [[Trim (rapper)|Trim]], [[Ruff Sqwad]], [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]], [[Newham Generals]] and many others.\n\nHe moved to London's Kiss 100 in the spring of 2005 and began a late night specialist [[Grime (music genre)|Grime]] show running from 2{{nbsp}}am to 4{{nbsp}}am on Thursday night/Friday morning. The popularity of this show soon saw it move to Monday night 11{{nbsp}}pm{{snd}}1{{nbsp}}am where it became the leading show amongst young people within [[London]] at that time, capturing over 61,000 listeners in the Greater London area as certified by [[RAJAR]]. His exposure of live mix sets and first played new tracks has led to him becoming the leading figure in radio for Grime music. His shows are now also captured on video and streamed as [[YouTube]] clips which have proved very popular.\n\nThe show broadcast at 1{{nbsp}}am on Monday and has become very popular on social networking site Twitter using the hashtag #KissGrime which has trended nationally with great frequency. New additions to the show the 'Versus Sessions' where an artist picks their favourite current beat and performs live as well as the 'After Hours' classic Grime sets are also made available via his YouTube channel 'KeepinItGrimy' founded in 2008.\n\nLogan won multiple 'Grime Awards', public voted awards that were given to the best grime acts in different categories by GrimeForum. He currently holds the record for most awards won by a single act with 7 separate wins.\n\nLogan left Kiss FM in 2014, along with [[DJ EZ]] and [[Hannah Wants]] following changes that saw many specialist DJs moved to the digital only [[KissFresh]] channel, and immediately took up a residency on the new SixtyMinutes rotating, regular guest mix feature on [[MistaJam]]'s [[BBC Radio 1xtra]] show.\nFrom November 2015 he re-joined [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] covering for Sian Anderson (till February 2016) on Tuesdays 10{{nbsp}}pm, covering the best of Grime. In 2016 he was brought on to the [[BBC Radio 1]] Residency line up.\n\nAfter being announced as taking up a new regular weekly show on Friday nights on 1xtra, on 7 November the BBC released a statement that Logan would no longer be hosting the show. A statement from Logan referenced a number of publicly visible tweets made between 2011-2015 that perpetuated negative stereotypes offensive to women, specifically of mixed black heritage, that were brought to the attention of the BBC who made the decision he would be unsuitable to join the network. Subsequently, he also left the Radio 1 Residency position.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/41915241/dj-logan-sama-wont-present-1xtra-grime-show-after-making-offensive-comments|title=DJ Logan Sama won't present 1Xtra grime show after making 'offensive comments' - BBC Newsbeat|date=2017-08-11|website=BBC Newsbeat|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-08}}</ref>\n\nIn January 2018, Logan joined Rinse FM once again as part of their new The Grime Show residency alongside DJs; Spooky, GrandMixxer and AG.

Celestine makes a further guest appearance in 1993, while Etta makes a guest appearance in 1994, both visiting remaining members of the Tavernier family. Celestine is portrayed as a strict disciplinarian and a devout Christian who expects everyone in his family to show similar dedication to the church and abide by his rules. His unwavering demand for respect often alienates his children and almost causes the breakdown of his marriage.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\">{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=978-0-563-36292-0|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref> Also religious, Etta is portrayed as a career woman; her most prominent storylines concern marital problems and crises of faith.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\n==Storylines==\n\n===Backstory===\nCelestine and Etta were born in [[Trinidad]]. Celestine was raised by his grandmother after his mother died and his father left to find work in [[Jamaica]]. He came to Britain in 1966, recruited by [[London Transport Board|London Transport]], with the intention of studying at evening classes for a [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] job. It was a time when most West-Indians were expected to work on the buses or in hospitals and not to be too ambitious. However, he achieved his ambition, conformed and worked hard and eventually got promoted to manager at Walford [[Department of Social Security]] (DSS).\n\nCelestine married  [[Etta Tavernier]] in Jamaica and after the birth of their first son in 1968 she joined Celestine in England, later having two more children. Etta decided to train for a job that she knew she could do well - teaching.\n\n===1990\u20131994===\nCelestine and Etta and their three children, [[Clyde Tavernier|Clyde]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]), the oldest, and twins [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]) and [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]), move to [[Albert Square]] along with Celestine's father [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), when they are rehoused by the [[City council|council]] in 1990 after Etta acquires a new job [[Teacher|teaching]] at Walford Primary School.\n\nCelestine is put in an awkward position in 1990 when he discovers that [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) is working and signing on for dole money at the same time. He eventually decides that he cannot 'turn a blind eye' to Arthur's fraudulent behaviour and turns him in to the authorities at his work, but his self-righteous attitude earns him few friends on the square.\n\nCelestine is unwavering with his expectations of his offspring. He demands respect and adherence at all times, and because of this he finds it extremely difficult to relate to his children, who often feel that his strict rules are harsh and unfair. Celestine has a tempestuous relationship with Clyde in particular. Clyde feels that his father has 'sold out' by accepting the prejudices of his bosses who are slow to promote him, whilst Celestine cannot relate to Clyde's lack of ambition. He is also regularly accused of turning his back on his roots by his father Jules and because Jules never went through Celestine's struggles for acceptance in a white community, he doesn't really understand his son.\n\nCelestine is a dedicated [[Church service|Church]]-goer and spends most of his spare time performing religious readings and educating 'young disciples' in the teachings of the [[Bible]]. Etta is also a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and a dedicated mother, but the big love of her life is teaching, so she is thrilled when she gets promoted to 'acting head' at Walford primary in 1991. However, Celestine blights what should have been a happy time for Etta by continuously arguing with her about her new job. Celestine, is unhappy about Etta's promotion as he feels threatened by her higher status and earning power and believes that she has deliberately set out to undermine his status as the head of the household. The rift between them nearly drives Celestine into the arms of another woman whom he had been [[mentor]]ing in bible studies. The woman, [[Yvonne (EastEnders)|Yvonne]] ([[Pamela Nomvete]]), wants more than friendship from Celestine and propositions him one night following a row with Etta. It is a testing time for Celstine, but the sanctity of marriage is more important to him and he manages to resist the temptation.\n\nTheir marriage is tested again later in 1991 when Etta decides that she wants to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] in order not to pass on her [[Sickle-cell anaemia|Sickle-cell]] [[gene]] to any future children (their youngest son Lloyd has already inherited the gene and his life has been severely limited because of this). Celestine refuses to entertain the idea, however, as he feels that such an act goes against their religious principles. Etta decides to go ahead with the sterilisation anyway, only to discover that she is already [[pregnant]] and that her unborn child is carrying a double dose of the sickle-cell gene. Upon realising this Celestine is forced to reappraise his priorities and to agree, unwillingly, to a [[abortion|termination]]. It is a traumatic time for the Taverniers, but the ordeal eventually manages to bring them closer and they emerge from it a much stronger couple.\n\nIn 1992 Etta is offered a permanent role as [[head teacher]] at Walford primary and Celestine proves that he has learnt from his past mistakes by showing genuine happiness for Etta's success. However, in June of that year Celestine is offered a promotion in [[Norwich]]. Etta is unwilling to move but after Lloyd gets into trouble with the [[police]] for [[Joyride (crime)|joy-riding]], she decides that a fresh start for the family might be best. So the couple leave Walford for a new start.\n\nCelestine returns briefly in July 1993 when he finds out that his daughter is planning on marrying [[Steve Elliot]] ([[Mark Monero]]) and is extremely shocked to find out that she is pregnant. Celestine is also shocked to meet his previously unknown of niece, [[Gidea Thompson]] (Sian Martin), and he is appalled to find out that his father, Jules, had abandoned Gidea's grandmother - who at the time was pregnant with Gidea's mother - many years earlier.\n\nEtta returns briefly in February 1994 to stop Steve (Hattie's ex-boyfriend) from attempting to contact her daughter when he arrives in Norwich and the following week she visits Walford to try to persuade her father-in-law, Jules, to come and live with them following his mugging. Jules declines and says he is happy in the square.\n\n==Creation and development==\nIn the latter part of 1989 ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer named [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who took over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2014 a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]]. Due to his success on ''The Bill'', [[Peter Cregeen]], the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] has said that it was a challenging period, but \"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among the new characters were the Jamaican Tavernier family, who collectively arrived on-screen in July 1990, composed of grandfather [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), his son and daughter-in-law Celestine ([[Leroy Golding]]) and Etta ([[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]]), their eldest son [[Clyde Tavernier|Clyde]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]), and their twins [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]) and [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]], played by [[Michelle Gayle]]. Colin Brake has described the Taverniers as the major new additions that year, and it heralded the first time that an entire family had joined the serial all at once. Their introduction has also been described as a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the soap.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nEtta was Gordon-Lawrence's first television role.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\" /> Golding, a relatively inexperienced actor at the time of his casting, was sent to audition for the part of Celestine as a means of getting him used to the audition process.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/> He was awarded the part and claims that his inexperience helped rather than hindered the Tavernier family to gel together as it created a sense of \"camaraderie\" among them; he suggests that he and his screen wife Gordon-Lawrence \"played very well off each other\".<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\nThe Taverniers backstory scripted them as Trinidadian immigrants, who came to the UK in the 1960s and battled their way through a racist society to achieve.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Kingsley describes Etta as \"the real boss at home, clever enough to let Celestine and Jules believe they were the heads of the household\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Meanwhile, Celestine has been described \"as someone so straight and upstanding that he'd have to be given a surgical procedure in order to have an unclean thought.\"<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\">{{cite web|work=Walford Gazette|url= http://www.wgazette.com/int-ler.html|title=THE GOLDING VARIATION|accessdate= 2 April 2010}}</ref> Author Hilary Kingsley suggests that Celestine was the \"most upright, law-abiding citizen of Albert Square [...] but he doesn't get much thanks for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> She goes on to say that Celestine is \"not a happy man, though. He knows his father thinks he has lost his roots. His older son Clyde thinks he has 'sold out' and accepted the prejudices of his bosses who've been slow to promote him. His twins wish he'd loosen up and get excited about something other than their school reports and the cricket results.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Kingsley suggests that it was Celestine's relationship with Etta that proved most problematic for him however, stating that \"He loves [Etta] and has always been loyal. but when she decided to push ahead in her career he began to feel slighted.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nCelestine and Etta's most prominent storylines concerned marital difficulties. Kingsley suggests that Etta's independence and decision to undergo sterilisation and have an abortion, wounded Celestine's male pride and plunged their marriage into turmoil.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> However, the Taverniers marriage remained intact when \"Celestine realised he had to change or he'd be the loser\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nHalf the Tavernier family, including Celestine, Etta and Lloyd were written out of the serial in 1992. On-screen Celestine was given a promotion in Norwich and left Walford. However, Celestine appeared again in 1993 and Etta in 1994 as part of storylines that were focusing on the remaining characters of the Tavernier family, Jules, Hattie and Clyde.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{EastEnders characters|past}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tavernier, Celestine and Etta}}\n[[Category:EastEnders characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=June 2018}}\n{{Use British English|date=June 2018}}\n{{Infobox soap character\n|series=EastEnders\n|image1=Celestine Tavernier EE.jpg\n|imagesize1=200px\n|caption1=[[Leroy Golding]] as Celestine Tavernier\n|image2=Etta Tavernier EE.jpg\n|imagesize2=200px\n|caption2=[[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]] as Etta Tavernier\n|name=Celestine and Etta Tavernier\n|portrayer=[[Leroy Golding]] (Celestine)<br />[[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]] (Etta)\n|introducer=[[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]] (1990)<br>[[Leonard Lewis]] (1993, 1994) \n|years=1990\u20131993 (Celestine)<br>1990\u22121992, 1994 (Etta)\n|first=Episode 563<br/>{{start date|1990|6|28|df=y}} (Celestine)<br>Episode 565<br/>{{start date|1990|7|5|df=y}} (Etta)\n|last=Episode 884<br/>{{end date|1993|7|22|df=y}} (Celestine)<br>Episode 949<br/>{{end date|1994|3|3|df=y}} (Etta)\n|classification=[[List of past EastEnders characters#Last appeared in 1994|Former; regular]]\n|halfsisters=Elizabeth Thompson (Celestine's)\n|sons=[[Clyde Tavernier]]<br />[[Lloyd Tavernier]]\n|grandsons=[[Kofi Tavernier]]\n|daughters=[[Hattie Tavernier]]\n|father=[[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules Tavernier]] (Celestine's)\n|nieces=[[Gidea Thompson]]<br>(Celestine's)\n}}\n'''Celestine and Etta Tavernier''' are [[fictional character]]s from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]] ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Leroy Golding]] and [[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]] respectively.

However, he achieved his ambition, conformed and worked hard and eventually got promoted to manager at Walford [[Department of Social Security]] (DSS).\n\nCelestine married  [[Etta Tavernier]] in Jamaica and after the birth of their first son in 1968 she joined Celestine in England, later having two more children. Etta decided to train for a job that she knew she could do well - teaching.\n\n===1990\u20131994===\nCelestine and Etta and their three children, [[Clyde Tavernier|Clyde]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]), the oldest, and twins [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]] ([[Michelle Gayle]]) and [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]), move to [[Albert Square]] along with Celestine's father [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), when they are rehoused by the [[City council|council]] in 1990 after Etta acquires a new job [[Teacher|teaching]] at Walford Primary School.\n\nCelestine is put in an awkward position in 1990 when he discovers that [[Arthur Fowler]] ([[Bill Treacher]]) is working and signing on for dole money at the same time. He eventually decides that he cannot 'turn a blind eye' to Arthur's fraudulent behaviour and turns him in to the authorities at his work, but his self-righteous attitude earns him few friends on the square.\n\nCelestine is unwavering with his expectations of his offspring. He demands respect and adherence at all times, and because of this he finds it extremely difficult to relate to his children, who often feel that his strict rules are harsh and unfair. Celestine has a tempestuous relationship with Clyde in particular. Clyde feels that his father has 'sold out' by accepting the prejudices of his bosses who are slow to promote him, whilst Celestine cannot relate to Clyde's lack of ambition. He is also regularly accused of turning his back on his roots by his father Jules and because Jules never went through Celestine's struggles for acceptance in a white community, he doesn't really understand his son.\n\nCelestine is a dedicated [[Church service|Church]]-goer and spends most of his spare time performing religious readings and educating 'young disciples' in the teachings of the [[Bible]]. Etta is also a devout [[Christians|Christian]] and a dedicated mother, but the big love of her life is teaching, so she is thrilled when she gets promoted to 'acting head' at Walford primary in 1991. However, Celestine blights what should have been a happy time for Etta by continuously arguing with her about her new job. Celestine, is unhappy about Etta's promotion as he feels threatened by her higher status and earning power and believes that she has deliberately set out to undermine his status as the head of the household. The rift between them nearly drives Celestine into the arms of another woman whom he had been [[mentor]]ing in bible studies. The woman, [[Yvonne (EastEnders)|Yvonne]] ([[Pamela Nomvete]]), wants more than friendship from Celestine and propositions him one night following a row with Etta. It is a testing time for Celstine, but the sanctity of marriage is more important to him and he manages to resist the temptation.\n\nTheir marriage is tested again later in 1991 when Etta decides that she wants to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] in order not to pass on her [[Sickle-cell anaemia|Sickle-cell]] [[gene]] to any future children (their youngest son Lloyd has already inherited the gene and his life has been severely limited because of this). Celestine refuses to entertain the idea, however, as he feels that such an act goes against their religious principles. Etta decides to go ahead with the sterilisation anyway, only to discover that she is already [[pregnant]] and that her unborn child is carrying a double dose of the sickle-cell gene. Upon realising this Celestine is forced to reappraise his priorities and to agree, unwillingly, to a [[abortion|termination]]. It is a traumatic time for the Taverniers, but the ordeal eventually manages to bring them closer and they emerge from it a much stronger couple.\n\nIn 1992 Etta is offered a permanent role as [[head teacher]] at Walford primary and Celestine proves that he has learnt from his past mistakes by showing genuine happiness for Etta's success. However, in June of that year Celestine is offered a promotion in [[Norwich]]. Etta is unwilling to move but after Lloyd gets into trouble with the [[police]] for [[Joyride (crime)|joy-riding]], she decides that a fresh start for the family might be best. So the couple leave Walford for a new start.\n\nCelestine returns briefly in July 1993 when he finds out that his daughter is planning on marrying [[Steve Elliot]] ([[Mark Monero]]) and is extremely shocked to find out that she is pregnant. Celestine is also shocked to meet his previously unknown of niece, [[Gidea Thompson]] (Sian Martin), and he is appalled to find out that his father, Jules, had abandoned Gidea's grandmother - who at the time was pregnant with Gidea's mother - many years earlier.\n\nEtta returns briefly in February 1994 to stop Steve (Hattie's ex-boyfriend) from attempting to contact her daughter when he arrives in Norwich and the following week she visits Walford to try to persuade her father-in-law, Jules, to come and live with them following his mugging. Jules declines and says he is happy in the square.\n\n==Creation and development==\nIn the latter part of 1989 ''EastEnders'' acquired a new executive producer named [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who took over from [[Mike Gibbon]]. Ferguson had previously been a producer on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]'' \u2014 a hard-hitting, gritty and successful police drama, which seemed to be challenging ''EastEnders'' in providing a realistic vision of modern life in [[London]]. Due to his success on ''The Bill'', [[Peter Cregeen]], the Head of Series at the BBC, poached Ferguson to become executive producer of ''EastEnders''.<ref name=\"first10years\">{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=978-0-563-37057-4|title-link= EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books}}</ref>\n\nFollowing a relatively unsuccessful inclination towards comic storylines throughout 1989, Ferguson decided to take the soap in a new direction in 1990. Big changes were implemented both off-screen and on-screen.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Ferguson altered the way the episodes were produced, changed the way the storylines were conceptualised and introduced a far greater amount of location work than had previously been seen. ''EastEnders'' scriptwriter [[Colin Brake]] has said that it was a challenging period, but \"the results on-screen were a programme with a new sense of vitality, and a programme more in touch with the real world than it had been for a while\".<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nAs a consequence of these changes, a large number of characters were axed in early 1990 as the new production machine cleared way for a new direction and new characters.<ref name=\"first10years\"/> Among the new characters were the Jamaican Tavernier family, who collectively arrived on-screen in July 1990, composed of grandfather [[Jules Tavernier (EastEnders)|Jules]] ([[Tommy Eytle]]), his son and daughter-in-law Celestine ([[Leroy Golding]]) and Etta ([[Jacqui Gordon-Lawrence]]), their eldest son [[Clyde Tavernier|Clyde]] ([[Steven Woodcock]]), and their twins [[Lloyd Tavernier|Lloyd]] ([[Garey Bridges]]) and [[Hattie Tavernier|Hattie]], played by [[Michelle Gayle]]. Colin Brake has described the Taverniers as the major new additions that year, and it heralded the first time that an entire family had joined the serial all at once. Their introduction has also been described as a well-intentioned attempt to portray a wider range of black characters than had previously been achieved on the soap.<ref name=\"first10years\"/>\n\nEtta was Gordon-Lawrence's first television role.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\" /> Golding, a relatively inexperienced actor at the time of his casting, was sent to audition for the part of Celestine as a means of getting him used to the audition process.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/> He was awarded the part and claims that his inexperience helped rather than hindered the Tavernier family to gel together as it created a sense of \"camaraderie\" among them; he suggests that he and his screen wife Gordon-Lawrence \"played very well off each other\".<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\nThe Taverniers backstory scripted them as Trinidadian immigrants, who came to the UK in the 1960s and battled their way through a racist society to achieve.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Kingsley describes Etta as \"the real boss at home, clever enough to let Celestine and Jules believe they were the heads of the household\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Meanwhile, Celestine has been described \"as someone so straight and upstanding that he'd have to be given a surgical procedure in order to have an unclean thought.\"<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\">{{cite web|work=Walford Gazette|url= http://www.wgazette.com/int-ler.html|title=THE GOLDING VARIATION|accessdate= 2 April 2010}}</ref> Author Hilary Kingsley suggests that Celestine was the \"most upright, law-abiding citizen of Albert Square [...] but he doesn't get much thanks for it.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> She goes on to say that Celestine is \"not a happy man, though. He knows his father thinks he has lost his roots. His older son Clyde thinks he has 'sold out' and accepted the prejudices of his bosses who've been slow to promote him. His twins wish he'd loosen up and get excited about something other than their school reports and the cricket results.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> Kingsley suggests that it was Celestine's relationship with Etta that proved most problematic for him however, stating that \"He loves [Etta] and has always been loyal. but when she decided to push ahead in her career he began to feel slighted.\"<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nCelestine and Etta's most prominent storylines concerned marital difficulties. Kingsley suggests that Etta's independence and decision to undergo sterilisation and have an abortion, wounded Celestine's male pride and plunged their marriage into turmoil.<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/> However, the Taverniers marriage remained intact when \"Celestine realised he had to change or he'd be the loser\".<ref name=\"EEHandbook\"/>\n\nHalf the Tavernier family, including Celestine, Etta and Lloyd were written out of the serial in 1992. On-screen Celestine was given a promotion in Norwich and left Walford. However, Celestine appeared again in 1993 and Etta in 1994 as part of storylines that were focusing on the remaining characters of the Tavernier family, Jules, Hattie and Clyde.<ref name=\"Larry Jaffee\"/>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{EastEnders characters|past}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tavernier, Celestine and Etta}}\n[[Category:EastEnders characters]]\n[[Category:Television characters introduced in 1990]]\n[[Category:Male characters in television]]\n[[Category:Female characters in television]]\n", "name_user": "Conquistador2k6", "label": "safe", "comment": "One-year rule", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Celestine_and_Etta_Tavernier"}

[[Iowa]] voters elected state senators in 35 of the state senate's 50 districts--all 25 of the odd-numbered seats were up for regularly-scheduled elections and, due to the oddities of redistricting following the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]], 10 of the even-numbered sears were up as well. State senators serve four-year terms in the [[Iowa State Senate]], with half of the seats ''traditionally'' up for election each cycle.\n\nThe primary election on June 4, 2002 determined which candidates appeared on the November 5, 2002 general election ballot.

On March 12, 2002 a special election in [[Iowa Senate, District 10|district 10]] resulted in [[Amanda Ragan]] flipping a seat in favor of the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]]. Therefore, on election day in November 2002, [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] controlled 29 seats and [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] had 21.\n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] needed to net 5 Senate seats. \n\n[[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] maintained control of the [[Iowa State Senate]] following the 2002 general election with the balance of power remaining unchanged with [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] holding 29 seats and [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] having 21 seats. \n\n==Summary of Results==\n*NOTE: 15 of the even-numbered districts did not have elections in 2002 so they are not listed here.\n*Also note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting. \n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! class=\"unsortable\"| [[Iowa State Senate|State Senate]] District\n! class=\"unsortable\"|[[Incumbent]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924811.pdf 1st]\n| Steven D.

On March 12, 2002 a special election in [[Iowa Senate, District 10|district 10]] resulted in [[Amanda Ragan]] flipping a seat in favor of the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]]. Therefore, on election day in November 2002, [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] controlled 29 seats and [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] had 21.\n\nTo reclaim control of the chamber from [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]], the [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] needed to net 5 Senate seats. \n\n[[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] maintained control of the [[Iowa State Senate]] following the 2002 general election with the balance of power remaining unchanged with [[Iowa Republican Party|Republicans]] holding 29 seats and [[Democratic Party of Iowa|Democrats]] having 21 seats. \n\n==Summary of Results==\n*NOTE: 15 of the even-numbered districts did not have elections in 2002 so they are not listed here.\n*Also note, an asterisk (*) after a Senator's name indicates they were an incumbent re-elected, but to a new district number due to redistricting. \n{| class=\"sortable wikitable\" style=\"font-size:95%;line-height:14px;\"\n! class=\"unsortable\"| [[Iowa State Senate|State Senate]] District\n! class=\"unsortable\"|[[Incumbent]]\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n! class=\"unsortable\"|Elected Senator\n! colspan=\"2\"| Party\n|-\n| [https://www.legis.iowa.gov/docs/publications/DMP/924811.pdf 1st]\n| Steven D.
