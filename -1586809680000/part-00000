The parents of the children exchange stories and the Fitpatricks tell the Ellerbys that they are naming their son Leonard Fitzpatrick, after his great-grandfather. The Ellerbys exclaim that they are naming their daughter after her great-grandmother, Amanda Ellerby. Angelina predicts that the two children will be best friends and makes them promise they will celebrate this day together every year. A year later, on Amanda and Leo's first birthday, the Ellerbys and Fitpatricks are surprised to find themselves together again. It turns out that both families have been booked into the same birthday room at the Magic Castle Birthday Party Palace by mistake. They spend Amanda and Leo's birthday together, watching the two bond and even take their first steps together. The two children become friends.\n\nThe night before Amanda and Leo's 11th birthday, Amanda is busy practicing back handsprings with her friend Stephanie for the next day's gymnastics tryouts at school. The girls want to get on the team in order to become friends with the popular girls. Amanda's mother arrives home from work, and Amanda notices that her mother has sent Leo an invitation to her party and gets upset. She is still angry because she overheard Leo tell his friends that he thought it was stupid that he had to spend his birthday with a girl, but she doesn\u2019t have many other friends so he wouldn\u2019t want to tell her and hurt her feelings. After that Amanda refused to speak to Leo, locking away all of their pictures and even throwing the flowerpot that she had hand painted with Leo on their 5th birthday, along with the plant in it, out her window.\n\nThe day of Amanda tucker is awesome!!! and Leo's birthday does not go well for Amanda. She has to take the bus to school and forgets her lunch, and there is a pop quiz in class. She fails the gymnastics tryouts although Stephanie makes the team. When it comes time for her birthday party, most of her friends end up ditching in favor of Leo's. The night ends with her finding out that her mother has been fired from her job because she had mistakenly switched an important work presentation with her sister's science presentation. Amanda she goes to bed tired and disappointed. \n\nWhen Amanda wakes up the next morning it seems as if the whole day is playing out exactly like the day before. At first she believes everybody is playing a cruel joke but finally it dawns on her that it is the day of her birthday all over again. She does everything exactly the same as before, afraid to change any details. It's only when she's getting ready for her party she realizes that she is stuck in a time loop.\n\nThe following morning is exactly the same as the previous two days but this time Amanda decides to fake sick and stay home. Her neighbor takes her to the doctor where she lets slip something about an old family feud between the Ellerbys and the Fitzpatricks but she doesn\u2019t know much about it, so Amanda doesn\u2019t pursue it. Her party ends up being cancelled and she spends the night with her family. In the morning, Amanda realizes that she's still stuck on the same day. Frustrated and confused she goes to school but this time, while she's sitting in class, she sees Leo wink at her, which makes her realize the two of them are stuck in this time loop together.\n\nAmanda is relieved the next morning when nobody remembers that they are angry with her and she is no longer grounded. She even remembers to remind her mom about taking the right presentation. At school, Amanda and Leo finally get the chance to talk. He apologizes to her for the things he said and tells her he only said them because he wanted to look cool in front of his friends. They both agree that they miss each other and become friends again and decide tomorrow they are going to skip school and go out since there will be no consequences the next day.\n\nThe next morning Amanda fakes sick and stays home. When her dad falls asleep, she sneaks out to meet up with Leo. Leo has the whole day planned and it starts with them going for breakfast where Leo orders lots of food he would never normally get to eat. He then leads her to an open mic poetry reading where he gets up in front of the crowd and reads some of his own poetry. Leo then proceeds to take Amanda to an audition for a band looking for a drummer. After much coaxing Amanda agrees to try out. The band members are impressed, but they tell her to come back when she is older. Exhilarated, the two finally head to the mall where security grabs them and turns them over to their families who are worried sick about them.\n\nThe day goes as it normally does but after school Amanda and Leo go visit the Senior Community Center and ask around about the family feud that Amanda's neighbor had previously mentioned. They find out that their grandfathers used to own competing apple groves and they would always do things to try and harm the others\u2019 farm. Then, however, they suddenly made up for unknown reasons. Amanda and Leo still need more answers so they decide to go to the Willow Falls Historical Society the next day.\n\nThey go to the Willow Falls Historical Society where they find Angelina. She tells them that the town had sought the help of someone special who told the two men that they had to patch up their differences by the Harvest Day or else there would be consequences. Angelina claims she doesn\u2019t know anymore and the only thing that would have more information would be a journal that was stolen a while ago. Amanda and Leo ultimately come back the next day to sneak into the historical society and look around for the journal because they think she actually stashed the journal somewhere in the place. They end up finding Leo's great-grandfather's journal instead which revealed that because they didn\u2019t heed the woman's warning and patch things up within the year they went through a time loop as well until they resolved their differences and fixed all the damage they caused. Amanda and Leo are confused because they made up a week ago but they are still stuck. They decide to help everyone that they possibly can tomorrow in hopes that it will fix things. The next day, Amanda and Leo help everybody that they possibly can, such as reminding her mother about the presentation mix up, even though her mother still gets fired, suggesting that some things are meant to be. Amanda manages to make the gymnastics team. During their birthday parties they decide to merge them and both Leo and Amanda have high hopes they have broken the time loop.\n\nIn the morning, Amanda realizes that she is celebrating her birthday again for the 11th time. She is frustrated but when she gets on the bus she sees the Angelina is the bus driver and ultimately she gives her and Leo some answers. She reveals that she was the one who put the spell their great-grandfathers and was worried that it would transfer over to them. She insists that this shouldn\u2019t have happened though because on their 5th birthday she gave them plants protecting them from the curse. As long as they had the plants close they shouldn\u2019t have fallen into the time loop. Leo claims that's his is still sitting in his room but Amanda admits that she threw hers out the window a year ago on the night of their tenth birthday. Angelina makes them hurry back to class where everything goes as normal, except this time Amanda tries out for the marching band instead of the gymnastics team, something she secretly had wanted to do the whole time. When Amanda gets home from school she is relieved to find the plant still in the bushes under her window and she returns it back to its place in her bedroom. Both Amanda and Leo decide that they are just going to have one mom party together this time where they spend the night laughing together just like old times. To both Amanda and Leo's relief, the next morning is finally the day after their birthday. Amanda and Leo make a pact that they will always stay in touch with each other so that it won\u2019t happen again.\n\n== Reception and awards ==\n''11 Birthdays'', was positively received by both the general public and critics.

These vibrate to produce sound inside the body. Valves on opposing reeds of each note are used to make the instrument's reeds sound louder without air leaking from each reed block.<ref group=\"notes\">For the accordion's place among the families of musical instruments, see Henry Doktorski's [http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/description/taxonomy.html ''Taxonomy of Musical Instruments'' (''The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.'')] Also on this page is Diarmuid Pigott's ''The Free-Reed Family of Aerophones''</ref>  The performer normally plays the melody on buttons or keys on the right-hand [[manual (music)|manual]], and the [[accompaniment]], consisting of bass and pre-set chord buttons, on the left-hand manual.

These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May\u2013June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n====Pallet mechanism====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]].

All instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless [[digital accordion]]s. Not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.\n\n====Right-hand manual systems====\n[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody (while it can also play chords).

They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7\u20139 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].\n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows.\n**The rarely used bass accordion only has a right-hand keyboard, with ranks of 8', 16', and 32' reeds, with the lowest note being the deepest pitch on a pipe organ [[pedal keyboard]] (pedal C). The bass accordion is intended to perform [[bassline]]s in an accordion orchestra.\n**The rarely used piccolo accordion also only has a right-hand keyboard.\n* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A ''Weltmeister'' piano accordion by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Left-hand manual systems====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n[[File:Bassmechanics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bass buttons trigger a complex mechanism of wires, rods, and levers, which is normally hidden inside the instrument.]]\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for bass notes and additional rows of single buttons for preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished [[chord (music)|chords]]. The dominant seventh and diminished chords are three-note chord voicings that omit the fifths of the chords. \n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was rarely used outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies and complex [[bassline]]s on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords note-by-note. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n====Reed ranks and switches====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.\n\n====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====\nIn describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. A second aspect of size is the width of the white keys, which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths, ranging from {{convert|14|in|cm}} for a child's accordion to {{convert|19|in|cm}} for an adult-sized instrument. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. \n\nPrice is also affected by the use of costly woods, luxury decorations, and features such as a palm switch, grille mute, and so on. Some accordion makers sell the same model in a range of different models, from a less-expensive base model to a more costly luxury model. Typically, the register switches are described as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" or \"full organ\" switch on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side. Another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics, such as condenser microphones, volume and tone controls, or MIDI sensors and connections. \n\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n====Straps====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n====Electronic and digital====\n{{Main|Digital accordion}}\n[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n===Unusual accordions===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities \u2014 only a few have remained in use:\n* The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion\n* The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol\n* The [[schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement \u2014  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass \u2013 that travel parallel to the bellows motion\n* The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass\n* The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=2003 |title=An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments |location=Stockport |publisher=Robaccord Publications |isbn=978-0-9546711-0-5}}</ref>\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia peda\u0142owa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, which has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Free reed aerophone#History|l1=History of free reed aerophones}}\n[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Eight-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830)]]\n\nThe accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]], in 1822, by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]],<ref group=\"notes\">There is not a single document to back up this belief.

An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 \u2013 19 Jun 9 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l\u00e4\u00dft sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da\u00df man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T\u00f6ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu\u00df ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, w\u00fcrde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"\nTranslation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A\u2013Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : \u201cGREAT CONCERT-ROOM \u2013 KING\u2019S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called \u201ca concertina,\u201d an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': \u201cWhile we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>\n\nAfter Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph M\u00fcller's accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M\u00fcller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule f\u00fcr Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. Modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls, so that the accordion can be plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] for live shows. Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate [[digital accordion|MIDI sensors and circuitry]], enabling the accordion to be plugged into a [[synth module]] and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.\n\n==Use in various music genres==\n{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n===Use in traditional music===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nThe accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world.

Accordion is also used in the music of the [[Dropkick Murphys]] and [[Gogol Bordello]].\n\nAccordionists in [[heavy metal music]] make their most extensive appearances in the [[folk metal]] subgenre, and are otherwise generally rare. Full-time accordionists in folk metal seem even rarer, but they are still utilized for studio work, as flexible keyboardists are usually more accessible for live performances. The Finnish symphonic folk-metal band [[Turisas]] used to have a full-time accordionist, employing classical and polka sensibilities alongside a violinist.

In some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil.

Bellows effects include:\n* Volume control, including swells  and fades\n* Repeated short, rapid changes of direction (\"bellows shake\"), which has been popularized by musicians such as Renato Borghete (gaucho music) and [[Luiz Gonzaga]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340 |title= Luiz Gonzaga:Biography by John Dougan |first=John |last=Dougan |website=All Music |publisher=RhythmOne group |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151130122258/http://www.allmusic.com/artist/luiz-gonzaga-mn0000316340/biography |archive-date=30 November 2015 |url-status=live |access-date=26 June 2017}}</ref> and extensively used in [[Forr\u00f3]], called ''resfulengo'' in Brazil\n* Constant bellows motion while applying pressure at intervals\n* Constant bellows motion to produce clear tones with no resonance\n* Subtly changing the intonation to mimic the expressiveness of a singer\n* Using the bellows with the silent air button gives the sound of air moving (\"whooshing\"), which is sometimes used in contemporary compositions for this instrument\n\n====Body====\n[[File:Petosa - showroom 01.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A Petosa accordion shop showroom.]]\nThe accordion's body consists of two wooden boxes joined together by the bellows. These boxes house reed chambers for the right- and left-hand manuals. Each side has [[grille]]s in order to facilitate the transmission of air in and out of the instrument, and to allow the sound to project better. The grille for the right-hand manual is usually larger and is often shaped for decorative purposes. The right-hand manual is normally used for playing the melody and the left-hand manual for playing the accompaniment; however, skilled players can reverse these roles and play melodies with the left hand.<ref group=\"notes\">[[Guido Deiro]] claimed he was the first accordionist to play a solo with the left hand: ''Sharpshooter's March'' (1908) Guido Deiro, ''Guido Deiro's Own Story of Sharpshooters March'', ''The Pietro Musicordion'', Volume 6, Number 2 (May\u2013June 1948)</ref>\n\nThe size and weight of an accordion varies depending on its type, layout and playing range, which can be as small as to have only one or two rows of basses and a single [[octave]] on the right-hand manual, to the standard 120-bass accordion and through to large and heavy 160-bass free-bass converter models.\n\n====Pallet mechanism====\nThe accordion is an [[aerophone]]. The manual mechanism of the instrument either enables the air flow, or disables it:<ref group=\"notes\">Illustration made with reference from a similar illustration that can be found in both ''Det levende b\u00e6lgspil'' (p. 9) by Jeanette & Lars Dyremose (2003), and ''Harmonikaens historie'' (p. 35a) by Bjarne Glenstrup (1972, The University of Copenhagen, Faculty of Music)</ref>\n\n[[File:Accordion button mechanism.svg|upright=3.4|thumb|center|A side view of the pallet mechanism in a piano accordion. As the key is pressed down the pallet is lifted, allowing for air to enter the tone chamber in either direction and excite the reeds; air flow direction depends on the direction of bellows movement. A similar mechanical pallet movement is used in button accordions, as well as for bass mechanisms such as the Stradella ''bass machine'' that translates a single button press into multiple pallet openings for the notes of a chord.|alt=Accordion; cross-sectional view]]\n\n===Variable components===\nThe term ''accordion'' covers a wide range of instruments, with varying components. All instruments have reed ranks of some format, apart from reedless [[digital accordion]]s. Not all have switches to change registers or ranks, as some have only one treble register and one bass register. The most typical accordion is the piano accordion, which is used for many musical genres. Another type of accordion is the button accordion, which is used in musical traditions including Cajun, Conjunto and [[Tejano music]], Swiss and Austro-German Alpine music, and Argentinian tango music.\n\n====Right-hand manual systems====\n[[File:MeguRee the duo of Dino Baffetti Chromatic Button Accordion Excelsior Piano Accordion.jpg|right|thumb|Piano accordionist & chromatic button accordionist at [[Tokyo Big Sight]]]]\nDifferent systems exist for the right-hand manual of an accordion, which is normally used for playing the melody (while it can also play chords). Some use a [[button (control)|button]] layout arranged in one way or another, while others use a [[piano]]-style keyboard. Each system has different claimed benefits<ref name=\"pianovschromatic\">{{cite web|url=http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf|author=Dan Lindgren |title=Piano Accordion vs. Chromatic Button Accordion|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090318050921/http://home.swipnet.se/nydana/accordiontest.pdf |archive-date=18 March 2009}}</ref> by those who prefer it. They are also used to define one accordion or another as a different \"type\":\n* [[Chromatic button accordion]]s and the [[bayan (accordion)|bayan]], a Russian variant, use a buttonboard where notes are arranged [[chromatic]]ally. Two major systems exist, referred to as the B-system and the C-system (there are also regional variants).\n* [[Diatonic button accordion]]s use a buttonboard designed around the notes of [[diatonic scales]] in a small number of keys. The keys are often arranged in one row for each key available.  Chromatic scales may be available by combining notes from different rows. The adjective \"diatonic\" is also commonly used to describe bisonic or bisonoric accordions\u2014that is, instruments whose right-hand-manual (and in some instances even bass) keys each sound two different notes depending on the direction of the bellows (for instance, producing major triad sequences while closing the bellows and dominant seventh or 7\u20139 while opening). Such is the case, for instance, with the Argentinian [[bandoneon]], the Austro-German [[steirische Harmonika]], the Italian [[organetto]], the Swiss [[Schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] and the [[Anglo concertina]].\n* [[Piano accordion]]s use a [[musical keyboard]] similar to a piano, at right angles to the cabinet, the tops of the keys inward toward the bellows.\n**The rarely used bass accordion only has a right-hand keyboard, with ranks of 8', 16', and 32' reeds, with the lowest note being the deepest pitch on a pipe organ [[pedal keyboard]] (pedal C). The bass accordion is intended to perform [[bassline]]s in an accordion orchestra.\n**The rarely used piccolo accordion also only has a right-hand keyboard.\n* 6-plus-6 accordions use a buttonboard with three rows of buttons in a \"uniform\" or \"whole-tone\" arrangement, generally known as a [[Jank\u00f3 keyboard]]. The chromatic scale consists of two rows. The third row is a repetition of the first row, so there is the same fingering in all twelve scales. These accordions are produced only in special editions e.g. the ''logicordion'' produced by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke|Harmona]].\n<gallery>\nItalian Button Accordion QM r.jpg|A button key accordion made by the company Marrazza in Italy. It was brought by Italian immigrants to Australia as a reminder of their homeland.\nPianoAccordeon.jpg|A ''Weltmeister'' piano accordion by [[VEB Klingenthaler Harmonikawerke]]\n</gallery>\n\n====Left-hand manual systems====\n[[File:120-button Stradella chart.svg|thumb|right|300px|Typical 120-button Stradella bass system. This is the left-hand manual system found on most unisonoric accordions today.]]\nDifferent systems are also in use for the left-hand manual, which is normally used for playing the accompaniment. These almost always use distinct bass buttons and often have buttons with concavities or studs to help the player navigate the layout despite not being able to see the buttons while playing. There are three general categories:\n[[File:Bassmechanics.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The bass buttons trigger a complex mechanism of wires, rods, and levers, which is normally hidden inside the instrument.]]\n* The [[Stradella bass system]], also called ''standard bass'', is arranged in a [[circle of fifths]] and uses single buttons for bass notes and additional rows of single buttons for preset major, minor, dominant seventh, and diminished [[chord (music)|chords]]. The dominant seventh and diminished chords are three-note chord voicings that omit the fifths of the chords. \n* The [[Belgian bass system]] is a variation used in Belgian chromatic accordions. It is also arranged in a circle of fifths but in reverse order. This system has three rows of basses, three rows of chord buttons allowing easier fingering for playing melodies, combined chords, better use of fingers one and five, and more space between the buttons. This system was rarely used outside of its native Belgium.\n* Various [[free-bass system]]s for greater access to playing melodies and complex [[bassline]]s on the left-hand manual and to forming one's own chords note-by-note. These are often chosen for playing [[jazz]] and [[classical music]]. Some models can convert between free-bass and Stradella bass; this is called ''converter bass''.  The free-bass left hand notes are arranged chromatically in three rows with one additional duplicate row of buttons.\n\n====Reed ranks and switches====\n{{main|Accordion reed ranks and switches}}\n[[File:reedsinset.jpg|upright=0.75|thumb|right|Accordion [[Accordion reed ranks and switches|reed ranks]] with closeup of reeds]]\n\nInside the accordion are the reeds that generate the instrument tones. These are organized in different sounding ''banks'', which can be further combined into ''registers'' producing differing ''[[timbre]]s''. All but the smaller accordions are equipped with switches that control which combination of reed banks operate, organized from high to low [[register (music)|registers]]. Each register stop produces a separate sound timbre, many of which also differ in octaves or in how different octaves are combined. See the [[accordion reed ranks and switches]] article for further explanation and audio samples. All but the smallest accordions usually have treble switches. The larger and more expensive accordions often also have bass switches to give options for the reed bank on the bass side.\n\n====Classification of chromatic and piano type accordions====\nIn describing or pricing an accordion, the first factor is size, expressed in number of keys on either side. For a piano type, this could for one example be 37/96, meaning 37 treble keys (three octaves plus one note) on the treble side and 96 bass keys. A second aspect of size is the width of the white keys, which means that even accordions with the same number of keys have keyboards of different lengths, ranging from {{convert|14|in|cm}} for a child's accordion to {{convert|19|in|cm}} for an adult-sized instrument. After size, the price and weight of an accordion is largely dependent on the number of reed ranks on either side, either on a [[Accordion reed ranks and switches#Cassotto|cassotto]] or not, and to a lesser degree on the number of combinations available through register switches. \n\nPrice is also affected by the use of costly woods, luxury decorations, and features such as a palm switch, grille mute, and so on. Some accordion makers sell the same model in a range of different models, from a less-expensive base model to a more costly luxury model. Typically, the register switches are described as ''Reeds: 5 + 3'', meaning five reeds on the treble side and three on the bass, and ''Registers: 13 + M, 7'', meaning 13 register buttons on the treble side plus a special \"master\" that activates all ranks, like the \"tutti\" or \"full organ\" switch on an organ, and seven register switches on the bass side. Another factor affecting the price is the presence of electronics, such as condenser microphones, volume and tone controls, or MIDI sensors and connections. \n\n[[File:Quito Accordion player.jpg|thumb|Accordion player in a street in the historic centre of [[Quito]], Ecuador]]\n\n====Straps====\nThe larger piano and chromatic button accordions are usually heavier than other smaller [[squeezebox]]es, and are equipped with two shoulder straps to make it easier to balance the weight and increase bellows control while sitting, and avoid dropping the instrument while standing. Other accordions, such as the [[diatonic button accordion]], have only a single shoulder strap and a right hand thumb strap. All accordions have a (mostly adjustable) leather strap on the left-hand manual to keep the player's hand in position while drawing the bellows. There are also straps above and below the bellows to keep it securely closed when the instrument is not playing.\n\n====Electronic and digital====\n{{Main|Digital accordion}}\n[[File:Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound-2015 (12).jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rainer von Vielen-Heimatsound playing a Roland digital V-Accordion. The bank of electronic switches can change the accordion's sound, tone and volume.]]\nIn the 2010s, a range of electronic and digital accordions are made. They have an electronic [[sound module]] which creates the accordion sound, and most use [[MIDI]] systems to encode the keypresses and transmit them to the sound module. A digital accordion can have hundreds of sounds, which can include different types of accordions and even non-accordion sounds, such as pipe organ, piano, or guitar. Sensors are used on the buttons and keys, such as magnetic reed switches. Sensors are also used on the bellows to transmit the pushing and pulling of the bellows to the sound module. Digital accordions may have features not found in acoustic instruments, such as a piano-style [[sustain pedal]], a modulation control for changing keys, and a [[portamento]] effect.\n\nAs an electronic instrument, these types of accordions are plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] to produce sound. Some digital accordions have a small internal speaker and amplifier, so they can be used without a PA system or keyboard amplifier, at least for practicing and small venues like [[coffeehouse]]s. One benefit of electronic accordions is that they can be practiced with headphones, making them inaudible to other people nearby. On a digital accordion, the volume of the right-hand keyboard and the left-hand buttons can be independently adjusted.\n\nAcoustic-digital hybrid accordions also exist. They are acoustic accordions (with reeds, bellows, and so on), but they also contain sensors, electronics, and MIDI connections, which provides a wider range of sound options. An acoustic-digital hybrid may be manufactured in this form, or it may be an acoustic accordion which has had aftermarket electronics sensors and connections added. Several companies sell aftermarket electronics kits, but they are typically installed by professional accordion technicians, due to the complex and delicate nature of the internal parts of an accordion.\n\n===Unusual accordions===\n[[File:Busking Accordionist.jpg|upright=0.75|right|thumb|Garmon player]]\nVarious hybrid accordions have been created between instruments of different buttonboards and actions.  Many remain curiosities \u2014 only a few have remained in use:\n* The [[Schrammel accordion]], used in [[Vienna|Viennese]] [[chamber music]] and [[klezmer]], which has the treble buttonboard of a chromatic button accordion and a bisonoric bass buttonboard, similar to an expanded diatonic button accordion\n* The [[Steirische Harmonika]], a type of bisonoric diatonic button accordion particular to the Alpine folk music of Austria, the Czech Republic, Slovenia, the German state of Bavaria, and the Italian South Tyrol\n* The [[schwyzer\u00f6rgeli]] or Swiss organ, which usually has a three-row diatonic treble and 18 unisonoric bass buttons in a bass/chord arrangement \u2014  a subset of the Stradella system in reverse order like the Belgian bass \u2013 that travel parallel to the bellows motion\n* The [[trikitixa]] of the [[Basque people]], which has a two-row diatonic, bisonoric treble and a 12-button diatonic unisonoric bass\n* The [[British Chromatic Accordion|British chromatic accordion]], the favoured diatonic accordion in Scotland. While the right hand is bisonoric, the left hand follows the Stradella system. The elite form of this instrument is generally considered the German manufactured Shand Morino, produced by [[Hohner]] with the input of [[Jimmy Shand|Sir Jimmy Shand]]<ref>{{cite book |first=Rob |last=Howard |date=2003 |title=An A to Z of the Accordion and related instruments |location=Stockport |publisher=Robaccord Publications |isbn=978-0-9546711-0-5}}</ref>\n* {{Interlanguage link multi|Pedal harmony|pl|3=Harmonia peda\u0142owa}}, a type of accordion used sometimes in Polish folk music, which has a pair of [[pump organ]]-like bellows attached\n\n==History==\n{{See also|Free reed aerophone#History|l1=History of free reed aerophones}}\n[[File:8 key accordion.JPG|upright=1.15|right|thumb|Eight-key bisonoric diatonic accordion (c. 1830)]]\n\nThe accordion's basic form is believed to have been invented in [[Berlin]], in 1822, by [[Christian Friedrich Ludwig Buschmann]],<ref group=\"notes\">There is not a single document to back up this belief.

An instrument called ''accordion'' was first patented in 1829 by [[Cyrill Demian]], of Armenian origin, in [[Vienna]].<ref group=\"notes\">A summary and pictures of this patent can be found at [https://web.archive.org/web/20090619162610/http://www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html www.ksanti.net/free-reed/history/demian.html] (Version of 20 Okt 4 \u2013 19 Jun 9 Using Way Back Machine to Display: The Classical Free-Reed, Inc.)</ref> Demian's instrument bore little resemblance to modern instruments. It only had a left hand buttonboard, with the right hand simply operating the bellows. One key feature for which Demian sought the patent was the sounding of an entire chord by depressing one key. His instrument also could sound two different chords with the same key, one for each bellows direction (a ''bisonoric'' action). At that time in Vienna, mouth harmonicas with ''Kanzellen'' (chambers) had already been available for many years, along with bigger instruments driven by hand bellows. The [[diatonic]] key arrangement was also already in use on mouth-blown instruments. Demian's patent thus covered an accompanying instrument: an accordion played with the left hand, opposite to the way that contemporary chromatic hand harmonicas were played, small and light enough for travelers to take with them and used to accompany singing. The patent also described instruments with both [[Bass (sound)|bass]] and [[wikt:treble|treble]] sections, although Demian preferred the bass-only instrument owing to its cost and weight advantages.<ref group=\"notes\">German Text: \"Mit den Dekel des Balges, l\u00e4\u00dft sich das ganze Instrument verdoppeln, so da\u00df man dadurch die Accorde vermehrt, oder auch mit einzelne T\u00f6ne spielen kann, in diesem Fall, mu\u00df ein zweyter Einsatz mit Federn, und auch eine 2te Claviatur dazu kommen, der Blasebalg bleibt in der Mitte, jede Hand dirigirt abwechselnd, entweder die Claves, oder den Balg. Durch eine obengenannte Verdoplung des Instruments oder durch Vermehrung der Accorde, w\u00fcrde niemand etwas verbessern, oder was neues liefern, weil nur die Bestandtheile dadurch vermehrt, das Instrument theurer und schwerer wird.\"\nTranslation of this snip: With the Cover of the bellows the instrument can be duplicated, so the amount of Chords or single notes can be enlarged, or one can sound single notes, in this case, a second part with springs (free reeds) and also a second keyboard must be added, the bellows are in between these two parts, both hands push buttons and push and pull the bellows at the same time or alternatively. Through this doubling or increasing of chords within the instrument nothing new is invented or improved by someone else, because only the amount of similar parts is increased and the Instrument is heavier and more expensive.[http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm German full text] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718195131/http://www.akkordeon-online.de/instrum/demian.htm |date=18 July 2011 }}</ref>\n\nThe accordion was introduced from Germany into Britain in about the year 1828.<ref>''The National Cyclopaedia of Useful Knowledge, Vol I, A\u2013Arcesilaus'', London, George Woodfall and Son, 1847, p.107.</ref> The instrument was noted in ''The Times'' in 1831 as one new to British audiences<ref>The Times, Thursday 9 June 1831; pg. 5; Issue 14560; col A: (Review of a performance by a flautist, [[Johann Sedlatzek|Mr. Sedlatzek]]) \"At the close of the concert Mr. Sedlatzek performed on a new instrument called the Accordion or Aeolian, which, however, has little beside its novelty to recommend it.\"</ref> and was not favourably reviewed, but nevertheless it soon became popular.<ref>''The Times'', Wednesday, 26 April 1837; pg. 5; Issue 16400; col C : \u201cGREAT CONCERT-ROOM \u2013 KING\u2019S THEATRE...There was also a novelty in the shape of an instrument called \u201ca concertina,\u201d an improvement on the accordion, which has been such a favourite musical toy for the last two or three years.\"</ref> It had also become popular with New Yorkers by the mid-1840s.<ref>''New York Times'', 19 May 1907:- 'The Lay of the Last of the Old Minstrels: Interesting Reminiscences of Isaac Odell, Who Was A Burnt Cork Artist Sixty Years Ago': \u201cWhile we were drawing big crowds to the Palmer House on Chambers Street Charley White was making a great hit playing an accordion in Thalia Hall on Grand Street. In those days\"(i.e. mid-1840s) \"accordions were the real attraction to the public\".</ref>\n\nAfter Demian's invention, other accordions appeared, some featuring only the right-handed keyboard for playing melodies. It took English inventor Charles Wheatstone to bring both chords and keyboard together in one squeezebox. His 1844 patent for what he called a ''[[concertina]]'' also featured the ability to easily tune the reeds from the outside with a simple tool.\n\n[[File:Accordionschule1.JPG|thumb|right|upright=0.75|The first pages in Adolph M\u00fcller's accordion book]]\nThe musician Adolph M\u00fcller described a great variety of instruments in his 1833 book ''Schule f\u00fcr Accordion''. At the time, Vienna and London had a close musical relationship, with musicians often performing in both cities in the same year, so it is possible that Wheatstone was aware of this type of instrument and may have used them to put his key-arrangement ideas into practice.\n\nJeune's ''[[flutina]]'' resembles Wheatstone's concertina in internal construction and [[tone colour]], but it appears to complement Demian's accordion functionally. The flutina is a one-sided bisonoric melody-only instrument whose keys are operated with the right hand while the bellows is operated with the left. When the two instruments are combined, the result is quite similar to diatonic button accordions still manufactured today.\n\nFurther innovations followed and continue to the present. Various buttonboard and keyboard systems have been developed, as well as voicings (the combination of multiple tones at different octaves), with mechanisms to switch between different voices during performance, and different methods of internal construction to improve tone, stability and durability. Modern accordions may incorporate electronics such as condenser microphones and tone and volume controls, so that the accordion can be plugged into a [[PA system]] or [[keyboard amplifier]] for live shows. Some 2010s-era accordions may incorporate [[digital accordion|MIDI sensors and circuitry]], enabling the accordion to be plugged into a [[synth module]] and produce accordion sounds or other synthesized instrument sounds, such as piano or organ.\n\n==Use in various music genres==\n{{main|Accordion music genres}}\nThe accordion has traditionally been used to perform folk or [[ethnic music]], popular music, and transcriptions from the operatic and light-classical music repertoire.<ref>Henry Doktorski, CD booklet notes for \"[[Guido Deiro]]: Complete Recorded Works, Vol. 1,\" [[Archeophone Records]] (2007)</ref> Today the instrument is sometimes heard in contemporary pop styles, such as rock and pop-rock,<ref>Sometimes in modern pop music the accordion is not actually played, but its sound is heard by use of a MIDI instrument and sampled sound module.</ref> and occasionally even in serious classical music concerts, as well as advertisements.\n\n===Use in traditional music===\n{{main|Accordion music genres#Use in traditional music|l1=Accordion in traditional music}}\n\nThe accordion's popularity spread rapidly: it has mostly been associated with the common people, and was propagated by Europeans who emigrated around the world.

In some parts of the country, such as the northeast it is the most popular melodic instrument. As opposed to most European folk accordions, a very dry tuning is usually used in Brazil.
