A Gujarati origin for scripts of [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a [[South Sulawesi script]], probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of [[coda consonant marker]]s in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have [[coda consonant]]s, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. \n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Several Sulats of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|250px|Several Sulats of the Philippines]]\nThe best known evidence of where Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered. From these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s. So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]]. This theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n}} \n\nAccording to other sources, the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letter forms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Philippine passport (2016 edition) Baybayin.jpg|thumb|250px|Philippine passport (2016 edition) showing the Baybayin script]]\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the \"National Writing System Act\" (House Bill 1022<ref>{{cite web| url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB01022.pdf|title=House Bill 1022|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|17th Philippine House of Representatives]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=4 July 2016}}</ref>/Senate Bill 433<ref>{{cite web| url=https://senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-433|title=Senate Bill 433|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|17th Philippine Senate]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=19 July 2016}}</ref>).

Baybayin is well known because it was carefully and extensively documented by scribes during the Spanish colonial era.{{Sfn |Scott|1984|pp= 57\u201358}} \n\nIt is one of a number of individual writing systems used in [[Southeast Asia]], nearly all of which are [[abugida]]s where any consonant is pronounced with the inherent vowel ''a'' following it\u2014[[diacritic]]s being used to express other vowels.

A Gujarati origin for scripts of [[Sumatra]], [[Sulawesi]] and the Philippines. Proceedings of Berkeley Linguistics Society 36:376-91</ref> Its immediate ancestor was very likely a [[South Sulawesi script]], probably Old Makassar or a close ancestor. This is because of the lack of [[coda consonant marker]]s in Baybayin. Philippine and Gujarati languages have [[coda consonant]]s, so it is unlikely that their indication would have been dropped had Baybayin been based directly on a Gujarati model. South Sulawesi languages, however, lack coda consonants and there is no way of representing them in the Bugis and Makassar scripts. The most likely explanation for the absence of coda consonant markers in Baybayin is therefore that its direct ancestor was a South Sulawesi script. Sulawesi lies directly to the south of the Philippines and these is evidence of trade routes between the two. Baybayin must therefore have been developed in the Philippines in the fifteenth century CE as the Bugis-Makassar script was developed in South Sulawesi no earlier than 1400 CE.<ref>Caldwell, Ian. 1988. Ten Bugis Texts; South Sulawesi 1300-1600. PhD thesis, Australian National University, p.17</ref> However, Geoff Wade has argued that the ancestor of the Baybayin script was a Cham script.\n \n====Influence of Greater India====\n{{See also | List_of_loanwords_in_Tagalog#Sanskrit | label 1 = Indian Sanskrit loanwords in Tagalog }}\n\nHistorically [[Southeast Asia]] was under the influence of [[Greater India|Ancient India]], where numerous [[Indianized kingdom|Indianized principalities]] and empires flourished for several centuries in Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Philippines, Cambodia and Vietnam.

It was written in the Kawi script in a variety of [[Old Malay]] containing numerous loanwords from Sanskrit and a few non-Malay vocabulary elements whose origin is ambiguous between [[Old Javanese]] and [[Old Tagalog]].  One hypothesis therefore reasons that, since Kawi is the earliest attestation of writing on the Philippines, then Baybayin may have descended from Kawi or vice versa. It is the kawi inspired ancient alphabet of the people of Baybay in the Lakanate of Lawan used to write letters to relatives in far places where they migrate. Scott mentioned the Bingi of Lawan siday (local epic) originally written in Baybay, a place in ancient Lawan. It is believed that there were at least 16 different types of writing systems present around the Philippines prior to our colonization. Baybayin is just one of them, which was said to be of widespread use among coastal groups such as the Tagalog, Bisaya, Iloko, Pangasinan, Bikol, and Pampanga around the 16th century. \n\nA second example of Kawi script can be seen on the [[Kawi script|Butuan Ivory Seal]], though it has not been dated.\n\nAn earthenware burial jar, called the \"Calatagan Pot,\" found in [[Calatagan, Batangas|Batangas]] is inscribed with characters strikingly similar to Baybayin, and is claimed to have been inscribed ca. 1300 AD.  However, its authenticity has not yet been proven.\n\nMany of the writing systems of Southeast Asia descended from ancient scripts used in India over 2000 years ago. Although Baybayin shares some important features with these scripts, such as all the consonants being pronounced with the vowel a and the use of special marks to change this sound, there is no evidence that it is so old.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Several Sulats of the Philippines.jpg|thumb|250px|Several Sulats of the Philippines]]\nThe best known evidence of where Baybayin came about is from the \"abecedaries\" evidence. It is an example of letters of the script arranged more or less in the order the Spaniards knew, reproduced by the Spanish and other observers in the different regions of Luzon and Visayas. Another source of evidence are the archival documents preserved and recovered. From these two sources, it is clear that the Baybayin scripts was used in Luzon, Palawan, Mindoro, as far as Pangasinan in the north, and in Ilocos, Panay, Leyte, and Iloilo, but there are no proof supporting that Baybayin reached Mindanao. From what is available, it seems clear that the Luzon and Palawan varieties have started to develop in different ways in the 1500s, way before the Spaniards conquered what we know today as the Philippines. This puts Luzon and Palawan as the oldest regions where Baybayin was and is used. It is also notable that the script used in Pampanga had already developed special shapes for four letters by the early 1600s, different from the ones used elsewhere. It is equally important to note that this ancient Kapampangan script is very different from the experiment called \"modern Kulitan\" which was taught in the late 1990s. So we can say that there were three somewhat distinct varieties of a single script in the late 1500s and 1600s, though they could not be described as three different scripts any more than the different styles of Latin script across medieval or modern Europe with their slightly different sets of letters and spelling systems.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\">[https://www.quora.com/Is-Baybayin-really-a-writing-system-in-the-entire-pre-hispanic-Philippines-Whats-the-basis-for-making-it-a-national-writing-system-if-pre-hispanic-kingdoms-weren-t-homogenous/answer/Christopher-Ray-Miller?share=71e5e264&srid=hyV8\"]</ref>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\nAs mentioned earlier, the advent of the Baybayin in the Philippines was considered a fairly recent event in the 16th century and the Filipinos at that time believed that their Baybayin came from [[Borneo]]. This theory is supported by the fact that the Baybayin script could not show syllable final consonants, which are very common in most Philippine languages. (See Final Consonants) This indicates that the script was recently acquired and had not yet been modified to suit the needs of its new users. Also, this same shortcoming in the Baybayin was a normal trait of the script and language of the Bugis people of [[Sulawesi]], which is directly south of the Philippines and directly east of Borneo. Thus most scholars believe that the Baybayin may have descended from the Buginese script or, more likely, a related lost script from the island of Sulawesi.\n\nAlthough one of [[Ferdinand Magellan]]'s shipmates, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], wrote that the people of the Visayas were not literate in 1521, the Baybayin had already arrived there by 1567 when [[Miguel L\u00f3pez de Legazpi]] reported that, \"They [the Visayans] have their letters and characters like those of the [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], from whom they learned them.\" Then, a century later [[Francisco Alcina]] wrote about:\n\n{{Quote\n|text=The characters of these natives, or, better said, those that have been in use for a few years in these parts, an art which was communicated to them from the Tagalogs, and the latter learned it from the Borneans who came from the great island of Borneo to [[Manila]], with whom they have considerable traffic...\nFrom these Borneans the Tagalogs learned their characters, and from them the Visayans, so they call them Moro characters or letters because the Moros taught them... [the Visayans] learned [the Moros'] letters, which many use today, and the women much more than the men, which they write and read more readily than the latter.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n}} \n\nAccording to other sources, the Visayans derived their writing system from those of [[Toba Batak people|Toba]], Borneo, Celebes, Ancient Java, and from the Edicts of the ancient Indian emperor [[Ashoka]].<ref>[https://archive.org/details/lasislasvisayase00reye Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, ''Las Islas Visayas en la \u00c9poca de la Conquista'' (Segunda edici\u00f3n), Manila: 1889, Tipo-Litograf\u00eda de Chofk\u00e9  y C.a, p. 82.]</ref>\n\nBaybayin was noted by the Spanish priest [[Pedro Chirino]] in 1604 and [[Antonio de Morga]] in 1609 to be known by most Filipinos, and was generally used for personal writings, poetry, etc. However, according to [[William Henry Scott (historian)|William Henry Scott]], there were some [[datus]] from the 1590s who could not sign affidavits or oaths, and witnesses who could not sign land deeds in the 1620s.<ref>{{Harvnb|Scott|1984|p=210}}</ref><ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\">[https://www.esquiremag.ph/culture/the-life-death-and-resurgence-of-baybayin-a1962-20170811-lfrm The Life, Death, and Resurgence of Baybayin]</ref>\n\nThe only modern scripts that descended directly from the original Baybayin script through natural development are the Palaw'an script inherited from the Tagbanwa in Palawan, the Buhid and Hanun\u00f3o scripts in Mindoro, the ancient Kapampangan script used in the 1600s but has been supplanted by a constructed script called \"modern Kulitan\", and of course the Tagalog script. There is no evidence for any other regional scripts; like the modern Kulitan experiment in Pampanga. Any other scripts are recent inventions based on one or another of the abecedaries from old Spanish descriptions.<ref name=\"QuoraBaybayin\"/>{{Better source|date=March 2020}}\n\n==Characteristics==\n[[File:Filipino sword filipino dha baybayin script.JPG|thumb|right|A Filipino [[Dha (sword)|dha]] sword inscribed with Baybayin characters.]]\nThe writing system is an [[abugida]] system using consonant-vowel combinations. Each character, written in its basic form, is a consonant ending with the vowel \"A\". To produce consonants ending with the other vowel sounds, a mark is placed either above the consonant (to produce an \"E\" or \"I\" sound) or below the consonant (to produce an \"O\" or \"U\" sound). The mark is called a ''kudlit''. The kudlit does not apply to stand-alone vowels. Vowels themselves have their own glyphs.\n\nThere is only one symbol or character for '''Da''' or '''Ra''' as they were allophones in many [[languages of the Philippines]], where '''Ra''' occurred in intervocalic positions and '''Da''' occurred elsewhere. The grammatical rule has survived in modern Filipino, so that when a '''d''' is between two vowels, it becomes an '''r''', as in the words ''dang\u00e1l'' (honour) and ''marang\u00e1l'' (honourable), or ''dunong'' (knowledge) and ''marunong'' (knowledgeable), and even ''raw'' for ''daw'' (he said, she said, they said, it was said, allegedly, reportedly, supposedly) and ''rin'' for ''din'' (also, too) after vowels.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/> This variant of the script is not used for Ilokano, Pangasinan, Bikolano, and other Philippine languages to name a few, as these languages have separate symbols for '''Da''' and '''Ra'''.\n\nAs well the same letter is used to represent the '''Pa''' and '''Fa''' (or '''Pha'''), '''Ba''' and '''Va''', '''Sa''' and '''Za''' which were also allophonic.\n\nBeside these phonetic considerations, the script is monocameral and does not use letter case for distinguishing proper names or initials of words starting sentences.\n\n===Writing materials===\nTraditionally, baybayin was written upon [[palm leaves]] with styli or upon [[bamboo]] with knives.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KFQOAQAAMAAJ&q=baybayin+palm+leaves&dq=baybayin+palm+leaves&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y|title=Filipinas|last=|first=|date=1995-01-01|publisher=Filipinas Pub.|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=60|language=en|quote=|via=|issue=36-44}}</ref> The curved shape of the letter forms of baybayin is a direct result of this heritage; straight lines would have torn the leaves.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|title=Cochin Palm Leaf Fiscals|date=2001-04-01|website=Princely States Report > Archived Features|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170113205231/http://princelystates.com/ArchivedFeatures/fa-03-05.shtml|archive-date=2017-01-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> During the era of Spanish colonization, most baybayin began being written with ink on [[paper]], but in some parts of the country the traditional art form has been retained.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://bakitwhy.com/articles/fundamentals-baybayin|title=The Fundamentals of Baybayin|last=Lazaro|first=David|date=2009-10-23|work=|newspaper=BakitWhy|language=en|access-date=2017-01-25|via=The Bathala Project}}</ref>\n\n===Significant examples===\n[[File:Monreal stone.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Monreal Stones|Monreal stone]], which is the centerpiece at the Baybayin section of the [[National Museum of Anthropology (Manila)|National Museum of Anthropology]].]]\nThe Ticao stone inscription, also known as the Monreal stone or Rizal stone, is a limestone tablet that contains Baybayin characters.

Because of this, Francisco L\u00f3pez introduced his own kudlit in 1620, called a ''sabat'' or ''krus'', that cancelled the implicit ''a'' vowel sound. The kudlit was in the form of a \"+\" sign,<ref name=\"bibingka\">[http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm Tagalog script] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080823214513/http://www.bibingka.com/dahon/tagalog/tagalog.htm |date=August 23, 2008 }}. Accessed September 2, 2008.</ref> in reference to [[Christianity]]. This cross-shaped kudlit functions exactly the same as the ''[[virama]]'' in the [[Devanagari]] script of [[India]]. In fact, Unicode calls this kudlit the ''Tagalog Sign Virama''. See sample above in Characteristics Section.\n\nThe confusion over the use of marks may have contributed to the demise of Baybayin over time. The desire of Francisco Lopez (1620) for Baybayin to conform to the Spanish ''alfabetos'' paved the way for the invention of a cross sign. Such introduction was uniquely a standalone event that was blindly copied by succeeding writers up to the present. Sevilla and Alvero (1939) said, \"The marks required in the formation of syllables are: the tuldok or point (.) and the bawas or minus sign (-).\" The bawas or minus sign (-) that is placed before the script to remove the paired vowel appears more logical than the cross or plus sign (+) of Lopez.<ref name=\"EsquiremagPHbaybayin\"/>\n\n==== \"Nga\" character ====\nA single character represented \"'''nga'''\". The current version of the Filipino alphabet still retains \"'''ng'''\" as a [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]].\n\n==== Punctuation ====\nWords written in baybayin were written in a continuous flow, and the only form of punctuation was a single vertical or slanted line ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1735}}'''), or more often, a pair of vertical or slanted lines ('''{{Script|Tglg|\u1736}}'''). These lines (similar to [[danda]] signs in other Indic abugidas) fulfill the function of a comma, period, or unpredictably separate sets of words.<ref name=\"baybayin\"/>\n\n==Usage==\n\n===Pre-colonial and colonial usage===\nBaybayin historically was used in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and to a lesser extent [[Kapampangan language|Kapampangan]] speaking areas. Its use spread to [[Ilokano language|Ilokanos]] when the Spanish promoted its use with the printing of Bibles. Related scripts, such as [[Hanunoo script|Hanun\u00f3o]], [[Buhid script|Buhid]], and [[Tagbanwa alphabet|Tagbanwa]] are still used today, along with the [[Kulitan alphabet]].\nAmong the earliest literature on the orthography of [[Visayan languages]] were those of Jesuit priest Ezguerra with his {{lang|es|Arte de la lengua bisaya}} in 1747<ref>{{cite book\n| title      = Arte de la lengua bisaya de la provincia de Leyte\n| author     = P.

However, when the Spaniards succeeded in colonizing the islands, they abolished the practice and burned all documents they captured from the natives while forcefully establishing a Roman Catholic-based rule. Records on Philippine seals were forgotten until in the 1970s when actual ancient seals made of ivory were found in an archaeological site in [[Butuan]]. The seal, now known as the [[Butuan Ivory Seal]], has been declared as a National Cultural Treasure. The seal is inscribed with the word \"Butwan\" through a native ''baybayin'' script. The discovery of the seal proved the theory that pre-colonial Filipinos, or at least in coastal areas, used seals on paper. Before the discovery of the seal, it was only thought that ancient Filipinos used bamboo, metal, bark, and leaves for writing. The presence of paper documents in the classical era of the Philippines is also backed by a research of Otley Beyer stating that Spanish friars 'boasted' about burning ancient Philippine documents with ''baybayin'' inscriptions, one of the reasons why ancient documents from the Philippines are almost non-existent in present time. The ivory seal is now housed at the [[National Museum of the Philippines]]. Nowadays, younger generations are trying to revive the usage of seals, notably in signing pieces of art such as drawings, paintings, and literary works.<ref name=\"NMPHseal\">[http://www.nationalmuseum.gov.ph/nationalmuseumbeta/Collections/Archaeo/Seal.html Nation Museum Collections Seals]</ref>\n\n===Modern Usage===\n[[File:Philippine passport (2016 edition) Baybayin.jpg|thumb|250px|Philippine passport (2016 edition) showing the Baybayin script]]\n\nA number of legislative bills have been proposed periodically aiming to promote the writing system, among them is the \"National Writing System Act\" (House Bill 1022<ref>{{cite web| url=http://congress.gov.ph/legisdocs/basic_17/HB01022.pdf|title=House Bill 1022|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#House of Representatives|17th Philippine House of Representatives]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=4 July 2016}}</ref>/Senate Bill 433<ref>{{cite web| url=https://senate.gov.ph/lis/bill_res.aspx?congress=17&q=SBN-433|title=Senate Bill 433|publisher=[[17th Congress of the Philippines#Senate|17th Philippine Senate]]|accessdate=24 September 2018|date=19 July 2016}}</ref>).

Hetfield is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar duties and solos, both live and in the studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in October 1981 after answering an advertisement by drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] in the [[Los Angeles]] newspaper ''The Recycler''. Metallica has won nine [[Grammy Award]]s and released ten studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays and 24 singles.\n\nIn 2009, Hetfield was ranked at no. 8 in [[Joel McIver]]'s book ''The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/im-over-my-metallica-demons-says-dave-mustaine|title='I'm Over My Metallica Demons,' Says Dave Mustaine|publisher=Claasic Rock|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074823/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/im-over-my-metallica-demons-says-dave-mustaine/|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> and no. 24 by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time. In ''[[Guitar World]]'s'' poll, Hetfield was placed as the 19th greatest guitarist of all time, as well as being placed second (along with Metallica lead guitarist [[Kirk Hammett]]) in ''The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists'' poll of the same magazine.

His parents divorced in 1976 when Hetfield was 13. They were very strict [[Christian Science|Christian Scientists]], and in accordance with their beliefs, they strongly disapproved of medicine or any other medical treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration for many of Hetfield's lyrics during his career with Metallica, most notably in the songs \"[[Dyers Eve]]\" and \"[[The God That Failed (song)|The God That Failed]]\" from ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' and [[Metallica (album)|The Black Album]] respectively. Cynthia died of cancer in 1979 when Hetfield was 16 years old. After the death of his mother, Hetfield went to live with his older half-brother David.

The finalized line-up of the band became Hetfield (lead vocals and rhythm guitar), [[Lars Ulrich]] (drums), [[Dave Mustaine]] (lead guitar), and [[Ron McGovney]] (bass) who was soon replaced by [[Cliff Burton]]. Hetfield referred to their early sound as [[power metal]].

For the first two albums, he used [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] heads and cabinets, with occasional effects. The specific Marshall that he used for ''Kill 'Em All'' was stolen after a concert prior to the recording of ''Ride the Lightning''; Hetfield was extremely upset by the theft, as his mother had helped him purchase the amplifier before her death.  In 1985, for the recording of ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', he and [[Kirk Hammett]] each bought a [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ amplifier (the preamp sections of which were connected to Marshall power amplifiers), and since then he has mostly used [[Mesa/Boogie]]s, including the Triaxis and Rectifier models. Around the time of ''[[St. Anger]]'', Hetfield began using the [[Diezel|Diezel VH4]] head. The majority of his clean tones come from a [[Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier]], although many different amplifiers have been used over the years.\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with [[Randall Amplifiers]] to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. [[Kirk Hammett]] currently has two prototypes, and Hetfield will eventually be receiving one.\n\nThe amplifiers currently used on tour by Hetfield are:\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] TriAxis [[preamp]] (x4)\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] Simul-Class 2:90 power amp (x2)\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] Triple Rectifier heads\n* [[Diezel|Diezel VH4]] heads\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] 4x12 cabinets with [[Celestion|Celestion V30]] speakers in [[Isolation cabinet (guitar)|isolation cabinets]]\n* [[Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier|Roland JC-120]] combo amplifiers\n\n===Effects===\nTo avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hetfield keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers and his guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage. The pedal controller allows him to change between different effect pedals and amplifiers.\n\nHetfield's live rig in 2008 included:\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[TC Electronic]] G-Major\n* [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] DM4\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] Custom Graphic EQ\n* [[MXR]] Phase 100\n* ATI NanoAmp SUM 100\n* Klon Centaur\n* [[Boss Corporation|Boss]] NS-2 Noise Suppressor\n{{col-2}}\n* Voodoo Lab Ground Control Pro\n* Voodoo Lab GCX Audio Switcher (x2)\n* Voodoo Lab Pedal Power 2 Plus\n* [[Dbx, Inc.|DBX]] 1074 Quad Gate\n* [[Behringer]] Multigate Pro\n{{col-end}}\n\nIn 2010, a [[Line 6 (company)|Line 6]] [[effects unit]] was added to the list, along with the TC Electronic unit, perhaps indicating that this had replaced his stompboxes.\n\n===Accessories===\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-2}}\n* [[Ernie Ball]] Power Slinky strings (.11      \u2013.48)\n* [[Dunlop Manufacturing|Dunlop]] James Hetfield Black Fang 1.14mm picks\n* 3\" Levy's Straps\n* [[Peterson Strobe 420 Tuner]]\n* [[EMG, Inc.|EMG]] JH Het Set\n* [[Shure]] UR-4D Wireless Equipment\n* Furman AR Pro Power Conditioner\n{{col-end}}\nIn addition, Hetfield uses [[Shure]] Super 55 microphones for vocals.\n\n==Discography==\n\n===Metallica===\n{{Main|Metallica discography}}\n\n==Filmography==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Film\n|-\n!

Hetfield is mainly known for his intricate rhythm playing, but occasionally performs lead guitar duties and solos, both live and in the studio. Hetfield co-founded Metallica in October 1981 after answering an advertisement by drummer [[Lars Ulrich]] in the [[Los Angeles]] newspaper ''The Recycler''. Metallica has won nine [[Grammy Award]]s and released ten studio albums, three live albums, four extended plays and 24 singles.\n\nIn 2009, Hetfield was ranked at no. 8 in [[Joel McIver]]'s book ''The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/im-over-my-metallica-demons-says-dave-mustaine|title='I'm Over My Metallica Demons,' Says Dave Mustaine|publisher=Claasic Rock|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716074823/http://www.classicrockmagazine.com/news/im-over-my-metallica-demons-says-dave-mustaine/|archivedate=July 16, 2011}}</ref> and no. 24 by ''[[Hit Parader]]'' on their list of the 100 Greatest Metal Vocalists of All Time.

They were very strict [[Christian Science|Christian Scientists]], and in accordance with their beliefs, they strongly disapproved of medicine or any other medical treatment and remained loyal to their faith, even as Cynthia was dying from cancer. This upbringing became the inspiration for many of Hetfield's lyrics during his career with Metallica, most notably in the songs \"[[Dyers Eve]]\" and \"[[The God That Failed (song)|The God That Failed]]\" from ''[[...And Justice for All (album)|...And Justice for All]]'' and [[Metallica (album)|The Black Album]] respectively. Cynthia died of cancer in 1979 when Hetfield was 16 years old. After the death of his mother, Hetfield went to live with his older half-brother David.

Hetfield referred to their early sound as [[power metal]].

Hetfield was the victim of a pyrotechnics accident during the song \"Fade to Black\", in which a pyrotechnic charge reacted. Hetfield's guitar protected him from the full force of the blast; however, the reaction struck his left side, burning his hand, arm, eyebrows, face and hair. He suffered second and third-degree burns, but was back on stage 17 days later, although his guitar duties were delegated to former guitar tech and [[Metal Church]] guitarist [[John Marshall (guitarist)|John Marshall]] for four weeks while he made a full recovery.<ref>{{cite news | first= David | last= Peisner | title= Rock Stars Who've Caught Fire Onstage! | date= February 2007 | publisher= Blender Magazine Online | url= http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2529&src=blender_ed | accessdate= February 27, 2007 | url-status= dead | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184227/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?ID=2529&src=blender_ed | archivedate= September 30, 2007 | df= mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nHetfield also suffered a broken arm a number of times while skateboarding, which prevented him from playing guitar on stage, and subsequently caused Hetfield's management company, ''Q Prime'', to put a clause in Hetfield's contract, forbidding him to ride a skateboard while Metallica was touring.<ref>[http://www.musicfanclubs.org/metallica/jaymz.htm Music Fan Clubs Metallica \u2013 Metallica > The Band > James Hetfield].

He did basic warm-up exercises to piano keys with his vocal coach, who also gave him a cassette tape of the piano warm-up for future use. Hetfield still uses the same cassette he was given in the early 1990s to this day before any live performance or any recording Metallica does.

He rejoined the band after seven months in rehab and four months recovering with his family. He is now clean and sober, and is determined to remain so, all of which is featured in ''Some Kind of Monster''.<ref name=\"metallica.com\"/> ''Some Kind of Monster'' also shows the making of the ''St. Anger'' album, and documents the various conflicts and issues the band were facing at the time including the departure of [[Jason Newsted]], alcoholism, family commitments, and the future of the band with many in the rock press questioning whether the band would even still be together to see the completion of the ''St. Anger'' album.\n\nHetfield and Metallica addressed their need for a new bassist by recruiting [[Robert Trujillo]], who formerly served under the wing of [[Ozzy Osbourne]]. It was more of a swap since Ozzy Osbourne surprisingly recruited Jason Newsted shortly after Trujillo's transfer. The new line-up has continued to make music and tour worldwide. Metallica's ninth studio album, ''[[Death Magnetic]]'', was released on September 12, 2008. Like ''St. Anger'' and every album of original material released by Metallica since 1991's ''Metallica'', ''Death Magnetic'' went to #1 on the Billboard charts in over 30 countries during its first week of release.<ref>[http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/906/906286p1.html Metallica \u2013 \"My Apocalypse\" Review \u2013 Music Review at IGN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080901020547/http://uk.music.ign.com/articles/906/906286p1.html |date=September 1, 2008 }}.

To date, Hetfield has had six signature guitars with the company. However, Hetfield often uses guitars from [[Gibson Guitars|Gibson]] and other companies instead of ESP despite his endorsement.\n\nSome of Hetfield's guitars over the years have included:\n<!-- Do not add guitars to this list unless reliably sourced -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n! class=unsortable width=10% |Date purchased\n! class=unsortable width=30%% |Guitar & \"''motto''\"\n! class=unsortable width=60% |Note\n|-\n| Unknown\n| [[Gibson SG]] Standard (1969 model)\n| Hetfield purchased the guitar from a mutual member of the schools jazz band.<ref name=\"GG\">{{cite web|url=https://www.groundguitar.com/james-hetfield-guitars-and-gear/|title=Metallica\u2019s James Hetfield\u2019s Guitars and Gear from the book ''The Art of James Hetfield'' |publisher=Ground Guitar  |date= |accessdate=October 18, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n| 1980\n| [[Electra Guitars|Electra Flying V]]\n| Purchased for $200 in 1980 and used on ''[[Kill 'Em All]]''.

For the first two albums, he used [[Marshall Amplification|Marshall]] heads and cabinets, with occasional effects. The specific Marshall that he used for ''Kill 'Em All'' was stolen after a concert prior to the recording of ''Ride the Lightning''; Hetfield was extremely upset by the theft, as his mother had helped him purchase the amplifier before her death.  In 1985, for the recording of ''[[Master of Puppets]]'', he and [[Kirk Hammett]] each bought a [[Mesa/Boogie]] Mark IIC+ amplifier (the preamp sections of which were connected to Marshall power amplifiers), and since then he has mostly used [[Mesa/Boogie]]s, including the Triaxis and Rectifier models. Around the time of ''[[St. Anger]]'', Hetfield began using the [[Diezel|Diezel VH4]] head. The majority of his clean tones come from a [[Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier]], although many different amplifiers have been used over the years.\n\nIn December 2011, it was announced by Fortin Amps that they would team up with [[Randall Amplifiers]] to start a new line of tube amplifiers based on the Fortin Meathead amplifier. [[Kirk Hammett]] currently has two prototypes, and Hetfield will eventually be receiving one.\n\nThe amplifiers currently used on tour by Hetfield are:\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] TriAxis [[preamp]] (x4)\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] Simul-Class 2:90 power amp (x2)\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] Triple Rectifier heads\n* [[Diezel|Diezel VH4]] heads\n* [[Mesa/Boogie]] 4x12 cabinets with [[Celestion|Celestion V30]] speakers in [[Isolation cabinet (guitar)|isolation cabinets]]\n* [[Roland JC-120 Jazz Chorus Guitar Amplifier|Roland JC-120]] combo amplifiers\n\n===Effects===\nTo avoid problems with pedals being damaged during live performances, Hetfield keeps his effect pedals in a rack along with his amplifiers and his guitar technician controls them through a pedalboard sidestage.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings.

architectural significance include the [[Treasury Building, Brisbane|Treasury Building]], [[Brisbane City Hall|City Hall]], [[Customs House, Brisbane|Customs House]] and the [[Land Administration Building]]. \n\nBrisbane is the origin of a distinctive architectural style known as [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]] archtecture, which developed in the 1840s and characterises the majority of pre-war homes built in the metropolitan area. Queenslander homes typically feature timber construction with large [[verandah]]s, [[gable roof|gabled]] corrugated iron roofs, high ceilings. Most of these houses are elevated on stumps (also called \"stilts\"), traditionally built of timber, which allow for a void under the houses which aid in cooling. Queenslander houses are considered iconic to Brisbane and are typically sold at a significant premium to equivalent modern houses.The relatively low cost of timber in south-east Queensland meant that until recently, most residences were constructed of timber, rather than brick or stone. Early legislation decreed a minimum size for residential blocks causing few [[terrace house]]s being constructed in Brisbane. The high-density housing that historically existed came in the form of miniature [[Queenslander (architecture)|Queenslander]]-style houses which resemble the much larger traditional styles, but are sometimes only one-quarter the size. These houses are most common in the inner-city suburbs.\n\nBrisbane is home to several of [[List of tallest buildings in Australia|Australia's tallest buildings]] and it is ranked among [[List of cities with the most skyscrapers|world cities with the most skyscrapers]]. All of Brisbane's skyscrapers (buildings with a height greater than 150 metres) are located within the CBD, with large numbers of high-rise buildings also proliferating in the inner suburbs of South Brisbane, Kangaroo Point, Fortitude Valley, Newstead, Teneriffe, New Farm, Bowen Hills, Spring Hill, Milton, Auchenflower, Toowong, Taringa, St Lucia, West End and Woolloongabba. Brisbane's 91-metre City Hall was the city's tallest building for decades after its completion in 1930 and was finally surpassed in 1970, which marked the beginning of the widespread construction of high-rise buildings. [[List of tallest buildings in Brisbane|Brisbane's tallest building]] is currently [[Brisbane Skytower]], which has a height of 270 metres.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://buildingdb.ctbuh.org/?do=create>|title=CTBUH Tall Building Database \u2013 The Skyscraper Center|author=CTBUH|work=Skyscrapercenter}}</ref> \n\n==Governance==\n{{Main|City of Brisbane|Logan City|Moreton Bay Region|City of Ipswich|Redland City|Scenic Rim Region|Government of Queensland}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = left\n| direction = vertical\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Escudo de Brisbane.png\n| width1   = 120\n| caption1 = [[Coat of arms of Brisbane|City of Brisbane coat of arms]]\n| image2   = Flag of Brisbane.svg\n| width2   = 120\n| caption2 = [[Flag of Brisbane|City of Brisbane flag]]}}\n\n{{Multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| header    =\n| header_align = left/right/center\n| header_background =\n| footer    =[[Brisbane City Hall]] home to the [[Museum of Brisbane]] and [[Parliament House, Brisbane|Parliament House]], home of the [[Parliament of Queensland]]\n| footer_align = left/right/center\n| footer_background =\n| width    =\n| image1   = Brisbane Town Hall.jpg\n| width1   = 100\n| caption1 =\n| image2   = Christmas tree in 2019 at Parliament House, Brisbane, Queensland 03.jpg\n| width2   = 200\n| caption2 = }}\n\nUnlike other Australian capital cities, a large portion of the greater metropolitan area, or Greater Capital City Statistical Area (GCCSA) of Brisbane is controlled by a single [[Local government in Australia|local government area]], the [[City of Brisbane]].

The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.\n\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields.

It contains a variety of calorific gases including [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other volatile [[hydrocarbons]], together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.\n\nMost town \"gashouses\" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The [[coal tar]] (or [[asphalt]]) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.\n\n===Biogas===\n{{Main|Biogas}}\n[[Methanogen]]ic ''Archaea'' are responsible for almost all biological sources of methane, though [[methylphosphonate]]-degrading ''Bacteria'' produce an as-yet not fully quantified fraction of biogenic methane, particularly in the oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DM Karl, L Beversdorf, KM Bj\u00f6rkman, MJ Church, A Martinez, EF DeLong |year=2008 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=473\u2013478 |title=Aerobic production of methane in the sea|doi=10.1038/ngeo234 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..473K }}</ref> Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including [[termite]]s, [[ruminant]]s, and cultivated crops.

Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\n\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas\u2014Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline#v=onepage&q=The%20presence%20of%20CO2%20will%20lower%20the%20energy%20level%20of%20the%20gas%20below%20requirements%20for%20the%20pipeline&f=false|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref>  Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations. Co-firing landfill gas with natural gas improves combustion, which lowers emissions.\n\nBiogas, and especially landfill gas, are already used in some areas, but their use could be greatly expanded.

Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the \"frack,\" oil or gas is extracted and 30\u201370% of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells. This [[produced water]] often has a high content of salt and other dissolved minerals that occur in the formation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Yeboah | first1 = N.N.N. | last2 = Burns | first2 = S.E. | year = 2011 | title = Geological Disposal of Energy-Related Waste | url = | journal = KSCE Journal of Civil Engineering | volume = 15 | issue = 4| pages = 701\u2013702 | doi = 10.1007/s12205-011-0010-x }}</ref>\n\nThe volume of water used to hydraulically fracture wells varies according to the hydraulic fracturing technique.

In order to assist consumers in detecting [[leak]]s, an [[odorizer]] with a scent similar to rotten eggs, [[tert-Butylthiol]] (t-butyl mercaptan), is added. Sometimes a related compound, [[tetrahydrothiophene|thiophane]], may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry.  This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST\u2014AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839\u2013848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>\n\n===Risk of explosion===\n[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.\nThe gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref>  However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\n\n===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===\nNatural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns.

Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L.

Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\n\nA [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\n\n===Elsewhere===\nOutside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI.

The small, light gas carbon chains came out of solution as the extracted fluids underwent pressure reduction from the [[Petroleum reservoir|reservoir]] to the surface, similar to uncapping a soft drink bottle where the carbon dioxide [[effervesce]]s. The gas was often viewed as a by-product, a hazard, and a disposal problem in active oil fields.  The large volumes produced could not be utilized until relatively expensive [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[natural gas storage|storage]] facilities were constructed to deliver the gas to consumer markets.\n\nUntil the early part of the 20th century, most natural gas associated with oil was either simply released or [[Gas flare|burned off]] at oil fields. [[Gas venting]] and [[production flaring]] are still practised in modern times, but efforts are ongoing around the world to retire them, and to replace them with other commercially viable and useful alternatives.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/partnership/?p=1532 |title=Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://climateinitiativesplatform.org/index.php/Zero_Routine_Flaring_by_2030 |title=UN Climate Initiatives Platform - Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 |publisher=[[United Nations]] |accessdate=2019-12-29}}</ref>  Unwanted gas (or [[stranded gas reserve|stranded gas]] without a market)  is often returned to the reservoir with 'injection' wells while awaiting a possible future market or to re-pressurize the formation, which can enhance oil extraction rates from other wells. In regions with a high natural gas demand (such as the US), [[Pipeline transport|pipelines]] are constructed when it is economically feasible to transport gas from a wellsite to an [[end consumer]].\n\nIn addition to transporting gas via pipelines for use in power generation, other end uses for natural gas include export as [[LNG|liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) or conversion of natural gas into other liquid products via [[gas to liquids]] (GTL) technologies. GTL technologies can convert natural gas into liquids products such as gasoline, diesel or jet fuel. A variety of GTL technologies have been developed, including [[Fischer\u2013Tropsch]] (F\u2013T), methanol to gasoline (MTG) and [[syngas to gasoline plus]] (STG+). F\u2013T produces a synthetic crude that can be further refined into finished products, while MTG can produce synthetic gasoline from natural gas.

The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the gas reservoir get depleted. One method to deal with this problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the [[Natural gas processing|gas plant]] is to collect this condensate.

It contains a variety of calorific gases including [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[methane]], and other volatile [[hydrocarbons]], together with small quantities of non-calorific gases such as [[carbon dioxide]] and [[nitrogen]], and is used in a similar way to natural gas. This is a historical technology and is not usually economically competitive with other sources of fuel gas today.\n\nMost town \"gashouses\" located in the eastern US in the late 19th and early 20th centuries were simple by-product [[coke (fuel)|coke]] ovens that heated bituminous coal in air-tight chambers. The gas driven off from the coal was collected and distributed through networks of pipes to residences and other buildings where it was used for cooking and lighting. (Gas heating did not come into widespread use until the last half of the 20th century.) The [[coal tar]] (or [[asphalt]]) that collected in the bottoms of the gashouse ovens was often used for roofing and other waterproofing purposes, and when mixed with sand and gravel was used for paving streets.\n\n===Biogas===\n{{Main|Biogas}}\n[[Methanogen]]ic ''Archaea'' are responsible for almost all biological sources of methane, though [[methylphosphonate]]-degrading ''Bacteria'' produce an as-yet not fully quantified fraction of biogenic methane, particularly in the oceans.<ref>{{cite journal |author=DM Karl, L Beversdorf, KM Bj\u00f6rkman, MJ Church, A Martinez, EF DeLong |year=2008 |journal=Nature Geoscience |volume=1 |issue=7 |pages=473\u2013478 |title=Aerobic production of methane in the sea|doi=10.1038/ngeo234 |bibcode=2008NatGe...1..473K }}</ref> Some live in symbiotic relationships with other life forms, including [[termite]]s, [[ruminant]]s, and cultivated crops.

Landfill gas is created by decomposition of waste in [[landfill]] sites. Excluding [[water vapor]], about half of landfill gas is methane and most of the rest is [[carbon dioxide]], with small amounts of [[nitrogen]], [[oxygen]], and [[hydrogen]], and variable trace amounts of [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[siloxane]]s. If the gas is not removed, the pressure may get so high that it works its way to the surface, causing damage to the landfill structure, unpleasant odor, vegetation die-off, and an [[explosion]] hazard. The gas can be vented to the atmosphere, [[gas flare|flared]] or burned to produce [[electricity]] or [[heat]]. Biogas can also be produced by separating [[organic material]]s from waste that otherwise goes to landfills. This method is more efficient than just capturing the landfill gas it produces. [[Anaerobic lagoon]]s produce biogas from manure, while biogas reactors can be used for manure or plant parts. Like landfill gas, biogas is mostly methane and carbon dioxide, with small amounts of nitrogen, oxygen and hydrogen. However, with the exception of pesticides, there are usually lower levels of contaminants.\n\nLandfill gas cannot be distributed through utility natural gas pipelines unless it is cleaned up to less than 3% {{chem|C|O|2}}, and a few parts per million {{chem|H|2|S}}, because {{chem|C|O|2}} and {{chem|H|2|S}} corrode the pipelines.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |title=Interstate Natural Gas\u2014Quality Specifications & Interchangeability |date= |accessdate=6 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812145240/http://www.beg.utexas.edu/energyecon/lng/documents/CEE_Interstate_Natural_Gas_Quality_Specifications_and_Interchangeability.pdf |archivedate=12 August 2011 |df=dmy-all}}</ref> The presence of {{chem|C|O|2}} will lower the energy level of the gas below requirements for the pipeline.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://courses.lumenlearning.com/geology/chapter/reading-natural-gas/|title=Reading: Natural Gas {{!}} Geology|website=courses.lumenlearning.com|access-date=2019-08-26}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UyqBDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA40&lpg=PA40&dq=The+presence+of+CO2+will+lower+the+energy+level+of+the+gas+below+requirements+for+the+pipeline#v=onepage&q=The%20presence%20of%20CO2%20will%20lower%20the%20energy%20level%20of%20the%20gas%20below%20requirements%20for%20the%20pipeline&f=false|title=Handbook of Natural Gas Analysis|last=Speight|first=James G.|date=2018-08-14|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781119240280|language=en}}</ref>  Siloxanes in the gas will form deposits in gas burners and need to be removed prior to entry into any gas distribution or transmission system. Consequently, it may be more economical to burn the gas on site or within a short distance of the landfill using a dedicated pipeline. Water vapor is often removed, even if the gas is burned on site.  If low temperatures condense water out of the gas, [[siloxanes]] can be lowered as well because they tend to condense out with the water vapor. Other non-methane components may also be removed to meet [[emission standard]]s, to prevent fouling of the equipment or for environmental considerations.

The high pressure water breaks up or \"fracks\" the rock, which releases gas from the rock formation. Sand and other particles are added to the water as a proppant to keep the fractures in the rock open, thus enabling the gas to flow into the casing and then to the surface. Chemicals are added to the fluid to perform such functions as reducing friction and inhibiting corrosion. After the \"frack,\" oil or gas is extracted and 30\u201370% of the frack fluid, i.e. the mixture of water, chemicals, sand, etc., flows back to the surface. Many gas-bearing formations also contain water, which will flow up the wellbore to the surface along with the gas, in both hydraulically fractured and non-hydraulically fractured wells.

In order to assist consumers in detecting [[leak]]s, an [[odorizer]] with a scent similar to rotten eggs, [[tert-Butylthiol]] (t-butyl mercaptan), is added. Sometimes a related compound, [[tetrahydrothiophene|thiophane]], may be used in the mixture. Situations in which an odorant that is added to natural gas can be detected by analytical instrumentation, but cannot be properly detected by an observer with a normal sense of smell, have occurred in the natural gas industry.  This is caused by odor masking, when one odorant overpowers the sensation of another. As of 2011, the industry is conducting research on the causes of odor masking.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Rawson | first1 = Nancy | last2 = Quraishi | first2 = Ali | last3 = Bruno | first3 = Thomas J. | year = 2011| title = Findings and Recommendations From the Joint NIST\u2014AGA Workshop on Odor Masking | journal = Journal of Research of the National Institute of Standards and Technology | volume = 116 | issue = 6| pages = 839\u2013848 | doi=10.6028/jres.116.026| pmid = 26989604 | pmc = 4551224 }}</ref>\n\n===Risk of explosion===\n[[File:Fire engines in Kiev, Ukraine.JPG|thumb|Gas network emergency vehicle responding to a major fire in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]]]]\n[[List of pipeline accidents|Explosions caused by natural]] [[gas leak]]s occur a few times each year.  Individual homes, small businesses and other structures are most frequently affected when an internal leak builds up gas inside the structure.  Frequently, the blast is powerful enough to significantly damage a building but leave it standing.  In these cases, the people inside tend to have minor to moderate injuries.  Occasionally, the gas can collect in high enough quantities to cause a deadly explosion, disintegrating one or more buildings in the process.   Many building codes now forbid the installation of gas pipes inside cavity walls and/or below floor boards to mitigate against this risk.\nThe gas usually dissipates readily outdoors, but can sometimes collect in dangerous quantities if flow rates are high enough.  From 1994 through 2013, the United States had 745 serious incidents with gas distribution, causing 278 fatalities and 1059 injuries, with $110,658,083 in property damage.<ref>https://www.phmsa.dot.gov/data-and-statistics/pipeline/data-and-statistics-overview</ref>  However, considering the tens of millions of structures that use the fuel, the individual risk of using natural gas is very low.\n\n===Risk of carbon monoxide inhalation===\nNatural gas heating systems may cause [[carbon monoxide poisoning]] if unvented or poorly vented. In 2011, natural gas furnaces, space heaters, water heaters and stoves were blamed for 11 carbon monoxide deaths in the US. Another 22 deaths were attributed to appliances running on liquified petroleum gas, and 17 deaths on gas of unspecified type. Improvements in natural gas furnace designs have greatly reduced CO poisoning concerns. [[Carbon monoxide detector|Detectors]] are also available that warn of carbon monoxide and/or explosive gas (methane, propane, etc.).<ref>US Consumer Product Safety Commission, [http://www.cpsc.gov/Global/Research-and-Statistics/Injury-Statistics/Carbon-Monoxide-Posioning/NonFireCarbonMonoxideDeathsAssociatedwiththeUseofConsumerProducts2011AnnualEstimatesSept2014.pdf Non-Fire Carbon Monoxide Deaths, 2011 Annual Estimate], September 2014.</ref>\n\n==Energy content, statistics, and pricing==\n{{Main|Natural gas prices}}\n{{see also|Billion cubic metres of natural gas}}\n[[File:Henry hub NG prices.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Natural gas prices]] at the [[Henry Hub]] in US dollars per million BTUs]]\n[[File:Natural Gas Price Comparison.png|thumb|upright=1.5|Comparison of natural gas prices in Japan, United Kingdom, and United States, 2007\u20132011]]\n\nQuantities of natural gas are measured in [[normal cubic meter]]s (cubic meter of gas at \"normal\" temperature {{convert|0|\u00b0C|\u00b0F|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|101.325|kPa|psi|abbr=on}}) or [[Standard cubic foot|standard cubic feet]] (cubic foot of gas at \"standard\" temperature {{convert|60.0|\u00b0F|\u00b0C|abbr=on}} and pressure {{convert|14.73|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}), {{convert|1|m3|cuft|4|spell=in|sp=us|disp=x|&nbsp;\u2248&nbsp;}}.

Gas sales to domestic consumers are often in units of 100 [[standard cubic feet]] (scf). [[Gas meter]]s measure the volume of gas used, and this is converted to therms by multiplying the volume by the energy content of the gas used during that period, which varies slightly over time. The typical annual consumption of a single family residence is 1,000 therms or one [[Residential Customer Equivalent]] (RCE). Wholesale transactions are generally done in [[decatherm]]s (Dth), thousand decatherms (MDth), or million decatherms (MMDth). A million decatherms is a trillion BTU, roughly a billion cubic feet of natural gas.\n\nThe price of natural gas varies greatly depending on location and type of consumer. In 2007, a price of $7 per 1000 cubic feet ({{convert|.007|$/cuft|$/m3|disp=out}}) was typical in the United States. The typical caloric value of natural gas is roughly 1,000&nbsp;BTU per cubic foot, depending on gas composition. This corresponds to around $7 per million BTU or around $7 per [[gigajoule]] (GJ). In April 2008, the wholesale price was $10 per 1000 cubic feet ($10/million BTU).<ref>{{cite web|author=James L. Williams |url=http://www.wtrg.com/daily/gasprice.html |title=NYMEX Natural Gas Futures |website=WTRG Economics|date=1998-10-02 |accessdate=2017-11-22}}</ref> The residential price varies from 50% to 300% more than the wholesale price.

Each contract is for 10,000 million BTU or {{convert|10|e9BTU|GJ|0|abbr=unit}}. Thus, if the price of gas is $10/million BTU on the NYMEX, the contract is worth $100,000.\n\n===Canada===\nCanada uses [[metric units|metric]] measure for internal trade of petrochemical products. Consequently, natural gas is sold by the gigajoule (GJ), cubic meter (m<sup>3</sup>) or thousand cubic meters (E3m3). Distribution infrastructure and meters almost always meter volume (cubic foot or cubic meter). Some jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, sell gas by volume only. Other jurisdictions, such as Alberta, gas is sold by the energy content (GJ). In these areas, almost all meters for residential and small commercial customers measure volume (m<sup>3</sup> or ft<sup>3</sup>), and billing statements include a multiplier to convert the volume to energy content of the local gas supply.\n\nA [[gigajoule]] (GJ) is a measure approximately equal to half a barrel (250&nbsp;lbs) of oil, or 1 million BTUs, or {{convert|1000|ft3|m3|disp=or|abbr=on}} of gas. The energy content of gas supply in Canada can vary from {{convert|37|to|43|MJ/m3|abbr=on}} depending on gas supply and processing between the wellhead and the customer.\n\n===Elsewhere===\nOutside of the European Union, the U.S., and Canada, natural gas is sold in gigajoule retail units. LNG (liquefied natural gas) and LPG ([[liquefied petroleum gas]]) are traded in metric tonnes (1,000&nbsp;kg) or million BTU as spot deliveries. Long term natural gas distribution contracts are signed in cubic meters, and LNG contracts are in metric tonnes. The LNG and LPG is transported by specialized [[LNG carrier|transport ships]], as the gas is liquified at [[cryogenic]] temperatures. The specification of each LNG/LPG cargo will usually contain the energy content, but this information is in general not available to the public.\n\nIn the Russian Federation, [[Gazprom]] sold approximately {{convert|250|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas in 2008. In 2013 they produced {{convert|487.4|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural and associated gas. Gazprom supplied Europe with {{convert|161.5|e9m3|abbr=off|sp=us}} of gas in 2013.\n\nIn August 2015, possibly the largest natural gas discovery in history was made and notified by an Italian gas company ENI. The energy company indicated that it has unearthed a [[Giant oil and gas fields|\"supergiant\" gas field]] in the Mediterranean Sea covering about {{convert|40|sqmi}}. It was also reported that the gas field could hold a potential {{convert|30|e12cuft|abbr=off|sp=us}} of natural gas. ENI said that the energy is about{{convert|5.5|e9BOE|abbr=~}}. The field was found in the deep waters off the northern coast of Egypt and ENI claims that it will be the largest ever in the Mediterranean and even the world.<ref>{{cite web |website=CNN Money |date=30 August 2015 |url=http://money.cnn.com/2015/08/30/news/companies/eni-gas-field/ |title=Natural gas discovery could be largest ever |first=David |last=Goldman}}</ref>\n\n==Natural gas as an asset class for institutional investors==\nResearch conducted by the [[World Pensions Council]] (WPC){{when|date=March 2014}} suggests that large US and Canadian pension funds and Asian and [[MENA]] area [[Sovereign wealth fund|SWF]] investors have become particularly active in the fields of natural gas and natural gas infrastructure, a trend started in 2005 by the formation of [[Scotia Gas Networks]] in the UK by [[OMERS]] and [[Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan]].{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n==Adsorbed natural gas (ANG)==\nNatural gas may be stored by adsorbing it to the porous solids called sorbents. The optimal condition for methane storage is at room temperature and atmospheric pressure. Pressures up to 4 MPa (about 40 times atmospheric pressure) will yield greater storage capacity. The most common sorbent used for ANG is activated carbon (AC), primarily in three forms: Activated Carbon Fiber (ACF), Powdered Activated Carbon (PAC), activated carbon monolith.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang|title=Adsorbed Natural Gas|work=scopeWe \u2013 a Virtual Engineer|accessdate=11 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109181802/http://scopewe.com/category/chemical-engineering/ang/|archive-date=9 November 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Energy|Renewable energy}}\n* [[Associated petroleum gas]]\n* [[Gas oil ratio]]\n* [[Natural gas by country]]\n* [[Peak gas]]\n* [[Power to gas]]\n* [[Renewable natural gas]]\n* [[Thiols]] universally used as the added odorant, mercaptan, to give a foul odor safety signal when gas leaks occur\n\n'''General:'''\n* [[World energy resources and consumption]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://mitei.mit.edu/publications/reports-studies/future-natural-gas The future of Natural Gas MIT study]\n* [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2341738 A Comparison between Shale Gas in China and Unconventional Fuel Development in the United States: Health, Water and Environmental Risks] by Paolo Farah and Riccardo Tremolada.
