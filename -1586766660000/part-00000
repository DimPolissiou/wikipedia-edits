It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}} \n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel. Between 1937-41, the ''Juntong'', working together with the Green Gang triad, carried out 150 assassinations of Chinese collaborators and 40 Japanese officers in Shanghai alone.<ref name=FJp356>{{harvnb|Fenby|2004|p=356}}</ref><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=552}}</ref> The ''Juntong'' favored assassinating Chinese collaborators over the Japanese partly because they were easier to kill as the Japanese tended to stick to certain enclaves, but mostly to prevent the Japanese from imposing any sort of ordered government in parts of China they had occupied.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=551}}</ref> Japan had occupied vast sections of China inhabited by millions of people requiring hundreds of thousands of civil servants to administer while the number of Japanese who were fluent in Mandarin or Cantonese was limited, and to a very large extent the Japanese depended upon Chinese collaborators to administer China for them.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp551/> Zhang Xiaolin, a leading member of the Green Gang who went over to the Japanese in 1937 was gunned down by a ''Juntong'' assassin.<ref name=FJp356/> In October 1938, [[Tang Shaoyi]], a former prime minister of the Republic of China who had agreed to serve the Japanese was killed at his home when a ''Juntong'' assassin posing as an antique dealer used the antique axe he was showing to Tang to smash in his head.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550>\n{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=550}} </ref> As the Japanese had no idea of who the ''Juntong'' assassins were, they resorted to executing at random innocent people who had nothing to do with the assassinations.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nOn Chinese New Year (18 February 1939), four ''Juntong'' agents assassinated Chen Lu, the foreign minister of the [[Wang Jingwei]] puppet government as he paid respects to his ancestors in his mansion in the French Concession of Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p550/> Led by the ''Juntong'' ace assassin Liu Geqing, he and three others entered Chen's mansion as two of his bodyguards let them in, machine-gunned Chen down as he paying his respects before the family shrine, and then draped over his corpse a scroll reading \"Death to Collaborators!

The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.\n\nOn 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau.

It was devoted to intelligence gathering and covert [[Espionage|spying]] operation for purposes of national security and defense. It was originally headed by [[Dai Li]], and after 1946 he was succeeded by [[Mao Renfeng]]. This bureau was largely superseded by the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' under [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] in [[Taiwan]] today.\n\nThe NBIS had a great influence amongst the [[Nationalist Government]]'s military, police, administration, and transportation agencies, as well as embassies and consulates abroad during the [[Political Tutelage]] period (1928-1946) of [[Republic of China (1912\u201349)|Republic of China]]. It was often criticized by the political dissidents as a \"secret police\" involving in covert and espionage operation, including surveillance, kidnapping, assassinations, elimination and house-arrest against Chinese communists, Japanese spies as well as political dissidents.\n \nDuring the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]], the NBIS was involved in a number of counter-intelligence and covert espionage warfare against the Japanese invaders. There were NBIS agents who defected to Japanese, and many of the secret police in [[Wang Jingwei]]'s Japanese-occupied areas were former NBIS agents.\n\nFrom a historical perspective, NBIS played an important role in [[Second Sino-Japanese War]]. Under the leadership of [[Dai Li]], the [[Nationalist Government]] had a body of 100,000 active spies involving in espionage warfare against Japanese, as well as against the [[Wang Jingwei]]-led puppet Nationalist Government of the Japanese-occupied areas.\n\n== History ==\n=== Early stages ===\nThe NBIS was founded in 1927 as the \"Military Commission of Clandestine Investigation Section of the [[National Revolutionary Army]]\" ({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u9769\u547d\u8ecd\u7e3d\u53f8\u4ee4\u90e8\u5bc6\u67e5\u7d44}})  with the \"Special Works Department\"({{zh|c=\u570b\u6c11\u653f\u5e9c\u8ecd\u4e8b\u59d4\u54e1\u6703\u7279\u52d9\u8655}}) set up in 1932. When the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" was established under the Military Commission, the \"Special Works Department\" was incorporated into the Bureau and renamed the \"Second Division\", and is responsible for intelligence collection and personnel training. All of the bureau's affairs were under the direct command of [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. Dai sought to make the ''Juntong'' into an extended family with himself as the stern paternal figure, stressing traditional Chinese Confucian values of filial piety, loyalty, benevolence, and righteousness.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546-547}} The ''Juntong'' operated as a traditional sworn brotherhood with all of the senior officers taking an oath making themselves into \"brothers\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=547}}</ref> The inspiration for the ''Juntong'' were the secret sworn brotherhoods portrayed in the classics of Chinese literature like ''Water Margin'' and ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p=546}}  Dai presented himself as a stern Confucian father figure to the men and women of the ''Juntong'' and liked to quote from book ''The Dynastic History of the Han'' is \"Is personal happiness possible before the extermination of the Xiongnu?\"<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this mentality, the men and women serving in the ''Juntong'' were forbidden to marry and expected to be celibate as their only love was to be China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> The rules about celibacy were not always followed as Liu Gequing, the ''Juntong'' ace assassin fell in love with and had a relationship with a fellow agent, Lu Ti, during his time in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=556}}</ref> Likewise, ''Juntong'' agents were expected to forsake smoking, gambling and playing mahjong as Dai wanted them to hard work and dedicate their lives totally to China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p547/> Reflecting this ethos of absolute dedication to the cause, many of the assassination missions that ''Juntong'' agents were sent on against the Chinese Communists and later on during the war with Japan were known to be suicide missions as the expectation was that ''Juntong'' agents were to value China more than their own lives.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=548}}</ref> Dai often said that the ''Juntong'' were to serve Chiang \"like dogs and horses serving their masters without a mind of their own\" as Dai presented Chiang as \"the Leader\" to whom all Chinese had to obey unconditionally.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p548/> As the world of espionage was a secretive one, ''Juntong'' agents were advised that they were to be \"anonymous heroes\" whose deeds would not be remembered by historians.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=549}}</ref>\n\n''Juntong'' agents tended to come from the provincial schools as Dai disliked recruiting those who attended universities, whom the xenophobic, ultra-conservative Dai felt were too exposed to Western influence to fit into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> ''Juntong'' agents, especially those working as assassins were generally expected to know martial arts before joining, both to improve their skills at killing and because Dai felt the sort of self-discipline needed to master the martial arts was the same sort of dedication that he expected in his agents.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Reflecting Dai's traditionalism, the model for the ''Juntong'' were the assassins of the Warring States period and those portrayed in ''The Romance of the Three Kingdoms''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> One of the most best loved books among the ''Juntong'' was the novel ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' (''Legendary Roving Knights of the Rivers and Lakes''), a ''[[wuxia]]'' (martial arts) book that was very popular in Republican China.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> Dai liked the book so much that he recruited the ''kung fu'' master who was said to be the inspiration for the hero of ''Jianghu qixia zhuan'' into the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> The men and women of the ''Juntong'' liked to see themselves as \"knights\" who would use their skills to defend the weak from the strong and save China from its enemies.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/> A disproportionate number of the men and women of the ''Juntong'' came from the provinces of Hunan, Guangdong, and Zhejiang, all places where Western influence was limited and traditional values flourished.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p549/>\n\nIn 1938, the Special Works Department was expanded and took over the \"Investigation and Statistics Bureau\" to cope with the increasingly demanding tasks of intelligence operations. [[Dai Li]] was assigned as the ''de facto'' responsibility for running the unit.  Dai's preference for recruiting on the basis of familial loyalties, where one sibling would recruit other siblings to the ''Juntong'' proved to be a weakness, when in 1938 a number of ''Juntong'' agents defected over to work for the \"reformed\" government of [[Wang Jingwei]], pitting brother literally against brother.{{sfn|Yeh|1989|p= 549-550}} \n\n=== Sino-Japanese War period ===\nDuring the Sino-Japanese War, NBIS had orchestrated the assassinations of several key Japanese enemy military and government personnel.

Rather, the ''Juntong'' targeted the secret service loyal to the Wang regime. This was based in the Huxi \"badlands\" district in Shanghai headed by [[Ding Mocun]] and Li Shiqun, two former Communists  who defected first to the ''Juntong'' and then to the Japanese.<ref name=FJp357/><ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> The No. 76 organization as it was known after its address at 76 Jessfield Road was founded in February 1939 when Ding and Li presented themselves to General [[Kenji Doihara]], the chief of Japanese intelligence in China, at a restaurant in Shanghai's \"Little Tokyo\" district, and proclaimed their willingness to serve Japan, stating as former ''Juntong'' agents that they were the only men who could beat the ''Juntong'' at its own game.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 1 March 1939, the No. 76 organization came into being, and its liaison officer was Colonel Haruke Yoshitane of the Plum Blossom Agency, who in turn reported to Colonel Kagesa Sadaaki of the ''[[Kempeitai]]'', the much feared Japanese military police.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/> On 8 May 1939, Wu Shibao, a Green Gang member and the leader of \"a gang of local thugs and bullies\" agreed to become Li's bodyguard and to provide the \"muscle\" for the No. 76 organization.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=553}}</ref> Li boosted in a speech \"With the left hand we'll annihilate the Blue Shirts, with the right we'll knock down the C.C Clique!\".<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The No. 76 organization, which moved into its base at No. 76 Jessfield Road in July 1939, was based in a mansion that had once belonged to the warlord General Chen Diaoyuan that was turned into a fortress with concrete blocks on the drive-way and electrified iron gates as both Ding and Li had an obsessive fear of assassination.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp552/>\n\nAs both Ding and Li had been senior ''Juntong'' agents until 1938 with Ding heading the Third Section of the Military Affairs Bureau until late 1938 while Li had been a member of the Green Gang, the two men knew the ''Juntong'' very well and in many ways the No. 76 organization was a mirror image of the ''Juntong''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp553/> The collaborating secret police assassinated anti-Japanese Chinese; had powers to arrest without warrant, torture and to kill extrajudicially; kidnapped businessmen for ransom; and were deeply involved in organized crime, charging a \"fee\" to all of the opium dens, brothels and casinos of Shanghai to allow them to operate.<ref name=FJp357/> In September 1939, Wang Tianmu, the chief ''Juntong'' agent in Shanghai was kidnapped on the Nanjing road by No. 76 agents, was taken to 76 Jessfield Road where he was held for three weeks before being released.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=554}}</ref> Wang had not been tortured and Dai suspected that he had been \"turned\"; Dai ordered him assassinated and a ''Juntong'' agent shot him in the shoulder during a failed attempt to kill him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYehp554/>\n\nThe No. 76 organization blew up the headquarters of the ''Juntong'' in Shanghai while the ''Juntong'' assassins killed a dozen of No. 76 organization leaders in the fall of 1939.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555>{{harvnb|Yeh|1989|p=555}}</ref> Wang's defection to the No. 76 organization proved a most serious blow as he betrayed all of the agents under his command, and the ''Kempeitai'' arrested dozens of ''Juntong agents'' in Shanghai, Beijing, and Tianjin due to the information provided by Wang.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 15 November 1939, Zhao Gangyi, the ''Juntong'' chief in Qingdao, fearing it was only a matter of time before the ''Kempeitai'' arrested him owing to the information provided by Wang, decided to save himself and defected over to the Wang regime,  betraying all of the agents under his command to the ''Kempeitai''.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> On 24 November 1939, thanks to information provided by Zhao, the ''Kempeitai'' raided the ''Juntong'''s headquarters in Beijing.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nOn 21 December 1939, Ding was almost killed when his mistress, the teenage schoolgirl Zheng Pingru, led him into a ''Juntong'' assassination attempt.<ref name=WFp194>{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Wakeman|first=Frederic, Jr|title=The Shanghai Badlands: Wartime Terrorism and Urban Crime, 1937-1941|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TbpNjDlPSq0C&pg=PR7#v=onepage|accessdate=01-05-2017|date=25 July 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-52871-9|pages=194|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laydate=}}</ref>  When Ding ordered his men to execute Zheng, a girl born to a Chinese father and a Japanese mother, she asked them not to shoot her in the face, so she would still be beautiful at her funeral, a request that No. 76 execution squad honored.<ref name=WFp194/> This incident is generally believed to have been the inspiration for the 1979 novella [[Lust, Caution (novella)|''Lust, Caution'']] by [[Eileen Chang]], which in turn inspired the 2007 film ''[[Lust, Caution]]''. On Christmas Eve 1939, Chen Mingchu, a former ''Juntong'' agent who had joined the No. 76 organization was assassinated by the ''Juntong'' agents at the Huierdeng nightclub in Shanghai.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> Chen and his twenty bodyguards were celebrating Christmas on the floor of the nightclub when a group of ''Juntong'' agents armed with machine-guns burst in to gun down Chen and his bodyguards.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p555/> On 8 September 1940, Zhou Guangshi, the chief of ''Juntong'' operations in occupied China was captured by the ''Kempeitai'' who tortured and executed him.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/> By late 1941, most of the ''Juntong'' agents operating in the major cities occupied by Japan were either killed or captured.<ref name=Wen-hsinYeh_p556/>\n\nVarious \"guerrilla command\" and \"traffic police\" groups under the NBIS carried out a wide range of covert espionage and counterintelligence activities against the Japanese and Japanese collaborators. In 1942, the [[Sino-American Cooperative Organization]] was founded, which led to 3,000 Americans being sent to China for joint operations with the ''Juntong''.{{sfn|Polmar|Allen|1997|p=111}} Dai's relations with the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) were unfriendly and at one point Dai warned William \"Wild Bill\" Donovan, the chief of the OSS: \"If the OSS tries to operate outside of SACO, I will kill your agents\".{{sfn|Polmar|Allen|1997|p=111-112}} The ''Juntong'' co-operated with the OSS in parachuting agents, mostly Chinese-Americans, behind Japanese lines, but relations were stained in 1943 when the OSS sent [[Ilya Andreyevich Tolstoy]] to [[Tibet (1912\u20131951)|Tibet]] to contact the [[Dalai Lama]] as China's government did not recognize Tibet's ''de facto'' independence.<ref name=PNATp112>{{harvnb|Polmar|Allen|1997|p=112}}</ref> China regarded Tibet, which had become ''de facto'' independent in 1911, as a breakaway province that was still legally part of China. China greatly resented the Tolstoy mission as a tacit American recognition of Tibetan independence.<ref name=PNATp112/> From 1937-41, more than 18,000 NBIS intelligence agents lost their lives, and by the end of the war the number has increased to more than 45,000.\n\n=== Chinese Civil War period ===\nIn August 1946, the [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]]  was established to replace the Military Commission, and the NBIS changed its name to the Counterintelligence Bureau under the Ministry of National Defense ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u4fdd\u5bc6\u5c40}}). [[Mao Renfeng]] was the director given the de facto responsibility for running the unit.\n\n=== After 1949 in mainland China ===\nAfter Nationalist government was moved to Taiwan in 1949, a number of BIS staff remained in mainland China for intelligence activities. The NBIS operatives were severely repressed by Chinese Communist government during the [[Campaign to Suppress Counterrevolutionaries]], and were mostly executed by firing squad or received heavy punishment. By end of the 1950s, the NBIS staff were largely shot or serving hard labor on the mainland.\n\n=== In Taiwan ===\nIn 1955, the Bureau was again reorganized as the Intelligence Bureau ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}), responsible for early-warning intelligence collection and strategic analysis. Since then, the [[Ministry of Justice]] took over the functions of counterintelligence and investigation from the Bureau.\n\nOn 1 July 1985, the '''Military Intelligence Bureau''' ({{zh|c=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40}}) was created by merging the Special Military Intelligence Office with the Intelligence Bureau. The Military Intelligence Bureau was subordinated to the  [[Ministry of National Defense (Republic of China)|Ministry of National Defense]] under the direct command of the Chief of the [[Staff (military)|General Staff]].\n\n== See also ==\n* [[National Security Bureau (Republic of China)|National Security Bureau]]\n* [http://www.mnd.gov.tw/English/Publish.aspx?cnid=418&p=264 Military Intelligence Bureau]\n*{{Interlanguage link|1=Bureau of Military Intelligence|2=zh|3=\u570b\u9632\u90e8\u8ecd\u4e8b\u60c5\u5831\u5c40|lt=Military Intelligence Bureau|WD=Q14319999}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== Further reading == \n\n*{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Fenby|first=Jonathan|title=Chiang Kai Shek: China's Generalissimo and the Nation He Lost|url=https://books.google.com/?id=tZxKDgAAQBAJ&pg=PP356#v=onepage|accessdate=20-04-2017|date=2004|publisher= Carrol & Graf|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7867-3984-4|authormask=|format=|origyear=|oclc=|doi=|bibcode=|id=|quote=|laydate=}}\n*{{cite book |last1=Polmar |first1=Norman |last2=Allen |first2=Thomas |title=Spy book : the encyclopedia of espionage |date=1997 |publisher=Random House |location=New York |isbn=9780679425144 |edition=1st |ref=harv}}\n*{{cite journal |last1=Yeh |first1=Wen-hsin |title=Dai Li and the Liu Geqing Affair: Heroism in the Chinese Secret Service During the War of Resistance |journal=The Journal of Asian Studies |date=1989 |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=545\u2013562 |doi=10.2307/2058639 |jstor=2058639 |ref=harv |issn=0021-9118}} \n\n{{National Intelligence Agencies}}\n{{Military_of_the_Republic_of_China}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Investigation and Statistics Bureau, The}}\n[[Category:Intelligence agencies]]\n[[Category:Government of the Republic of China]]\n[[Category:1927 establishments in China]]\n[[Category:Taiwanese intelligence agencies]]\n", "name_user": "Richard Keatinge", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eSino-Japanese War period:wikilink", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bureau_of_Investigation_and_Statistics"}
