They can be manufactured by [[casting]] for general hose connection and low pressure applications, but for firefighting, it is better to use [[forging]]s to guarantee the safety and durability of the coupling.\n\nIt is sometimes referred to as a [[Gender of connectors and fasteners|sexless coupling]], because rather than having a male and a female end connected by [[screw thread]]s, either identical end can be joined to any other end of the same diameter. This is also called [[hermaphrodite|hermaphroditic]] or two-way connection. To couple a Storz connection, the two opposing couplings are pressed together such that the hooks of each one are inserted into the slots in the flange of the other. Then they are rotated in opposite directions until they are tight, or latches engage. This creates a watertight connection between the internal packing gaskets.  To uncouple them, the latches are released and the connectors are turned in the opposite directions from coupling, and then separated when the hooks and slots are aligned. Special [[wrench]]es are designed for assisting with use of Storz connectors.\n\nThe main benefit to using Storz couplings is speed of hose connection, as a hose can be locked with a quarter-turn. By comparison, locking hoses using threaded couplings often takes several turns. Because of this, Storz couplings are widely viewed as a safer alternative to using threaded couplings. A secondary benefit over threaded couplings is that the connecting faces and hooks are less prone to damage if the coupling is dropped onto, or dragged over, a hard surface.\n\nStorz couplers are available commercially in the following non-DIN-specified sizes:<ref>{{cite web|title=Storz Coupling Sizes|url=https://pslfireandsafety.co.nz/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Storz-Coupling-Sizes.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2017}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

It submits annual reports to the UN General Assembly and to the Security Council, when necessary.  If any questions arise that fall within the purview of the Security Council, the IAEA notifies the SC accordingly.  The IAEA's special relationship with the UN and UN SC is also specified in an agreement between the IAEA and the UN in 1957.  Under this agreement the IAEA cooperates with the Security Council by furnishing it, at its request, with such information and assistance as may be required in the exercise of its responsibility for maintenance or restoration of international peace and security.  This agreement has since served as a model for UN agreements with nonproliferation organizations such as the OPCW and the CTBTO}}</ref>\n\n=== Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission ===\n{{Main|Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission}}\nThe Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty Organization Preparatory Commission preparatory commission is tasked with preparing the activities of the nuclear non-proliferation organization.\n\n=== International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) ===\n[[File:Flag of IAEA.svg|thumb|IAEA flag.]]\n{{Main|International Atomic Energy Agency}}\n\nThe International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is an intergovernmental organization for scientific and technical cooperation in the field of [[nuclear power|nuclear]] technology.  It is headquartered in Vienna, Austria.  It seeks to promote the peaceful use of nuclear energy and to inhibit its use for [[nuclear weapon|military purposes]]. The IAEA was set up as an autonomous organization on 29 July 1957. Prior to this, in 1953, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Dwight D.

It is native to Europe, Asia, and North Africa, but it can be found throughout the world as an [[introduced species]]. This is an annual or biennial herb growing from a [[taproot]] erect to a maximum height near 80 centimeters. Leaves are up to 20 centimeters long and generally oval to triangular in shape but dissected into many small linear to lance-shaped segments. The [[inflorescence]] is a compound [[umbel]] of white flowers similar to those of other Apiaceae species. The fruit is a compressed oval-shaped body less than 3 millimeters long. This and other ''Ammi'' species are sources of [[khellin]], a [[diuretic]] extract.\n\nLike its close relative ''[[Ammi majus]]'', ''A. visnaga'' is commonly seen in gardens where it is grown from seed annually.<ref>{{cite web | url= http://higgledygarden.com/2015/01/07/growing-ammi-visnaga-and-ammi-majus-from-seed/\n| title = Growing ''Ammi visnaga'' and ''Ammi majus'' from seed\n| publisher = higgledygarden.com\n| accessdate = 12 January 2018| date = 2015-01-07\n}}</ref>\n\n== Traditional medicine ==\nIn [[Egypt]], a [[tea]] made from the fruit of this species has been used as an [[herbal remedy]] for [[kidney stones]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Azim Khan|first1=Muhammad|title=Phytochemistry and Medicinal Properties of Ammi Visnaga|journal=Pak.
