It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the \u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution.

In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\nCUT is currently at the forefront of research and innovation, making the university a leading South African university in the application of additive manufacturing (AM) for the design and production of customised medical implants. The university also commands respect with its technology transfer research, including the:\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/crpm Centre for Rapid Prototyping and Manufacturing (CRPM)];\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/pdts Product Development Technology Station (PDTS)];\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/cafsab Centre for Applied Food Security and Biotechnology (CAFSaB)];\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/seda-agricultural-mining-and-tooling-incubato Seda Agricultural Mining and Tooling Incubator (SAMTI)];\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/ulcs Unit for Lean Construction and Sustainability (ULCS)]; and\n* [https://www.cut.ac.za/centre-sustainable-smart-cities-40 Centre for Sustainable Smart Cities 4.0]\n\nThe university holds South African Research Chairs Initiative (SARChI) status in the field of Medical Product Development through AM, and a Department of Science and Innovation (DSI)/Manufacturing, Engineering and Related Services Sector Education and Training Authority (merSETA)-funded Chair in Innovation and Commercialisation of AM.  Furthermore, the Minister of Higher Education, Science and Technology, Dr Blade Nzimande, will be launching the Medical Device Additive Manufacturing Technology Demonstrator Project (MEDADD) at the Bloemfontein campus in 2020. This R71 million project, which is funded by the DSI, is set to unite the university\u2019s centre and industry in planning and investing resources in a collaborative manner to develop the local medical device industry through AM technology, and to reduce the country\u2019s reliance on costly imported medical devices that local hospitals cannot afford.

The link between London and [[Leipzig]] fell through, resulting in two Mendelssohn Scholarships.<ref name=\"Grove\">''[[s:Page:A Dictionary of Music and Musicians vol 2.djvu/322|A Dictionary of Music and Musicians]]'' [[George Grove|Sir George Grove]], Vol. 2, London, 1900</ref><ref name=\"NYT1895\">{{cite web|url= https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1895/11/07/106072657.pdf |title=''German Mendelssohn Scholarship'' }}, New York Times, 7 November 1895</ref>\n\n==Mendelssohn Scholarship in Germany==\nIn Germany, the Mendelssohn Scholarship was established in the 1870s as two awards of 1500 Marks, one for composition and one for performance, for any student of a music school in Germany, and was funded by the [[Prussia]]n state as part of an arrangement under which the [[Mendelssohn family]] donated the composer's manuscripts to the state.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://hv.spk-berlin.de/deutsch/presse/archiv/2006/060115_FMB.pdf |title= Press release on the 2006 prize from the Stiftung Preussischer Kulturbesitz |url-status= dead |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110719084612/http://hv.spk-berlin.de/deutsch/presse/archiv/2006/060115_FMB.pdf |archivedate= 19 July 2011|language=de}}</ref> The first recipient was the composer, [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], who used it to travel to [[Italy]] in 1879.\n\nFunded by the Jewish Mendelssohn family, the award was discontinued by the [[Nazism|Nazis]] in 1934.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. Justice T. S. Sinnathuray, who presided over Abdul Nasir's trial for kidnapping, ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997.

They were armed with a rifle Sek had stolen from Nee Soon camp. All five victims: Tay, his wife, their Filipino maid, Tay's daughter and her tutor were confined to a bedroom. They proceeded to rob Tay's family of their jewellery and cash out money from their bank accounts. While Nyu was guarding the victims, Sek decided to murder all five victims by escorting them one-by-one out of the bedroom in a bid to erase witnesses. Sek proceeded to struck Tay and his wife with a chair and strangled them. Sek also strangled their maid. In all, Sek murdered 3 people. Nyu discovered Sek's murder intentions only when he caught him in the act in another room. Fearing that Tay's daughter and her tutor would be next, Nyu carried the rifle with him and locked the bedroom door upon dashing in. When Sek's repeated requests to open the door was denied by Nyu, Sek immediately fled. Nyu then released Tay's daughter and her tutor. Nyu fled to Malaysia before he surrendered and was extradited to Singapore. Sek was arrested at his sister's home on 29 July, where he attempted suicide when police were closing in on him. During the trial, when asked how he felt when strangling Tay's wife, Sek brought up an incident when he was nearly strangled by someone at the Singapore Boys\u2019 Home until he blacked out.

Earlier on that day itself, the two men, who were acquaintances, went to the Oriental Hotel for a job interview when they both spotted the Japanese tour group which Fujii and Takishita were with, and seeing this, the two men decided to rob the Japanese tourists. Both men robbed and assaulted the two women; Takishita was assaulted by Abdul Rahman and she pretended to faint to escape further injury. When Abdul Nasir attempted to escape after severely assaulting and robbing Fujii, he lost his balance and accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face, causing a facial fracture which obstructed her breathing and caused her death. 2 years later, Abdul Nasir was arrested for attempting to rob and murder a taxi driver, and his fingerprints were found to match those found in Fujii and Takishita's room. Abdul Nasir confessed that he was involved in the robbery, and Abdul Rahman was later found to be in prison serving a 20-month jail sentence for theft. Both men were charged with murder; however, Abdul Rahman's charge was reduced to robbery with hurt, and he was sentenced to 10 years' jail with 16 strokes of the cane. At Abdul Nasir's murder trial, the presiding judge, Judicial Commissioner Choo Han Teck accepted Abdul Nasir's defence that he accidentally stepped onto Fujii's face while he rejected the prosecution's arguement that Abdul Nasir intentionally stamped onto Fujii's face to kill her. For this, Abdul Nasir was acquitted of murder, and he was instead sentenced to 18 years' jail and 18 strokes of the cane for robbery with hurt. The prosecution appealed against Abdul Nasir's acquittal. However by a split decision of 2-1, the Court of Appeal dismissed the appeal. That did not mark an end to Abdul Nasir's ordeal, as he had to go back to court to face a kidnapping charge, which he committed during the time of his remand. At the time of his remand, Abdul Nasir, together with drug trafficker Low Theng Gee briefly kidnapped two police officers for ransom before being subdued by the police. Abdul Nasir was later found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to life imprisonment and 12 strokes of the cane on 3 March 1997. The judge ordered the life sentence to run consecutively with the jail term Abdul Nasir received for robbing Fujii, meaning Abdul Nasir will be serving a total of 38 years in prison (at that time, life imprisonment in Singapore was defined as a 20-year jail sentence). Abdul Nasir appealed for the two jail terms to run concurrently, but the appeal was dismissed on 20 August 1997. However, Chief Justice Yong Pung How also ruled that life imprisonment should be considered as a term of imprisonment for the remainder of a prisoner's natural life instead of a jail term of 20 years. This amendment will apply to future cases after 20 August 1997.

{"title_page": "Subcategorization", "text_new": "In [[linguistics]], '''subcategorization''' refers to the types of [[verb argument|argument]]s required or allowed by [[lexical item]]s (usually verbs).<ref>Chomsky (1965) is a prominent early source on the concept of subcategorization.</ref> The properties of a word that are crucial to their linguistic analysis are included in its ''lexical entry''.<ref name=\":0\">Grimshaw, J. (2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. <blockquote>\"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Keeping in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality, this example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":0\" /> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements.<blockquote>\"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items (Kroger, 2005). We can think of a lexical entry analogously to a dictionary entry. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic, if not also other grammatical information such as irregular forms or patterns associated with that specific word (Kroger, 2005). Phonological features indicate pronunciation information and whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicate syntactic category labels, otherwise known as parts of speech. Finally, semantic features indicate meaning. In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied by each head in order to create a well formed sentence. For example, a lexical entry for the English noun ''dog'' has been illustrated below. \n\n\n''dog'' /d\u00f4g/\n'a domesticated carnivorous mammal, typically found with four legs\"\n<sub>CAT</sub>: N\n[+count]\n<sub>PLURAL</sub>: ''dogs''\n\n==Argument Structure==\nArgument structure is a representation of the number and types of arguments selected by the predicate (Kroger, 2005). When every predicate, otherwise known as a verb, is used, it selects a specific set of arguments that need to be fulfilled to create a well-formed sentence. These arguments are <small>AGENT</small>, <small>PATIENT</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>RECIPIENT</small>, and <small>STIMULUS</small>. To illustrate this, the sentence ''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa'', has been broken down into its semantic roles and argument selections below. \n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry. \n==Verbs==\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument. The verb ''ate/eat'' is transitive, so it subcategorizes for two arguments (here ''Indiana Jones'' and ''chilled monkey brain''), a subject and an optional object, which means that its subcategorization frame contains two arguments. And the verb ''waited/wait'' subcategorizes for two arguments as well, although the second of these is an optional prepositional argument associated with the preposition ''for''. In this regard, we see that the subcategorization frame of verbs can contain specific words. Subcategorization frames are sometimes schematized in the following manner:\n\n::work [NP __ ]\n::eat [NP __ (NP)]\n::wait [NP __ (''for'' NP)]\n\nThese examples demonstrate that subcategorization frames are specifications of the number and types of arguments of a word (usually a verb), and they are believed to be listed as [[lexicon|lexical]] information (that is, they are thought of as part of a speaker's knowledge of the word in the vocabulary of the language). Dozens of distinct subcategorization frames are needed to accommodate the full combinatory potential of the verbs of any given language. Finally, subcategorization frames are associated most closely with verbs, although the concept can also be applied to other word categories.\n\nSubcategorization frames are essential parts of a number of [[phrase structure grammar]]s, e.g. [[Head-Driven Phrase Structure Grammar]], [[Lexical Functional Grammar]], and [[Minimalism (linguistics)|Minimalism]].\n\n==Occurrences==\nSubcategorization can be observed in any language, including but not limited to:\nFrench\nGerman\nMandarin \n==Valency==\nThe subcategorization notion is similar to the notion of [[valency (linguistics)|valency]], although subcategorization originates with [[phrase structure grammar]]s in the [[Noam Chomsky|Chomskyan]] tradition,<ref>See Chomsky (1965).</ref> whereas valency originates with [[Lucien Tesni\u00e8re]] of the [[dependency grammar]] tradition.<ref>See Tesni\u00e8re (1959).</ref> The primary difference between the two concepts concerns the status of the subject.

(2003). Subcategorization and Selection. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics. : Oxford University Press. Retrieved 2 Apr. 2020</ref> Violating the requirements of subcategorization and selection will produce an ill-formed sentence. <blockquote>\"They put the papers {under the desk/*to the desk/*the desk/*tidy}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Keeping in mind that an asterisk (*) is used to indicate ungrammaticality, this example shows that out of the options given, only \"under the desk\" leads to the production of a well-formed sentence. The term selection is commonly used alongside subcategorization, but the two encode two different types of information.<ref name=\":0\" /> Selection is used to represent the semantic requirements placed on arguments and subcategorization is used to represent the syntactic requirements placed on complements.<blockquote>\"They tried to kill the {president/person/weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to murder the {president/person/*weeds/*box}.\n\nThey tried to assassinate the {president/*person/*weeds/*box}.\" (from Grimshaw, 2003)</blockquote>Here we see that the object of the verb \"kill\" can be any living thing, that of \"murder\" must be human, and that of \"assassinate\" must be a famous human.\n\n==Lexical Entries==\nA lexical entry indicates crucial syntactic information about the heard of a phrase, such as what it selects and where it must be positioned. The term lexical entries come from the idea of the \"mental lexicon\", which specifies what speakers know about individual lexical items (Kroger, 2005). We can think of a lexical entry analogously to a dictionary entry. Each lexical item (LI) is associated with a lexical entry, minimally a triplet of features: Phonological, Formal, and Semantic, if not also other grammatical information such as irregular forms or patterns associated with that specific word (Kroger, 2005). Phonological features indicate pronunciation information and whether the LI is free or bound. Formal features indicate syntactic category labels, otherwise known as parts of speech. Finally, semantic features indicate meaning. In accordance with X-Bar Theory and the Projection Principle, all of these features must be satisfied by each head in order to create a well formed sentence. For example, a lexical entry for the English noun ''dog'' has been illustrated below. \n\n\n''dog'' /d\u00f4g/\n'a domesticated carnivorous mammal, typically found with four legs\"\n<sub>CAT</sub>: N\n[+count]\n<sub>PLURAL</sub>: ''dogs''\n\n==Argument Structure==\nArgument structure is a representation of the number and types of arguments selected by the predicate (Kroger, 2005). When every predicate, otherwise known as a verb, is used, it selects a specific set of arguments that need to be fulfilled to create a well-formed sentence. These arguments are <small>AGENT</small>, <small>PATIENT</small>, <small>EXPERIENCER</small>, <small>THEME</small>, <small>RECIPIENT</small>, and <small>STIMULUS</small>. To illustrate this, the sentence ''The adults asked if the cats would pee on the sofa'', has been broken down into its semantic roles and argument selections below. \n\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!  !! Category (Head) !! Selection Restriction: Argument Selection\n|-\n| ''ask'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<small>THEME</small>}\n|-\n| ''pee'' || V || {DP<small>AGENT</small>, CP<sub>THEME</sub>}\n|-\n| ''adults'' || N || \n|-\n| ''cats'' || N || \n|-\n| ''sofa'' || N || {(PP<sub>THEME</sub>)}\n|}\n\n\nIt is necessary to understand the fundamentals of argument structure to understand the idea of subcategorization because subcategorization, as noted above, refers to the sub-categories a verb (or other semantic role) requires (Kroger, 2005). For example, the verb ''ask'' from above subcategorizes for a DP<small>AGENT</small> and CP<small>THEME</small>, otherwise known as a subject and direct object, respectively. In this way, subcategorization is an important piece of information to include in any lexical entry. \n==Verbs==\nWhile subcategorization is a concept that can apply to almost any type of lexical item, it is usually discussed with respect to verbs. Verbs that take just one argument are classified as intransitive, while verbs with two and three arguments are classified as transitive and ditransitive, respectively.<ref>See Tallerman (2011:39-41) for a discussion of subcategorization in terms of intransitive, transitive, and ditransitive verbs.</ref> The following sentences are employed to illustrate the concept of subcategorization:\n\n::Luke worked.\n::Indiana Jones ate chilled monkey brain.\n::Tom waited for us.\n\nThe verb ''worked/work'' is intransitive and thus subcategorizes for a single argument (here ''Luke''), which is the subject; therefore its subcategorization frame contains just a subject argument.

He then spent 3 years playing for a [[PlusLiga]] club, [[ZAKSA K\u0119dzierzyn-Ko\u017ale]] (2005\u20132008).\n\nIn 2008, he moved to [[PGE Skra Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]], one of the most successful teams in the Polish [[PlusLiga]], where he quickly became a key player. With [[PGE Skra Be\u0142chat\u00f3w|PGE Skra]] he won the Polish Championship three times in 2008/2009, 2009/2010 and 2010/2011 and claimed a silver medal in 2011/2012. He won the Polish Cup three times; in 2009, 2011 and 2012. He also has two [[FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|Club World Championships]] silver medals, from [[2009 FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|2009]] and [[2010 FIVB Volleyball Men's Club World Championship|2010]]. In 2010 [[Skra Be\u0142chat\u00f3w|PGE Skra Belchat\u00f3w]], with Bartosz Kurek, won the bronze medal in the [[2009\u201310 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League]]. On March 18, 2012 [[PGE Skra Be\u0142chat\u00f3w|PGE Skra]] won the [[2011\u201312 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League]] silver medal after losing to [[Zenit Kazan]] in the final in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], [[Poland]].  Kurek received the award for ''Best Spiker'' of [[2011\u201312 CEV Champions League|CEV Champions League 2011/2012]].\n\nAfter the season 2011/2012 he left [[PGE Skra Be\u0142chat\u00f3w]] and signed a contract with Russian club [[VC Dynamo Moscow]];<ref>[http://www.skra.pl/aktualnosci-przeglad/item/1211-kurek-odszed%C5%82-do-dynama ''Kurek odszed\u0142 do Dynama''] \u2013 skra.pl \u2013 06-05-2012</ref> however, due to injury, he was unable to play for his new club for large part of the season.\n\nAfter one season in Russia, Kurek moved to Italian club [[Lube Banca Macerata]].  In 2013/2014, the team won Scudetto (Italian Championship) in the final against [[Umbria Volley|Sir Safety Perugia]]. On October 15, 2014 [[Lube Banca Macerata]], including Kurek, won the Italian Super Cup, beating [[Pallavolo Piacenza|Copra Elior Piacenza]] (3-2).<ref>[http://www.plusliga.pl/news/id/10063 ''Bartosz Kurek z Superpucharem W\u0142och''] \u2013 plusliga.pl \u2013 15-10-2014</ref> On May 4, 2015 Kurek signed a 1+1 contract with [[Asseco Resovia Rzesz\u00f3w]].<ref>[http://www.plusliga.pl/news/id/11192 ''Bartosz Kurek w Asseco Resoviii''] \u2013 plusliga.pl \u2013 04-05-2015</ref> After winning a silver medal in the Polish Championship he left Resovia and signed a contract with Japanese club [[JT Thunders|JT Thunders Hiroshima]].\n\nOn October 2, 2016 he announced interrupting of his sporting career because of physical and mental fatigue.
