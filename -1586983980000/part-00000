He is a mysterious and unnamed agent of a remnant of the former [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and plays a key role in setting the show's story into motion by hiring the [[bounty hunter]] known as [[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|the Mandalorian]] to track down a young [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] creature known only as \"[[The Child (Star Wars)|the Child]]\".\n\nThe Client is portrayed by German film director, screenwriter, and actor [[Werner Herzog]], who was recruited for the part by series creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]]. Herzog accepted the role in part to help finance his film ''[[Family Romance, LLC]]'' (2019). Herzog was not familiar with Favreau's previous work, nor had he ever seen a ''Star Wars'' film, but was impressed with the [[screenplay]]s for ''The Mandalorian'' as well as the filmmaking style of the show.\n\nHerzog particularly enjoyed filming scenes with the [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppet of [[The Child (Star Wars)|The Child]], subsequently strongly urging Favreau to solely use the puppet for the character and not [[computer-generated imagery]] as had originally been intended for later scenes, calling them \"cowards\" for considering using CGI in its place. The character and Herzog's performance have received positive reviews from critics. <ref name=\"Couch1115\" />\n\n==Appearances==\nAlmost no details are provided about the Client's [[backstory]], except that he is loyal to the remnant of the former [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], which by this time has fallen from power after losing its war against the [[Rebel Alliance]].<ref name=\"Thorne1122\">{{cite news |last=Thorne |first=Will |title='The Mandalorian': 5 Burning Questions From Episode 3 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=November 22, 2019 |url=https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/mandalorian-episode-3-biggest-questions-baby-yoda-1203413101/ |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191126043022/https://variety.com/2019/tv/news/mandalorian-episode-3-biggest-questions-baby-yoda-1203413101/ |archive-date=November 26, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref> The character is never identified by name on the series and is known simply as \"The Client\".<ref>{{cite news |last=Milner |first=Sarah Bea |title=The Mandalorian's Confusing Character Names Are Getting In The Way |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=December 8, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-show-no-character-names-problem/ |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191209141431/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-show-no-character-names-problem/ |archive-date=December 9, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Alter |first=Rebecca |title=Werner Herzog to Jon Favreau: Sorry to This Man |work=[[New York (magazine)#Digital expansion and blogs|Vulture]] |date=November 12, 2019 |url=https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/werner-herzog-hasnt-seen-star-wars-watches-kardashians.html |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191218144339/https://www.vulture.com/2019/11/werner-herzog-hasnt-seen-star-wars-watches-kardashians.html |archive-date=December 18, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last=Elvy |first=Craig |title=The Mandalorian Still Hasn't Introduced A Main Character (But Did Reference Him) |work=[[Screen Rant]] |date=November 25, 2019 |url=https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-series-moff-gideon-giancarlo-esposito-missing-reference/ |accessdate=January 28, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191128004159/https://screenrant.com/mandalorian-series-moff-gideon-giancarlo-esposito-missing-reference/ |archive-date=November 28, 2019 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nHe first appears in the series premiere episode \"[[Chapter 1: The Mandalorian]]\" of ''[[The Mandalorian]]'', a ''[[Star Wars]]'' television series on the streaming service [[Disney+]].<ref name=\"Smail1112\">{{cite news |last=Smail |first=Gretchen |title=Werner Herzog's 'The Mandalorian' Character Is The Next Great 'Star Wars' Villain |work=[[Bustle (website)|Bustle]] |date=November 12, 2019 |url=https://www.bustle.com/p/werner-herzogs-the-mandalorian-character-is-the-next-great-star-wars-villain-19344045 |accessdate=January 27, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200127044709/https://www.bustle.com/p/werner-herzogs-the-mandalorian-character-is-the-next-great-star-wars-villain-19344045 |archive-date=January 27, 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref> The show's protagonist, a [[bounty hunter]] known as \"[[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|The Mandalorian]]\", is placed into contact with the Client by [[Greef Karga]], the leader of the Bounty Hunters' Guild.

He is a mysterious and unnamed agent of a remnant of the former [[Galactic Empire (Star Wars)|Galactic Empire]], and plays a key role in setting the show's story into motion by hiring the [[bounty hunter]] known as [[The Mandalorian (Star Wars character)|the Mandalorian]] to track down a young [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] creature known only as \"[[The Child (Star Wars)|the Child]]\".\n\nThe Client is portrayed by German film director, screenwriter, and actor [[Werner Herzog]], who was recruited for the part by series creator and [[showrunner]] [[Jon Favreau]]. Herzog accepted the role in part to help finance his film ''[[Family Romance, LLC]]'' (2019). Herzog was not familiar with Favreau's previous work, nor had he ever seen a ''Star Wars'' film, but was impressed with the [[screenplay]]s for ''The Mandalorian'' as well as the filmmaking style of the show.\n\nHerzog particularly enjoyed filming scenes with the [[Animatronics|animatronic]] puppet of [[The Child (Star Wars)|The Child]], subsequently strongly urging Favreau to solely use the puppet for the character and not [[computer-generated imagery]] as had originally been intended for later scenes, calling them \"cowards\" for considering using CGI in its place.
