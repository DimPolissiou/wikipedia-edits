The successor to the 1983 arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was released in Japan in 1985 for the [[Famicom]], and in North America and Europe for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control [[Mario]], or his brother [[Luigi]] in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] to rescue [[Princess Toadstool]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. They must traverse [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of [[power-up]]s such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.\n\nThe game was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] as \"a grand culmination\" of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming. The design of the first level, [[World 1-1]], serves as a [[Tutorial (video gaming)|tutorial]] for first-time video gamers on the basic [[game mechanics|mechanics]] of [[platform game]]play. The aggressively size-optimized profile was intended as a [[Parting phrase|farewell]] to the Famicom's [[Game cartridge|cartridge]] medium in favor of the forthcoming [[Famicom Disk System]], whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant distribution medium for a few years.\n\n''Super Mario Bros.'' is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], with praise on its precise controls. It is one of the [[bestselling games of all time]], with more than 40 million physical copies. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. [[Koji Kondo]]'s [[Super Mario Bros. theme|soundtrack]] is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music into a centerpiece of game design. The game inspired an [[Mario (franchise)|expansive franchise]] including a long-running [[Super Mario (series)|game series]], an [[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|animated television series]], and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. Re-releases and cameos of the game are on most of Nintendo's following systems. Alongside Mario himself, ''Super Mario Bros.'' has become prominent in [[popular culture]].\n\n{{toc limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|left|''Super Mario Bros.'' features various unique power-ups which assist Mario. In the above picture, Mario wields a [[Fire Flower]], allowing him to attack enemies with fire projectiles. Behind Mario is an [[starman (Mario)|invincibility star]], which allows him to defeat enemies on contact and withstand other hazards for a short period of time.|alt=Refer to caption]]\n\nIn ''Super Mario Bros.'', the player takes on the role of [[Mario]], the protagonist of [[Mario (franchise)|the series]]. Mario's younger brother, [[Luigi]], is controlled by the second player in the game's [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|7}} The game is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.\n\nThe game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (''?''), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other \"secret\", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a [[Super Mushroom]], Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} Players start with a certain number of [[life (gaming)|lives]] and may gain [[Extra life|additional lives]] by picking up green spotted orange [[1 up mushroom|1-Up mushrooms]] hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or [[Time limit (video gaming)|runs out of time]]. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225911/https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |archivedate=February 22, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this. For example, a [[Goomba]] will flatten and be defeated,<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} while a [[Koopa Troopa]] will temporarily retract into its shell, allowing Mario to use it as a projectile.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|11}} These shells may be deflected off a wall to destroy other enemies, though they can also bounce back against Mario, which will hurt or kill him.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|19}} Other enemies, such as underwater foes and enemies with spiked tops, cannot be jumped on and damage the player instead.  Mario can also defeat enemies above him by jumping to hit the brick that the enemy is standing on. Mario may also acquire the [[Fire flower|Fire Flower]] from certain \"?\" blocks that when picked up changes the color of Super Mario's outfit and allows him to throw fireballs. However, certain enemies such as Buzzy Beetles are immune to fireballs. A less common item is the [[Super Mario#Invincibility|Starman]], which often appears when Mario hits certain concealed or otherwise invisible blocks. This item makes Mario temporarily [[Invincibility (video gaming)|invincible]] to most hazards and capable of defeating enemies on contact.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|10}}\n\nThe game consists of eight worlds with four sub-levels called \"stages\" in each world.\"<ref name=\"IGN VC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2007/03/06/super-mario-bros-vc-review |title=Super Mario Bros.

Bowser and his decoys are defeated by jumping over them and reaching the axe on the end of the bridge, although they can also be defeated using a Fire Flower. The game also includes some stages taking place underwater, which contain different enemies. In addition, there are bonuses and secret areas in the game. Most secret areas contain more coins for Mario to collect, but some contain \"warp pipes\" that allow Mario to advance directly to later worlds in the game without completing the intervening stages. After completing the game once, the player is rewarded with the ability to replay the game with changes made to increase its difficulty, such as all Goombas in the game being replaced with Buzzy Beetles.<ref name=\"allgame\">{{cite web |last=Smith |first=Geoffrey Douglas |title=Super Mario Bros \u2013 Review |website=[[Allgame]] |accessdate=December 6, 2012 |url=http://allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114120755/http://www.allgame.com/game.php?id=1320&tab=review |archivedate=November 14, 2014 }}</ref>\n\n==Synopsis==\nIn the fantasy setting of the [[Mushroom Kingdom]], a tribe of turtle-like creatures known as the [[Koopa Troopa]]s invade the kingdom and uses the magic of its king, [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]], to turn its inhabitants, known as the Mushroom People, into inanimate objects such as bricks, stones and horsehair plants.

The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in [[World 1-1|the first level of the game]], the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letting Everyone Know It Was A Good Mushroom |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |work=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros Wii |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194716/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \"Mushroom Kingdom\".

This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7-2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost.

Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date.

The successor to the 1983 arcade game, ''[[Mario Bros.]]'', it was released in Japan in 1985 for the [[Famicom]], and in North America and Europe for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES) in 1985 and 1987 respectively. Players control [[Mario]], or his brother [[Luigi]] in the multiplayer mode, as they travel the [[Mushroom Kingdom]] to rescue [[Princess Toadstool]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]. They must traverse [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] stages while avoiding hazards such as enemies and pits with the aid of [[power-up]]s such as the Super Mushroom, Fire Flower, and Starman.\n\nThe game was designed by [[Shigeru Miyamoto]] and [[Takashi Tezuka]] as \"a grand culmination\" of the Famicom team's three years of game mechanics and programming. The design of the first level, [[World 1-1]], serves as a [[Tutorial (video gaming)|tutorial]] for first-time video gamers on the basic [[game mechanics|mechanics]] of [[platform game]]play. The aggressively size-optimized profile was intended as a [[Parting phrase|farewell]] to the Famicom's [[Game cartridge|cartridge]] medium in favor of the forthcoming [[Famicom Disk System]], whose floppy disks temporarily became the dominant distribution medium for a few years.\n\n''Super Mario Bros.'' is frequently cited as one of the [[greatest video games of all time]], with praise on its precise controls. It is one of the [[bestselling games of all time]], with more than 40 million physical copies. It is credited alongside the NES as one of the key factors in reviving the video game industry after the [[Video game crash of 1983|1983 crash]], and helped popularize the side-scrolling platform game genre. [[Koji Kondo]]'s [[Super Mario Bros. theme|soundtrack]] is one of the earliest and most popular in video games, making music into a centerpiece of game design. The game inspired an [[Mario (franchise)|expansive franchise]] including a long-running [[Super Mario (series)|game series]], an [[The Super Mario Bros. Super Show!|animated television series]], and a [[Super Mario Bros. (film)|feature film]]. Re-releases and cameos of the game are on most of Nintendo's following systems. Alongside Mario himself, ''Super Mario Bros.'' has become prominent in [[popular culture]].\n\n{{toc limit|limit=3}}\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:NES Super Mario Bros.png|thumb|left|''Super Mario Bros.'' features various unique power-ups which assist Mario. In the above picture, Mario wields a [[Fire Flower]], allowing him to attack enemies with fire projectiles. Behind Mario is an [[starman (Mario)|invincibility star]], which allows him to defeat enemies on contact and withstand other hazards for a short period of time.|alt=Refer to caption]]\n\nIn ''Super Mario Bros.'', the player takes on the role of [[Mario]], the protagonist of [[Mario (franchise)|the series]]. Mario's younger brother, [[Luigi]], is controlled by the second player in the game's [[Multiplayer video game|multiplayer]] mode and assumes the same plot role and functionality as Mario. The objective is to race through the Mushroom Kingdom, survive the main antagonist Bowser's forces, and save Princess Toadstool.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|7}} The game is a [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]; the player moves from the left side of the screen to the right side in order to reach the flag pole at the end of each level.\n\nThe game world features coins scattered around for Mario to collect and special bricks marked with a question mark (''?''), which when hit from below by Mario may reveal more coins or a special item. Other \"secret\", often invisible, bricks may contain more coins or rare items. If the player gains a [[Super Mushroom]], Mario grows to double his size and gains the ability to break bricks above him. If Mario gets hit in this mode, then instead of dying he turns back to regular Mario.<ref name=\"Super Mario Bros. instruction booklet\" />{{rp|12}} Players start with a certain number of [[life (gaming)|lives]] and may gain [[Extra life|additional lives]] by picking up green spotted orange [[1 up mushroom|1-Up mushrooms]] hidden in bricks, or by collecting 100 coins, defeating several enemies in a row with a Koopa shell, or bouncing on enemies successively without touching the ground. Mario loses a life if he takes damage while small, falls in a bottomless pit, or [[Time limit (video gaming)|runs out of time]]. The game ends when the player runs out of lives, although a button input can be used on the game over screen to continue from the first level of the world in which the player died.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |title=Archived copy |accessdate=February 22, 2018 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222225911/https://www.polygon.com/2015/1/26/7908265/super-mario-bros-continue-cheat-code |archivedate=February 22, 2018 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\nMario's primary attack is jumping on top of enemies, though many enemies have differing responses to this.

Then they decided it would be fun to let Mario change his size via a [[power-up]]. The early level design was focused on teaching players that mushrooms were distinct from Goombas and would be beneficial to them, so in [[World 1-1|the first level of the game]], the first mushroom is difficult to avoid if it is released.<ref>{{cite web |title=Letting Everyone Know It Was A Good Mushroom |url=http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |work=Iwata Asks: New Super Mario Bros Wii |publisher=Nintendo |accessdate=December 5, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160927194716/http://iwataasks.nintendo.com/interviews/#/wii/nsmb/0/3 |archivedate=September 27, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> The use of mushrooms to change size was influenced by common Japanese folktales in which people wander into forests and eat magical mushrooms; this also resulted in the game world being named the \"Mushroom Kingdom\".

If the player is able to exploit a bug that allows Mario to pass through bricks, the player can enter the warp zone by passing through the wall and the pipe to World 2-1 and 4-1 may instead transport the player to a stage labeled \"World -1\". This stage's map is identical to worlds 2-2 and 7-2, and upon entering the warp pipe at the end, the player is taken back to the start of the level, thus trapping the player in the level until all lives have been lost.

World -2 is an identical copy of World 7-3, and World -3 is a copy of World 4-4 with an underground level color palette and underground level music, and does not loop if the player takes the wrong path, contrary to the original World 4-4.

Two of these sequels, ''[[Super Mario Bros. 2]]'' and ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', were direct sequels to the game and were released for the NES, experiencing similar levels of commercial success. A different sequel, also titled ''Super Mario Bros. 2'', was released for the [[Famicom Disk System]] in 1986 exclusively in Japan, and was later released elsewhere as a part of ''[[Super Mario All-Stars]]'' under the name ''[[Super Mario Bros.: The Lost Levels]]''. The gameplay concepts and elements established in ''Super Mario Bros.'' are prevalent in nearly every ''Super Mario'' game. The series consists of over 15 entries; at least one ''Super Mario'' game has been released on nearly every Nintendo console to date. ''[[Super Mario 64]]'' is widely considered one of the greatest games ever made, and is largely credited with revolutionizing the platforming genre of video games and its step from 2D to 3D.

She is best known for her groundbreaking comedy variety show, ''[[The Carol Burnett Show]]'', originally aired on [[CBS]]. It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects. Her film roles include ''[[Pete 'n' Tillie]]'' (1972),  ''[[The Front Page (1974 film)|The Front Page]]'' (1974), ''[[The Four Seasons (1981 film)|The Four Seasons]]'' (1981), ''[[Annie (1982 film)|Annie]]'' (1982), ''[[Noises Off (film)|Noises Off]]'' (1992), and ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (film)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' (2008). On television, she has appeared in other sketch shows; in dramatic roles in ''[[6 Rms Riv Vu]]'' (1974) and ''[[Friendly Fire (1979 film)|Friendly Fire]]'' (1979); in various well-regarded guest roles, such as in ''[[Mad About You]],'' for which she won an Emmy Award; and in specials with [[Julie Andrews]], [[Dolly Parton]], [[Beverly Sills]], and others. She returned to the Broadway stage in 1995 in ''[[Moon Over Buffalo]],'' for which she was again nominated for a [[Tony Award]].\n\nBurnett has written and narrated several [[memoir]]s, earning [[Grammy Award|Grammy]] nominations for almost all of them, and a win for ''[[In Such Good Company|In Such Good Company: Eleven Years Of Laughter, Mayhem, And Fun In The Sandbox]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.grammy.com/grammys/artists/carol-burnett|title=Artist Carol Burnett|website=www.grammy.com|accessdate=July 12, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/music/la-et-ms-grammys-2017-nominations-winners-list-20161205-story.html |title=2017 Grammy Awards: Complete list of nominees |newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=February 12, 2017|accessdate=August 1, 2018}}</ref>\n  \nIn 2005, she was recognized as \"one of America's most cherished entertainers\" and awarded the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] \"for enhancing the lives of millions of Americans and for her extraordinary contributions to American entertainment.\"<ref>{{cite press release|date=November 9, 2005 |title= Citations for Recipients of the 2005 Presidential Medal of Freedom |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/11/20051109-10.html|location=Washington, DC|publisher=The White House|agency= Office of the Press Secretary|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref> In 2013, Burnett was awarded the [[Mark Twain Prize for American Humor]] at the [[John F.

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience).

She was cast in a minor role on ''The [[Paul Winchell]] and Jerry Mahoney Show'' in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist's dummy on the popular children's program. This role led to her starring role opposite [[Buddy Hackett]] in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Stanley (1956 TV series)|Stanley]]'' from 1956-57.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n[[File:Carol burnett garry moore 1960.JPG|thumb|right|Burnett and Larry Blyden from ''The Garry Moore Show'', 1960]]\nAfter ''Stanley'', Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. She eventually bounced back a few months later as a highly popular performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called \"I Made a Fool of Myself Over [[John Foster Dulles]]\" (Dulles was [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', hosted by [[Jack Paar]], and ''[[The Ed Sullivan Show]]''. Dulles was asked about her on ''[[Meet the Press]]'' and joked,  \u201cI never discuss matters of the heart in public.\u201d<ref name=MTprize/>\n\nShe also worked as a regular on one of television's earliest game shows, ''[[Pantomime Quiz]]'', during this time. In 1957, just as she was achieving her first small successes, her mother died.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}<del></del>\n\nBurnett's first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she was nominated for a [[Tony Award]]. The same year, she became a regular player on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'', a job that lasted until 1962. She won an [[Emmy Award]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/celebrities/carol-burnett|title=Carol Burnett Emmy Winner|publisher=The Emmys|accessdate=December 27, 2011}}</ref> that year for her \"Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series\" on the show. She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman who later became her signature alter-ego. With her success on the ''Moore Show'', Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special ''[[Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall]]'' (1962), co-starring with her friend [[Julie Andrews]].

Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994).

National Enquirer, Inc'''\n{{main|Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it. Burnett and her company requested that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character but the studio did not.<ref name=\"Reut20th\">{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-burnett/carol-burnett-sues-tvs-family-guy-cartoon-idUSN1624604020070317 |title=Carol Burnett sues TV's \"Family Guy\" cartoon |work=[[Reuters]] |date=March 16, 2007 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Gun20th\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thesmokinggun.com/documents/celebrity/carol-burnett-v-family-guy |title=Carol Burnett v. \"Family Guy\" Comedian sues over porn shop spoof of beloved charwoman character |work=[[The Smoking Gun]] |date=March 16, 2018 |accessdate=August 28, 2018}}</ref> The suit was ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

It was the first of its kind to be hosted by a woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://parade.com/451837/amyspencer/carol-burnett-first-woman-of-comedy/|title=Carol Burnett: First Woman of Comedy|last=Spencer|first=Amy|work=[[Parade (magazine)|Parade]]|publisher=[[Athlon Media Group]]|date=January 22, 2016|accessdate=July 11, 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.emmytvlegends.org/interviews/people/carol-burnett#| title=Interview: Carol Burnett| publisher=Archive of American Television| date=29 April 2003| last=Herman| first=Karen}}</ref> She has achieved success on stage, television and film in varying genres including dramatic and comedic roles. She has also appeared on various talk shows and as a panelist on game shows.\n\nBorn in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]], Burnett moved with her grandmother to Hollywood, where she attended [[Hollywood High School]] and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]]. Later she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in ''[[Once Upon a Mattress]]'', for which she received a [[Tony Award]] nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on ''[[The Garry Moore Show]]'' for the next three years, and won her first [[Emmy Award]] in 1962. Burnett had her television special debut in 1963 when she starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of ''[[Calamity Jane]]'' on [[CBS]].<ref>{{cite journal|title=Billboard| date=July 29, 1963 |volume=75 |issue=26| page=24}}</ref> Burnett moved to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], and began an 11-year run as star of ''The Carol Burnett Show'' on [[CBS]] television from 1967 to 1978. With its [[vaudeville]] roots, ''The Carol Burnett Show'' was a [[variety show]] that combined [[sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] with song and dance. The comedy sketches included [[parody|film parodies]] and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show's run, and both she and the show won numerous [[Emmy Award|Emmy]] and [[Golden Globe Award]]s.\n\nDuring and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Gurney's ''[[Love Letters (play)|Love Letters]]''.\n\nBurnett had long been a fan of the soap opera ''[[All My Children]]'', and realized a dream when [[Agnes Nixon]] created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1976. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford ([[Louis Edmonds]]), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford ([[Ruth Warrick]]). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief [[cameo appearance]] as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show's 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series' finale. \n\nShe also starred in television films such as ''[[Seasons of the Heart (1994 film)|Seasons of the Heart]]'' (1994). She also returned in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of ''Once Upon a Mattress''. She guest-starred in season two of ''[[Desperate Housewives]]'' as Bree's stepmother, Elanor Mason.\n\nIn 2009, she made a guest appearance on the ''[[Law & Order: Special Victims Unit]]'', for which she was nominated for the [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress \u2013 Drama Series|Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series]].

National Enquirer, Inc.}}\n\nIn 1976, a false report in the nation's leading supermarket [[tabloid journalism|tabloid]], ''[[The National Enquirer]],'' incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State [[Henry Kissinger]] in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her.  Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the ''Enquirer'', in 1981.  Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 by a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of [[tabloid journalism]].<ref name=\"carol_burnett_launches_1981_03_22_upi\">Scott, Vernon, [http://www.upi.com/Archives/1981/03/22/Carol-Burnett-launches-trial-balloon/6032354085200/ \"Carol Burnett launches trial balloon,\"], March 22, 1981, ''[[United Press International]] (UPI),'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"carol_burnett_given_1981_03_27_lindsey_nytimes\">Lindsey, Robert, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/03/27/us/carol-burnett-given-1.6-million-in-suit-against-national-enquirer.html \"Carol Burnett given 1.6 million in suit against National Enquirer,\"], March 27, 1981, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"how_tabloids_1991_01_04_nytimes\">[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/01/04/news/how-the-supermarket-tabloids-stay-out-of-court.html \"How the Supermarket Tabloids Stay Out of Court,\"] January 4, 1991, ''[[The New York Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloids_lies_1991_08_12_langberg_nytimes\">Langberg, Barry (libel attorney for Carol Burnett and others), opinion essay: [http://articles.latimes.com/1991-08-12/entertainment/ca-468_1_tabloids \"Tabloids' Lies Abuse the First Amendment,\"] August 12, 1991, ,\"], ''[[The Los Angeles Times]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt1_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 1 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"tabloid_law_pt2_1999_08_atlantic\">Beam, Alex, [https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1999/08/tabloid-law/377722/ \"Tabloid Law,\"] Part 2 of two parts, August 1999, ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref><ref name=\"dr_phil_2016_07_14_wash_post\">Andrews, Travis M., [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2016/07/14/dr-phil-and-wife-robin-sue-the-national-enquirer-for-250000-million-citing-defamation/ \"Dr_ Phil and wife Robin sue the National Enquirer for $250 million, citing defamation,\"] July 14, 2016, ''[[The Washington Post]],'' retrieved January 1, 2017.</ref>\n\nThe former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book ''The Untold Story'' asserted that after the Burnett lawsuit, while under his leadership, the ''Enquirer'' worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources.\n\n'''Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation'''\n\nIn 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against [[20th Century Fox|Twentieth Century Fox]] requesting at least $2 million in damages, alleging copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights, and misappropriation of name and likeness due to the use of her charwoman character and an altered version of \"Carol's Theme\", the theme song used in ''The Carol Burnett Show'', without her permission. The character and theme were used in the \"[[Peterotica]]\" episode of ''[[Family Guy]]'' when the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop and one of them states it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. The charwoman is shown mopping the floor in the porn shop, and the characters subsequently discuss Burnett's ear tug and make a crude comment about it.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''. The series revolves around the Mixels, small creatures that can mix and combine with one another in creative and unpredictable storylines. Although previous [[Lego]] series, such as ''[[Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu]]'' and ''[[Legends of Chima]]'' use [[CGI animation]], ''Mixels'' made use of [[Toon Boom]] Harmony software, which is animated at [[Atomic Cartoons, Inc.]], before later being animated [[Traditional animation|traditionally]] at [[Digital eMation|Digital eMation, Inc.]], Big Star Entertainment, Inc., and [[Saerom Animation|Saerom Animation, Inc.]].\n\nA mobile app was released for the series on March 4, 2014, named ''Calling All Mixels'', and even earlier two websites, one on the LEGO website and another owned by Cartoon Network, were launched where fans can learn about the Mixels. Nine series of collectible Lego building toys were released, based on the characters. On February 19, 2014, the series began airing as an interstitial program on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], and still currently airs as such.\n\nThe TV series wrapped up production in July 2016, and the series finale aired on October 1, 2016,<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-reichek-9256218</ref> marking the end of the franchise, bar references in ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]''<ref>https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mixels/images/c/c2/Mixels_ug_poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20170513035137</ref> and ''[[The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part]].<ref>https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mixels/images/4/49/CUBITINLEGOMOVIE2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20190304222843</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nMixels involves many different, fun-loving tribes\u2014each tribe having a different color scheme\u2014who inhabit a fantasy land of adventure and wonder. They can Mix (combining two Mixels), Max (combining all three Mixels of the same tribe), and Murp (when a mix goes horribly wrong) in all kinds of situations, using the mysterious Cubits. All that stands in their way are the small, evil, discolored Nixels led by the tall King Nixel.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Mixels===\n\n====Infernites (Series 1)====\nA tribe based on [[fire]] and the primary tribe of Series 1. They live in the Magma Wastelands. When all 3 combine, they become a bipedal t-rex-like creature with fire breath. Their cubits are red. This tribe is led by Flain.\n\n* Flain (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]): a smart and brave Mixel with a head prone to fire.\n* Vulk (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): a dim-witted but lovable Mixel with super-heated fingers. \n* Zorch (voiced by David P. Smith): a super-speedy prankster aided by his fiery jet boosters.\n\n====Cragsters====\nA tribe based on [[rock (geology)|rock]] and the secondary tribe of Series 1. They live in the tunnels they have dug in the mine. When all 3 combine, they become a giant humanoid rock golem that can turn into a boulder that can roll at enemies. Their cubits are grey. This tribe is led by Krader.\n\n* Krader (voiced by David P. Smith): a tough Mixel with a giant hand and a short temper.\n* Seismo (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]): a lanky, nervous Mixel who can cause earthquakes with his massive feet.\n* Shuff (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): a not-so-bright Mixel with a kind heart and a body like a living wrecking ball.\n\n====Electroids====\nA tribe based on [[electricity]] and the tertiary tribe of Series 1. They live in the Mountain City. When all 3 combine, they become a bipedal lion-like creature who can shoot electricity from his tail. Their cubits are yellow. This tribe is led by Teslo.\n\n* Teslo (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]): a super-smart Mixel with a fear of heights and an electric tail.\n* Zaptor (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]): a quirky and highly-charged adrenaline junkie with a deep love for Hamlogna sandwiches. \n* Volectro (voiced by David P. Smith): a hyper and energetic Mixel with a static-charged hairdo.\n\n====Frosticons (Series 2)====\nA tribe based on [[ice]] and the primary tribe of Series 2. They live in the icy popsicle lands in the Frozen Volcanoes. When all three combine, they become a blue dinosaur-like creature with claws of ice. Their cubits are blue. This tribe is led by Flurr.\n\n* Flurr (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2212 Flurr is the leader of the chilled-out tribe of Frosticons, a blue Mixel tribe that hails from the frozen crystalline shells of dead volcanoes. Flurr is the only tribe member who never seems sleepy and this curious creature likes to fly around and explore Frosticon lands. Flurr is great at spotting invading Nixels far away but somestimes misses the most obvious things!\n* Slumbo (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2212 Slumbo is the sleepiest and dreamiest of the Frosticons, a blue Mixel tribe which hails from the frozen crystalline shells of dead volcanoes. It takes an earthquake to wake this guy up, but when Slumbo is awake, this lazy Frosticon has the muscle to move giant objects and create obstacles for Nixels. But beware, Slumbo can get brain freeze from making ice tunnels.\n* Lunk (voiced by [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) \u2212 The unbelievably slow Lunk makes other members of the permanently chilled-out Frosticon tribe seem positively energetic. Lunk might not be the brainiest, or the most graceful when waddling along ice balancing on his stubby hands, but that thick ice exoskeleton makes this Mixel incredibly durable. And one sneeze from Lunk can instantly freeze a Nixel in an ice cube.\n\n====Fang Gang====\nA tribe based on [[wood]] and the secondary tribe of Series 2.

(TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]''. The series revolves around the Mixels, small creatures that can mix and combine with one another in creative and unpredictable storylines. Although previous [[Lego]] series, such as ''[[Lego Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu]]'' and ''[[Legends of Chima]]'' use [[CGI animation]], ''Mixels'' made use of [[Toon Boom]] Harmony software, which is animated at [[Atomic Cartoons, Inc.]], before later being animated [[Traditional animation|traditionally]] at [[Digital eMation|Digital eMation, Inc.]], Big Star Entertainment, Inc., and [[Saerom Animation|Saerom Animation, Inc.]].\n\nA mobile app was released for the series on March 4, 2014, named ''Calling All Mixels'', and even earlier two websites, one on the LEGO website and another owned by Cartoon Network, were launched where fans can learn about the Mixels. Nine series of collectible Lego building toys were released, based on the characters. On February 19, 2014, the series began airing as an interstitial program on [[Boomerang (TV network)|Boomerang]], and still currently airs as such.\n\nThe TV series wrapped up production in July 2016, and the series finale aired on October 1, 2016,<ref>https://www.linkedin.com/in/jordan-reichek-9256218</ref> marking the end of the franchise, bar references in ''[[Uncle Grandpa]]''<ref>https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mixels/images/c/c2/Mixels_ug_poster.png/revision/latest?cb=20170513035137</ref> and ''[[The LEGO Movie 2: The Second Part]].<ref>https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/mixels/images/4/49/CUBITINLEGOMOVIE2.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20190304222843</ref>\n\n==Overview==\nMixels involves many different, fun-loving tribes\u2014each tribe having a different color scheme\u2014who inhabit a fantasy land of adventure and wonder. They can Mix (combining two Mixels), Max (combining all three Mixels of the same tribe), and Murp (when a mix goes horribly wrong) in all kinds of situations, using the mysterious Cubits. All that stands in their way are the small, evil, discolored Nixels led by the tall King Nixel.\n\n==Characters==\n\n===Mixels===\n\n====Infernites (Series 1)====\nA tribe based on [[fire]] and the primary tribe of Series 1. They live in the Magma Wastelands. When all 3 combine, they become a bipedal t-rex-like creature with fire breath. Their cubits are red. This tribe is led by Flain.\n\n* Flain (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212 Flain is their adventurous leader. Known as \"the smart one\" to friends because this Infernite can spell... but beware! If Flain thinks too hard that massive brain will soon catch fire.\n* Vulk (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212 One-eyed Vulk is the strong but dim-witted member of the Infernites. His scorching hot hands can melt escape routes through solid rocks and fend of Nixels... just stay clear of this loyal and goofy Mixel's super hot high-fives!\n* Zorch (voiced by David P. Smith) \u2212 Zorch is the speediest of the red hot tribe of Infernites that live amid the lava near the planet's core. When he is not playing pranks, the fiery jets from this cheeky Mixel's backside leave Nixels standing in a cloud of smoke!\n\n====Cragsters====\nA tribe based on [[rock (geology)|rock]] and the secondary tribe of Series 1. They live in the tunnels they have dug in the mine. When all 3 combine, they become a giant humanoid rock golem that can turn into a boulder that can roll at enemies. Their cubits are grey. This tribe is led by Krader.\n\n* Krader (voiced by David P. Smith) \u2212 Super-strong Krader is a tough guy, has a short fuse and is as close to a leader as the Cragsters have. With a rotating torso and a massive hand that folds into a demolition ball, he can bulldoze rock and dig deep pits to trap Nixels.\n* Seismo (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212 Seismo is a quiet and shy Cragster, and just a nervous tap of this Mixel's huge feet can cause an earthquake. This can be useful when Nixels attack because Seismo's stomp can cause an avalanche to bury them!\n* Shuff (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212 Shuff is helpful and friendly, but very clumsy. He has a body like a living wrecking ball and usually ends up accidentally smashing everything.\n\n====Electroids====\nA tribe based on [[electricity]] and the tertiary tribe of Series 1. They live in the Mountain City. When all 3 combine, they become a bipedal lion-like creature who can shoot electricity from his tail. Their cubits are yellow. This tribe is led by Teslo.\n\n* Teslo (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212 Teslo is the lookout for the yellow tribe of Electroids. He has an electrically charged tail to zap any Nixels who challenge him. This dynamic Mixel has a secret fear of heights... well, not that secret, but the other Electroids don't let Teslo know that they know!\n* Zaptor (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212 Up for anything, Zaptor is the super-charged adrenaline junkie of the Electroids. Capable of releasing massive blasts of energy and blinding light, he can give his friends sunburn. They would prefer it if this living lightning rod of a Mixel directed those high voltage blasts at the Nixels.\n* Volectro (voiced by David P. Smith) \u2212 Every day is a bad hair day for scatter-brained Volectro. One too many electric shocks have made him emit loads of static energy which this hilarious Mixel uses to draw anything it desires to that mega hairdo!\n\n====Frosticons (Series 2)====\nA tribe based on [[ice]] and the primary tribe of Series 2. They live in the icy popsicle lands in the Frozen Volcanoes. When all three combine, they become a blue dinosaur-like creature with claws of ice. Their cubits are blue. This tribe is led by Flurr.\n\n* Flurr (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2212 Flurr is the leader of the chilled-out tribe of Frosticons, a blue Mixel tribe that hails from the frozen crystalline shells of dead volcanoes. Flurr is the only tribe member who never seems sleepy and this curious creature likes to fly around and explore Frosticon lands. Flurr is great at spotting invading Nixels far away but somestimes misses the most obvious things!\n* Slumbo (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2212 Slumbo is the sleepiest and dreamiest of the Frosticons, a blue Mixel tribe which hails from the frozen crystalline shells of dead volcanoes. It takes an earthquake to wake this guy up, but when Slumbo is awake, this lazy Frosticon has the muscle to move giant objects and create obstacles for Nixels. But beware, Slumbo can get brain freeze from making ice tunnels.\n* Lunk (voiced by [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) \u2212 The unbelievably slow Lunk makes other members of the permanently chilled-out Frosticon tribe seem positively energetic. Lunk might not be the brainiest, or the most graceful when waddling along ice balancing on his stubby hands, but that thick ice exoskeleton makes this Mixel incredibly durable. And one sneeze from Lunk can instantly freeze a Nixel in an ice cube.\n\n====Fang Gang====\nA tribe based on [[wood]] and the secondary tribe of Series 2. They live on a farm with totems and make food for their appetites. When they all combine together, they form a brown beaver-like creature. Their cubits are brown. This tribe is led by Jawg.\n\n* Jawg (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2212 Fiercely loyal, he'll use his indestructible teeth to protect his friends.\n* Gobba (voiced by [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) \u2212 His whip-like tongue has a super sense of taste that is amazingly accurate.\n* Chomly (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2212 A lethargic trash compactor, he'll eat just about anything that's not nailed down.\n\n====Flexers====\nA tribe based on [[rubber]] and the tertiary tribe of Series 2. They live in the Sproingylands, using their stretchtastic talents to fight Nixels. all three combine, they become a hermit crab-like creature. Their cubits are orange. This tribe is led by Kraw.\n\n* Kraw (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) \u2212 He loves to stretch his intellect in a battle of wits, but he also just loves to stretch and bounce.\n* Tentro (voiced by [[Phil LaMarr]]) \u2212 Although he suffers from a lack of confidence, his tentacles make him powerful and versatile.\n* Balk (voiced by [[Billy West (voice actor)|Billy West]]) \u2212 He uses his head as a rubber mallet, but he may have knocked a few screws loose.\n\n====Glorp Corp (Series 3)====\nA tribe based on [[biofilm|slime]] and the primary tribe of Series 3. They live in a castle in the deepest part of a deep swamp. When all three combine, they turn into a squirrel-like creature. Their cubits are green. This tribe is led by Glomp.\n\n* Glomp (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matt Taylor]]) \u2212 He's always hatching some crazy plan, but the real thing to watch out for is his runny nose!\n* Glurt (voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]]) \u2212 The avid garbage collector, if it's old, worn out, and smelly, he has a name for it: LUNCH!\n* Torts (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) \u2212 This slow-moving guy has some super-gooey hands. Great for catching Nixels, not so much for high-fives.\n\n====Spikels====\nA tribe based on [[spine (zoology)|spikes]] and the secondary tribe of Series 3. The three are fun-loving and love to play and dance. They live in a desert with huge [[flowers]]. When all three join forces, they turn into a brachaeosaurus-like creature. Their cubits are tan. This tribe is led by Scorpi.\n\n* Scorpi (voiced by [[Maria Bamford]]) \u2212 Don't get stung by Scorpi, the super-cute but super-skittish member with a spike-ended tail for defense.\n* Footi (voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]]) \u2212 Keep on moving with Footi, with spiny legs and gargantuan feet for dancing.\n* Hoogi (voiced by [[Maddie Taylor|Matt Taylor]]) \u2212 Lend a helping hand with Hoogi, with huge hands for crashing and smashing... and hugs.\n\n====Wiztastics====\nA tribe based on [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and the tertiary tribe of Series 3. All three live in a magic [[tent]] and love to put on magic shows for the other Mixels. When all three combine, they turn into a griffin-like creature. Their cubits are purple. This tribe is led by Magnifo.\n\n* Magnifo (voiced by [[Brian Stepanek]]) \u2212 Say Abracadabra to Magnifo, the magician who wields two magic wands and is the star of the shows.\n* Mesmo (voiced by [[Carlos Alazraqui]]) \u2212 Fly along with Mesmo, Magnifo's assistant who lacks in showmanship but is loyal.\n* Wizwuz (voiced by [[Bumper Robinson]]) \u2212 Burp out with Wizwuz, the fun-loving member of the tribe.\n\n====Orbitons (Series 4)====\nA tribe based on [[outer space|space]] and the primary tribe of Series 4. They live in Orbitopia, located on the Mixel Moon. When all three combine, they turn into a spaceship-shaped creature. Their cubits are lime and gold. This tribe is led by Niksput.\n\n* Niksput (voiced by [[Andrew Kishino]]) \u2212 Despite having the charm and charisma of a leading man, his mind is slow, to the point of bravely leaping into any danger before realizing how terrified he is.\n* Nurp-Naut (voiced by Justin Grollman for Nurp, and [[Rodger Bumpass]] for Naut) \u2212 Nurp-Naut has a bad case of split personality with his double-face head! One face of him, Nurp is an innocent baby; the other, Naut, is a wise old man! This makes him very forgetful and accident-prone, as a side effect.\n* Rokit (voiced by [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]]) \u2212 The trooper of the Orbitons does everything as if his life depends on it, whether it's petting a kitten, or eating some pizza. One of Rokit's biggest pet peeves is that none of the other Mixels mimic his extreme lifestyle.\n \n====Infernites====\nA tribe also based on [[fire]] and the secondary tribe of Series 4. They live in the Magma Desert and are the apparent cousins of the original Infernites. When all three combine, they form a cyclops like creature. Their cubits are crimson. They are still led by Flain, despite the fact that they are a separate branch of the Infernites.\n\n* Burnard (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212 This fun guy is always laughing! He laughs through fear and sadness, he just loves to laugh! If he laughs hard enough, he even spews fire! Ironically, the only way to get him to stop laughing is by telling a funny joke. He won't get the punchline!\n* Meltus (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212 Although Meltus may look strong and tough, he really is only a gentle giant. Unfortunately, he is allergic to everything, literally! If he even steps outside his house, he starts sneezing fire!\n* Flamzer (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]) \u2212 While Burnard sees fun in everything, Flamzer sees fear in everything! He is very untrusting, and at the slightest sign of danger, he speeds away with the help of his flaming tail. And when he runs, there's no catching him!\n \n====Glowkies====\nA tribe based on [[night]] and the tertiary tribe of Series 4. They live the Glowkie Caves in an all-new area called the Mixel Moon, and love to put on shows. When all three combine, they form a giant bat like creature. Their cubits are navy blue and light cyan. This tribe is led by Globert.\n\n* Globert (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]) \u2212 Globert claims to wow and impress any audience, and with his glow-in-the-dark eye, that's not hard to do! He loves to perform, and is the tribe's ultimate exhibitionist.\n* Vampos (voiced by [[Sam Riegel]]) \u2212 Vampos is the ultimate sports nut. He loves any sport, from rockball to acrobatics, and he's good at all of these, too! He is also said to be very relaxed and calm.\n* Boogly (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]) \u2212 Boogly is, well, a snob. He claims to have done everything there is, so nothing impresses him. He is always complaining, and is very critical.\n\n====Klinkers (Series 5)====\n* Gox (voiced by Chris Cox) \u2212\n* Jinky (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2212\n* Kamzo (voiced by [[Steve Blum]]) \u2212\n\n====Frosticons====\n* Krog (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]) \u2212\n* Chilbo (voiced by Griffin Burns) \u2212\n* Snoof (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2212\n\n====Lixers====\n* Spugg (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2212\n* Turg (voiced by [[Peter Jason]]) \u2212\n* Tungster (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212\n\n====Weldos (Series 6)====\n* Kramm (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]) \u2212\n* Forx (voiced by Chris Cox) \u2212\n* Wuzzo (voiced by [[Peter Jason]]) \u2212\n\n====Glorp Corp====\n* Dribbal (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2212\n* Gurggle (voiced by [[Jeff Bennett]]) \u2212\n* Slusho (voiced by Griffin Burns) \u2212\n\n====Munchos====\n* Snax (voiced by Griffin Burns) \u2212\n* Berp (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212\n* Vaka-Waka (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]] for Vaka, and [[Daran Norris]] for Waka) \u2212\n\n====MCPD (Series 7)====\n* Kuffs (voiced by [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]], later by [[Steve Blum]]) \u2212\n* Busto (voiced by Chris Cox) \u2212\n* Ticketz (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2212\n\n====Medivals====\n* Camillot (voiced by [[Jeff Glen Bennett]]) \u2212\n* Mixadel (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz|Richard Horvitz]]) \u2212\n* Paladum (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) \u2212\n\n====Mixies====\n* Jamzy (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]) \u2212\n* Tapsy \u2212\n* Trumpsy \u2212\n\n====MCFD (Series 8)====\n* Splasho (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz|Richard Horvitz]]) \u2212\n* Fire Chief (voiced by [[Peter Jason]]) \u2212\n* Aquad (voiced by [[Steve Blum]]) \u2212\n* Hydro (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212\n\n====Pyrratz====\n* Sharx (voiced by [[Peter Jason]]) \u2212\n* Skulzy \u2212\n* Lewt \u2212\n\n====Medix====\n* Surgeo (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212\n* Skrubz \u2212\n* Tuth (voiced by [[Peter Jason]]) \u2212\n\n====Trashoz (Series 9)====\n* Gobbol \u2212\n* Sweepz \u2212\n* Compax \u2212\n\n====Nindjas====\n* Mysto (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212\n* Cobrax (voiced by [[Leonard R. Garner Jr.|Leonard Garner]]) \u2212\n* Spinza (voiced by [[Steve Blum]]) \u2212\n\n====Newzers====\n* Screeno (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212\n* Camsta (voiced by [[Gregg Bissonette]]) \u2212\n* Myke (voiced by [[Gregg Bissonette]]) \u2212\n\n===Mixamals===\n* Amphipod (voiced by [[Daran Norris]]) \u2212\n* Mixapod (voiced by [[Eric Bauza]]) \u2212\n* Mixeloptors (all voiced by [[Michael Winslow]]) \u2212\n* Mixie Cat (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz|Richard Horvitz]]) \u2212\n\n===Nixels===\nNixels (all voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]]) are creatures who are enemies of the Mixels, and like to destroy any combinations that the Mixels create. This is because they consider themselves far superior to the Mixels, but are only able to say quite a few words. Their white faces can pop out of their bodies and walk around (with no arms).\n\n* Major Nixel (voiced by [[Fred Tatasciore]], later [[Rodger Bumpass]], and currently [[Peter Jason]]) \u2212 Major Nixel is the military leader of the Nixels. Unlike the other Nixels, he is capable of speech. He treats the other Nixels like a tornado treats cars, throwing and kicking them to steal cubits.\n* King Nixel (voiced by [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]], later by [[Steve Blum]]) \u2212 The true leader of the Nixels.\n\n===Other characters===\n\n====Glorp Corp====\n* Booger (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212\n\n====Flexers====\n* Teacher (voiced by [[Cree Summer]]) \u2212\n\n====Frosticons====\n* Scrud (voiced by [[Richard Steven Horvitz|Richard Horvitz]]) \u2212\n\n====Klinkers====\n* Principal Knave (voiced by Chris Cox) \u2212\n\n====MCPD====\n* Sergeant (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]) \u2212\n\n====Medivals====\n* King (voiced by [[Dave Fennoy]]) \u2212\n\n====Munchos====\n* Coach (voiced by [[Phil Hayes (actor)|Phil Hayes]]) \u2212\n* Zabo (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) \u2212\n\n====Spikels====\n* Blip (voiced by [[Tom Kenny]]) \u2212\n* Ranger Jinx (voiced by [[Jeff Glen Bennett]]) \u2212\n* Gate Keeper (voiced by [[Rodger Bumpass]]) \u2212\n\n==Episodes==\n\n===Series overview===\n<onlyinclude>{{Series overview\n| color1=#0ebfe9\n| link1=Mixels#Season 1 (2014)\n| episodes1=22\n| start1={{Start date|2014|2|12}}\n| end1={{End date|2014|8|31}}\n\n| color2=#0000ff\n| link2=Mixels#Season 2 (2015)\n| episodes2=9\n| start2={{Start date|2015|3|9}}\n| end2={{End date|2016|10|1}}\n}}</onlyinclude>\n\n===Season 1 (2014)===\n{| class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%;\"\n|- style=\"color:white;\"\n! style=\"background:#0ebfe9;\" | No. in<br />series\n! style=\"background:#0ebfe9;\" | No. in<br />season\n! style=\"background:#0ebfe9;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#0ebfe9;\" | Written and storyboarded by\n! style=\"background:#0ebfe9;\" | Original air date\n! style=\"background:#0ebfe9;\" | Production<br />code\n|-\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=1\n|EpisodeNumber2=1\n|Title=Coconapple\n|WrittenBy=\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|2|12}}\n|ProdCode=501-296-01A\n|ShortSummary=Seismo and Zorch try to get a coconapple<!-- Combination of Coconut and Apple --> hanging from a tree.\n|LineColor=0ebfe9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=2\n|EpisodeNumber2=2\n|Title=Hot Lava Shower\n|WrittenBy=\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|2|12}}\n|ProdCode=501-296-02F\n|ShortSummary=Vulk gets the Infernites to fix the Lava Shower and they MAX to unclog the pipes, but heats a toilet and water fountain that results in burning Teslo's mouth and Krader's rear.\n|LineColor=0ebfe9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=3\n|EpisodeNumber2=3\n|Title=Cookironi\n|WrittenBy=\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|2|12}}\n|ProdCode=501-296-02B\n|ShortSummary=Nine first wave Mixels fight over a single cookironi<!-- Combination of Cookie and Macaroni -->.\n|LineColor=0ebfe9\n}}\n{{Episode list\n|EpisodeNumber=4\n|EpisodeNumber2=4\n|Title=Electrock\n|WrittenBy=\n|OriginalAirDate={{Start date|2014|2|19}}\n|ProdCode=501-296-01D\n|ShortSummary=Krader finds the Electroid kingdom.
