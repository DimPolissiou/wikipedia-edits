The Conservatives retained control of the council with an increased majority, winning 35 of the 45 seats.\n\nWhen Guildford Borough Council was created under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] the electoral wards used were largely based on the wards and parish boundaries which had existed under the two previous councils - Guildford Municipal Borough Council (the town council) and Guildford Rural District Council, which together had been merged to form the new Guildford Borough Council.\n\nThere had been a slight degree of rewarding in the run up to the 1973 council election.<ref>See Guildford Borough Council - A Compendium of Municipal Election Results 1835 to 1974 by Roger Ottewill.</ref> For example, the pre 1973 Friary ward and pre 1973 St Nicolas ward were merged into a new Friary & St Nicolas ward.\n\nComplete rewarding though would only be completed in time for the 1976 elections.<ref>The Borough of Guildford (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975</ref> The main changes to the electoral wards in the run up to the 1976 elections were as follows -\n\nAsh ward (5 councillors) was split into two wards Ash (3 councillors) plus Ash Vale (2 councillors);\n\nA new Christchurch ward (2 councillors) was created from part of the Stoke ward and part of the Merrow & Burpham ward;<ref>From 1904 to 1933 there had been an electoral ward in this area of Guildford Municipal Borough Council called Christchurch.  From 1933 to 1951 its successor ward was known as Merrow & Christchurch.  In 1951 the Christchurch ward name disappeared for what would be 25 years - see Twentieth Century Local Election Results Vol 5 Guildford compiled by Roger Ottewill, published by  University of Plymouth.</ref>\n\nAs a result of this Merrow & Burpham ward reduced from 5 councillors to 3.  However the geographically reduced Stoke ward still retained its 3 councillors;\n\nArtington, Compton, Puttenham, Seale and Tongham, Shackleford and Wanborough ward (2 councillors) was split into two wards Tongham (1 councillor), plus Pilgrims (2 councillors).  This represented a gain of one councillor for this area;\n\nStoughton saw the number of councillors represent it increase from 2 to 3;\n\nWorplesdon also saw the number of councillors represent it increase from 2 to 3;\n\nAlbury, Shere and St Martha's ward (2 councillors) was renamed Tillingbourne (2 councillors);\n\nEast Clandon, West Clandon, East Horsley and West Horsley ward (3 councillors) was renamed Clandon and Horsley (3 councillors); and\n\nRipley, Wisley and Ockham ward (1 councillor) was renamed Lovelace (1 councillor).\n\nIn the 1976 election the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] lost three seats reducing their representation from 5 to 2.  They lost one councillor in Clandon & Horsley (previously called East Clandon, West Clandon, East Horsley and West Horsley).  They lost 2 of their 3 councillors in Friary & St Nicolas.\n\n[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] retained all 6 councillors in its two strongholds Stoke and Westborough.\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] increased their number of councillors from 29 to 35, a figure which up to and including 2011 still remained a record for any party in a full Guildford Borough Council election.\n\nThe Conservatives 6 gains included 3 gains from the Liberals - 2 in Friary & St Nicolas and 1 in Clandon & Horsley.  The Conservatives gained 1 seat from an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] in Tillingbourne (previously known as Aldbury, Shere and St Martha's) and made 2 gains as a result of an increase in the number of councillors representing the Stoughton and Worplesdon wards.\n\nA total of 2 independents were elected.  Independents lost one councillor in Tillingbourne, but gained one in the new Tongham ward where the elected candidate was described as an Independent Conservative.  That Independent Conservative then went on to stand at the next full council election, in 1979, as the official Conservative candidate for the Tongham ward.\n\n==Results<ref>Surrey Advertiser 7\u20138

The reason why Mr Laurence is believed to be a Conservative candidate rather than Labour candidate are - a) there are already three other Labour candidates listed in the newspaper for this three ward seat and any party putting up more candidates than positions available would only reduce their average vote and consequently reduce their chance of election which is highly unlikely; b) the number of votes Mr Laurence received fell between the numbers received by the two candidates described in the newspaper as Conservatives, but around 900 fewer votes than would have been expected if he had been a Labour candidate in this ward in this election; and c) there are only two candidates described as Conservatives in the newspaper for this ward in this election and it would be highly unusual in this era in Guildford for the Conservative not to challenge either the Liberals or Labour with their full quota of candidates, although the Conservatives on a number of occasions did not oppose Independents seeking election in Guildford during this era.</ref>\n |candidate = PM Laurence\n |votes = 577\n |percentage = \n |change = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party =

The Conservatives retained control of the council with an increased majority, winning 35 of the 45 seats.\n\nWhen Guildford Borough Council was created under the [[Local Government Act 1972]] the electoral wards used were largely based on the wards and parish boundaries which had existed under the two previous councils - Guildford Municipal Borough Council (the town council) and Guildford Rural District Council, which together had been merged to form the new Guildford Borough Council.\n\nThere had been a slight degree of rewarding in the run up to the 1973 council election.<ref>See Guildford Borough Council - A Compendium of Municipal Election Results 1835 to 1974 by Roger Ottewill.</ref>  For example, the pre 1973 Friary ward and pre 1973 St Nicolas ward were merged into a new Friary & St Nicolas ward.\n\nComplete rewarding though would only be completed in time for the 1976 elections.<ref>The Borough of Guildford (Electoral Arrangements) Order 1975</ref>  The main changes to the electoral wards in the run up to the 1976 elections were as follows -\n\nAsh ward (5 councillors) was split into two wards Ash (3 councillors) plus Ash Vale (2 councillors);\n\nA new Christchurch ward (2 councillors) was created from part of the Stoke ward and part of the Merrow & Burpham ward;<ref>From 1904 to 1933 there had been an electoral ward in this area of Guildford Municipal Borough Council called Christchurch.  From 1933 to 1951 its successor ward was known as Merrow & Christchurch.  In 1951 the Christchurch ward name disappeared for what would be 25 years - see Twentieth Century Local Election Results Vol 5 Guildford compiled by Roger Ottewill, published by  University of Plymouth.</ref>\n\nAs a result of this Merrow & Burpham ward reduced from 5 councillors to 3.  However the geographically reduced Stoke ward still retained its 3 councillors;\n\nArtington, Compton, Puttenham, Seale and Tongham, Shackleford and Wanborough ward (2 councillors) was split into two wards Tongham (1 councillor), plus Pilgrims (2 councillors).  This represented a gain of one councillor for this area;\n\nStoughton saw the number of councillors represent it increase from 2 to 3;\n\nWorplesdon also saw the number of councillors represent it increase from 2 to 3;\n\nAlbury, Shere and St Martha's ward (2 councillors) was renamed Tillingbourne (2 councillors);\n\nEast Clandon, West Clandon, East Horsley and West Horsley ward (3 councillors) was renamed Clandon and Horsley (3 councillors); and\n\nRipley, Wisley and Ockham ward (1 councillor) was renamed Lovelace (1 councillor).\n\nIn the 1976 election the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberals]] lost three seats reducing their representation from 5 to 2.  They lost one councillor in Clandon & Horsley (previously called East Clandon, West Clandon, East Horsley and West Horsley).  They lost 2 of their 3 councillors in Friary & St Nicolas.\n\n[[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] retained all 6 councillors in its two strongholds Stoke and Westborough.\n\nThe [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] increased their number of councillors from 29 to 35, a figure which up to and including 2011 still remained a record for any party in a full Guildford Borough Council election.\n\nThe Conservatives 6 gains included 3 gains from the Liberals - 2 in Friary & St Nicolas and 1 in Clandon & Horsley.  The Conservatives gained 1 seat from an [[Independent (politician)|Independent]] in Tillingbourne (previously known as Aldbury, Shere and St Martha's) and made 2 gains as a result of an increase in the number of councillors representing the Stoughton and Worplesdon wards.\n\nA total of 2 independents were elected.  Independents lost one councillor in Tillingbourne, but gained one in the new Tongham ward where the elected candidate was described as an Independent Conservative.  That Independent Conservative then went on to stand at the next full council election, in 1979, as the official Conservative candidate for the Tongham ward.\n\n==Results<ref>Surrey Advertiser 7\u20138

It is believed that this is a misprint and should read \"(Con)\".  The reason why Mr Laurence is believed to be a Conservative candidate rather than Labour candidate are - a) there are already three other Labour candidates listed in the newspaper for this three ward seat and any party putting up more candidates than positions available would only reduce their average vote and consequently reduce their chance of election which is highly unlikely; b) the number of votes Mr Laurence received fell between the numbers received by the two candidates described in the newspaper as Conservatives, but around 900 fewer votes than would have been expected if he had been a Labour candidate in this ward in this election; and c) there are only two candidates described as Conservatives in the newspaper for this ward in this election and it would be highly unusual in this era in Guildford for the Conservative not to challenge either the Liberals or Labour with their full quota of candidates, although the Conservatives on a number of occasions did not oppose Independents seeking election in Guildford during this era.</ref>\n |candidate = PM Laurence\n |votes = 577\n |percentage = \n |change = \n}}\n{{Election box candidate with party link|\n |party =

{"title_page": "Basketball moves", "text_new": "{{Use mdy dates|date=January 2016}}\n{{More citations needed|date=January 2007}}\n\n'''Basketball moves''' are generally individual actions used by players in [[basketball]] to pass by defenders to gain access to the basket or to get a clean pass to a teammate to score a two pointer or three pointer.\n\n== Dribbling ==\n{{main|Dribble}}\n\nDribbling is bouncing the ball continuously with one hand at a time without ever holding the ball. Dribbling is necessary in order to take steps while possessing the ball. Once a player picks up their dribble (stops it by holding the ball), they may not dribble again until they pass, shoot, or otherwise lose possession of the ball and the ball touches a different player or the rim or backboard.\n\n=== Crossover ===\n{{main|Crossover dribble}}\n\nIn a Crossover, the ball handler changes the ball from one hand to the other using a single dribble. The is a fundamental dribbling technique in basketball used to keep the ball in the hand farthest from the defender (preventing a steal) while maintaining a desired speed and orientation on the court. It is very efficient when executing a drive. Make the crossover, get around your defender, and drive to the basket. A crossover functions best when the ball handler looks and acts like they are headed in one direction, before crossing over to the other direction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxoTzyvUO0s|title=How To Crossover So It ACTUALLY WORKS! Break Ankles In Basketball!|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> This can often be achieved by a simple head fake, or a step in that intended direction.<ref name=\"Gandolfi, Giorgio p. 29\">Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 29. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref> Some of the players famous for their crossover dribble include [[Tim Hardaway]], [[Allen Iverson]], [[Kyrie Irving]], [[Stephen Curry]], and [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\n=== Between the legs ===\n\nThis is a commonly used variation of the crossover in which the ball-handler bounces the ball off of the floor between his/her legs and catches it with the other hand on the opposite side of his/her body. It is used as a safer way to cross over while directly facing a defender, but requires more slowing of forward momentum than the crossover dribble.\n\n=== Behind the back ===\n\nThis advanced form of crossover involves the ball handler, bouncing the ball off of the floor behind his feet and catching it with the other hand, usually while his/her feet are no more than shoulder-width apart. If there are no defensive players around the ball handler except one directly facing him/her, and that defender does not expect this type of dribble, it can be an even safer way of crossing over compared to a between-the-legs. In all other cases, it is generally a dangerous move that can result in the ball bouncing off of the dribbler's feet or a steal.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 29-30. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref>\n\nThis dribble is especially useful for when the offensive player is really close to their defender and needs to change dribble hands, but doesn't have space to use a regular crossover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPBG2LD4n4|title=Basketball Moves: NEXT LEVEL Behind the Back Crossover Secrets!|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Wraparound ===\n\nThe wraparound is similar to a behind-the-back except; instead of the ball being thrown in a sideways direction and bouncing behind the ballhandler's back, it is swung further around the back and thrown in a forward direction, bouncing on the side or in front of the ballhandler's body. This move is mostly used when a defender lunges toward one side of the ballhandler's body for a steal. The ballhandler would then simply throw the ball around his body and quickly pass his defender.\n\n=== In and out dribble ===\n\nAn in and out dribble is widely used as a counter move to a crossover, whereby the ball handler fakes the crossover, and pushes the ball back out on the same hand.<ref name=\"Gandolfi, Giorgio p. 29\"/>\n\n=== V dribble ===\nBall is dribbled with same hand in a V motion.  Almost looks like a double crossover but ball stays in  hand.Always ensure the ball stays in the hand to prevent stealing.\n\n=== Different heights dribble ===\n\nThis technique involves dribbling the ball in different heights. This is usually combined with other dribbling techniques to make it more effective. It is mostly effective on players smaller or taller than the dribbler but not quite as much on players that are the same height as the dribbler. If you are facing a shorter opponent, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball low and then suddenly turning the ball very high. If the opponent is taller than you, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball high and quickly lowering the height of the dribble. If your opponent does not bite on your lure/trap, maintain the height of your dribble, and you can drive past them with more speed. If you're going to pass or shoot after your dribble, make sure that you will go back to your usual pace to maintain the momentum for your dribbling.\n\n=== Ankle breaker dribble ===\n\nThis is when an offensive player does a move that makes their defender stumble to the ground. Players' collapsing due to this rarely occurs under normal circumstances.  Typically this happens when a defender loses balance, trips over their own feet, or even slips.  An offensive player can't consistently control whether the defender falls, but using speed, body momentum, body contact and sharp changes of direction make it much more likely to happen.This move usually embarrasses the defender <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvXsBJxH-aM|title=3 Basketball Moves To Break Ankles! How To: Best Crossover Moves|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Hesitation move ===\nThe player makes a dash posture but does not actually apply force on the foot for one moment, and then dash full speed.\n\n== After the dribble ==\n\n=== Euro step ===\n{{main|Euro step}}\n\nThe Euro step (sometimes \"Eurostep\") is a move developed in European basketball in which a player, after picking up his dribble, takes a step in one direction, and then quickly takes a second step in the other direction before they attempt a layup. It is an attempt to evade at least one defender before attacking the basket.\n\n[[\u0160ar\u016bnas Mar\u010diulionis]], a Lithuanian, and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], an Argentine who arrived in the NBA from the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian league]], are credited with bringing the move to the NBA. It has since been widely used by many US-born players, such as [[Dwyane Wade]], [[James Harden]], and [[Russell Westbrook]]\n\n=== Pro-Hop ===\n\nThe combination of a euro step and a jump-stop, the pro-hop is a move in which a player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a synchronized left hand dribble with left foot step. The player then rips the ball to the opposite side of their body while landing on a jump-stop. The pro hop's ability to split defenders, or throw an opposing defender off rhythm through 'change of direction speed' is a move popularized by Shantay Legans, former point guard for University of California at Berkeley.\n\n=== Pro-hop euro step ===\n\nThe Pro-hop Euro Step combines the pro-hop and Euro step while removing the pro-hop's jump stop. The player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a left hand dribble with left foot step. Player then rips the ball to opposite side of their body (behind the back if skilled), takes two steps, and finishes with a reverse layup.\n\n=== Power up ===\n\nThe power up is a move in which the player lands on their outside foot then inside foot, and powers up toward the basket. An effective move because of its balance and power resulting from a two-foot gather and take off.\n\n=== Over-the-head ===\n\nThe over-the-head move is a move in which the player rotates the ball over their head in a circular fashion. This is done as the player is stepping to one side of the defender, while trying to get past him/her at the same time. It is essentially used as a way to prevent the ball from getting stolen. It is typically used when driving to the basket, and on fast breaks.\n\n== Shots ==\n\n=== Layups ===\n{{main|Layup}}\n\nA layup is a two-point attempt made by leaping from the ground, releasing the ball with one hand up near the basket, and using one hand to tip the ball over the rim and into the basket (lay-in) or banking it off the backboard and into the basket (lay-up). The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball.\n\nAn undefended layup is usually a high-percentage shot. The main challenge is getting near the rim and avoiding blocks by taller defenders who usually stand near the basket. Common layup strategies are to create space, releasing the ball from different spots or using an alternate hand. A player tall enough (or with sufficient leaping ability) to reach over the rim might choose to perform a more spectacular and higher percentage slam dunk (dropping or throwing the ball through the basket from above the rim) instead.\n\nAs the game has evolved through the years, so has the layup. Several different versions of the layup are used today. Layups can be broadly categorized into two types: the underarm and the overarm. The underarm layup involves using most of the wrist and the fingers to 'lay' the ball into the basket or off the board. The underarm layup is more commonly known as the [[Basketball moves#Finger roll|finger roll]]. A notable current NBA player who uses the underarm finger roll is [[Dwyane Wade]].\n\nFinger-rolls today have many forms, including the Around the World which involves a complete circle around the player before the layup and a variety of faking in the approach to the rim. A classic example is a play by former Kings point guard Jason Williams during his time with Sacramento, in which Williams brings the ball behind his back with his right hand, in a fake of a back pass, and then brings it front again with the same hand for the finish (reminiscent of [[Bob Cousy]] who pioneered the move).\n\nThe other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from considerably closer range. Overhand layups almost always involved the use of the backboard. Players like Scottie Pippen  and Karl Malone have used this move to great effect.\n\nIn addition, another variation of the lay-up is the wrong-foot layup. Typically, this move can be seen by inexperienced players with poor footwork, however, when done intentionally, a wrong-footed layup can deceive a defender into mistiming his block attempt. In a normal layup, the left foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand, and vice versa. However, in a wrong-footed layup, the right foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand. This also helps to shield the defender from reaching across to block the shot; in reaching across however, the defender will likely get called for a defensive foul. [[Tony Parker]] of the San Antonio Spurs relies heavily on the wrong footed layup, largely due to his smaller size and deceptive quickness.\n\n==== Reverse layup ====\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 125\n\n| image1    = 20130403 MCDAAG Isaiah Hicks does a reverse layup (1).JPG\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n| image2    = 20130403 MCDAAG Isaiah Hicks does a reverse layup (2).JPG\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n| image3    = 20130403 MCDAAG Isaiah Hicks does a reverse layup (3).JPG\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  =\n\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Isaiah Hicks]] does a reverse layup at the [[2013 McDonald's All-American Boys Game]]\n| footer_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\nA reverse layup is a layup that is finished on the opposite side of the court's split-line, than the player began the attack on.\n\n==== Finger roll ====\n{{main|Finger roll}}\n\nA finger roll is performed when a player shoots the ball with one hand during a layup and then lifts his fingers, rolling the ball into the basket. The rotation produced provides the ball with a soft touch, and the ball will roll around the rim and then drop into the basket.  Guard [[George Gervin|George \"The Iceman\" Gervin]] was known for having one of the best finger rolls in the game along center [[Wilt Chamberlain]]. [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]] are other notable practitioners, while former NBA star [[Jason Kidd]] is renowned for his smooth finger rolls as well.\n\n==== Tear drop ====\n\nThe tear drop, also called a '''runner''' or a '''floater''', is usually performed by undersized players (mainly [[point guard]]s).  A player usually starts the layup procedure a good distance away from the basket. The ball is generally released earlier and in a higher arc than the normal layup. The ball should be away before the taller defender has the chance to block it. The purpose of this shooting move is to make the defender miss blocking the ball as the ball is released from the hand one moment sooner than expected. It is so-named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arc like a falling tear drop. [[Gary Payton]] and [[John Stockton]] during their primes, the former in the mid-to-late 90s and the latter in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best tear drops in the game. [[Chris Paul]], [[Tony Parker]], and [[Stephen Curry (basketball)|Stephen Curry]] frequently use the tear drop with great success.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cacciola |first=Scott |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/sports/basketball/with-teardrop-shots-nbas-little-guys-gain-upper-hand.html?pagewanted=all |title=With Hop and Flick, Little Guys Get Upper Hand |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> [[Antawn Jamison]] had one of the most highly effective tear drop shots in the league despite being a power forward. [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], [[Juan Carlos Navarro (basketball)|Juan Carlos Navarro]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Rajon Rondo]], [[Jose Barea|J.J. Barea]], and [[Derrick Rose]] are currently known for the tear drop move.\n\n==== Power layup ====\n\nPower layup, also called '''jump stop layup''', is a continuous shooting move in which a player stops dribbling and makes a huge leap forward(jump stop), while securing the ball in both hands from the dribbling hand, then making a layup. The move is generally used as a layup because the huge movement coming from the leap provides the momentum for the player to jump forward for a layup.  The move is a great way to squeeze the player under the basket for a fast layup.\n\n==== Double clutch ====\n\nA double clutch is a move associated with a layup or a dunk; it is a change of ball position in mid-air (similar to the \"up and under\" move, but performed while the player is in the air). It is effectively used by many players.\n\n=== Bank shot ===\n\nA ''bank shot'' in [[basketball]] is a shot that relies on the ball bouncing off the backboard and into the basket. It is frequently used for mid-range [[jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]]s from around a 45\u00b0 angle and [[layup]]s. It is not commonly used for long-range shots or shots from the middle or near the baseline. The purpose of using the backboard is to try to hit the backboard at an angle, thus slowing the speed of the ball and increasing its chances of falling into the hoop. Researchers at [[North Carolina State University]] found that bank shots may be 20 percent more effective up to a distance of about 12 feet than direct shots.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kulikowski|first=Mick|title=The physics of bank shots|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/ncsu-tpo031011.php|accessdate=March 12, 2011|date=March 10, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110328065720/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/ncsu-tpo031011.php| archivedate= March 28, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Another term for a bank shot is \"off the glass.\" [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players known for using the bank shot often are [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]], [[George Gervin]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Scottie Pippen]], and [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\n=== Putback and tip-in ===\n\nA putback describes a situation where a player secures an offensive rebound, then immediately scores a basket.  If the player secures the rebound while in the air, for the shot to be considered a putback, the player can land on the ground before shooting, but cannot dribble before taking the shot.  If the player does not secure the rebound but instead taps the ball into the basket, it is considered a tip-in.  There is a point where the difference between a putback and a tip-in is subjective (e.g., a one-handed rebound in the air followed by a shot before touching the ground). A putback jam is a spectacular alternative to the tip-in, where the ball is slam-dunked off the rebound in the same motion.  [[Bill Russell]] would use this move during his college days in the mid-1950s<ref name=johnson/><ref name=Paul/>  [[Josh Smith]] and [[Kenyon Martin]] are more recent users of the putback jam. It is also a primary source of scoring for All-Star center [[Dwight Howard]], who led the NBA in dunks in the 2008\u20132009, 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 seasons.\n\n== Triple threat position and related moves ==\n\n''Triple threat'' is the position when a player facing a defender receives a pass but has not dribbled yet.  The offensive player's feet are slightly wider than shoulder width and slightly on the balls of their feet, their knees flexed, with both hands on the basketball in front of them or almost resting on their thigh, presenting the defender with an opponent able to move in any direction.  One foot is held as the pivot and the other slightly ahead. From this, the player can choose from three options: to [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump-shoot]], to [[dribble]] (drive) past the defender or to [[Basketball passes|pass]] it to a teammate. There are also options to get the defender out of their defensive stance by using '''jab steps''' and '''pump fakes'''.\n\n=== Pivot ===\n\nPivoting is the act of rotating one's body while keeping the ball of one foot in place on the floor. Most of the player's balance should be on the pivot foot while slightly raising the heel in order to pivot on the ball of the foot. Pivoting can be done with or without the ball as it is an important tool to quickly change direction or orientation to the basket.<ref>Krause, Jerry V., Jerry Meyer, and Don Meyer. ''Basketball Skills & Drills: Third Edition'', p. 9. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736067072}}.</ref>\n\n=== Jab step ===\n\nA jab step, also known as ''side step,'' is performed when a player holds onto the ball before dribbling while his non-pivot leg performs a jabbing forward or side motion.  This move is used to test defender's defensive weaknesses and stance.  A combination of the pump fake, the drive, the shot and the crossover drive can be performed along with the jab step to lure the opponent out of his defense. Forward [[Carmelo Anthony]] is well known for taking the jab step, as was 13-year pro [[Kiki Vandeweghe]]. When the player does this, the defender falls off from their defensive stance, creating a space between the player and the defender, allowing them to take a quick mid-range jumper, a three-pointer, or a drive \"to the lane.\"\n\n=== Pump fake ===\n\nA pump fake (also called a shot fake) is a feigned attempt at a jump shot, restrained before the feet leave the ground.  The pump fake is a fundamental move in basketball, used to cause defenders to jump (known in basketball slang as \"lifting\" the defender) or be shifted off-balance. Its main applications are in the low post area, where a player is much more likely to have his or her shot blocked.  On the perimeter, it is useful in creating open lanes to the basket by \"showing\" the ball enough to entice a defender to attempt to block or steal it, allowing the dribbler to penetrate easily. Michael Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade are known masters of the pump fake, with Leonard and Jordan being known to frequently use the one hand pump fake variation.\n\n=== Drawing contact ===\n\nAn offensive move intended to produce a foul call on the defensive player. A typical strategy is to drive into a defensive player whose feet are not stationary.  When the two players make bodily contact, a blocking foul can be called on the defensive player.  If the defensive player has a set position (i.e., both feet are stationary and arms are not in a downward motion), the contact can result in a charging foul against the offensive player (this is known as ''taking the charge'' for the fouled defensive player). Another way of drawing contact is to pump fake and then jump towards the defender, make contact and then shoot; this gets you to the foul line. If you make the basket (often made in the paint), you get the basket and one foul shot. Players like [[DeMar DeRozan]], [[James Harden]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Damian Lillard]], and [[Dwyane Wade]] have mastered the art of drawing contact.\n\n=== Shuffle ===\n\nThis move is similar to the jab step, but smaller. It is when a player uses multiple very little jab steps to throw off a defender and keep him constantly guessing whether you will go to the basket or not. It was used frequently by former [[San Antonio Spurs]] forward [[Tim Duncan]].\n\n== Posting up ==\n\nTo \"post up\" is to establish a position in the low post, the area near the basket below the foul line, usually in order to take advantage of a smaller defender. The offensive player usually faces away from the basket, so that his body can protect the ball from the defender. From this position, options such as spinning or backing down the defender to close in to the basket for better scoring opportunities become available.\n\n=== Up and under ===\n\n[[Image:RichardMasonRocca.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mason Rocca]] making a hook shot for [[Eldo Napoli]], 2006]]\n\nThe up and under is a move consisting of two parts: a shot fake (the up) and a step-through (the under). First the player with the ball fakes a shot by thrusting the ball above his head as if to take a shot, then when the defender jumps in an attempt to block the shot, the offensive player steps by him and attempts a clear, unguarded shot.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 45. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref>\n\nGenerally used by post players, [[Hakeem Olajuwon]] and [[Kevin McHale (basketball)|Kevin McHale]] were considered masters of this move.<ref name=\"Thorpe\">Thorpe, David. [http://insider.espn.go.com/nba/insider/columns/story?columnist=thorpe_david&page=ScoutingPost Scouting breakdown: The game's best post players], espn.com, accessed March 29, 2007.</ref>\n\n=== Hook shot ===\n{{main|Hook shot}}\n\nThe hook shot is one of the most effective inside moves, but it is also quite difficult to execute. A hook shot begins when the player puts his body between the ball and the opponent. He then releases the ball towards the basket with his outside hand in a \"hook\" motion. The hook shot and variations such as the jump-hook and skyhook are effective because they are very difficult for the defender to block, although it is harder to hit the shot with precision. The advantage the hook shot offers is the space it creates between the offensive player and his defender. This extra space can reduce or eliminate the advantages enjoyed by a taller defender. The hook shot is most often used by post players because it is difficult to make the shot from a distance.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 44-45. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref> [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] became the NBA's all-time leading scorer by using his almost indefensible skyhook.\n\n=== Drop step ===\n\nAlso called a ''reverse pivot'', the drop step is a move in which the player posting up takes a back step on the side of a defender behind him and spins to that side to gain leverage.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 42-44. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref>\n\n=== Power move ===\n\nThe power move is executed by pivoting towards the basket to seal the defender, then using a two handed power dribble followed by a jump stop to get closer to the basket. Immediately after the jump stop the player jumps up for a power shot or jump hook.<ref>Krause, Jerry V., Jerry Meyer, and Don Meyer. ''Basketball Skills & Drills: Third Edition'', p. 140. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736067072}}.</ref>\n\n=== Spin and drive ===\n\nWhen the offensive player receives the ball in the low post, the player either fakes in one direction and then spins in the opposite direction, or immediately after catching the ball, the player spins around the defender and goes up for the shot or takes one hard dribble and then takes the shot.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 47. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref><ref>{{YouTube | id= XC5r5s6qe6M&index=3&list=PLAC32B3B8F79CE092 | title= Low Post Spin Move }}</ref>\n\n=== Sikma move ===\n\nNamed after [[Jack Sikma]], the post player receives the ball with their back to the basket and keeps the ball at forehead level. The post then pivots to face the basket while bringing the ball overhead (almost behind the head) to shoot a jump shot. The ball is released high over the head making it difficult for the defense to block.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 48. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref><ref>{{YouTube | id= O1KEWqgZmeE | title= Sikma Move }}</ref>\n\n=== Dream shake ===\n\nNamed after [[Hakeem Olajuwon|Hakeem \"The Dream\" Olajuwon]], this move is executed when a post player dribbles alongside the baseline and with one hand under the ball fakes a layup, then pivots to the outside for a jump hook. If the defender recovers and jumps at the hook shot, the post player can pump fake the hook and step through for the unguarded layup (similar to the up and under move).<ref>{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=SLAM 147: Hall of Famer and low-post wizard Hakeem Olajuwon is happy to share his knowledge with today\u2019s stars.|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2011/03/masterpiece-theater/|publisher=SLAM Online|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube | id= SxDopaqTxiY&noredirect=1 | title= Hakeem Olajuwon Dream Shake }}</ref>\n\n== Shooting ==\n\n=== Pull up jumper ===\n\nA pull-up jumper is an offensive move, where the ball handler in the act of dribbling, 'pulls up' to shoot the basketball. This is especially effective as the defender is not able to react in time to affect or block the shot. This move is widely used by many players in the NBA, including notable stars such as [[Jerry West]], [[DeMar DeRozan]], [[Russell Westbrook]], [[Stephen Curry]], [[Kevin Durant]], and [[LeBron James]].\n\n=== Turnaround jump shot ===\nWhen a player posts up, in order to shoot he has to turn around to face the basket. This can be done by turning in the air, timing the jump shot when the defender is not likely to jump and challenge the shot. Though a fade-away version of this move was perfected by [[Larry Bird]] and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], players such as [[Michael Jordan]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[Kevin Garnett]] are also well known for it.\n\n=== Fadeaway ===\n{{main|Fadeaway}}\n\nA [[fadeaway]] shot is a variation on a set jump shot in which the shooter attempts his shot leaning backward, creating the effect of \"fading away\" from his defender. This makes it more difficult for the defender to contest the shot. The fadeaway usually has less range than a regular jump shot, because the ball has backwards momentum due to its [[inertia]], making it somewhat tougher to project the ball over long distances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tqiwPBwHQ|title=PERFECT Your Fadeaway Jumper FAST! How To Shoot A Basketball - Shooting Techniques|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> [[Michael Jordan]], [[LeBron James]], [[Reggie Miller]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Karl Malone]], [[Steve Nash]], and [[DeMar DeRozan]] are famous for their use of the fadeaway. [[Wilt Chamberlain]] was criticized for his frequent use of the fadeaway jumper, since the follow-through usually carries the shooter away from the basket and out of rebounding position.\n\n=== Step-back jump shot ===\n\nThe shooter takes a quick jab step away from the basket and takes a normal jump shot. [[Stephen Curry]], [[James Harden]] and [[Luka Doncic]] are famous for their step-back jumper. The move creates space for the shot, while providing more balance than the fadeaway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5RDpCAY6yo|title=Get EASY Shots ANY TIME You Want! Basketball Step Back Move Tutorial!|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n== Passes ==\n{{see also|Assist (basketball)}}\n\n=== Bounce pass ===\n\nThe bounce pass is a fundamental and very effective passing technique. This pass consists of one player passing the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. Because the ball will be at ground level as it passes a defender, a successful bounce pass can easily result in a scoring assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to steal. Still, a bounce pass may be stolen due to its slower speed. So, a player must use his best judgment when he decides whether to make such a pass.\n\n=== Chest pass ===\n\nThis pass is performed best by stepping towards your target with one foot, then throwing the ball out towards their chest with two hands while turning the hands over, ending with the thumbs pointing down. It is best used in an open court and on the perimeter.\n\n=== Over the head pass ===\n\nAn over the head pass is another fundamental passing technique. It is used by snapping the ball over the head, like a soccer throw-in. This pass is especially effective in helping to initiate a fast break. After a defensive rebound, a well-thrown overhead, or outlet, pass can allow a breaking offensive player to quickly score without even dribbling by catching the ball near the basket.\n\n=== Touch pass ===\n\nA touch pass is an advanced passing technique in which a prior pass or a loose ball is immediately redirected to another player by tipping or slapping the ball. This is the quickest pass in basketball and is therefore very effective when executed correctly.\n\n=== Baseball pass ===\n\nThe baseball pass is a long pass in which the passer throws the ball with one hand, as if it were a baseball or a football. It is infrequently used, mainly to set up last-second plays off a baseline inbounding situation.\n\n=== Jump pass ===\n\nA jump pass is a pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, usually when a teammate gets open during the shot, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing him to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. At times, however, it is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team. This kind of pass is risky to execute, and the chances of perfectly passing the ball to an open teammate are considerably low, as it leaves the offensive player very vulnerable to turnovers.\n\n=== Blind pass ===\n\nAlso known as a ''no-look pass'', the blind pass is performed when a player looks in one direction but passes the ball to his target in another direction. Blind passes are risky and infrequently attempted, but when done correctly, they can confuse the defense. The no-look pass has been popularized by players such as [[Magic Johnson]], [[Isiah Thomas]], [[Stephen Curry]], [[Pete Maravich]], [[Larry Bird]], [[Jason Kidd]], [[Rajon Rondo]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[John Stockton]], [[Ricky Rubio]], [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]], and [[Steve Nash]]. [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius]] also frequently used it during his glory years in the [[EuroLeague]].\n\n=== Behind-the-back ===\n\nBehind-the-back passes are passes dealt to a target behind the passer's back. Usually done to confuse the defender, behind the back passes can either be bounced off the floor or passed directly to a teammate's chest. However, most behind-the-back passes are direct. [[Earl Monroe]] was famous for this move. [[Steve Nash]] used this move often, and [[Chris Webber]] is famed for using this move down in the paint.\n\n== Two person game ==\n\n=== Give and go ===\n\n\"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\n\n=== Dribble pitch (handoff) ===\n\nThe dribble pitch or the handoff, is an offensive play, whereby the ball-handler passes to a player (often a bigger player) and runs by him to collect the ball, whilst the big sets a screen.\n\n=== Pick and roll ===\n{{Main|Pick and roll}}\n\n\"Pick and Roll\" is an offensive play in which a player stops to [[screen (basketball)|screen]] (block) a defender for the teammate handling the ball and then slips behind the defender to accept a pass as the handler makes a move towards the basket. In the NBA, [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]] were a quintessential pick and roll tandem and used this play to great effect in the 1990s. [[Steve Nash]] and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] proved to be extremely effective at the pick and roll throughout the 2000s. [[Kyrie Irving]] and [[LeBron James]] and [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Chris Paul]] were considered among the best contemporary pick and roll tandems.\n\nFrom the initial position of the pick and roll maneuver, the player who receives the ball has many different options as to whether he/she passes it, or fakes and then goes for a jump shot.\nThese variations typically include the pick and pop, where by the roll man instead of heading to the basket trails behind and is wide open for a jumper, hence the 'pop', as well as slipping the screen, whereby the defender of the screener attempts to cheat and get ahead of the screener, at which point the screener does not set a screen, but merely slips by, leaving him open as his defender trails behind.\n\n=== Backdoor ===\n\nA backdoor play is when a player without the ball gets behind the defense and receives a pass for an easy score. This can be executed if the defenders are unaware of the open space behind them. Also, when a defender strongly commits on defense (e.g. tries to steal or deny a pass), they are vulnerable to a backdoor play.\n\n=== Alley-oop ===\n{{main|Alley oop (basketball){{!}}Alley oop}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 125\n\n| image1    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (1).JPG\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n| image2    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (3).JPG\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n| image3    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (6).JPG\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  =\n\n| image4    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (7).JPG\n| width4    = \n| alt4      = \n| caption4  =\n\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Aaron Harrison]] [[assist (basketball)|assists]] on an [[Aaron Gordon]] [[Alley oop (basketball)|alley oop]] at the [[2013 McDonald's All-American Boys Game]]\n| footer_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\nAn alley-oop is an offensive play which involves one teammate lofting the ball up near the rim in anticipation of another teammate jumping up to catch and dunk it. Because this move requires both teammates to know what the other is thinking, the alley-oop is a rare and exciting play.  The alley-oop first dates back to the mid-1950s when [[K. C. Jones]] and [[Bill Russell]] teamed up to perform it while they were college teammates.<ref name=johnson>{{Cite book| last = Johnson | first = James W. | title = The Dandy Dons: Bill Russell, K. C.

Dribbling is necessary in order to take steps while possessing the ball. Once a player picks up their dribble (stops it by holding the ball), they may not dribble again until they pass, shoot, or otherwise lose possession of the ball and the ball touches a different player or the rim or backboard.\n\n=== Crossover ===\n{{main|Crossover dribble}}\n\nIn a Crossover, the ball handler changes the ball from one hand to the other using a single dribble. The is a fundamental dribbling technique in basketball used to keep the ball in the hand farthest from the defender (preventing a steal) while maintaining a desired speed and orientation on the court. It is very efficient when executing a drive. Make the crossover, get around your defender, and drive to the basket. A crossover functions best when the ball handler looks and acts like they are headed in one direction, before crossing over to the other direction.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JxoTzyvUO0s|title=How To Crossover So It ACTUALLY WORKS! Break Ankles In Basketball!|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> This can often be achieved by a simple head fake, or a step in that intended direction.<ref name=\"Gandolfi, Giorgio p. 29\">Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 29. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref> Some of the players famous for their crossover dribble include [[Tim Hardaway]], [[Allen Iverson]], [[Kyrie Irving]], [[Stephen Curry]], and [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\n=== Between the legs ===\n\nThis is a commonly used variation of the crossover in which the ball-handler bounces the ball off of the floor between his/her legs and catches it with the other hand on the opposite side of his/her body. It is used as a safer way to cross over while directly facing a defender, but requires more slowing of forward momentum than the crossover dribble.\n\n=== Behind the back ===\n\nThis advanced form of crossover involves the ball handler, bouncing the ball off of the floor behind his feet and catching it with the other hand, usually while his/her feet are no more than shoulder-width apart. If there are no defensive players around the ball handler except one directly facing him/her, and that defender does not expect this type of dribble, it can be an even safer way of crossing over compared to a between-the-legs. In all other cases, it is generally a dangerous move that can result in the ball bouncing off of the dribbler's feet or a steal.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 29-30. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref>\n\nThis dribble is especially useful for when the offensive player is really close to their defender and needs to change dribble hands, but doesn't have space to use a regular crossover.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eRPBG2LD4n4|title=Basketball Moves: NEXT LEVEL Behind the Back Crossover Secrets!|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Wraparound ===\n\nThe wraparound is similar to a behind-the-back except; instead of the ball being thrown in a sideways direction and bouncing behind the ballhandler's back, it is swung further around the back and thrown in a forward direction, bouncing on the side or in front of the ballhandler's body. This move is mostly used when a defender lunges toward one side of the ballhandler's body for a steal. The ballhandler would then simply throw the ball around his body and quickly pass his defender.\n\n=== In and out dribble ===\n\nAn in and out dribble is widely used as a counter move to a crossover, whereby the ball handler fakes the crossover, and pushes the ball back out on the same hand.<ref name=\"Gandolfi, Giorgio p. 29\"/>\n\n=== V dribble ===\nBall is dribbled with same hand in a V motion.  Almost looks like a double crossover but ball stays in  hand.\n\n=== Different heights dribble ===\n\nThis technique involves dribbling the ball in different heights. This is usually combined with other dribbling techniques to make it more effective. It is mostly effective on players smaller or taller than the dribbler but not quite as much on players that are the same height as the dribbler. If you are facing a shorter opponent, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball low and then suddenly turning the ball very high. If the opponent is taller than you, you can lure them by pretending to bring the ball high and quickly lowering the height of the dribble. If your opponent does not bite on your lure/trap, maintain the height of your dribble, and you can drive past them with more speed. If you're going to pass or shoot after your dribble, make sure that you will go back to your usual pace to maintain the momentum for your dribbling.\n\n=== Ankle breaker dribble ===\n\nThis is when an offensive player does a move that makes their defender stumble to the ground. Players' collapsing due to this rarely occurs under normal circumstances.  Typically this happens when a defender loses balance, trips over their own feet, or even slips.  An offensive player can't consistently control whether the defender falls, but using speed, body momentum, body contact and sharp changes of direction make it much more likely to happen.This move usually embarrasses the defender <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WvXsBJxH-aM|title=3 Basketball Moves To Break Ankles! How To: Best Crossover Moves|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n=== Hesitation move ===\nThe player makes a dash posture but does not actually apply force on the foot for one moment, and then dash full speed.\n\n== After the dribble ==\n\n=== Euro step ===\n{{main|Euro step}}\n\nThe Euro step (sometimes \"Eurostep\") is a move developed in European basketball in which a player, after picking up his dribble, takes a step in one direction, and then quickly takes a second step in the other direction before they attempt a layup. It is an attempt to evade at least one defender before attacking the basket.\n\n[[\u0160ar\u016bnas Mar\u010diulionis]], a Lithuanian, and [[Manu Gin\u00f3bili]], an Argentine who arrived in the NBA from the [[Lega Basket Serie A|Italian league]], are credited with bringing the move to the NBA. It has since been widely used by many US-born players, such as [[Dwyane Wade]], [[James Harden]], and [[Russell Westbrook]]\n\n=== Pro-Hop ===\n\nThe combination of a euro step and a jump-stop, the pro-hop is a move in which a player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a synchronized left hand dribble with left foot step. The player then rips the ball to the opposite side of their body while landing on a jump-stop. The pro hop's ability to split defenders, or throw an opposing defender off rhythm through 'change of direction speed' is a move popularized by Shantay Legans, former point guard for University of California at Berkeley.\n\n=== Pro-hop euro step ===\n\nThe Pro-hop Euro Step combines the pro-hop and Euro step while removing the pro-hop's jump stop. The player picks up their dribble with a synchronized right hand dribble/right foot step, or a left hand dribble with left foot step. Player then rips the ball to opposite side of their body (behind the back if skilled), takes two steps, and finishes with a reverse layup.\n\n=== Power up ===\n\nThe power up is a move in which the player lands on their outside foot then inside foot, and powers up toward the basket. An effective move because of its balance and power resulting from a two-foot gather and take off.\n\n=== Over-the-head ===\n\nThe over-the-head move is a move in which the player rotates the ball over their head in a circular fashion. This is done as the player is stepping to one side of the defender, while trying to get past him/her at the same time. It is essentially used as a way to prevent the ball from getting stolen. It is typically used when driving to the basket, and on fast breaks.\n\n== Shots ==\n\n=== Layups ===\n{{main|Layup}}\n\nA layup is a two-point attempt made by leaping from the ground, releasing the ball with one hand up near the basket, and using one hand to tip the ball over the rim and into the basket (lay-in) or banking it off the backboard and into the basket (lay-up). The motion and one-handed reach distinguish it from a jump shot. The layup is considered the most basic shot in basketball.\n\nAn undefended layup is usually a high-percentage shot. The main challenge is getting near the rim and avoiding blocks by taller defenders who usually stand near the basket. Common layup strategies are to create space, releasing the ball from different spots or using an alternate hand. A player tall enough (or with sufficient leaping ability) to reach over the rim might choose to perform a more spectacular and higher percentage slam dunk (dropping or throwing the ball through the basket from above the rim) instead.\n\nAs the game has evolved through the years, so has the layup. Several different versions of the layup are used today. Layups can be broadly categorized into two types: the underarm and the overarm. The underarm layup involves using most of the wrist and the fingers to 'lay' the ball into the basket or off the board. The underarm layup is more commonly known as the [[Basketball moves#Finger roll|finger roll]]. A notable current NBA player who uses the underarm finger roll is [[Dwyane Wade]].\n\nFinger-rolls today have many forms, including the Around the World which involves a complete circle around the player before the layup and a variety of faking in the approach to the rim. A classic example is a play by former Kings point guard Jason Williams during his time with Sacramento, in which Williams brings the ball behind his back with his right hand, in a fake of a back pass, and then brings it front again with the same hand for the finish (reminiscent of [[Bob Cousy]] who pioneered the move).\n\nThe other layup is the overhand shot, similar to a jump shot but from considerably closer range. Overhand layups almost always involved the use of the backboard. Players like Scottie Pippen  and Karl Malone have used this move to great effect.\n\nIn addition, another variation of the lay-up is the wrong-foot layup. Typically, this move can be seen by inexperienced players with poor footwork, however, when done intentionally, a wrong-footed layup can deceive a defender into mistiming his block attempt. In a normal layup, the left foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand, and vice versa. However, in a wrong-footed layup, the right foot is used to step off when laying in with the right hand. This also helps to shield the defender from reaching across to block the shot; in reaching across however, the defender will likely get called for a defensive foul. [[Tony Parker]] of the San Antonio Spurs relies heavily on the wrong footed layup, largely due to his smaller size and deceptive quickness.\n\n==== Reverse layup ====\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 125\n\n| image1    = 20130403 MCDAAG Isaiah Hicks does a reverse layup (1).JPG\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n| image2    = 20130403 MCDAAG Isaiah Hicks does a reverse layup (2).JPG\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n| image3    = 20130403 MCDAAG Isaiah Hicks does a reverse layup (3).JPG\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  =\n\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Isaiah Hicks]] does a reverse layup at the [[2013 McDonald's All-American Boys Game]]\n| footer_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\nA reverse layup is a layup that is finished on the opposite side of the court's split-line, than the player began the attack on.\n\n==== Finger roll ====\n{{main|Finger roll}}\n\nA finger roll is performed when a player shoots the ball with one hand during a layup and then lifts his fingers, rolling the ball into the basket. The rotation produced provides the ball with a soft touch, and the ball will roll around the rim and then drop into the basket.  Guard [[George Gervin|George \"The Iceman\" Gervin]] was known for having one of the best finger rolls in the game along center [[Wilt Chamberlain]]. [[Michael Jordan]] and [[Scottie Pippen]] are other notable practitioners, while former NBA star [[Jason Kidd]] is renowned for his smooth finger rolls as well.\n\n==== Tear drop ====\n\nThe tear drop, also called a '''runner''' or a '''floater''', is usually performed by undersized players (mainly [[point guard]]s).  A player usually starts the layup procedure a good distance away from the basket. The ball is generally released earlier and in a higher arc than the normal layup. The ball should be away before the taller defender has the chance to block it. The purpose of this shooting move is to make the defender miss blocking the ball as the ball is released from the hand one moment sooner than expected. It is so-named because the ball drops down from the high point of the arc like a falling tear drop. [[Gary Payton]] and [[John Stockton]] during their primes, the former in the mid-to-late 90s and the latter in the early-to-mid 90s were considered to have the best tear drops in the game. [[Chris Paul]], [[Tony Parker]], and [[Stephen Curry (basketball)|Stephen Curry]] frequently use the tear drop with great success.<ref>{{cite news |last=Cacciola |first=Scott |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/sports/basketball/with-teardrop-shots-nbas-little-guys-gain-upper-hand.html?pagewanted=all |title=With Hop and Flick, Little Guys Get Upper Hand |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 8, 2013 |accessdate=December 18, 2014}}</ref> [[Antawn Jamison]] had one of the most highly effective tear drop shots in the league despite being a power forward. [[Ben Gordon (basketball)|Ben Gordon]], [[Juan Carlos Navarro (basketball)|Juan Carlos Navarro]], [[Steve Nash]], [[Rajon Rondo]], [[Jose Barea|J.J. Barea]], and [[Derrick Rose]] are currently known for the tear drop move.\n\n==== Power layup ====\n\nPower layup, also called '''jump stop layup''', is a continuous shooting move in which a player stops dribbling and makes a huge leap forward(jump stop), while securing the ball in both hands from the dribbling hand, then making a layup. The move is generally used as a layup because the huge movement coming from the leap provides the momentum for the player to jump forward for a layup.  The move is a great way to squeeze the player under the basket for a fast layup.\n\n==== Double clutch ====\n\nA double clutch is a move associated with a layup or a dunk; it is a change of ball position in mid-air (similar to the \"up and under\" move, but performed while the player is in the air). It is effectively used by many players.\n\n=== Bank shot ===\n\nA ''bank shot'' in [[basketball]] is a shot that relies on the ball bouncing off the backboard and into the basket. It is frequently used for mid-range [[jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]]s from around a 45\u00b0 angle and [[layup]]s. It is not commonly used for long-range shots or shots from the middle or near the baseline. The purpose of using the backboard is to try to hit the backboard at an angle, thus slowing the speed of the ball and increasing its chances of falling into the hoop. Researchers at [[North Carolina State University]] found that bank shots may be 20 percent more effective up to a distance of about 12 feet than direct shots.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kulikowski|first=Mick|title=The physics of bank shots|url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/ncsu-tpo031011.php|accessdate=March 12, 2011|date=March 10, 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110328065720/http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/ncsu-tpo031011.php| archivedate= March 28, 2011 | url-status= live}}</ref>  Another term for a bank shot is \"off the glass.\" [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] players known for using the bank shot often are [[Sam Jones (basketball)|Sam Jones]], [[George Gervin]], [[Tim Duncan]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Scottie Pippen]], and [[Kobe Bryant]].\n\n=== Putback and tip-in ===\n\nA putback describes a situation where a player secures an offensive rebound, then immediately scores a basket.  If the player secures the rebound while in the air, for the shot to be considered a putback, the player can land on the ground before shooting, but cannot dribble before taking the shot.  If the player does not secure the rebound but instead taps the ball into the basket, it is considered a tip-in.  There is a point where the difference between a putback and a tip-in is subjective (e.g., a one-handed rebound in the air followed by a shot before touching the ground). A putback jam is a spectacular alternative to the tip-in, where the ball is slam-dunked off the rebound in the same motion.  [[Bill Russell]] would use this move during his college days in the mid-1950s<ref name=johnson/><ref name=Paul/>  [[Josh Smith]] and [[Kenyon Martin]] are more recent users of the putback jam. It is also a primary source of scoring for All-Star center [[Dwight Howard]], who led the NBA in dunks in the 2008\u20132009, 2009\u20132010 and 2010\u20132011 seasons.\n\n== Triple threat position and related moves ==\n\n''Triple threat'' is the position when a player facing a defender receives a pass but has not dribbled yet.  The offensive player's feet are slightly wider than shoulder width and slightly on the balls of their feet, their knees flexed, with both hands on the basketball in front of them or almost resting on their thigh, presenting the defender with an opponent able to move in any direction.  One foot is held as the pivot and the other slightly ahead. From this, the player can choose from three options: to [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump-shoot]], to [[dribble]] (drive) past the defender or to [[Basketball passes|pass]] it to a teammate. There are also options to get the defender out of their defensive stance by using '''jab steps''' and '''pump fakes'''.\n\n=== Pivot ===\n\nPivoting is the act of rotating one's body while keeping the ball of one foot in place on the floor. Most of the player's balance should be on the pivot foot while slightly raising the heel in order to pivot on the ball of the foot. Pivoting can be done with or without the ball as it is an important tool to quickly change direction or orientation to the basket.<ref>Krause, Jerry V., Jerry Meyer, and Don Meyer. ''Basketball Skills & Drills: Third Edition'', p. 9. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736067072}}.</ref>\n\n=== Jab step ===\n\nA jab step, also known as ''side step,'' is performed when a player holds onto the ball before dribbling while his non-pivot leg performs a jabbing forward or side motion.  This move is used to test defender's defensive weaknesses and stance.  A combination of the pump fake, the drive, the shot and the crossover drive can be performed along with the jab step to lure the opponent out of his defense. Forward [[Carmelo Anthony]] is well known for taking the jab step, as was 13-year pro [[Kiki Vandeweghe]]. When the player does this, the defender falls off from their defensive stance, creating a space between the player and the defender, allowing them to take a quick mid-range jumper, a three-pointer, or a drive \"to the lane.\"\n\n=== Pump fake ===\n\nA pump fake (also called a shot fake) is a feigned attempt at a jump shot, restrained before the feet leave the ground.  The pump fake is a fundamental move in basketball, used to cause defenders to jump (known in basketball slang as \"lifting\" the defender) or be shifted off-balance. Its main applications are in the low post area, where a player is much more likely to have his or her shot blocked.  On the perimeter, it is useful in creating open lanes to the basket by \"showing\" the ball enough to entice a defender to attempt to block or steal it, allowing the dribbler to penetrate easily. Michael Jordan, Kawhi Leonard, Kobe Bryant, and Dwyane Wade are known masters of the pump fake, with Leonard and Jordan being known to frequently use the one hand pump fake variation.\n\n=== Drawing contact ===\n\nAn offensive move intended to produce a foul call on the defensive player. A typical strategy is to drive into a defensive player whose feet are not stationary.  When the two players make bodily contact, a blocking foul can be called on the defensive player.  If the defensive player has a set position (i.e., both feet are stationary and arms are not in a downward motion), the contact can result in a charging foul against the offensive player (this is known as ''taking the charge'' for the fouled defensive player). Another way of drawing contact is to pump fake and then jump towards the defender, make contact and then shoot; this gets you to the foul line. If you make the basket (often made in the paint), you get the basket and one foul shot. Players like [[DeMar DeRozan]], [[James Harden]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Damian Lillard]], and [[Dwyane Wade]] have mastered the art of drawing contact.\n\n=== Shuffle ===\n\nThis move is similar to the jab step, but smaller. It is when a player uses multiple very little jab steps to throw off a defender and keep him constantly guessing whether you will go to the basket or not. It was used frequently by former [[San Antonio Spurs]] forward [[Tim Duncan]].\n\n== Posting up ==\n\nTo \"post up\" is to establish a position in the low post, the area near the basket below the foul line, usually in order to take advantage of a smaller defender. The offensive player usually faces away from the basket, so that his body can protect the ball from the defender. From this position, options such as spinning or backing down the defender to close in to the basket for better scoring opportunities become available.\n\n=== Up and under ===\n\n[[Image:RichardMasonRocca.JPG|thumb|right|[[Mason Rocca]] making a hook shot for [[Eldo Napoli]], 2006]]\n\nThe up and under is a move consisting of two parts: a shot fake (the up) and a step-through (the under). First the player with the ball fakes a shot by thrusting the ball above his head as if to take a shot, then when the defender jumps in an attempt to block the shot, the offensive player steps by him and attempts a clear, unguarded shot.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio.

A hook shot begins when the player puts his body between the ball and the opponent. He then releases the ball towards the basket with his outside hand in a \"hook\" motion. The hook shot and variations such as the jump-hook and skyhook are effective because they are very difficult for the defender to block, although it is harder to hit the shot with precision. The advantage the hook shot offers is the space it creates between the offensive player and his defender. This extra space can reduce or eliminate the advantages enjoyed by a taller defender. The hook shot is most often used by post players because it is difficult to make the shot from a distance.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio.

Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref> [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar]] became the NBA's all-time leading scorer by using his almost indefensible skyhook.\n\n=== Drop step ===\n\nAlso called a ''reverse pivot'', the drop step is a move in which the player posting up takes a back step on the side of a defender behind him and spins to that side to gain leverage.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 42-44. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref>\n\n=== Power move ===\n\nThe power move is executed by pivoting towards the basket to seal the defender, then using a two handed power dribble followed by a jump stop to get closer to the basket. Immediately after the jump stop the player jumps up for a power shot or jump hook.<ref>Krause, Jerry V., Jerry Meyer, and Don Meyer. ''Basketball Skills & Drills: Third Edition'', p. 140. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736067072}}.</ref>\n\n=== Spin and drive ===\n\nWhen the offensive player receives the ball in the low post, the player either fakes in one direction and then spins in the opposite direction, or immediately after catching the ball, the player spins around the defender and goes up for the shot or takes one hard dribble and then takes the shot.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio.

The post then pivots to face the basket while bringing the ball overhead (almost behind the head) to shoot a jump shot. The ball is released high over the head making it difficult for the defense to block.<ref>Gandolfi, Giorgio. ''NBA Coaches Playbook: Techniques, Tactics, and Teaching Points.'', p. 48. Human Kinetics, Champaign, IL. {{ISBN|9780736063555}}.</ref><ref>{{YouTube | id= O1KEWqgZmeE | title= Sikma Move }}</ref>\n\n=== Dream shake ===\n\nNamed after [[Hakeem Olajuwon|Hakeem \"The Dream\" Olajuwon]], this move is executed when a post player dribbles alongside the baseline and with one hand under the ball fakes a layup, then pivots to the outside for a jump hook. If the defender recovers and jumps at the hook shot, the post player can pump fake the hook and step through for the unguarded layup (similar to the up and under move).<ref>{{cite web|last=Bobb|first=Maurice|title=SLAM 147: Hall of Famer and low-post wizard Hakeem Olajuwon is happy to share his knowledge with today\u2019s stars.|url=http://www.slamonline.com/online/the-magazine/features/2011/03/masterpiece-theater/|publisher=SLAM Online|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{YouTube | id= SxDopaqTxiY&noredirect=1 | title= Hakeem Olajuwon Dream Shake }}</ref>\n\n== Shooting ==\n\n=== Pull up jumper ===\n\nA pull-up jumper is an offensive move, where the ball handler in the act of dribbling, 'pulls up' to shoot the basketball. This is especially effective as the defender is not able to react in time to affect or block the shot. This move is widely used by many players in the NBA, including notable stars such as [[Jerry West]], [[DeMar DeRozan]], [[Russell Westbrook]], [[Stephen Curry]], [[Kevin Durant]], and [[LeBron James]].\n\n=== Turnaround jump shot ===\nWhen a player posts up, in order to shoot he has to turn around to face the basket. This can be done by turning in the air, timing the jump shot when the defender is not likely to jump and challenge the shot. Though a fade-away version of this move was perfected by [[Larry Bird]] and [[Dirk Nowitzki]], players such as [[Michael Jordan]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Hakeem Olajuwon]], and [[Kevin Garnett]] are also well known for it.\n\n=== Fadeaway ===\n{{main|Fadeaway}}\n\nA [[fadeaway]] shot is a variation on a set jump shot in which the shooter attempts his shot leaning backward, creating the effect of \"fading away\" from his defender. This makes it more difficult for the defender to contest the shot. The fadeaway usually has less range than a regular jump shot, because the ball has backwards momentum due to its [[inertia]], making it somewhat tougher to project the ball over long distances.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z5tqiwPBwHQ|title=PERFECT Your Fadeaway Jumper FAST! How To Shoot A Basketball - Shooting Techniques|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref> [[Michael Jordan]], [[LeBron James]], [[Reggie Miller]], [[Kobe Bryant]], [[Dwyane Wade]], [[Dirk Nowitzki]], [[Karl Malone]], [[Steve Nash]], and [[DeMar DeRozan]] are famous for their use of the fadeaway. [[Wilt Chamberlain]] was criticized for his frequent use of the fadeaway jumper, since the follow-through usually carries the shooter away from the basket and out of rebounding position.\n\n=== Step-back jump shot ===\n\nThe shooter takes a quick jab step away from the basket and takes a normal jump shot. [[Stephen Curry]], [[James Harden]] and [[Luka Doncic]] are famous for their step-back jumper. The move creates space for the shot, while providing more balance than the fadeaway.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5RDpCAY6yo|title=Get EASY Shots ANY TIME You Want! Basketball Step Back Move Tutorial!|via=www.youtube.com}}</ref>\n\n== Passes ==\n{{see also|Assist (basketball)}}\n\n=== Bounce pass ===\n\nThe bounce pass is a fundamental and very effective passing technique. This pass consists of one player passing the ball to a teammate by bouncing the ball off the floor. Because the ball will be at ground level as it passes a defender, a successful bounce pass can easily result in a scoring assist because a bounce pass is harder for defenders to steal. Still, a bounce pass may be stolen due to its slower speed. So, a player must use his best judgment when he decides whether to make such a pass.\n\n=== Chest pass ===\n\nThis pass is performed best by stepping towards your target with one foot, then throwing the ball out towards their chest with two hands while turning the hands over, ending with the thumbs pointing down. It is best used in an open court and on the perimeter.\n\n=== Over the head pass ===\n\nAn over the head pass is another fundamental passing technique. It is used by snapping the ball over the head, like a soccer throw-in. This pass is especially effective in helping to initiate a fast break. After a defensive rebound, a well-thrown overhead, or outlet, pass can allow a breaking offensive player to quickly score without even dribbling by catching the ball near the basket.\n\n=== Touch pass ===\n\nA touch pass is an advanced passing technique in which a prior pass or a loose ball is immediately redirected to another player by tipping or slapping the ball. This is the quickest pass in basketball and is therefore very effective when executed correctly.\n\n=== Baseball pass ===\n\nThe baseball pass is a long pass in which the passer throws the ball with one hand, as if it were a baseball or a football. It is infrequently used, mainly to set up last-second plays off a baseline inbounding situation.\n\n=== Jump pass ===\n\nA jump pass is a pass performed while the passing player's feet are off the floor. When done intentionally, usually when a teammate gets open during the shot, it can sometimes confuse the defender, causing him to believe that the passer is shooting instead of passing. At times, however, it is done as a result of the player having their shooting lane blocked and often leads to the player turning the ball over to the opposing team. This kind of pass is risky to execute, and the chances of perfectly passing the ball to an open teammate are considerably low, as it leaves the offensive player very vulnerable to turnovers.\n\n=== Blind pass ===\n\nAlso known as a ''no-look pass'', the blind pass is performed when a player looks in one direction but passes the ball to his target in another direction. Blind passes are risky and infrequently attempted, but when done correctly, they can confuse the defense. The no-look pass has been popularized by players such as [[Magic Johnson]], [[Isiah Thomas]], [[Stephen Curry]], [[Pete Maravich]], [[Larry Bird]], [[Jason Kidd]], [[Rajon Rondo]], [[Michael Jordan]], [[John Stockton]], [[Ricky Rubio]], [[Jason Williams (basketball, born 1975)|Jason Williams]], and [[Steve Nash]]. [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Jasikevi\u010dius]] also frequently used it during his glory years in the [[EuroLeague]].\n\n=== Behind-the-back ===\n\nBehind-the-back passes are passes dealt to a target behind the passer's back. Usually done to confuse the defender, behind the back passes can either be bounced off the floor or passed directly to a teammate's chest. However, most behind-the-back passes are direct. [[Earl Monroe]] was famous for this move. [[Steve Nash]] used this move often, and [[Chris Webber]] is famed for using this move down in the paint.\n\n== Two person game ==\n\n=== Give and go ===\n\n\"Give and Go\" is an offensive play that involves passing the ball (give) and then running (go) to an open spot to receive the ball back, usually near the basket, for an easy score. This play can be effective when the defender pays too much attention to the ball instead of the player who moves after passing the ball. This is also known as a \"One-Two\" in street ball.\n\n=== Dribble pitch (handoff) ===\n\nThe dribble pitch or the handoff, is an offensive play, whereby the ball-handler passes to a player (often a bigger player) and runs by him to collect the ball, whilst the big sets a screen.\n\n=== Pick and roll ===\n{{Main|Pick and roll}}\n\n\"Pick and Roll\" is an offensive play in which a player stops to [[screen (basketball)|screen]] (block) a defender for the teammate handling the ball and then slips behind the defender to accept a pass as the handler makes a move towards the basket. In the NBA, [[John Stockton]] and [[Karl Malone]] were a quintessential pick and roll tandem and used this play to great effect in the 1990s. [[Steve Nash]] and [[Amar'e Stoudemire]] proved to be extremely effective at the pick and roll throughout the 2000s. [[Kyrie Irving]] and [[LeBron James]] and [[Blake Griffin]] and [[Chris Paul]] were considered among the best contemporary pick and roll tandems.\n\nFrom the initial position of the pick and roll maneuver, the player who receives the ball has many different options as to whether he/she passes it, or fakes and then goes for a jump shot.\nThese variations typically include the pick and pop, where by the roll man instead of heading to the basket trails behind and is wide open for a jumper, hence the 'pop', as well as slipping the screen, whereby the defender of the screener attempts to cheat and get ahead of the screener, at which point the screener does not set a screen, but merely slips by, leaving him open as his defender trails behind.\n\n=== Backdoor ===\n\nA backdoor play is when a player without the ball gets behind the defense and receives a pass for an easy score. This can be executed if the defenders are unaware of the open space behind them. Also, when a defender strongly commits on defense (e.g. tries to steal or deny a pass), they are vulnerable to a backdoor play.\n\n=== Alley-oop ===\n{{main|Alley oop (basketball){{!}}Alley oop}}\n\n{{multiple image\n| align     = right\n| direction = horizontal\n| width     = 125\n\n| image1    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (1).JPG\n| width1    = \n| alt1      = \n| caption1  =\n\n| image2    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (3).JPG\n| width2    = \n| alt2      = \n| caption2  =\n\n| image3    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (6).JPG\n| width3    = \n| alt3      = \n| caption3  =\n\n| image4    = 20130403 MCDAAG Aaron Gordon alley oop from Aaron Harrison (7).JPG\n| width4    = \n| alt4      = \n| caption4  =\n\n| header            = \n| header_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| header_background = \n| footer            = [[Aaron Harrison]] [[assist (basketball)|assists]] on an [[Aaron Gordon]] [[Alley oop (basketball)|alley oop]] at the [[2013 McDonald's All-American Boys Game]]\n| footer_align      = <!-- left/right/center -->\n| footer_background = \n| background color  = \n}}\nAn alley-oop is an offensive play which involves one teammate lofting the ball up near the rim in anticipation of another teammate jumping up to catch and dunk it. Because this move requires both teammates to know what the other is thinking, the alley-oop is a rare and exciting play.  The alley-oop first dates back to the mid-1950s when [[K. C.
