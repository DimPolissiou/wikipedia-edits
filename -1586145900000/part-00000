{"title_page": "Lemma (morphology)", "text_new": "{{one source|date=March 2017}}\nIn [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and [[lexicography]], a '''lemma''' (plural ''lemmas'' or ''lemmata'') is the '''canonical form''', '''dictionary form''', or '''citation form''' of a set of [[word]]s ([[headword]]).{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} In [[English language|English]], for example, ''run'', ''runs'', ''ran'' and ''running'' are forms of the same lemma, with ''run'' as the lemma. ''Lexeme'', in this context, refers to the set of all the forms that have the same meaning, and ''lemma'' refers to the particular form that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme. In lexicography, this unit is usually also the ''citation form'' or [[headword]] by which it is indexed. Lemmas have special significance in highly [[inflection|inflected languages]] such as Arabic, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The process of determining the ''lemma'' for a given word is called [[lemmatisation]]. The lemma can be viewed as the chief of the [[principal parts]], although lemmatisation is at least partly arbitrary.\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe form of a word that is chosen to serve as the lemma is usually the least [[markedness|marked]] form, but there are several exceptions, such as, for several languages, the use of the infinitive for verbs.\n\nFor English, the citation form of a [[noun]] is the [[grammatical number|singular]]: e.g., ''mouse'' rather than ''mice''. For multi-word lexemes that contain [[possessive adjective]]s or [[reflexive pronoun]]s, the citation form uses a form of the [[indefinite pronoun]] ''one'': e.g., ''do one's best'', ''perjure oneself''. In European languages with [[grammatical gender]], the citation form of regular adjectives and nouns is usually the masculine singular. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} If the language additionally has [[grammatical case|cases]], the citation form is often the masculine singular nominative.\n\nFor many languages, the citation form of a [[verb]] is the [[infinitive]]: [[French language|French]] ''{{wiktfr|aller}}'', [[German language|German]] ''{{wiktde|gehen}}'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{wiktspa|ir}}''. For English this usually coincides with the uninflected, least marked form of the verb (that is, \"run\", not \"runs\" or \"running\"); the present tense is used for some [[defective verb]]s (''shall'', ''can'', and ''must'' have only the one form). For [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Modern Greek]], however, the first person singular [[present tense]] is traditionally used, although some modern dictionaries use the infinitive instead. (For [[Ancient Greek verbs#Contracted verbs|contracted verbs]] in Ancient Greek, an uncontracted first person singular present tense is used to reveal the contract vowel: {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9}} ''phil\u00e9\u014d'' for {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u1ff6}} ''phil\u014d'' \"I love\" [implying affection]; {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c9}} ''agap\u00e1\u014d'' for {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u1ff6}} ''agap\u014d'' \"I love\" [implying regard]). [[Finnish language|Finnish]] dictionaries list verbs not under the verb root but under the first infinitive, marked with ''-(t)a'', ''-(t)\u00e4''.\n\nFor [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the non-past (present and future) tense is used. For [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which has no infinitives, the third-person singular masculine of the past tense is the least-marked form, and is used for entries in modern dictionaries. In older dictionaries, which are still commonly used today, the [[triliteral]] of the word, either a verb or a noun, is used. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] often uses the third-person masculine perfect, e.g., \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 ''bara' '' create, \u05db\u05e4\u05e8 ''kaphar'' deny. [[Georgian language|Georgian]] uses the [[verbal noun]]. For [[Korean language|Korean]], ''-da'' is attached to the stem.\n\nIn [[Irish language|Irish]], words are highly inflected depending on their case (genitive, nominative, dative and vocative); they are also inflected on their place within a sentence because of [[Irish initial mutations|initial mutations]]. The noun ''cainteoir'', the lemma for the noun meaning \"speaker\", has a variety of forms: ''chainteoir'', ''gcainteoir'', ''cainteora'', ''chainteora'', ''cainteoir\u00ed'', ''chainteoir\u00ed'' and ''gcainteoir\u00ed''.\n\nSome phrases are cited in a sort of lemma, e.g., ''[[Carthago delenda est]]'' (literally, \"Carthage must be destroyed\") is a common way of citing [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], although what he said was nearer to ''censeo Carthaginem esse delendam'' (\"I hold Carthage to be in need of destruction\").\n\n== Lexicography ==\nIn a dictionary, the lemma \"go\" represents the [[Inflection|inflected]] forms \"go\", \"goes\", \"going\", \"went\", and \"gone\". The relationship between an inflected form and its lemma is usually denoted by an angle bracket, e.g., \"went\" < \"go\". The disadvantage of such simplifications is, of course, the inability to look up a declined or conjugated form of the word, although some dictionaries, like [[Webster's dictionary|Webster's]], will list \"went\". Multilingual dictionaries vary in how they deal with this issue: the [[Langenscheidt]] dictionary of German does not list ''ging'' (< ''gehen''); the Cassell does.\n\nLemmas or [[word stem]]s are used often in [[corpus linguistics]] for determining word frequency. In such usage the specific definition of \"lemma\" is flexible depending on the task it is being used for.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nA word may have different [[pronunciation]]s depending on its [[phonetic]] environment (neighbouring sounds) or its degree of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] within a sentence. An example of the latter is the [[weak and strong forms in English|weak and strong forms]] of certain English [[function word]]s such as ''some'' and ''but'' (pronounced {{IPA|/s\u028cm/}}, {{IPA|/b\u028ct/}} when stressed, but {{IPA|/s(\u0259)m/}}, {{IPA|/b\u0259t/}} when unstressed). Dictionaries usually give the pronunciation used when the word is pronounced alone (in its [[isolation form]]) and with stress, although they may also note commonly occurring weak forms of pronunciation.\n\n== Difference between stem and lemma ==\nThe [[Word stem|stem]] is the part of the word that never changes even when morphologically inflected; a lemma is the base form of the word.

''Lexeme'', in this context, refers to the set of all the forms that have the same meaning, and ''lemma'' refers to the particular form that is chosen by convention to represent the lexeme. In lexicography, this unit is usually also the ''citation form'' or [[headword]] by which it is indexed. Lemmas have special significance in highly [[inflection|inflected languages]] such as Arabic, [[Turkish language|Turkish]] and [[Russian language|Russian]]. The process of determining the ''lemma'' for a given word is called [[lemmatisation]]. The lemma can be viewed as the chief of the [[principal parts]], although lemmatisation is at least partly arbitrary.\n\n== Morphology ==\nThe form of a word that is chosen to serve as the lemma is usually the least [[markedness|marked]] form, but there are several exceptions, such as, for several languages, the use of the infinitive for verbs.\n\nFor English, the citation form of a [[noun]] is the [[grammatical number|singular]]: e.g., ''mouse'' rather than ''mice''. For multi-word lexemes that contain [[possessive adjective]]s or [[reflexive pronoun]]s, the citation form uses a form of the [[indefinite pronoun]] ''one'': e.g., ''do one's best'', ''perjure oneself''. In European languages with [[grammatical gender]], the citation form of regular adjectives and nouns is usually the masculine singular. {{Citation needed|date=March 2015}} If the language additionally has [[grammatical case|cases]], the citation form is often the masculine singular nominative.\n\nFor many languages, the citation form of a [[verb]] is the [[infinitive]]: [[French language|French]] ''{{wiktfr|aller}}'', [[German language|German]] ''{{wiktde|gehen}}'', [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''{{wiktspa|ir}}''. For English this usually coincides with the uninflected, least marked form of the verb (that is, \"run\", not \"runs\" or \"running\"); the present tense is used for some [[defective verb]]s (''shall'', ''can'', and ''must'' have only the one form). For [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Ancient Greek]], and [[Modern Greek]], however, the first person singular [[present tense]] is traditionally used, although some modern dictionaries use the infinitive instead. (For [[Ancient Greek verbs#Contracted verbs|contracted verbs]] in Ancient Greek, an uncontracted first person singular present tense is used to reveal the contract vowel: {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u03ad\u03c9}} ''phil\u00e9\u014d'' for {{lang|grc|\u03c6\u03b9\u03bb\u1ff6}} ''phil\u014d'' \"I love\" [implying affection]; {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u03ac\u03c9}} ''agap\u00e1\u014d'' for {{lang|grc|\u1f00\u03b3\u03b1\u03c0\u1ff6}} ''agap\u014d'' \"I love\" [implying regard]). [[Finnish language|Finnish]] dictionaries list verbs not under the verb root but under the first infinitive, marked with ''-(t)a'', ''-(t)\u00e4''.\n\nFor [[Japanese language|Japanese]], the non-past (present and future) tense is used. For [[Arabic language|Arabic]], which has no infinitives, the third-person singular masculine of the past tense is the least-marked form, and is used for entries in modern dictionaries. In older dictionaries, which are still commonly used today, the [[triliteral]] of the word, either a verb or a noun, is used. [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] often uses the third-person masculine perfect, e.g., \u05d1\u05e8\u05d0 ''bara' '' create, \u05db\u05e4\u05e8 ''kaphar'' deny. [[Georgian language|Georgian]] uses the [[verbal noun]]. For [[Korean language|Korean]], ''-da'' is attached to the stem.\n\nIn [[Irish language|Irish]], words are highly inflected depending on their case (genitive, nominative, dative and vocative); they are also inflected on their place within a sentence because of [[Irish initial mutations|initial mutations]]. The noun ''cainteoir'', the lemma for the noun meaning \"speaker\", has a variety of forms: ''chainteoir'', ''gcainteoir'', ''cainteora'', ''chainteora'', ''cainteoir\u00ed'', ''chainteoir\u00ed'' and ''gcainteoir\u00ed''.\n\nSome phrases are cited in a sort of lemma, e.g., ''[[Carthago delenda est]]'' (literally, \"Carthage must be destroyed\") is a common way of citing [[Cato the Elder|Cato]], although what he said was nearer to ''censeo Carthaginem esse delendam'' (\"I hold Carthage to be in need of destruction\").\n\n== Lexicography ==\nIn a dictionary, the lemma \"go\" represents the [[Inflection|inflected]] forms \"go\", \"goes\", \"going\", \"went\", and \"gone\". The relationship between an inflected form and its lemma is usually denoted by an angle bracket, e.g., \"went\" < \"go\". The disadvantage of such simplifications is, of course, the inability to look up a declined or conjugated form of the word, although some dictionaries, like [[Webster's dictionary|Webster's]], will list \"went\". Multilingual dictionaries vary in how they deal with this issue: the [[Langenscheidt]] dictionary of German does not list ''ging'' (< ''gehen''); the Cassell does.\n\nLemmas or [[word stem]]s are used often in [[corpus linguistics]] for determining word frequency. In such usage the specific definition of \"lemma\" is flexible depending on the task it is being used for.\n\n==Pronunciation==\nA word may have different [[pronunciation]]s depending on its [[phonetic]] environment (neighbouring sounds) or its degree of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]] within a sentence. An example of the latter is the [[weak and strong forms in English|weak and strong forms]] of certain English [[function word]]s such as ''some'' and ''but'' (pronounced {{IPA|/s\u028cm/}}, {{IPA|/b\u028ct/}} when stressed, but {{IPA|/s(\u0259)m/}}, {{IPA|/b\u0259t/}} when unstressed). Dictionaries usually give the pronunciation used when the word is pronounced alone (in its [[isolation form]]) and with stress, although they may also note commonly occurring weak forms of pronunciation.\n\n== Difference between stem and lemma ==\nThe [[Word stem|stem]] is the part of the word that never changes even when morphologically inflected; a lemma is the base form of the word. For example, from \"produced\", the lemma is \"produce\", but the stem is \"produc-\". This is because there are words such as '''produc'''tion. and '''produc'''ing<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nltk.org/ |title=Natural Language Toolkit \u2014 NLTK 3.0 documentation |publisher=Nltk.org |date=2015-09-05 |accessdate=2015-09-27}}</ref>{{failed verification|date=August 2015}} In linguistic analysis, the stem is defined more generally as the analyzed base form from which all inflected forms can be formed.

Though the name \"bison\" might be considered to be more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage the name \"buffalo\" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison.

However, \"[[bison]]\" is a Greek word meaning [[ox]]-like animal, while \"buffalo\" originated with the French fur trappers who called these massive beasts {{lang|fr|b\u0153ufs}}, meaning ox or bullock\u2014so both names, \"bison\" and \"buffalo\", have a similar meaning. Though the name \"bison\" might be considered to be more scientifically correct, as a result of standard usage the name \"buffalo\" is also considered correct and is listed in many dictionaries as an acceptable name for American buffalo or bison.  In reference to this animal, the term \"buffalo\" dates to 1635 in North American usage when the term was first recorded for the American mammal.  It thus has a much longer history than the term \"bison\", which was first recorded in 1774.<ref>The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition</ref> The American bison is very closely related to the wisent or [[European bison]].\n\n==Morphology==\n[[File:Buffalo in the Rain.JPG|thumb|left|Bull at [[North Carolina Zoo]]]]\nIn comparison to [[plains bison]] (the other surviving [[North America]]n subspecies/ecotype), the wood bison is larger and heavier, with large males reaching {{convert|3.35|m|ft|abbr=on}} in body length with {{convert|54|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tails and {{convert|201|cm|ft|abbr=on}} tall at [[withers]] and {{convert|1179|kg|lb|-2|abbr=on}} in weight, making it morphologically more similar to at least one of chronological subspecies of ancestral [[steppe bison]]s (''Bison priscus'' sp.)<ref>Gennady G.

The initiative identified areas in need of attention and produced concrete recommendations on how to go about improving them. The government subsequently prepared a comprehensive reform plan aimed at modernizing the educational sector over the 2000\u201310 period. In August 2000, it passed an official Education Planning Act and drafted a medium-term development plan for the next five years. The fundamental academic system was significantly restructured and made compulsory; it now consists of five years of primary school and four years of middle school.

It is considered the mark of poetic attainment when a young poet is able to compose such verse, and is regarded as the height of poetry. Groups of memorizers and reciters (''hafidayaal'') traditionally propagated the well-developed art form. Poems revolve around several main themes, including ''baroorodiiq'' (elegy), ''amaan'' (praise), ''jacayl'' (romance), ''guhaadin'' (diatribe), ''digasho'' (gloating) and ''guubaabo'' (guidance).

The country became a member of [[FIFA]] in 1994, but has only taken part in the qualifying rounds for the [[African Cup of Nations]] as well as the [[FIFA World Cup]] in the mid-2000s. In November 2007, the [[Djibouti national football team]] beat [[Somalia national football team|Somalia's national squad]] 1\u20130 in the qualification rounds for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]], marking its first ever World Cup-related win.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\nRecently, the [[World Archery Federation]] has helped to implement the Djibouti Archery Federation, and an international archery training center is being created in [[Arta, Djibouti|Arta]] to support archery development in East Africa and Red Sea area.{{citation needed|date=June 2019}}\n\n===Cuisine===\n{{Main|Djiboutian cuisine}}\n[[File:Sambusadish.jpg|thumb|right|200px|A plate of ''[[samosa|sambusas]]'' a popular traditional snack.]]\n\n[[Djiboutian cuisine]] is a mixture of [[Somali cuisine|Somali]], [[Afar people|Afar]], [[Yemeni cuisine|Yemeni]], and [[French cuisine]], with some additional [[South Asian cuisine|South Asian]] (especially [[Indian cuisine|Indian]]) culinary influences. Local dishes are commonly prepared using a lot of Middle Eastern spices, ranging from [[saffron]] to [[cinnamon]]. Grilled Yemeni fish, opened in half and often cooked in tandoori style ovens, are a local delicacy. Spicy dishes come in many variations, from the traditional ''Fah-fah'' or \"''Soupe Djiboutienne''\" (spicy boiled beef soup), to the ''yetakelt wet'' (spicy mixed vegetable stew). ''Xalwo'' (pronounced \"halwo\") or [[halva]] is a popular confection eaten during festive occasions, such as [[Eid ul-Fitr|Eid]] celebrations or wedding receptions. Halva is made from sugar, [[corn starch]], [[cardamom]] powder, [[nutmeg]] powder and [[ghee]]. Peanuts are sometimes added to enhance texture and flavor.<ref>Ali, Barlin (2007) ''Somali Cuisine''.

The initiative identified areas in need of attention and produced concrete recommendations on how to go about improving them. The government subsequently prepared a comprehensive reform plan aimed at modernizing the educational sector over the 2000\u201310 period. In August 2000, it passed an official Education Planning Act and drafted a medium-term development plan for the next five years. The fundamental academic system was significantly restructured and made compulsory; it now consists of five years of primary school and four years of middle school. Secondary schools also require a Certificate of Fundamental Education for admission. In addition, the new law introduced secondary-level vocational instruction and established university facilities in the country.<ref name=\"infodev.org\"/>\n\nAs a result of the Education Planning Act and the medium-term action strategy, substantial progress has been registered throughout the educational sector.<ref name=\"infodev.org\"/> In particular, school enrollment, attendance, and retention rates have all steadily increased, with some regional variation.

The gabay (epic poem) has the most complex length and meter, often exceeding 100 lines. It is considered the mark of poetic attainment when a young poet is able to compose such verse, and is regarded as the height of poetry. Groups of memorizers and reciters (''hafidayaal'') traditionally propagated the well-developed art form. Poems revolve around several main themes, including ''baroorodiiq'' (elegy), ''amaan'' (praise), ''jacayl'' (romance), ''guhaadin'' (diatribe), ''digasho'' (gloating) and ''guubaabo'' (guidance). The baroorodiiq is composed to commemorate the death of a prominent poet or figure.<ref name=Abdullahi75>Abdullahi, Mohamed Diriye (2001) ''Culture and Customs of Somalia'', Greenwood Press. pp. 75\u201376. {{ISBN|9780313313332}}</ref> The Afar are familiar with the ''ginnili'', a kind of warrior-poet and diviner, and have a rich oral tradition of folk stories.
