In the absence of the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]], the First Vice Prime Minister performs his or her duty{{efn|group=1|Article 17, paragraph 2, Law of Ukraine about Cabinet of Ministers}} as the acting Prime Minister of Ukraine. In 1991 the post was grandfathered from the already existing First Deputy Chairman that was part of the [[Council of Ministers of the Ukrainian SSR]].\n\nIn an absence of the First Vice Prime Minister, his or her functions are performed by other Vice Prime Ministers who are members of the [[Cabinet of Ukraine|Cabinet of Ministers]]. Similarly to Prime Minister, all office duties of the First Vice Prime Minister are supported by the Secretariat of Cabinet of Ministers. \n\nAlong with other members of Cabinet of Ministers, the newly appointed First Vice Prime Minister takes one and the same oath of office at a plenary session of the Verkhovna Rada ([[Ukrainian parliament]]). According to the Article 10 (Law of Ukraine about the Cabinet of Ministers), a member of Cabinet of Ministers (except for the [[Prime Minister of Ukraine]]) who refuses to take the oath is considered as such who refused to accept the post.

His older brother, David (died 2015), became a meteorologist.<ref> https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2566 </ref> The third and youngest brother, Paul Houghton, became a lecturer in engineering and was treasurer and company chairman of the John Ray Initiative, connecting the environment, science and Christianity.\n\nThe family moved to [[Rhyl]] when John was two, and he attended [[Rhyl High School|Rhyl Grammar School]] where he discovered his interest in science. He continued his education at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], gaining a BA in 1951, MA (Oxon) and DPhil in 1955.<ref name=WCC/><ref>http://www.japanprize.jp/en/prize_prof_2006_houghton.html</ref> He was brought up as an evangelical Christian by devout Christian parents and believed in science and Christianity as strengthening each other, as well as [[Christianity and environmentalism]]. Houghton's evangelical Christianity combined with his scientific background made him a significant voice in evangelical Christian circles. He was also an elder at [[Aberdyfi#presbyterian|Aberdovey Presbyterian Church.]] In 1962, Houghton married Dr Margaret Portman, daughter of a mill owner in Colwyn, Lancashire, and they had two children and seven grandchildren. Following her death from [[cancer]] in 1986, he set up the Margaret Houghton Memorial Fund, a research unit on medical nursing in her memory. His second wife, Sheila, became his companion for almost thirty years.\n\nPosts include:\n\n* a Member of the UK Government Panel on Sustainable Development (1994\u20132000)\n* Chairman, [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] (1992\u201398)\n* Chairman or Co-Chairman, Scientific Assessment Working Group, [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (1988\u20132002)\n* Director General (later Chief Executive), UK [[Meteorological Office]] (1983\u201391)\n* Director Appleton, [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (also Deputy Director, [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]])(1979\u201383);\n* Professor of Atmospheric Physics, Oxford University (1976\u201383).\n*Principal Investigator for Space Experiments on NASA Spacecraft.\n\nHe was knighted in 1991.

This has since been quoted by many [[global warming scepticism|sceptics]], including [[Benny Peiser]] and [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Christopher Monckton]], and is listed at the top of the front page of [[Christopher Booker]]'s ''[[The Real Global Warming Disaster]]''.  However, the quotation does not appear in any edition of Houghton's book. Houghton never said any such thing and believed the opposite.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 10 February 2010\n | title = Fabricated quote used to discredit climate scientist\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/fabricated-quote-used-to-discredit-climate-scientist-1894552.html\n | accessdate = 10 February 2010\n}}\n</ref>\nThe publishers of ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'', The Continuum International Publishing Group, apologised for the reference to that quotation, confirmed (in addition to Booker's confirmation) that it will not be repeated, and agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in ''The Sunday Telegraph'' on 20 February 2010, Christopher Booker purported to correct the misquotation contained in ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'' but this article contained yet further inaccuracies.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 20 February 2010\n | title = Article by Christopher Booker in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', \"What the weatherman never said\"\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/7280369/What-the-weatherman-never-said.html\n | accessdate = 10 February 2010\n| work=The Daily Telegraph\n}}\n</ref> As a result, Houghton referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC Reference 101959). Following the PCC's involvement, ''The Sunday Telegraph'' published on 15 August 2010 a letter of correction by Houghton stating his true position.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 15 August 2010\n | title = Letter by Sir John Houghton in The Sunday Telegraph, 15 August 2010\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/7944874/Trident-shouldnt-lead-to-more-defence-cuts.html\n | accessdate = 9 January 2010\n| work=The Sunday Telegraph\n}}\n</ref> An article supportive of Houghton also appeared in the edition of 21 May 2010 of ''New Scientist''.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = May 2010\n \n | title = \"Living in denial: Unleashing a lie\", Jim Giles, ''New Scientist'', 21 May 2010\n | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627606.300-living-in-denial-unleashing-a-lie.html\n | accessdate = 9 January 2010\n| work=New Scientist\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe correct quotation was, \"If we want a good environmental policy in the future we'll have to have a disaster.

His older brother, David (died 2015), became a meteorologist.<ref> https://rmets.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/wea.2566 </ref> The third and youngest brother, Paul Houghton, became a lecturer in engineering and was treasurer and company chairman of the John Ray Initiative, connecting the environment, science and Christianity.\n\nThe family moved to [[Rhyl]] when John was two, and he attended [[Rhyl High School|Rhyl Grammar School]] where he discovered his interest in science. He continued his education at [[Jesus College, Oxford]], gaining a BA in 1951, MA (Oxon) and DPhil in 1955.<ref name=wcc/><ref>http://www.japanprize.jp/en/prize_prof_2006_houghton.html</ref> He was brought up as an evangelical Christian by devout Christian parents and believed in science and Christianity as strengthening each other, as well as [[Christianity and environmentalism]]. Houghton's evangelical Christianity combined with his scientific background made him a significant voice in evangelical Christian circles. He was also an elder at [[Aberdyfi#presbyterian|Aberdovey Presbyterian Church.]] In 1962, Houghton married Dr Margaret Portman, daughter of a mill owner in Colwyn, Lancashire, and they had two children and seven grandchildren. Following her death from [[cancer]] in 1986, he set up the Margaret Houghton Memorial Fund, a research unit on medical nursing in her memory. His second wife, Sheila, became his companion for almost thirty years.\n\nPosts include:\n\n* a Member of the UK Government Panel on Sustainable Development (1994\u20132000)\n* Chairman, [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] (1992\u201398)\n* Chairman or Co-Chairman, Scientific Assessment Working Group, [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (1988\u20132002)\n* Director General (later Chief Executive), UK [[Meteorological Office]] (1983\u201391)\n* Director Appleton, [[Science and Engineering Research Council]] (also Deputy Director, [[Rutherford Appleton Laboratory]])(1979\u201383);\n* Professor of Atmospheric Physics, Oxford University (1976\u201383).\n*Principal Investigator for Space Experiments on NASA Spacecraft.\n\nHe was knighted in 1991.

This has since been quoted by many [[global warming scepticism|sceptics]], including [[Benny Peiser]] and [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley|Christopher Monckton]], and is listed at the top of the front page of [[Christopher Booker]]'s ''[[The Real Global Warming Disaster]]''.  However, the quotation does not appear in any edition of Houghton's book. Houghton never said any such thing and believed the opposite.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 10 February 2010\n | title = Fabricated quote used to discredit climate scientist\n | periodical = [[The Independent]]\n | url = https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/fabricated-quote-used-to-discredit-climate-scientist-1894552.html\n | accessdate = 10 February 2010\n}}\n</ref>\nThe publishers of ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'', The Continuum International Publishing Group, apologised for the reference to that quotation, confirmed (in addition to Booker's confirmation) that it will not be repeated, and agreed to place a corrigendum in any further copies of the book. In an article which appeared in ''The Sunday Telegraph'' on 20 February 2010, Christopher Booker purported to correct the misquotation contained in ''The Real Global Warming Disaster'' but this article contained yet further inaccuracies.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 20 February 2010\n | title = Article by Christopher Booker in ''The Sunday Telegraph'', \"What the weatherman never said\"\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/columnists/christopherbooker/7280369/What-the-weatherman-never-said.html\n | accessdate = 10 February 2010\n| work=The Daily Telegraph\n}}\n</ref> As a result, Houghton referred the matter to the Press Complaints Commission (PCC Reference 101959). Following the PCC's involvement, ''The Sunday Telegraph'' published on 15 August 2010 a letter of correction by Houghton stating his true position.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = 15 August 2010\n | title = Letter by Sir John Houghton in The Sunday Telegraph, 15 August 2010\n | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/letters/7944874/Trident-shouldnt-lead-to-more-defence-cuts.html\n | accessdate = 9 January 2010\n| work=The Sunday Telegraph\n}}\n</ref> An article supportive of Houghton also appeared in the edition of 21 May 2010 of ''New Scientist''.<ref>{{Citation\n | date = May 2010\n \n | title = \"Living in denial: Unleashing a lie\", Jim Giles, ''New Scientist'', 21 May 2010\n | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20627606.300-living-in-denial-unleashing-a-lie.html\n | accessdate = 9 January 2010\n| work=New Scientist\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe correct quotation was, \"If we want a good environmental policy in the future we'll have to have a disaster.
