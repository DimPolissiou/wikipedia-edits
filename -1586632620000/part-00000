The film is a sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Trolls (film)|Trolls]]'', directed by [[Walt Dohrn]] with co-direction by David P. Smith, produced by [[Gina Shay]], and written by [[Jonathan Aibel and Glenn Berger|Jonathan Aibel, Glenn Berger]], Elizabeth Tippet, [[Maya Forbes]] and [[Wallace Wolodarsky]], from a story by Aibel and Berger. The film stars [[Anna Kendrick]], [[Justin Timberlake]], [[James Corden]], [[Kunal Nayyar]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], and [[Rachel Bloom]].\n\n''Trolls World Tour'' was theatrically released in the United States on April 10, 2020. Due to the [[2020 coronavirus pandemic in the United States]], the film was also released for [[video on demand|digital rental]] on the same day.\n\n==Plot==\nThe film opens on a celebration of the Techno Trolls, which is crashed by the [[Rock music|Rock]] Trolls, led by Queen Barb. After Barb destroys his DJ station with her [[guitar]]'s power, King Trollex is forced to surrender the string that powers [[Techno]] music. \n\nPoppy, still becoming adjusted to her new leadership as queen, receives a message from Barb that invites all Trolls to a party to unite their music. Her father reveals that there are different kinds of Trolls scattered through their land, each represented by a different style of music that is powered by a magical string kept by the leader of each tribe. Having split into their different forms of music following discord and disagreement over which was the best, Poppy wants to help Barb unite the different forms of music, but both her father and Branch warn her not to trust Barb's intentions and to accept that the other Trolls are different. Poppy does not listen, and sends a cheerful reply to Barb via Debbie, Barb's pet bat.\n\nMeanwhile, Barb gloats over her victory of snatching the [[Techno]] string, revealing her plan to string an enchanted guitar with all six strings, and play a power chord strong enough to destroy all other music, replacing it with rock.\n\nWanting to prove herself as a good queen, Poppy travels via air balloon to recruit the other groups of Trolls, Branch joining her in an attempt to express his feelings towards her. Biggie accidentally stows aboard the balloon, and joins them. Meanwhile, Cooper, who feels like the black sheep among the Pop trolls, goes on a journey himself to find Trolls who look like him.\n\nThe balloon ends up in the land of [[Classical]] Trolls, which, to Poppy's horror, has been decimated by Barb's armada, who captured all the citizens. A single small [[flute]] named Pennywhistle tells Poppy the truth about what happened, and Poppy decides to now unite the other Trolls to stop Barb. Branch and Biggie both urge her to return home to protect the Pop string, but Poppy reveals it hidden in her hair. They then travel to the [[Country]] Trolls' land, but after introducing themselves with a loud medley of pop songs, are jailed by an offended Delta Dawn. A Country Troll named Hickory, who claims he is moved by Poppy's motives, breaks them out, leading to a chase to a ravine, where the group falls into a river. Branch does not trust Hickory, even when the Troll builds a raft to take the group downstream.  The conversation is interrupted by Chaz, a [[Smooth Jazz]] Troll who was hired as a bounty hunter to catch Poppy for Barb, who was incredibly offended by Poppy's reply letter. Hickory incapacitates Chaz, but Biggie, disillusioned by Poppy's poor leadership, decides to return home. Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music.  Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls [[hijack]] the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to  stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

Shortly after, the group is abducted by a space ship wielding magical soap bubbles.\n\nInside the spaceship, the group meets the [[Funk]] Trolls, and meets up with Cooper, who is revealed to have been a long lost identical twin prince of Funk all along. Cooper tells Poppy he finds comfort in identifying with both [[Pop]] and [[Funk]], and his parents, King Quincy and Queen Essence, reveal to Poppy that long ago the original [[Pop]] Trolls had attempted to steal the strings and remix the other five music styles into Pop, forcing the other Trolls to each take one string and divide their tribes to save their music.  Quincy explains to Poppy that differences are not bad, and trying to make all Trolls the same does not help the problem.\n\nAfter the Rock Trolls [[hijack]] the Funk Trolls' ship, Cooper ejects the group in bubbles, accidentally separating Hickory from the two. Branch and Poppy fight when Poppy refuses to return home to their friends, and Branch admonishes her insisting she cannot be a good queen if she is a poor listener, and the two go their separate ways, heartbroken. Branch is soon captured by both [[K-Pop]] and [[Reggaeton]] bounty hunters. However, he eventually convinces them to so stop capturing and fighting and save Poppy and all music.\n\nPoppy reunites with Hickory, showing him the Pop string. Hickory tries to urge her to return home, but suddenly is revealed to have been a [[Yodel]] Troll all along. He and another Yodel Troll, Dickory, had been hired to capture her for Barb, but Hickory had a change of heart. Before she can escape, Poppy is then captured personally by Barb, who takes possession of the sixth and final string. \n\nBiggie returns home and seeing it in shambles, feels remorse over abandoning Poppy. He gathers together their remaining friends to go rescue her and Branch, entering the land of the Rock Trolls.\n\nBarb has Poppy imprisoned over a large concert stage where all the captured Trolls are the audience, and admits she empathizes with Poppy's attempts to be a good queen, as she is trying to make rock supreme to prove her own leadership. Barb uses her enchanted guitar during the concert to turn Branch, and the leaders of the other lands into rock zombies. Poppy seemingly is transformed into a rock zombie when she falls onto the stage, but upon grabbing Barb's guitar, it is revealed to have been wearing gumdrop earplugs. She admonishes Barb for being a poor queen by not taking time to listen to her people, and smashes the guitar. While it snaps the possessed trolls out of their rock zombie state, it destroys the strings, ending [[music]], and causing all the trolls to lose their colors, much to Barb\u2019s anguish.\n\nCooper hears his heartbeat over a microphone, and creates a rhythmic beat with it, other trolls joining in with clapping, stomping, and other forms of soundmaking, reviving the power of their music, and Poppy encourages everyone to [[sing]] together as their colors are restored. Realizing how important other forms of [[music]] are, and encouraged by her father, Barb joins in, regaining her colors, and eagerly accepts Poppy's offer of friendship. \n\nBranch is finally able to profess his love to Poppy who reciprocates his feelings, and everyone performs together, all Trolls finally reunited while celebrating their differences.\n\nIn a mid-credits scene, Bridget and King Gristle arrive to the Pop Troll village, unaware of the events of the film, and worried they have missed the party.\n\n==Cast==\n{{castlist|\n* [[Anna Kendrick]] as Queen Poppy, the optimistic Queen of the pop Trolls and Branch's love interest.\n* [[Justin Timberlake]] as Branch, an over-cautious, good-hearted survivalist pop Troll and Poppy's love interest.\n* [[James Corden]] as Biggie, a chubby, friendly pop Troll.\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Queen Barb, the Queen of the Hard Rock Trolls and Thrash's daughter.\n* [[Ozzy Osbourne]] as King Thrash, former King of the Hard Rock Trolls and Barb's father.\n* [[Anderson Paak]] as Prince D, a Funk Troll and Quincy and Essence's son and Cooper\u2019s twin brother.\n* [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]] as King Quincy, the King of the Funk Trolls.\n* [[Mary J.

''Laws of New York.''1836, 59th Session, Chapter 077, Section 1, Page 102.'''</ref>\n\nIn 1854, Chemung County was divided and {{convert|110|sqmi|km2}} became [[Schuyler County, New York|Schuyler County]], reducing Chemung to {{convert|410|sqmi|km2}}, its current size.<ref name=\"NYLAWS CHEMUNG 02\">'''New York. ''Laws of New York.''1854, 77th Session, Chapter 386, Sections 1\u20144 & 6, Pages 913\u2014915.'''</ref>\n\nIn the late 1870s, the [[Greenback Party]] became prominent in Chemung and nearby counties in western New York. Here it was primarily allied with labor in a critique of capital, reaching its peak in 1878, the year following the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] and the [[Scranton General Strike]] in Pennsylvania. There were also strikes that year in Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo, starting with the railroad workers. In Steuben and Chemung counties, Greenbackers were elected to county councils in 1878 instead of Democrats, and others were elected from there and nearby counties to the state legislature, gaining votes of more than 25 percent in several of the Southern Tier counties.

Here it was primarily allied with labor in a critique of capital, reaching its peak in 1878, the year following the [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] and the [[Scranton General Strike]] in Pennsylvania. There were also strikes that year in Albany, Syracuse and Buffalo, starting with the railroad workers. In Steuben and Chemung counties, Greenbackers were elected to county councils in 1878 instead of Democrats, and others were elected from there and nearby counties to the state legislature, gaining votes of more than 25 percent in several of the Southern Tier counties. It gradually declined after that, due to internal dissension and the strength of the two major parties.<ref name=\"klein\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=FSn8HvlYsgUC&pg=PA455&lpg=PA455&dq=Chemung+Greenbacker+Party&source=bl&ots=eoFceaePsy&sig=2N5ONsqDagIAUcFrkNzM-ezLMBo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjIoNmbkezMAhUUSlIKHR_qAskQ6AEIJTAB#v=onepage&q=Chemung%20Greenbacker%20Party&f=false Milton M.

In the forty years through 1994, over 800 private claims were brought against tobacco companies in state courts across the country.<ref name=\"miller\">Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds.  25 A.L.R.6th 435</ref> The individuals asserted claims for negligent manufacture, negligent advertising, fraud, and violation of various state consumer protection statutes. The tobacco companies were successful against these lawsuits. Only two plaintiffs ever prevailed, and both of those decisions were reversed on appeal.<ref>25 A.L.R.6th 435</ref>  As scientific evidence mounted in the 1980s, tobacco companies claimed [[contributory negligence]] as the adverse health effects were previously unknown or lacked substantial credibility.\n\n===State litigation===\nIn the mid 1990s, more than 40 states commenced litigation against the tobacco industry, seeking monetary, equitable, and injunctive relief under various consumer-protection and antitrust laws.<ref>See Michael Janofsky, Mississippi Seeks Damages from Tobacco Companies, N.Y. Times, May 24, 1994, at A12 (\"Mississippi today became the first state to demand that cigarette makers bear the health care costs of smoking.\"); Gordon Slovut, State, Blue Cross Sue Tobacco Industry, Star Tribune, August 18, 1994, at A1 (stating Minnesota filed suit against the tobacco industry); Andrew Wolfson, West Virginia Takes on Tobacco Over Health Costs, The Courier-Journal, Sept. 22, 1994, at A1; Amy Goldstein, Maryland to Sue Makers of Cigarettes; Effect of Smoking on Medicaid at Issue, Washington Post, Nov. 17, 1995, at B1 (reporting Maryland Governor Parris Glendening's announcement of decision to sue tobacco companies).</ref> The first was declared in May 1994 by [[Mississippi Attorney General]] [[Mike Moore (U.S. politician)|Mike Moore]].\n\nThe general theory of these lawsuits was that the cigarettes produced by the tobacco industry contributed to health problems among the population, which in turn resulted in significant costs to the states' public health systems.  As Moore declared, \"'[The] lawsuit is premised on a simple notion: you caused the health crisis; you pay for it.'\"<ref>Janofsky, Mississippi Seeks Damages from Tobacco Companies, N.Y. Times, May 24, 1994, at A12 (quoting Mississippi Attorney General Mike Moore).</ref> The states alleged a wide range of deceptive and fraudulent practices by the tobacco companies over decades of sales.<ref>For example, Pennsylvania brought suit alleging a \"conspiracy in concealing and misrepresenting the addictive and harmful nature of tobacco/nicotine[,] . . . industry control and manipulation of nicotine to foster addiction and thus profits[,] . . . intentionally attracting and addicting children to tobacco products,\" and \"targeting African Americans\" (complaint in ''Commonwealth of Pennsylvania v. Philip Morris, Inc.''). These claims encompass [[civil conspiracy]], willful and negligent breach of a special duty, [[fraudulent misrepresentation]], [[fraudulent concealment]], negligent design, strict liability, unfair trade practices, [[public nuisance]], and negligent and intentional entrustment.</ref>  Other states soon followed. The state lawsuits sought recovery for [[Medicaid]] and other public health expenses incurred in the treatment of smoking-induced illnesses. Importantly, the defenses of personal responsibility that were so effective for the tobacco industry in suits by private individuals were inapplicable to the causes of action alleged by the states.\n\n===Proposed \"Global Settlement Agreement\"===\nFaced with the prospect of defending multiple actions nationwide, the Majors sought a congressional remedy, primarily in the form of a national legislative settlement.<ref>{{Cite news|title=Utah Sues Tobacco Companies|last=|first=|date=October 1, 1996|work=The Washington Post|access-date=|page=A9}}</ref> In June 1997, the National Association of Attorneys General and the Majors jointly petitioned Congress for a global resolution.  On June 20, 1997, Mississippi Attorney General Michael Moore and a group of other attorneys general announced the details of the settlement. The settlement included a payment by the companies of $365.5 billion, agreement to possible [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulation under certain circumstances, and stronger warning labels and restrictions on advertising. In exchange the companies would be freed from [[class-action suit]]s and litigation costs would be capped.<ref name=\"Brandt\">{{cite book | last = Brandt | first = Allan M. | title = The Cigarette Century: the Rise, Fall and Deadly Persistence of the Product That Defined America | publisher = Basic Books, a member of the Perseus Books Group | location = New York | year = 2007 | isbn = 978-0-465-07047-3 | url-access = registration | url = https://archive.org/details/cigarettecentury00bran }}</ref>{{Rp|422}}\n\nThis proposed congressional remedy (1997 National Settlement Proposal (NSP), a.k.a. the \"June 20, 1997 Proposal\") for the cigarette tobacco problem resembled the eventual Multistate Settlement Agreement (MSA), but with important differences. For example, although the congressional proposal would have earmarked one-third of all funds to combat teenage smoking, no such restrictions appear in the MSA.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/us/9705/tobacco/docs/proposal.html|title=1997 NSP, Title VII|last=|first=|work=|access-date=June 18, 2001|publisher=CNN}}</ref> In addition, the congressional proposal would have mandated [[Food and Drug Administration]] oversight and imposed federal advertising restrictions.

Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona carried the bill, which was much more aggressive than even the global settlement.<ref name=\"Brandt\" />{{Rp|422, 427}} However, in the spring of 1998, Congress rejected both the proposed settlement and an alternative proposal submitted by McCain.\n\nWhile the proposed legislation was being discussed in Congress, some individual states began settling their litigation against the tobacco industry. On July 2, 1997, Mississippi became the first. Over the next year, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota followed, with the four states recovering a total of over $35 billion.\n\nFour states (Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota) settled with the OPMs before the MSA. The OPMs pay those four states (the \"previously settled states\") 17 per cent of the MSA per-cigarette payment amount for each cigarette sold in any state. Thus, the OPMs pay the settling and previously settled states 104.55 per cent of the per-cigarette amount for each cigarette sold.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} In 2005, OPM payments totaled about 2.2 cents per cigarette or 44 cents per box.<ref>''Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline'', 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1081\u20131082 (D. Kan. 2007)</ref>\n\n===Adoption of the \"Master Settlement Agreement\"===\nIn November 1998, the Attorneys General of the remaining 46 states, as well as of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement with the four largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States. ([[Florida]], [[Minnesota]], [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]] had already reached individual agreements with the tobacco industry.)  The four manufacturers\u2014[[Philip Morris USA]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], [[Brown & Williamson|Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.]], and [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]]\u2014are referred to in the MSA as the Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs).\n\nThis settlement process yielded two other national agreements:\n\n====Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement====\nIn the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which was executed at the same time as the Master Settlement Agreement, the leading manufacturer in the [[smokeless tobacco]] market (United States Tobacco Company, now known as [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]]) settled with the jurisdictions who signed the MSA, plus Minnesota and Mississippi.\n\n====Phase II settlement====\nThe next year, the major cigarette manufacturers settled with the tobacco-growing states to compensate tobacco growers for losses they were expected to suffer due to the higher cigarette prices resulting from the earlier settlements. Called the \"Phase II\" settlement, this agreement created the National Tobacco Growers' Settlement Trust Fund. Tobacco growers and quota holders in the 14 states that grow flue-cured and burley tobacco used to manufacture cigarettes are eligible to receive payments from the trust fund. The states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\n====Subsequent signatories====\nAt the time the Master Settlement Agreement became effective, the OPMs collectively controlled approximately 97% of the domestic market for cigarettes.  In addition to these \"originally settling parties\" (OSPs), the Master Settlement Agreement permits other tobacco companies to join the settlement; a list of these \"subsequently settling parties\" (SSPs) is maintained by the National Association of Attorneys General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/participating_manu/2009-06-22_PM_List.pdf/download|title=naag.org}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Since 1998, approximately 41 additional tobacco companies have joined the Master Settlement Agreement. These companies, referred to as the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers (SPMs), are bound by the Master Settlement Agreement's restrictions and must make payments to the settling states as set forth in the Master Settlement Agreement. Collectively, the OPMs and the SPMs are referred to as the Participating Manufacturers (PMs). Any tobacco company choosing not to participate in the Master Settlement Agreement is referred to as a Nonparticipating Manufacturer (NPM).\n\nAs an incentive to join the Master Settlement Agreement, the agreement provides that, if an SPM joined within ninety days following the Master Settlement Agreement's \"Execution Date,\" that SPM is exempt (\"exempt SPM\") from making annual payments to the settling states unless the SPM increases its share of the national cigarette market beyond its 1998 market share, or beyond 125% of that SPM's 1997 market share. If the exempt SPM's market share in a given year increases beyond those relevant historic limits, the MSA requires that the exempt SPM make annual payments to the settling states, similar to those made by the OPMs, but based only upon the SPM's sales representing the exempt SPM's market share increase.<ref name=\"G Corp. v 1114\">KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1120 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\nSPMs joining the Master Settlement Agreement after this ninety-day exempt period must, instead, make annual payments based upon all of the SPM's national cigarette sales for a given year. In addition to its annual payment obligations, in order  [**9] to join the Master Settlement Agreement now, a non-exempt SPM must, \"within a reasonable time after signing the\" Master Settlement Agreement, pay the amount it would have been obligated to pay under the Master Settlement Agreement during the time between the Master Settlement Agreement's effective date and the date on which the SPM joined the agreement.<ref name=\"G Corp. v 1114\"/>\n\nThe addition of the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers meant that nearly all of the cigarette producers in the domestic market had signed the Multistate Settlement Agreement. Their addition was significant. The Majors allegedly feared that any cigarette manufacturer left out of a settlement (Non-Participating Manufacturers or NPMs) would be free to expand market share or could enter the market with lower prices, drastically altering the Majors' future profits and their ability to increase prices to pay for the settlement.\n\n==Summary of terms==\nThe Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs) agreed to several broad categories of conditions:\n* to restrict their advertising, sponsorship, lobbying, and litigation activities, particularly as those activities were seen as targeting youth;\n* to disband three specific \"Tobacco-Related Organizations,\" and to restrict their creation and participation in trade associations;\n* generally to make available to the public documents the OPMs had disclosed during the discovery phase of their litigation with the settling states;\n* to create and fund the National Public Education Foundation, dedicated to reducing [[youth smoking]] and preventing diseases associated with smoking.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1119 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n* to make annual payments to the settling states in perpetuity.\n\nA section on enforcement gave jurisdiction to individual state courts to implement and enforce the term, and established a state enforcement fund ($50 million one-time payment).  The participating manufacturers also paid the states' Attorney Fees.\n\n===Restrictions on youth targeting===\nGenerally, the participating manufacturers agreed not to \"take any action, directly or indirectly, to target Youth within any Settling State in the advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, or take any action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain or increase the incidence of Youth smoking within any Settling State.\" (\u00a7III(a))\n\nThe restrictions specified included bans on [[Billboard|outdoor billboards]], advertising on transit vehicles, as well as restrictions on sports marketing, event sponsorships and promotional products.\n\n===Financial provisions===\n\n====Receipts by the states====\nStates were to receive over $206 billion over 25 years:\n* Up-front payments \u2013 $12.742 billion.\n* Annual Payments, beginning April 15, 2000 \u2013 $183.177 billion estimated through 2025. 9 billion per year from 2018 into perpetuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/tclc-fs-msa-overview-2015.pdf |title=Overview |date=2015 |website=www.publichealthlawcenter.org |format=PDF |access-date=2019-07-14}}</ref>\n* Strategic Contribution Fund, 2008\u20132017 \u2013 $8.61 billion.\n* National Foundation ($250 million over 10 years).\n* Public Education Fund (at least $1.45 billion 2000\u20132003).\n* State Enforcement Fund ($50 million, one-time payment).\n* National Association of Attorneys General ($1.5 billion over next 10 years).\n\n====Payments by the Participating Manufacturers (PMs)====\nThe amount of money that the PMs are required to annually contribute to the states varies according to several factors. All payments are based primarily on the number of cigarettes sold.\n\n'''For the OPMs (Original Participating Manufacturers),''' the payments are determined in accordance with their relative market share as of 1997. The payment amount of a particular OPM is also dictated by the \"Volume Adjustment,\" which compares the number of cigarettes sold in each payment year to the number of cigarettes sold in 1997. If the number of cigarettes sold by an OPM in a given year is less than the number it sold in 1997, the Volume Adjustment allows that OPM to reduce its payment to the settling states. In other words, a reduction in the amount of cigarettes sold by the OPMs results in the settling states receiving less money.\n\nThe MSA sets forth specific amounts that the OPMs have agreed to pay the settling states each year. Those annual amounts are subject to a number of adjustments. The OPMs each pay a portion of the total annual payment according to each OPM's \"Relative Market Share\" for the preceding year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>The MSA specifically provides that\"Relative Market Share\" means an [OPM's] respective share (expressed as a percentage) of the total number of individual Cigarettes shipped in or to the fifty United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by all the [OPMs] during the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the payment at issue is due (regardless of when such payment is made), as measured by the [OPMs'] reports of shipments of Cigarettes to Management Science Associates, Inc. (or a successor entity acceptable to both the [OPMs] and a majority of those Attorneys General who are both the Attorney General of a Settling State and a member of the NAAG [National Association of Attorneys General] executive committee at the time in question). A Cigarette shipped by more than one Participating Manufacturer shall be deemed to have been shipped solely by the first Participating Manufacturer to do so. For purposes of the  [**7] definition and determination of \"Relative Market Share,\" 0.09 ounces of \"roll your own\" tobacco constitutes one individual Cigarette.</ref>\n\n'''For the SPMs (Subsequent Participating Manufacturers),''' the payments are determined by their relative market share as compared to other SPMs. For the SPMs that joined the MSA within 90 days of its execution, the annual payments are determined by the number of cigarettes an SPM sells beyond the \"grandfathered\" volume\u2014calculated as the higher of either the individual SPM's market share in 1998 (the year the MSA was executed) or 125% of the SPM's market share in 1997. If an SPM's sales volume or market share declines below the grandfathered amount, then it is not required to make any payments to the settling states. SPMs that failed to join the MSA within 90 days of its execution do not receive the benefit of any grandfathered amount.\n\nBoth exempt and non-exempt SPMs' annual payment obligations under the MSA are \"calculated on the basis of the percentage of the four original participating manufacturers' total domestic market share represented by the SPM[s'] domestic market share . . . . In other words, the denominator in the calculation is the total OPM market share, not the total OPM and SPM market share.\"<ref>Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 465\u201366.</ref> Furthermore, the parties agree that the amount the SPMs pay per cigarette is roughly the same as the per-cigarette amount that the OPMs pay under the MSA. To the extent the amount differs, the OPMs pay slightly more than the SPMs on a per cigarette basis.<ref name=\"G Corp. v 1114\"/>\n\n====Escrow account====\nThe payments from all the PMs are deposited into an escrow account until disbursement to the settling states.\n\nThe MSA includes a model escrow (or qualifying) act and provides strong incentives for settling states to adopt it.<ref>See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 466\u201367.</ref> \"[A] Qualifying Statute . . . is one that effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the Participating Manufacturers experience vis-a-vis Nonparticipating Manufacturers within the state.\"<ref>Id. at 467 (quotation omitted).</ref>\n\nThe MSA encouraged settling states to adopt the model escrow act by providing that a settling state's allocated payment\u2014that is, the portion of the annual MSA payment that a particular state receives in a given year\u2014could be reduced by applying a non-participating manufacturers (\"NPM\") adjustment. That adjustment lowers a state's allocated share of the annual MSA payment if the OPMs lose market share to NPMs and if \"a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants\" determines that the MSA was \"a significant factor contributing to the Market Share Loss for the year in question.\" The NPM adjustment does not apply to any state that has enacted and has in \"full force and effect\" a \"qualifying\" or model escrow statute. All settling states have enacted qualifying statutes.<ref>See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 467.</ref>\n\nThe escrow statute is premised on the legislative finding that, in light of the MSA settling the states' claims against the major cigarette manufacturers, [i]t would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.<ref>See Kan. Stat. \u00a7 50-6a01(f); Okla. Stat. tit. 37, \u00a7 600.21(D).</ref><ref>KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1121 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\nIn light of that, the model escrow statute requires an NPM selling cigarettes in  [*1122]  a given state to do one of two things: 1) join the MSA, agreeing to \"become a participating manufacturer (as that term is defined in section II(jj) of the [MSA]) and generally perform its financial obligations under the [MSA],\" or 2) make similar annual payments into a state \"liability reserve\" escrow account, the funds of which can only be used to pay a judgment or settlement on a claim against the NPM. (After 25 years, any amount remaining in the escrow account is returned to the NPM.)<ref>{{cite web | url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-9th-circuit/1137674.html | title=SANDERS v.

Stat. tit. 37, \u00a7 600.23(A)(2).</ref>\n\n====Allocable share====\nEach state receives a payment equal to its \"Allocable Share,\" a percentage of the funds held in escrow that has been agreed upon by the settling states and memorialized in the MSA. This \"Allocable Share\" (as measured by a percentage of the total funds in escrow) does not vary according to how many cigarettes are sold in a particular state in a given year.\n\nDuring the drafting of the MSA, the OPMs and the settling states contemplated that many of the smaller tobacco companies would choose not to join the MSA. This failure to join posed a potential problem for both the OPMs and the settling states. The OPMs worried that the NPMs, both because they would not be bound by the advertising and other restrictions in the MSA and because they would not be required to make payments to the settling states, would be able to charge lower prices for their cigarettes and thus increase their market share.\n\n====NPMs====\nAlthough the settling states' motivation was different from that of the OPMs, these states also were concerned about the effect of the tobacco companies that refused to join the MSA. The settling states worried that the NPMs would be able to regulate their sales so as to stay afloat financially while at the same time being effectively judgment-proof. As a result of these twin concerns, the OPMs and the settling states sought to have the MSA provide these other tobacco companies with incentives to join the agreement.\n\nOne such incentive, called the NPM Adjustment, provides that the payments by the PMs to the settling states may be adjusted according to the \"NPM Adjustment Percentage.\" According to this provision, if a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants determines that the PMs have lost market share as a result of compliance with the MSA, the PMs' required payments to the settling states will be reduced to account for the loss. The NPM Adjustment therefore gives the settling states an incentive to protect the market dominance of the PMs, because  [*551]  otherwise the settling states themselves will receive less funds.  The MSA also provides a safe harbor from the NPM Adjustment if a settling state \"diligently enforces\" the provision of a Model Statute attached to the MSA and enacted by all of the settling states.\n\nMost of the settling states have also voluntarily adopted \"complementary\" legislation to provide additional enforcement tools to compel compliance with the Model Statute.\n\n====Allocable Share Release Repeal====\nThe original escrow statutes provided that NPM payments would remain in escrow for 25 years, but authorized an early release of any escrow amount which was greater than the allocable share which that state would have received if the NPM had been an SPM.<ref>The pre-amendment Kansas statute, for example, provided that if an NPM established that its payments were greater than the State's \"allocable share of the payments that it would have been required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement . . . had it been a participating manufacturer,\" the NPM was entitled to an immediate release of its over-payment. See K.S.A. 50-6a03(b)(2)(B) (before 2005 amendment).</ref> The originally enacted escrow statutes permitted an NPM to obtain a refund of the amount the NPM paid into the escrow fund to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the State's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the [MSA] . . . had it been a participating manufacturer.<ref>See also Kan.

Nevertheless, the originally enacted escrow statute based any refund of those escrowed funds payments on that state's allocable share of the national MSA payment. This refund provision, then, assumed an NPM would sell its cigarettes nationally.<ref>See id. at 469.</ref><ref>KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1123 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\nIf an NPM made the bulk of its sales in a few states, however, it could obtain a refund of those escrow payments in excess of what it would have paid each of those States had it been an SPM. For example, an NPM which made 50 per cent of its sales in Kansas (which has a relatively low allocable share) would obtain a release from its Kansas escrow fund of more than 49 per cent of its full escrow payment. In other words, the original allocable share release provision created an unintended loophole: it only operated as intended if the NPMs distributed their products nationally. In that circumstance, the NPMs' total escrow obligations to all states with similar tobacco statutes approximately totaled the payments those NPMs would have made under the MSA. If an NPM concentrated its sales in a few state with low allocable share percentages, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of much of its escrow payments. Because the Kansas percentage was so low\u2014roughly 0.8 per cent\u2014NPMs concentrated their sales within Kansas and a few other states to receive immediate escrow refunds from those states.\n\nRather than selling cigarettes nationally, several NPMs instead concentrated their sales in just a few states. Because the originally enacted escrow statute refunded escrow funds to the extent those funds exceeded each state's \"allocable share\" of the national MSA payment, NPMs were able to obtain refunds of most of the monies they had paid into a state's escrow fund. To illustrate, if an NPM only sold cigarettes in Kansas in 2006, the Kansas escrow statute would require that NPM to pay into the Kansas escrow fund $.0167539 for each cigarette the NPM sold in that state.<ref>See Kan. Stat. \u00a7 50-6a03(b)(1)(D).</ref> Pursuant to the refund provision in the originally enacted Kansas escrow statute, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of all but .8336712% of those payments.\n\nOne commentator further explains that the calculations under the [originally enacted escrow] statutes were based on an assumption that a nonparticipating manufacturer sold cigarettes nationally. When this was the case, the statutes functioned as intended, permitting the NPM to obtain a refund of excess amounts placed in escrow in each state. However, when an NPM followed a regional sales strategy, as several did, the original escrow statutes allowed the NPM to obtain a refund that was much larger than intended.<ref>Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 469 (footnotes omitted).</ref>\n\nTo close this loophole, in late 2002, the National Association of Attorneys General (\"NAAG\") introduced the Allocable Share Release Repealer (\"ASR Repealer\"), a model statute which eliminated the ASR. In a memo dated September 12, 2003, Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont, Chairman of the NAAG Tobacco Project, underscored the urgency of \"all States taking steps to deal with the proliferation of NPM sales, including enactment of complementary legislation and allocable share legislation and consideration of other measures designed to serve the interests of the States in avoiding reductions in tobacco settlement payments.\" He stressed that \"NPM sales anywhere in the country hurt all States,\" that NPM sales in any state reduce payments to every other State,\" and that \"[a]ll States have an interest in reducing NPM sales in every State.\"<ref>Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline, 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1083 (D. Kan. 2007)</ref>\n\nThe \"Allocable Share Release Repeal\" (\"ASR Repeal\") revised the originally enacted escrow statute's refund calculation to remove the reference to the enacting state's \"allocable share\" of the annual MSA payments. HN2The amended statute, therefore, now provides that an NPM will be entitled to a refund[t]o the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow, based on units sold in the state . . . in a particular year, was greater than the [MSA] payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement including, after final determination of all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make based on such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert to such tobacco product manufacturer.<ref>Kan. Stat, \u00a7 50-6a03(b)(2)(B) (2005); see also Okla. Stat. tit. 37; \u00a7 600.23(B)(2). n5</ref>\n\nThus, an NPM still has to pay annually into a state's escrow fund an amount calculated by multiplying the number of cigarettes the NPM sells in that state during the year in question by the same per-cigarette amount for that year as set forth in the state's escrow statute. The NPM can obtain a refund to the extent those escrowed funds are greater than the amount that the NPM would have had to pay under the MSA for that same year, based upon that same number of cigarettes sold.<ref>KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\n==Contraband statutes==\nBy the middle of 2000, domestic NPMs and importers began to obtain greater market share.<ref>The NPMs sharply increased their share of the domestic market from 1.6 per cent in 1999 to 8.1 percent in 2003. OPM operating incomes declined substantially in 2003, but with the repeals of the allocable share release starting in 2003, their operating incomes increased. In the spring of 2004, Phillip Morris (the largest OPM) and Liggett (the largest SPM) attributed the increase of their gross profit margins to the widespread enactment of the ASR Repealers. PXs 125, 126.</ref> The NAAG noted that reductions in settlement payments which result from an overall reduction in cigarette consumption benefit the states because health care costs imposed by each cigarette exceed the settlement payments.<ref>The NAAG advised the settling states to enact these model Contraband Statutes promptly or receive lower MSA payments due to increased Volume Adjustments and substantial NPM Downward Adjustments. PX 21. The Volume Adjustment is determined by comparing the number of cigarettes sold nationally by OPMs in a given year with the number sold in the base year of 1997. The resulting percentage reduces the base payment to the states by the PMs. The NPM Downward Adjustment can reduce a settling state's share of the MSA payments if PMs have lost market share due to participation in the MSA and the state did not diligently enforce escrow payments by NPMs.</ref> On the other hand, when reductions in settlement payments occur because NPM sales displace PM sales, the states receive no benefits if the NPMs do not make escrow payments. Therefore, in late 2000, the NAAG drafted a model Contraband Statute to ensure that NPMs made escrow payments on cigarettes. See PX 116. The model Contraband Statute provides that excise tax stamping agents may not stamp cigarettes for sale in the state unless the manufacturer becomes a PM under the MSA or is an NPM which makes all escrow payments required by the Escrow Statute.<ref>Before the contraband statutes, the states did not have a mechanism to enforce the escrow statute.</ref> The model Contraband Statute imposes a criminal penalty on wholesalers who sell cigarettes made by NPMs who are not duly registered in the state and making full escrow payments. By the middle of 2002, only seven settling states had enacted Contraband Statutes. As of 2007, 44 of the 46 settling states (including Kansas) have enacted these statutes. See K.S.A. \u00a7 50-6a04. The Kansas Attorney General is charged with enforcing the Escrow and Contraband Statutes.<ref>Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline, 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1084 (D.

Proponents of this argument claim that certain restrictions on pricing make it more difficult for small growers to compete with \"[[Big Tobacco]]\".

Levy|Robert Levy]], assert that the lawsuit that brought on the tobacco settlement was instigated by a need to make beneficiary payments to [[Medicaid]] recipients.  Following the passage of laws that eliminated the tobacco companies' ability to provide evidence in court for their defense, the tobacco companies were forced to settle.  The big four tobacco companies agreed to pay the state governments several billion dollars but the government in turn was to protect the big four tobacco companies from competition.  The Master Settlement Agreement, they argue, created an unconstitutional cartel arrangement that benefited both the government and big tobacco.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa371.pdf | title=Constitutional and Antitrust Violations of the Multistate Tobacco Settlement | last=O\u2019Brien | first=Thomas | publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | date=2000-05-18 | accessdate=2018-07-19 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403075120/https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa371.pdf | archive-date=2015-04-03 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Reason_Olson\">{{cite magazine | url=http://reason.com/archives/2000/01/01/puff-the-magic-settlement/print | title=Puff, the Magic Settlement | last=Olson | first=Walter | magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] | date=2000-01-01 | accessdate=2018-07-20 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120075258/http://reason.com/archives/2000/01/01/puff-the-magic-settlement/print | archive-date=2011-11-20 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nRobert Levy states:<blockquote>For 40 years, tobacco companies had not been held liable for cigarette-related illnesses. Then, beginning in 1994, led by Florida, states across the country sued big tobacco to recover public outlays for medical expenses due to smoking. By changing the law to guarantee they would win in court, the states extorted a quarter-trillion-dollar settlement, which was passed along in higher cigarette prices. Basically, the tobacco companies had money; the states and their hired-gun attorneys wanted money; so the companies paid and the states collected.

Senator [[John McCain]] of Arizona carried the bill, which was much more aggressive than even the global settlement.<ref name=\"Brandt\" />{{Rp|422, 427}} However, in the spring of 1998, Congress rejected both the proposed settlement and an alternative proposal submitted by McCain.\n\nWhile the proposed legislation was being discussed in Congress, some individual states began settling their litigation against the tobacco industry. On July 2, 1997, Mississippi became the first. Over the next year, Florida, Texas, and Minnesota followed, with the four states recovering a total of over $35 billion.\n\nFour states (Mississippi, Florida, Texas and Minnesota) settled with the OPMs before the MSA. The OPMs pay those four states (the \"previously settled states\") 17 per cent of the MSA per-cigarette payment amount for each cigarette sold in any state. Thus, the OPMs pay the settling and previously settled states 104.55 per cent of the per-cigarette amount for each cigarette sold.{{dubious|date=March 2018}} In 2005, OPM payments totaled about 2.2 cents per cigarette or 44 cents per box.<ref>''Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline'', 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1081\u20131082 (D. Kan. 2007)</ref>\n\n===Adoption of the \"Master Settlement Agreement\"===\nIn November 1998, the Attorneys General of the remaining 46 states, as well as of the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands, entered into the Master Settlement Agreement with the four largest manufacturers of cigarettes in the United States. ([[Florida]], [[Minnesota]], [[Texas]] and [[Mississippi]] had already reached individual agreements with the tobacco industry.)  The four manufacturers\u2014[[Philip Morris USA]], [[R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company]], [[Brown & Williamson|Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.]], and [[Lorillard Tobacco Company]]\u2014are referred to in the MSA as the Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs).\n\nThis settlement process yielded two other national agreements:\n\n====Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement====\nIn the Smokeless Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which was executed at the same time as the Master Settlement Agreement, the leading manufacturer in the [[smokeless tobacco]] market (United States Tobacco Company, now known as [[U.S. Smokeless Tobacco Company]]) settled with the jurisdictions who signed the MSA, plus Minnesota and Mississippi.\n\n====Phase II settlement====\nThe next year, the major cigarette manufacturers settled with the tobacco-growing states to compensate tobacco growers for losses they were expected to suffer due to the higher cigarette prices resulting from the earlier settlements. Called the \"Phase II\" settlement, this agreement created the National Tobacco Growers' Settlement Trust Fund. Tobacco growers and quota holders in the 14 states that grow flue-cured and burley tobacco used to manufacture cigarettes are eligible to receive payments from the trust fund. The states are Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Missouri, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia.\n\n====Subsequent signatories====\nAt the time the Master Settlement Agreement became effective, the OPMs collectively controlled approximately 97% of the domestic market for cigarettes.  In addition to these \"originally settling parties\" (OSPs), the Master Settlement Agreement permits other tobacco companies to join the settlement; a list of these \"subsequently settling parties\" (SSPs) is maintained by the National Association of Attorneys General.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.naag.org/backpages/naag/tobacco/msa/participating_manu/2009-06-22_PM_List.pdf/download|title=naag.org}}{{Dead link|date=November 2019 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>  Since 1998, approximately 41 additional tobacco companies have joined the Master Settlement Agreement. These companies, referred to as the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers (SPMs), are bound by the Master Settlement Agreement's restrictions and must make payments to the settling states as set forth in the Master Settlement Agreement. Collectively, the OPMs and the SPMs are referred to as the Participating Manufacturers (PMs). Any tobacco company choosing not to participate in the Master Settlement Agreement is referred to as a Nonparticipating Manufacturer (NPM).\n\nAs an incentive to join the Master Settlement Agreement, the agreement provides that, if an SPM joined within ninety days following the Master Settlement Agreement's \"Execution Date,\" that SPM is exempt (\"exempt SPM\") from making annual payments to the settling states unless the SPM increases its share of the national cigarette market beyond its 1998 market share, or beyond 125% of that SPM's 1997 market share. If the exempt SPM's market share in a given year increases beyond those relevant historic limits, the MSA requires that the exempt SPM make annual payments to the settling states, similar to those made by the OPMs, but based only upon the SPM's sales representing the exempt SPM's market share increase.<ref name=\"G Corp. v 1114\">KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1120 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\nSPMs joining the Master Settlement Agreement after this ninety-day exempt period must, instead, make annual payments based upon all of the SPM's national cigarette sales for a given year. In addition to its annual payment obligations, in order  [**9] to join the Master Settlement Agreement now, a non-exempt SPM must, \"within a reasonable time after signing the\" Master Settlement Agreement, pay the amount it would have been obligated to pay under the Master Settlement Agreement during the time between the Master Settlement Agreement's effective date and the date on which the SPM joined the agreement.<ref name=\"G Corp. v 1114\"/>\n\nThe addition of the Subsequent Participating Manufacturers meant that nearly all of the cigarette producers in the domestic market had signed the Multistate Settlement Agreement. Their addition was significant. The Majors allegedly feared that any cigarette manufacturer left out of a settlement (Non-Participating Manufacturers or NPMs) would be free to expand market share or could enter the market with lower prices, drastically altering the Majors' future profits and their ability to increase prices to pay for the settlement.\n\n==Summary of terms==\nThe Original Participating Manufacturers (OPMs) agreed to several broad categories of conditions:\n* to restrict their advertising, sponsorship, lobbying, and litigation activities, particularly as those activities were seen as targeting youth;\n* to disband three specific \"Tobacco-Related Organizations,\" and to restrict their creation and participation in trade associations;\n* generally to make available to the public documents the OPMs had disclosed during the discovery phase of their litigation with the settling states;\n* to create and fund the National Public Education Foundation, dedicated to reducing [[youth smoking]] and preventing diseases associated with smoking.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1119 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n* to make annual payments to the settling states in perpetuity.\n\nA section on enforcement gave jurisdiction to individual state courts to implement and enforce the term, and established a state enforcement fund ($50 million one-time payment).  The participating manufacturers also paid the states' Attorney Fees.\n\n===Restrictions on youth targeting===\nGenerally, the participating manufacturers agreed not to \"take any action, directly or indirectly, to target Youth within any Settling State in the advertising, promotion or marketing of Tobacco Products, or take any action the primary purpose of which is to initiate, maintain or increase the incidence of Youth smoking within any Settling State.\" (\u00a7III(a))\n\nThe restrictions specified included bans on [[Billboard|outdoor billboards]], advertising on transit vehicles, as well as restrictions on sports marketing, event sponsorships and promotional products.\n\n===Financial provisions===\n\n====Receipts by the states====\nStates were to receive over $206 billion over 25 years:\n* Up-front payments \u2013 $12.742 billion.\n* Annual Payments, beginning April 15, 2000 \u2013 $183.177 billion estimated through 2025. 9 billion per year from 2018 into perpetuity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/sites/default/files/resources/tclc-fs-msa-overview-2015.pdf |title=Overview |date=2015 |website=www.publichealthlawcenter.org |format=PDF |access-date=2019-07-14}}</ref>\n* Strategic Contribution Fund, 2008\u20132017 \u2013 $8.61 billion.\n* National Foundation ($250 million over 10 years).\n* Public Education Fund (at least $1.45 billion 2000\u20132003).\n* State Enforcement Fund ($50 million, one-time payment).\n* National Association of Attorneys General ($1.5 billion over next 10 years).\n\n====Payments by the Participating Manufacturers (PMs)====\nThe amount of money that the PMs are required to annually contribute to the states varies according to several factors. All payments are based primarily on the number of cigarettes sold.\n\n'''For the OPMs (Original Participating Manufacturers),''' the payments are determined in accordance with their relative market share as of 1997. The payment amount of a particular OPM is also dictated by the \"Volume Adjustment,\" which compares the number of cigarettes sold in each payment year to the number of cigarettes sold in 1997. If the number of cigarettes sold by an OPM in a given year is less than the number it sold in 1997, the Volume Adjustment allows that OPM to reduce its payment to the settling states. In other words, a reduction in the amount of cigarettes sold by the OPMs results in the settling states receiving less money.\n\nThe MSA sets forth specific amounts that the OPMs have agreed to pay the settling states each year. Those annual amounts are subject to a number of adjustments. The OPMs each pay a portion of the total annual payment according to each OPM's \"Relative Market Share\" for the preceding year.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/><ref>The MSA specifically provides that\"Relative Market Share\" means an [OPM's] respective share (expressed as a percentage) of the total number of individual Cigarettes shipped in or to the fifty United States, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico by all the [OPMs] during the calendar year immediately preceding the year in which the payment at issue is due (regardless of when such payment is made), as measured by the [OPMs'] reports of shipments of Cigarettes to Management Science Associates, Inc. (or a successor entity acceptable to both the [OPMs] and a majority of those Attorneys General who are both the Attorney General of a Settling State and a member of the NAAG [National Association of Attorneys General] executive committee at the time in question). A Cigarette shipped by more than one Participating Manufacturer shall be deemed to have been shipped solely by the first Participating Manufacturer to do so. For purposes of the  [**7] definition and determination of \"Relative Market Share,\" 0.09 ounces of \"roll your own\" tobacco constitutes one individual Cigarette.</ref>\n\n'''For the SPMs (Subsequent Participating Manufacturers),''' the payments are determined by their relative market share as compared to other SPMs. For the SPMs that joined the MSA within 90 days of its execution, the annual payments are determined by the number of cigarettes an SPM sells beyond the \"grandfathered\" volume\u2014calculated as the higher of either the individual SPM's market share in 1998 (the year the MSA was executed) or 125% of the SPM's market share in 1997. If an SPM's sales volume or market share declines below the grandfathered amount, then it is not required to make any payments to the settling states. SPMs that failed to join the MSA within 90 days of its execution do not receive the benefit of any grandfathered amount.\n\nBoth exempt and non-exempt SPMs' annual payment obligations under the MSA are \"calculated on the basis of the percentage of the four original participating manufacturers' total domestic market share represented by the SPM[s'] domestic market share . . . . In other words, the denominator in the calculation is the total OPM market share, not the total OPM and SPM market share.\"<ref>Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 465\u201366.</ref> Furthermore, the parties agree that the amount the SPMs pay per cigarette is roughly the same as the per-cigarette amount that the OPMs pay under the MSA. To the extent the amount differs, the OPMs pay slightly more than the SPMs on a per cigarette basis.<ref name=\"G Corp. v 1114\"/>\n\n====Escrow account====\nThe payments from all the PMs are deposited into an escrow account until disbursement to the settling states.\n\nThe MSA includes a model escrow (or qualifying) act and provides strong incentives for settling states to adopt it.<ref>See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 466\u201367.</ref> \"[A] Qualifying Statute . . . is one that effectively and fully neutralizes the cost disadvantages that the Participating Manufacturers experience vis-a-vis Nonparticipating Manufacturers within the state.\"<ref>Id. at 467 (quotation omitted).</ref>\n\nThe MSA encouraged settling states to adopt the model escrow act by providing that a settling state's allocated payment\u2014that is, the portion of the annual MSA payment that a particular state receives in a given year\u2014could be reduced by applying a non-participating manufacturers (\"NPM\") adjustment. That adjustment lowers a state's allocated share of the annual MSA payment if the OPMs lose market share to NPMs and if \"a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants\" determines that the MSA was \"a significant factor contributing to the Market Share Loss for the year in question.\" The NPM adjustment does not apply to any state that has enacted and has in \"full force and effect\" a \"qualifying\" or model escrow statute. All settling states have enacted qualifying statutes.<ref>See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 467.</ref>\n\nThe escrow statute is premised on the legislative finding that, in light of the MSA settling the states' claims against the major cigarette manufacturers, [i]t would be contrary to the policy of the State if tobacco product manufacturers who determine not to enter into such a settlement could use a resulting cost advantage to derive large, short-term profits in the years before liability may arise without ensuring that the State will have an eventual source of recovery from them if they are proven to have acted culpably. It is thus in the interest of the State to require that such manufacturers establish a reserve fund to guarantee a source of compensation and to prevent such manufacturers from deriving large, short-term profits and then becoming judgment-proof before liability may arise.<ref>See Kan. Stat. \u00a7 50-6a01(f); Okla. Stat. tit. 37, \u00a7 600.21(D).</ref><ref>KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1121 (10th Cir.

Stat. tit. 37, \u00a7 600.23(A)(2).</ref>\n\n====Allocable share====\nEach state receives a payment equal to its \"Allocable Share,\" a percentage of the funds held in escrow that has been agreed upon by the settling states and memorialized in the MSA. This \"Allocable Share\" (as measured by a percentage of the total funds in escrow) does not vary according to how many cigarettes are sold in a particular state in a given year.\n\nDuring the drafting of the MSA, the OPMs and the settling states contemplated that many of the smaller tobacco companies would choose not to join the MSA. This failure to join posed a potential problem for both the OPMs and the settling states. The OPMs worried that the NPMs, both because they would not be bound by the advertising and other restrictions in the MSA and because they would not be required to make payments to the settling states, would be able to charge lower prices for their cigarettes and thus increase their market share.\n\n====NPMs====\nAlthough the settling states' motivation was different from that of the OPMs, these states also were concerned about the effect of the tobacco companies that refused to join the MSA. The settling states worried that the NPMs would be able to regulate their sales so as to stay afloat financially while at the same time being effectively judgment-proof. As a result of these twin concerns, the OPMs and the settling states sought to have the MSA provide these other tobacco companies with incentives to join the agreement.\n\nOne such incentive, called the NPM Adjustment, provides that the payments by the PMs to the settling states may be adjusted according to the \"NPM Adjustment Percentage.\" According to this provision, if a nationally recognized firm of economic consultants determines that the PMs have lost market share as a result of compliance with the MSA, the PMs' required payments to the settling states will be reduced to account for the loss. The NPM Adjustment therefore gives the settling states an incentive to protect the market dominance of the PMs, because  [*551]  otherwise the settling states themselves will receive less funds.  The MSA also provides a safe harbor from the NPM Adjustment if a settling state \"diligently enforces\" the provision of a Model Statute attached to the MSA and enacted by all of the settling states.\n\nMost of the settling states have also voluntarily adopted \"complementary\" legislation to provide additional enforcement tools to compel compliance with the Model Statute.\n\n====Allocable Share Release Repeal====\nThe original escrow statutes provided that NPM payments would remain in escrow for 25 years, but authorized an early release of any escrow amount which was greater than the allocable share which that state would have received if the NPM had been an SPM.<ref>The pre-amendment Kansas statute, for example, provided that if an NPM established that its payments were greater than the State's \"allocable share of the payments that it would have been required to make in that year under the master settlement agreement . . . had it been a participating manufacturer,\" the NPM was entitled to an immediate release of its over-payment. See K.S.A. 50-6a03(b)(2)(B) (before 2005 amendment).</ref> The originally enacted escrow statutes permitted an NPM to obtain a refund of the amount the NPM paid into the escrow fund to the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow in a particular year was greater than the State's allocable share of the total payments that such manufacturer would have been required to make in that year under the [MSA] . . . had it been a participating manufacturer.<ref>See also Kan. Stat. \u00a7 50-6a03(b)(2)(B); Okla. Stat. tit. 37, \u00a7 600.23(B)(2).</ref>  This \"Allocable Share Release Provision\" was intended to create substantial equivalence between the escrow obligation of NPMs under the escrow statutes and the amounts the NPMs would have paid if they had they joined the MSA.<ref>See K.S.A. \u00a7 50-6a03(b)(2)(B).</ref>\n\nThe settling states agreed to divide the annual MSA payment among themselves according to each state's preset allocable share, rather than according to the volume of sales made in a particular state in a given year.<ref>See Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 464.</ref> An NPM's payments into a state's escrow fund, on the other hand, were dependent on the number of cigarettes that the NPM sold in that state in a given year. Nevertheless, the originally enacted escrow statute based any refund of those escrowed funds payments on that state's allocable share of the national MSA payment. This refund provision, then, assumed an NPM would sell its cigarettes nationally.<ref>See id. at 469.</ref><ref>KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1123 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\nIf an NPM made the bulk of its sales in a few states, however, it could obtain a refund of those escrow payments in excess of what it would have paid each of those States had it been an SPM. For example, an NPM which made 50 per cent of its sales in Kansas (which has a relatively low allocable share) would obtain a release from its Kansas escrow fund of more than 49 per cent of its full escrow payment. In other words, the original allocable share release provision created an unintended loophole: it only operated as intended if the NPMs distributed their products nationally. In that circumstance, the NPMs' total escrow obligations to all states with similar tobacco statutes approximately totaled the payments those NPMs would have made under the MSA. If an NPM concentrated its sales in a few state with low allocable share percentages, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of much of its escrow payments. Because the Kansas percentage was so low\u2014roughly 0.8 per cent\u2014NPMs concentrated their sales within Kansas and a few other states to receive immediate escrow refunds from those states.\n\nRather than selling cigarettes nationally, several NPMs instead concentrated their sales in just a few states. Because the originally enacted escrow statute refunded escrow funds to the extent those funds exceeded each state's \"allocable share\" of the national MSA payment, NPMs were able to obtain refunds of most of the monies they had paid into a state's escrow fund. To illustrate, if an NPM only sold cigarettes in Kansas in 2006, the Kansas escrow statute would require that NPM to pay into the Kansas escrow fund $.0167539 for each cigarette the NPM sold in that state.<ref>See Kan. Stat. \u00a7 50-6a03(b)(1)(D).</ref> Pursuant to the refund provision in the originally enacted Kansas escrow statute, however, the NPM could obtain a refund of all but .8336712% of those payments.\n\nOne commentator further explains that the calculations under the [originally enacted escrow] statutes were based on an assumption that a nonparticipating manufacturer sold cigarettes nationally. When this was the case, the statutes functioned as intended, permitting the NPM to obtain a refund of excess amounts placed in escrow in each state. However, when an NPM followed a regional sales strategy, as several did, the original escrow statutes allowed the NPM to obtain a refund that was much larger than intended.<ref>Miller, Validity, Construction, Application, and Effect of Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) Between Tobacco Companies and Various States, and State Statutes Implementing Agreement; Use and Distribution of MSA Proceeds, 25 A.L.R. 6th 435, 461n.13 (2007), at 469 (footnotes omitted).</ref>\n\nTo close this loophole, in late 2002, the National Association of Attorneys General (\"NAAG\") introduced the Allocable Share Release Repealer (\"ASR Repealer\"), a model statute which eliminated the ASR. In a memo dated September 12, 2003, Attorney General William H. Sorrell of Vermont, Chairman of the NAAG Tobacco Project, underscored the urgency of \"all States taking steps to deal with the proliferation of NPM sales, including enactment of complementary legislation and allocable share legislation and consideration of other measures designed to serve the interests of the States in avoiding reductions in tobacco settlement payments.\" He stressed that \"NPM sales anywhere in the country hurt all States,\" that NPM sales in any state reduce payments to every other State,\" and that \"[a]ll States have an interest in reducing NPM sales in every State.\"<ref>Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline, 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1083 (D. Kan. 2007)</ref>\n\nThe \"Allocable Share Release Repeal\" (\"ASR Repeal\") revised the originally enacted escrow statute's refund calculation to remove the reference to the enacting state's \"allocable share\" of the annual MSA payments. HN2The amended statute, therefore, now provides that an NPM will be entitled to a refund[t]o the extent that a tobacco product manufacturer establishes that the amount it was required to place into escrow, based on units sold in the state . . . in a particular year, was greater than the [MSA] payments, as determined pursuant to section IX(i) of that agreement including, after final determination of all adjustments, that such manufacturer would have been required to make based on such units sold had it been a participating manufacturer, the excess shall be released from escrow and revert to such tobacco product manufacturer.<ref>Kan. Stat, \u00a7 50-6a03(b)(2)(B) (2005); see also Okla. Stat. tit. 37; \u00a7 600.23(B)(2). n5</ref>\n\nThus, an NPM still has to pay annually into a state's escrow fund an amount calculated by multiplying the number of cigarettes the NPM sells in that state during the year in question by the same per-cigarette amount for that year as set forth in the state's escrow statute. The NPM can obtain a refund to the extent those escrowed funds are greater than the amount that the NPM would have had to pay under the MSA for that same year, based upon that same number of cigarettes sold.<ref>KT&G Corp. v. AG of Okla., 535 F.3d 1114, 1124 (10th Cir. Okla. 2008)</ref>\n\n==Contraband statutes==\nBy the middle of 2000, domestic NPMs and importers began to obtain greater market share.<ref>The NPMs sharply increased their share of the domestic market from 1.6 per cent in 1999 to 8.1 percent in 2003. OPM operating incomes declined substantially in 2003, but with the repeals of the allocable share release starting in 2003, their operating incomes increased. In the spring of 2004, Phillip Morris (the largest OPM) and Liggett (the largest SPM) attributed the increase of their gross profit margins to the widespread enactment of the ASR Repealers. PXs 125, 126.</ref> The NAAG noted that reductions in settlement payments which result from an overall reduction in cigarette consumption benefit the states because health care costs imposed by each cigarette exceed the settlement payments.<ref>The NAAG advised the settling states to enact these model Contraband Statutes promptly or receive lower MSA payments due to increased Volume Adjustments and substantial NPM Downward Adjustments. PX 21. The Volume Adjustment is determined by comparing the number of cigarettes sold nationally by OPMs in a given year with the number sold in the base year of 1997. The resulting percentage reduces the base payment to the states by the PMs. The NPM Downward Adjustment can reduce a settling state's share of the MSA payments if PMs have lost market share due to participation in the MSA and the state did not diligently enforce escrow payments by NPMs.</ref> On the other hand, when reductions in settlement payments occur because NPM sales displace PM sales, the states receive no benefits if the NPMs do not make escrow payments. Therefore, in late 2000, the NAAG drafted a model Contraband Statute to ensure that NPMs made escrow payments on cigarettes. See PX 116. The model Contraband Statute provides that excise tax stamping agents may not stamp cigarettes for sale in the state unless the manufacturer becomes a PM under the MSA or is an NPM which makes all escrow payments required by the Escrow Statute.<ref>Before the contraband statutes, the states did not have a mechanism to enforce the escrow statute.</ref> The model Contraband Statute imposes a criminal penalty on wholesalers who sell cigarettes made by NPMs who are not duly registered in the state and making full escrow payments. By the middle of 2002, only seven settling states had enacted Contraband Statutes. As of 2007, 44 of the 46 settling states (including Kansas) have enacted these statutes. See K.S.A. \u00a7 50-6a04. The Kansas Attorney General is charged with enforcing the Escrow and Contraband Statutes.<ref>Int'l Tobacco Partners, Ltd. v. Kline, 475 F. Supp. 2d 1078, 1084 (D. Kan. 2007)</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nSome anti-smoking advocates, such as William Godshall, have criticized the MSA as being too lenient on the major tobacco companies.  In a speech at the National Tobacco Control Conference, Godshall stated that \"[w]ith unprecedented future legal protection granted by the [[State Attorney General|state A.G.s]] in exchange for money, it appears that the tobacco industry has emerged from the state lawsuits even more powerful\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://tc.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/8/4/437 |title=Giving 10% to gain eternity |first=William T. |last=Godshall |journal=Tobacco Control |year=1999 |volume=8 |issue=4 |pages=437\u2013439 |accessdate=2015-02-28 |doi=10.1136/tc.8.4.437|pmid=10629252 |pmc=1759749 }}</ref>\n\nAn article in the Journal of the [[National Cancer Institute]] described the MSA as an \"opportunity lost to curb cigarette use\", citing public health researchers' views that not enough of the MSA money was being spent on anti-smoking measures.<ref>\nRenee Twombly, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 96, No. 10, 730\u2013732,\nMay 19, 2004 {{doi|10.1093/jnci/96.10.730}},\n[http://www.jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/jnci;96/10/730 jncicancerspectrum.oxfordjournals.org]</ref> Dr. Stephen A. Schroeder wrote in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]'' that \"Although U.S. smoking rates are slowly declining, progress toward that end [decreasing smoking] would be faster if federal policymaking matched both the rigor of the scientific evidence against tobacco use and the resolve of antitobacco advocates.\"<ref>Steven A.

Proponents of this argument claim that certain restrictions on pricing make it more difficult for small growers to compete with \"[[Big Tobacco]]\". Twelve states have successfully fought against this argument in court during the last two years<!--Vague as time passes--> and the enforcement of the MSA continues throughout the United States in perpetuity.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}\n\nFellows within the [[Cato Institute]], such as [[Robert A. Levy|Robert Levy]], assert that the lawsuit that brought on the tobacco settlement was instigated by a need to make beneficiary payments to [[Medicaid]] recipients.  Following the passage of laws that eliminated the tobacco companies' ability to provide evidence in court for their defense, the tobacco companies were forced to settle.  The big four tobacco companies agreed to pay the state governments several billion dollars but the government in turn was to protect the big four tobacco companies from competition.  The Master Settlement Agreement, they argue, created an unconstitutional cartel arrangement that benefited both the government and big tobacco.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa371.pdf | title=Constitutional and Antitrust Violations of the Multistate Tobacco Settlement | last=O\u2019Brien | first=Thomas | publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | date=2000-05-18 | accessdate=2018-07-19 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403075120/https://object.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/pa371.pdf | archive-date=2015-04-03 | url-status=live }}</ref><ref name=\"Reason_Olson\">{{cite magazine | url=http://reason.com/archives/2000/01/01/puff-the-magic-settlement/print | title=Puff, the Magic Settlement | last=Olson | first=Walter | magazine=[[Reason (magazine)|Reason]] | date=2000-01-01 | accessdate=2018-07-20 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120075258/http://reason.com/archives/2000/01/01/puff-the-magic-settlement/print | archive-date=2011-11-20 | url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nRobert Levy states:<blockquote>For 40 years, tobacco companies had not been held liable for cigarette-related illnesses. Then, beginning in 1994, led by Florida, states across the country sued big tobacco to recover public outlays for medical expenses due to smoking. By changing the law to guarantee they would win in court, the states extorted a quarter-trillion-dollar settlement, which was passed along in higher cigarette prices. Basically, the tobacco companies had money; the states and their hired-gun attorneys wanted money; so the companies paid and the states collected. Then sick smokers got stuck with the bill.<ref name=\"Levy_quote\">{{cite web | url=http://www.cato.org/speakers/levy.html | title=The Cato Institute Speakers Bureau | publisher=[[Cato Institute]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102014055/http://www.cato.org/speakers/levy.html | archive-date=2006-11-02 | url-status=dead }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe argument the Master Settlement Agreement created a cartel of the major U.S. cigarette makers, allowing them to charge \"[[Supracompetitive pricing|supracompetitive]]\" prices for their product, was rejected by the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] in 2007.<ref name=\"Sanders v.

They are a form of [[securitization]]. In many cases the bonds permit state and local governments to transfer the risk of declines in future master settlement agreement payments to bondholders.  In some cases, however, the bonds are backed by secondary pledges of state or local revenues, which creates what some see as a [[perverse incentive]] to support the tobacco industry, on whom they are now dependent for future payments against this debt.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://redtape.msnbc.com/2008/11/ten-years-later.html |title=redtape.msnbc.com |access-date=2008-11-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205164308/http://redtape.msnbc.com/2008/11/ten-years-later.html |archive-date=2008-12-05 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nTobacco revenue has fallen more quickly than projected when the securities were created, leading to technical defaults in some states. Some analysts predict that many of the bonds will default entirely.

While these MSAs are identical, the states have had to enact enabling legislation which differs from state to state.
