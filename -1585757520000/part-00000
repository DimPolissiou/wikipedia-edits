[[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] became a powerful Sultan. He captured Raiseen in 1532 and defeated Mewar in 1533. He helped Tatar Khan to capture [[Bayana]], which was under Mughal occupation. Humayun sent Hindal and Askari to fight Tatar Khan. At the battle of [[Mandrail]] in 1534, Tatar Khan was defeated and killed. [[Puranmal]], the Raja of [[Amber, India|Amber]], helped the Mughals in this battle. He was killed in this battle. Now it became necessary for Humayun to crush the rising power of Bahadur Shah. While Bahadur Shah was besieging the fort of Chittorgarh, Humayun started against him. Hearing the news, the [[Rani Karnavati]], widow of Rana Sanga, sent ''rakhi'' to Humayun. Humayun is considered to have accepted the ''rakhi'', but stopped at Sarang Pur in January 1535. Mewar was weakened due to constant struggles. After a long wait, the Rajputs had the last fight on 8 March 1535, and Rani Karnavati, together with other women, committed ''[[Jauhar]]''the same day. Humayun now pursued Bahadur Shah. Later Bahadur Shah and [[Sher Shah Suri]] created many problems for Humayun, and he lost the empire. He regained the empire in July 1555, and died in January 1556. Akbar, the son of Humayun, tried to persuade Mewar to accept Mughal sovereignty, like other Rajputs, but Rana Udai Singh refused. Ultimately Akbar besieged the fort of Chittor in 1567. This time, Rana Udai Singh left the fort with his family. Jaimal Rathore of Merta and Fatah Singh of Kelwa were left to take care of the fort. On 23 February 1568, Akbar hit Jaimal Rathore, who was looking after the repair work, with his gun. That same night, the Rajput women committed ''jauhar'' (ritual suicide) and the Rajput men, led by the wounded Jaimal and Fateh Singh, fought their last battle. Akbar entered the fort, and at least 30,000 people were killed. Later Akbar placed a statue of these two Rajput warriors on the gates of [[Agra Fort]].<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n\n===Akbar and Rajputs===\n{{See also|Maharana Pratap}}\n[[File:Rajputsword.jpg|thumb|Maharana Pratap was known to have wielded a [[Khanda (sword)|khanda]] sword.]]\nAkbar won the fort of Chittorgarh, but Rana Udai Singh was ruling Mewar from other places. On 3 March 1572 Udai Singh died, and his son, [[Maharana Pratap]], sat on the throne at [[Gogunda]]. He vowed that he would liberate Mewar from the Mughals; until then he would not sleep on a bed, would not live in a palace, and would not have food on a plate (''thali''). Akbar tried to arrange a treaty with Rana Pratap, but did not succeed. Finally, he sent an army under [[Raja Man Singh]] in 1576. Rana Pratap was defeated at the [[Battle of Haldighati]] in June 1576. Rana Pratap escaped from the battle and started guerrilla warfare with the Mughals. Ultimately he was successful in liberating most of the Mewar, except the fort of Chittorgarh. The Bargujars were the main allies of the Ranas of Mewar. Rana Pratap died on 19 January 1597, and Rana Amar Singh succeeded him. Akbar sent Salim to attack Mewar in October 1603, but he stopped at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] and sought permission from the emperor to go to [[Allahabad]], and went there. In 1605 Salim sat on the throne and took the name of [[Jahangir]].<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n\n====Jahangir and Rajputs====\nJahangir sent an army under his son Parviz to attack Mewar in 1606 which was defeated in the [[Battle of Dewar]]. The Mughal emperor sent [[Mahabat Khan]] in 1608. He was recalled in 1609, and Abdulla Khan was sent. Then Raja Basu was sent, and Mirza Ajij Koka was sent. No conclusive victory could be achieved. The disunity among various clans of Rajwada didn't allow Mewar to be completely liberated. Ultimately Jahangir himself arrived at [[Ajmer]] in 1613, and appointed Shazada Khurram to fight against Mewar. Khurram devastated the areas of Mewar and cut the supplies to the Rana. With the advice of his nobles and the crown prince, Karna, the Rana sent a peace delegation to Prince Khurram, Jahangir's son. Khurram sought approval of the treaty from his father at Ajmer. Jahangir issued an order authorising Khurram to agree to the treaty. The treaty was agreed between Rana Amar Singh and Prince Khurram in 1615.\n* The Rana of Mewar accepted Mughal suzereignty.\n* Mewar and the fort of Chittorgarh was returned to Rana.\n* The fort of Chittorgarh could not be repaired or renovated by Rana.\n* The Rana of Mewar would not attend the Mughal court personally. The crown prince of Mewar would attend the court and give himself and his army to the Mughals.\n* There would be no matrimonial alliance of Mewar with the Mughals.\n\nThis treaty, considered respectable for both parties, ended the 88-year-long enmity between Mewar and the Mughals.<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n\n====Aurangzeb and Rajput rebellion====\nThe Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] (1658\u20131707), who was far less tolerant of Hinduism than his predecessors, placed a Muslim on the throne of Marwar when the childless Maharaja Jaswant Singh died. This enraged the [[Rathore]]s, and when [[Ajit Singh of Marwar|Ajit Singh]], [[Jaswant Singh of Marwar|Jaswant Singh]]'s son, was born after his death, the Marwar nobles asked Aurangzeb to place Ajit on the throne. Aurangzeb refused, and tried to have Ajit assassinated. [[Durgadas Rathore]] and the ''dhaa maa'' ([[wet nurse]]) of Ajit, Goora Dhaa (the Sainik Kshatriya [[Gehlot]] Rajputs of [[Mandore]]), and others smuggled Ajit out of Delhi to [[Jaipur]], thus starting the thirty-year Rajput rebellion against Aurangzeb. This rebellion united the Rajput clans, and a triple-pronged alliance was formed by the states of [[Marwar]], [[Mewar]], and [[Jaipur]]. One of the conditions of this alliance was that the rulers of Jodhpur and Jaipur should regain the privilege of marriage with the ruling [[Sisodia]] dynasty of Mewar, on the understanding that the offspring of [[Sisodia]] princesses should succeed to the throne over any other offspring.\n[[Chhatrasal]] waged war against the [[Mughals]] and after leading a successful rebellion established his own kingdom which extende over most of the [[Bundelkhand]].<ref name=\"sen2\" />{{rp|187\u2013188}}\n\n\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=March 2017}}\n\n[[Category:Military history of India]]\n[[Category:Rajput history]]\n", "text_old": "{| class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; '''Rajput resistance to Muslim conquests''' \n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Rana kumbha Birla mandir edited.jpg|[[Rana Kumbha]]halo was the vanguard of the fifteenth century Rajput resurgence.

Mewar emerged as the leading Rajput state, and [[Rana Kumbha]] expanded his kingdom at the expense of the sultanates of Malwa and Gujarat.<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n<gallery widths=\"200\" heights=\"200\">\nWalls of Kumbhalgarh.jpg|Built during the course of the 15th century by [[Rana Kumbha]], the walls of the fort of [[Kumbhalgarh]] extend over 38 km, claimed to be the second-longest continuous wall after the [[Great Wall of China]].\nUdaipur City Palace.jpg|[[City Palace, Udaipur|City Palace]] was constructed by [[Maharana]] [[Udai Singh II]] after shifting his capital to [[Udaipur]] due to Muslim invasion.\nAmber Fort (\u0906\u092e\u0947\u0930 \u0915\u093e \u0915\u093f\u0932\u093e ).jpg|[[Amer Fort]] and [[Jaigarh Fort]] are connected by subterranean passages, and are known for their artistic [[Hindu]] Rajput style elements.\nJunagarth Fort, Bikaner.jpg|Entrance eastern fa\u00e7ade of the [[Junagarh Fort]].

As Rajputs were in search of a capable ally to help them against the [[Lodi Dynasty]], Mughals under Babur invaded Delhi and defeated Ibrahim Lodi at the [[First Battle of Panipat]] on 21 April 1526.

[[Bahadur Shah of Gujarat]] became a powerful Sultan. He captured Raiseen in 1532 and defeated Mewar in 1533. He helped Tatar Khan to capture [[Bayana]], which was under Mughal occupation. Humayun sent Hindal and Askari to fight Tatar Khan. At the battle of [[Mandrail]] in 1534, Tatar Khan was defeated and killed. [[Puranmal]], the Raja of [[Amber, India|Amber]], helped the Mughals in this battle. He was killed in this battle. Now it became necessary for Humayun to crush the rising power of Bahadur Shah. While Bahadur Shah was besieging the fort of Chittorgarh, Humayun started against him. Hearing the news, the [[Rani Karnavati]], widow of Rana Sanga, sent ''rakhi'' to Humayun. Humayun is considered to have accepted the ''rakhi'', but stopped at Sarang Pur in January 1535. Mewar was weakened due to constant struggles. After a long wait, the Rajputs had the last fight on 8 March 1535, and Rani Karnavati, together with other women, committed ''[[Jauhar]]''the same day. Humayun now pursued Bahadur Shah. Later Bahadur Shah and [[Sher Shah Suri]] created many problems for Humayun, and he lost the empire. He regained the empire in July 1555, and died in January 1556. Akbar, the son of Humayun, tried to persuade Mewar to accept Mughal sovereignty, like other Rajputs, but Rana Udai Singh refused. Ultimately Akbar besieged the fort of Chittor in 1567. This time, Rana Udai Singh left the fort with his family. Jaimal Rathore of Merta and Fatah Singh of Kelwa were left to take care of the fort. On 23 February 1568, Akbar hit Jaimal Rathore, who was looking after the repair work, with his gun. That same night, the Rajput women committed ''jauhar'' (ritual suicide) and the Rajput men, led by the wounded Jaimal and Fateh Singh, fought their last battle. Akbar entered the fort, and at least 30,000 people were killed. Later Akbar placed a statue of these two Rajput warriors on the gates of [[Agra Fort]].<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n\n===Akbar and Rajputs===\n{{See also|Maharana Pratap}}\n[[File:Rajputsword.jpg|thumb|Maharana Pratap was known to have wielded a [[Khanda (sword)|khanda]] sword.]]\nAkbar won the fort of Chittorgarh, but Rana Udai Singh was ruling Mewar from other places. On 3 March 1572 Udai Singh died, and his son, [[Maharana Pratap]], sat on the throne at [[Gogunda]]. He vowed that he would liberate Mewar from the Mughals; until then he would not sleep on a bed, would not live in a palace, and would not have food on a plate (''thali''). Akbar tried to arrange a treaty with Rana Pratap, but did not succeed. Finally, he sent an army under [[Raja Man Singh]] in 1576. Rana Pratap was defeated at the [[Battle of Haldighati]] in June 1576. Rana Pratap escaped from the battle and started guerrilla warfare with the Mughals. Ultimately he was successful in liberating most of the Mewar, except the fort of Chittorgarh. The Bargujars were the main allies of the Ranas of Mewar. Rana Pratap died on 19 January 1597, and Rana Amar Singh succeeded him. Akbar sent Salim to attack Mewar in October 1603, but he stopped at [[Fatehpur Sikri]] and sought permission from the emperor to go to [[Allahabad]], and went there. In 1605 Salim sat on the throne and took the name of [[Jahangir]].<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n\n====Jahangir and Rajputs====\nJahangir sent an army under his son Parviz to attack Mewar in 1606 which was defeated in the [[Battle of Dewar]]. The Mughal emperor sent [[Mahabat Khan]] in 1608. He was recalled in 1609, and Abdulla Khan was sent. Then Raja Basu was sent, and Mirza Ajij Koka was sent. No conclusive victory could be achieved. The disunity among various clans of Rajwada didn't allow Mewar to be completely liberated. Ultimately Jahangir himself arrived at [[Ajmer]] in 1613, and appointed Shazada Khurram to fight against Mewar. Khurram devastated the areas of Mewar and cut the supplies to the Rana. With the advice of his nobles and the crown prince, Karna, the Rana sent a peace delegation to Prince Khurram, Jahangir's son. Khurram sought approval of the treaty from his father at Ajmer. Jahangir issued an order authorising Khurram to agree to the treaty. The treaty was agreed between Rana Amar Singh and Prince Khurram in 1615.\n* The Rana of Mewar accepted Mughal suzereignty.\n* Mewar and the fort of Chittorgarh was returned to Rana.\n* The fort of Chittorgarh could not be repaired or renovated by Rana.\n* The Rana of Mewar would not attend the Mughal court personally. The crown prince of Mewar would attend the court and give himself and his army to the Mughals.\n* There would be no matrimonial alliance of Mewar with the Mughals.\n\nThis treaty, considered respectable for both parties, ended the 88-year-long enmity between Mewar and the Mughals.<ref name=\"Ap\" />\n\n====Aurangzeb and Rajput rebellion====\nThe Mughal emperor [[Aurangzeb]] (1658\u20131707), who was far less tolerant of Hinduism than his predecessors, placed a Muslim on the throne of Marwar when the childless Maharaja Jaswant Singh died. This enraged the [[Rathore]]s, and when [[Ajit Singh of Marwar|Ajit Singh]], [[Jaswant Singh of Marwar|Jaswant Singh]]'s son, was born after his death, the Marwar nobles asked Aurangzeb to place Ajit on the throne. Aurangzeb refused, and tried to have Ajit assassinated. [[Durgadas Rathore]] and the ''dhaa maa'' ([[wet nurse]]) of Ajit, Goora Dhaa (the Sainik Kshatriya [[Gehlot]] Rajputs of [[Mandore]]), and others smuggled Ajit out of Delhi to [[Jaipur]], thus starting the thirty-year Rajput rebellion against Aurangzeb. This rebellion united the Rajput clans, and a triple-pronged alliance was formed by the states of [[Marwar]], [[Mewar]], and [[Jaipur]]. One of the conditions of this alliance was that the rulers of Jodhpur and Jaipur should regain the privilege of marriage with the ruling [[Sisodia]] dynasty of Mewar, on the understanding that the offspring of [[Sisodia]] princesses should succeed to the throne over any other offspring.\n[[Chhatrasal]] waged war against the [[Mughals]] and after leading a successful rebellion established his own kingdom which extende over most of the [[Bundelkhand]].<ref name=\"sen2\" />{{rp|187\u2013188}}\n\n==James Tod==\n[[James Tod]], a British colonial official, was impressed by the military qualities of the Rajputs and their centuries-old struggle against invaders.

Under the ownership of [[James Johnstone (publisher)|James Johnstone]], ''The Standard'' became a morning paper from 29 June 1857. ''The Evening Standard'' was published from 11 June 1859. ''The Standard'' gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' Eleventh Edition; Cambridge University Press, 1911, Vol. XIX, Mun to Oddfellows; Article on Newspapers, pp.544\u2013581.</ref> By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.\n\nBoth ''The Standard'' and the ''Evening Standard'' were acquired by <!-- Not a baronet until 1916. -->[[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|C.

It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired. In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]]'', which sold over 1 million copies nightly. During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'', which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s. ''The Evening Standard'' ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 Nov 1974, when it still produced six editions daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://47shoelane.wordpress.com/galleries/terriboules|title=Where are they now, those Saturday People?|website=47shoelane|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, [[Express Newspapers]] merged the ''Standard'' with [[Associated Newspapers]]' ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' in a [[Joint Operating Agreement]].

Under the ownership of [[James Johnstone (publisher)|James Johnstone]], ''The Standard'' became a morning paper from 29 June 1857. ''The Evening Standard'' was published from 11 June 1859. ''The Standard'' gained eminence for its detailed foreign news, notably its reporting of events of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865), the [[Austro-Prussian War]] of 1866, and the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870, all contributing to a rise in circulation.<ref>''[[Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica]]'' Eleventh Edition; Cambridge University Press, 1911, Vol. XIX, Mun to Oddfellows; Article on Newspapers, pp.544\u2013581.</ref> By the end of the 19th century, the evening edition eclipsed its morning counterpart.\n\nBoth ''The Standard'' and the ''Evening Standard'' were acquired by <!-- Not a baronet until 1916. -->[[Sir Arthur Pearson, 1st Baronet|C.

It became a staunchly Conservative paper, harshly attacking Labour in 1945 in a high-profile campaign that backfired. In the 1960s, the paper was upstaged by ''[[The Evening News (London newspaper)|The Evening News]]'', which sold over 1 million copies nightly. During the decade, the paper also began to publish the comic strip ''[[Modesty Blaise]]'', which bolstered its sales throughout the 1970s. ''The Evening Standard'' ceased publishing on Saturdays on 30 Nov 1974, when it still produced six editions daily.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://47shoelane.wordpress.com/galleries/terriboules|title=Where are they now, those Saturday People?|website=47shoelane|date=1 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn 1980, [[Express Newspapers]] merged the ''Standard'' with [[Associated Newspapers]]' ''[[Evening News (London)|Evening News]]'' in a [[Joint Operating Agreement]]. The new paper was known as the ''New Standard'' until 1985, when Associated Newspapers bought out the remaining stake, turning it into ''The Standard''. In 1987 the ''Evening News'' was briefly revived to compete with Robert Maxwell's ''[[London Daily News]]'', but was reabsorbed into ''The Standard'' later that year, after the collapse of Maxwell's paper.

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

quarantine, closure of bars, social venues or schools, and social distancing. Two potential overall strategies outlined were: mitigation, in which the aim is to reduce the health impact of the epidemic but not to stop transmission completely; and suppression, where the aim is to reduce transmission rates to a point where case numbers fall. Until this point government actions had been based on a strategy of mitigation, but the modelling predicted that while this would reduce deaths by approximately 2/3, it would still lead to approximately 250,000 deaths from the disease and the health systems becoming overwhelmed.<ref name=\"Imperial16March2020\" /> On the same day as the report was released, the Prime Minister announced in a press conference significant changes to the government advice, extending self isolation to whole households, advising social distancing particularly for vulnerable groups, and indicating that further measures were likely to be required in the future.<ref name=avoid/><ref name=\"Independent200317\" /> A paper on 30 March by Imperial estimated that the lockdown would reduce the number of dead from 510,000 to less than 20,000.<ref>[https://www.imperial.ac.uk/media/imperial-college/medicine/sph/ide/gida-fellowships/Imperial-College-COVID19-Europe-estimates-and-NPI-impact-30-03-2020.pdf COVID19 Europe estimates and NPI impact] Neil Ferguson, Imperial College London</ref>\n\n==Response by sector==\n=== Government ===\n[[File:British Government NHS coronavirus public info poster.pdf|thumb|upright|English NHS coronavirus poster, February 2020<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.england.nhs.uk/london/2020/02/03/coronavirus-public-information-campaign-launched-across-the-uk/ |title=Coronavirus public information campaign launched across the UK |work=NHS England |date=3 February 2020 |accessdate=7 March 2020}}</ref>]]\nGuidance has altered in line with the number of cases detected and changes in where affected people have contracted the virus, as well as with what has been happening in other countries.<ref name=\"Bosley26Feb2020\"/> In February, [[Chief Medical Officer (United Kingdom)|Chief Medical Adviser]] to the UK Government, [[Chris Whitty]] explained \"we basically have a strategy which depends upon four tactical aims: the first one is to contain;

States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.\n\nAll states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401113644/https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.\n\nThere are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]].

They also point towards its inability to incorporate other cultures. This rigidity leads to bizarre results. An example of this would be the fact that both fascist Adolf Hitler and libertarian Milton Friedman are on the \u201cfar right,\u201d yet Hitler advocated nationalism, socialism, militarism, authoritarianism, and anti-Semitism, while Milton Friedman advocated internationalism, capitalism, pacifism, civil liberties, and was himself a Jew. Another critic of political spectrum is its tendency to promote tribalism by needlessly sorting people into different groups.\n\nThere are also many alternatives to political spectrum and political compass. The popular among these being the ideological triangle i.e a way of organizing political ideology using the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The location of a political ideology on the triangle is a function of its preference for the three values. As one moves closer to the bottom corner, the preference for liberty increases. As one moves closer to the upper left-hand corner, the preference for equality increases. And as one moves closer to the upper right-hand corner, the preference for fraternity increases and political horseshoe i.e the '''horseshoe''' theory asserts that the far-left and the far-right, rather than being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear '''political''' continuum, closely resemble one another, analogous to the way that the opposite ends of a '''horseshoe''' are close together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Index of law articles]]\n* [[Index of politics articles]] \u2013 alphabetical list of political subjects\n* [[List of politics awards]]\n* [[List of years in politics]]\n* [[Outline of law]]\n* [[Outline of political science]] \u2013 structured list of political topics, arranged by subject area\n* [[Political lists]] \u2013 lists of political topics\n* [[Politics of present-day states]]\n* [[List of political ideologies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|year=1981|last1=Connolly|first1=William|authorlink=William E.

States are perhaps the predominant institutional form of political governance, where a state is understood as an institution and a government is understood as the [[regime]] in power.\n\nAccording to Aristotle, states are classified into [[monarchies]], [[aristocracy|aristocracies]], [[Timocracy|timocracies]], [[democracies]], [[oligarchies]], and [[tyrannies]]. Due to changes across the history of politics, this classification has been abandoned.\n\nAll states are varieties of a single organizational form, the sovereign state. All the [[great powers]] of the modern world rule on the principle of [[sovereignty]]. Sovereign power may be vested on an individual as in an [[autocracy|autocratic government]] or it may be vested on a group as in a constitutional government. [[Constitutions]] are written documents that specify and limit the powers of the different branches of government. Although a constitution is a written document, there is also an unwritten constitution. The unwritten constitution is continually being written by the legislative and judiciary branch of government; this is just one of those cases in which the nature of the circumstances determines the form of government that is most appropriate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|title=Britain's unwritten constitution|website=The British Library|access-date=2019-02-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401113644/https://www.bl.uk/magna-carta/articles/britains-unwritten-constitution|archive-date=1 April 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> England did set the fashion of written constitutions during the [[English Civil War|Civil War]] but after the [[Restoration (England)|Restoration]] abandoned them to be taken up later by the [[American Colonies]] after their [[American Revolution|emancipation]] and then [[France]] after the [[French Revolution|Revolution]] and the rest of Europe including the European colonies.\n\nThere are many forms of government. One form is a strong central government as in France and China. Another form is local government, such as the ancient divisions in England that are comparatively weaker but less bureaucratic. These two forms helped to shape the practice of [[federal government]], first in Switzerland, then in the United States in 1776, in Canada in 1867 and in Germany in 1871 and in 1901, [[Australia]].

This includes the importance of human rationality, individual [[property rights]], [[free market]]s, [[natural rights]], the protection of [[civil liberties]], constitutional limitation of government, and individual freedom from restraint as exemplified in the writings of [[John Locke]], [[Adam Smith]], [[David Hume]], [[David Ricardo]], [[Voltaire]], [[Montesquieu]] and others. According to the libertarian [[Institute for Humane Studies]], \"the libertarian, or 'classical liberal,' perspective is that individual well-being, prosperity, and social harmony are fostered by 'as much liberty as possible' and 'as little government as necessary.'\"<ref>[http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp What Is Libertarian?], Institute for Humane Studies {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070324231417/http://www.theihs.org/about/id.1084/default.asp|date=24 March 2007}}</ref> For anarchist political philosopher [[L.

Anarchism shares with liberalism a radical commitment to individual freedom while rejecting liberalism's competitive property relations.\"<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[L. Susan Brown]].

Black Rose Books Ltd. 1993</ref>\n\n=== Critiques of political spectrum ===\nThe critics of political spectrum criticize the uni dimensional and bi-dimensional nature of it. They also point towards its inability to incorporate other cultures. This rigidity leads to bizarre results. An example of this would be the fact that both fascist Adolf Hitler and libertarian Milton Friedman are on the \u201cfar right,\u201d yet Hitler advocated nationalism, socialism, militarism, authoritarianism, and anti-Semitism, while Milton Friedman advocated internationalism, capitalism, pacifism, civil liberties, and was himself a Jew. Another critic of political spectrum is its tendency to promote tribalism by needlessly sorting people into different groups.\n\nThere are also many alternatives to political spectrum and political compass. The popular among these being the ideological triangle i.e a way of organizing political ideology using the values of liberty, equality, and fraternity. The location of a political ideology on the triangle is a function of its preference for the three values. As one moves closer to the bottom corner, the preference for liberty increases. As one moves closer to the upper left-hand corner, the preference for equality increases. And as one moves closer to the upper right-hand corner, the preference for fraternity increases and political horseshoe i.e the '''horseshoe''' theory asserts that the far-left and the far-right, rather than being at opposite and opposing ends of a linear '''political''' continuum, closely resemble one another, analogous to the way that the opposite ends of a '''horseshoe''' are close together.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Politics}}\n{{Wikipedia books}}\n* [[Index of law articles]]\n* [[Index of politics articles]] \u2013 alphabetical list of political subjects\n* [[List of politics awards]]\n* [[List of years in politics]]\n* [[Outline of law]]\n* [[Outline of political science]] \u2013 structured list of political topics, arranged by subject area\n* [[Political lists]] \u2013 lists of political topics\n* [[Politics of present-day states]]\n* [[List of political ideologies]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|year=1981|last1=Connolly|first1=William|authorlink=William E.

In this case, a warm front could be approaching and rain is possible for the next 12 to 24 hours.\n\nWhen cumulus humilis appear in a clear sky, they are an indicator of pleasant weather for the next several hours.\n\n==Formation==\nCumulus humilis clouds are formed by rising warm air or [[thermal]]s with ascending [[air current]]s of 2\u20135&nbsp;m/s (7\u201317&nbsp;ft/s).<ref name=\"World Meteorological Organization: Cumulus humilis\">{{Cite web | url=https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/cumulus-humilis.html | title=Cumulus humilis | accessdate=2018-06-03}}</ref> These clouds are usually very small convective clouds and usually form after a thermal reaches the [[Lifted condensation level|condensation level]]. They can develop into cumulus mediocris clouds but most often dissipate a few minutes after formation.<ref name=\"Weatherscapes: Cumulus humilis\">{{Cite web | url=http://www.weatherscapes.com/album.php?cat=clouds&subcat=cu_humilis | title=Cumulus humilis | accessdate=2014-11-04}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Cumulus mediocris]]\n* [[Atmospheric convection]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070624065601/http://chitambo.com/clouds/cloudshtml/humilis.html Cumulus humilis]\n\n{{Cloud types}}\n\n[[Category:Cumulus]]\n", "name_user": "Mr Harry Masters", "label": "safe", "comment": "I added something", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cumulus_humilis_cloud"}
